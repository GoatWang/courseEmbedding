Nelson Peltz On Procter & Gamble: Sign Of The Future For ROIC Laggards - The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Nelson Peltz On Procter & Gamble: Sign Of The Future For ROIC LaggardsJul.27.17 | About: The Procter (PG) David Trainer Long/short equity, value, research analyst, Deep ValueMarketplaceNew Constructs Value Investing 2.0 SummaryNelson Peltz’s Trian Fund Management is seeking a board seat at Procter & Gamble.Activist investors have a mixed track record when it comes to creating shareholder value, but Peltz appears to have found an ideal situation.Any reform of the company’s corporate structure should include a renewed focus on return on invested capital (ROIC).One of the largest activist investors in the world is taking on his biggest target yet. Nelson Peltz’s Trian Fund Management is seeking a board seat at Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG). Now, the Consumer Staples giant is the largest company ever to face a proxy fight, signaling that size alone is no longer enough to keep activists away from poorly run companies. Activist investors have a mixed track record when it comes to creating shareholder value, but Peltz appears to have found an ideal situation. P&G has lagged its competitors in recent years, Peltz has experience revitalizing consumer brands, and the stock trades at a discount to its peers. Peltz has not yet released a detailed plan for P&G, but any reform of the company’s corporate structure should include a renewed focus on return on invested capital (ROIC). ROIC ranks as the most important metric for global investors and has demonstrable links to valuation. Linking executive compensation to ROIC could create immediate shareholder returns and drive a long-term commitment to the lean and disciplined corporate structure that Peltz wants P&G to adopt. This strategy should become part of the playbook for companies looking to avoid activist takeovers. Procter & Gamble’s Underperformance The best way to understand the recent failures of P&G’s management team is to compare the company to one of its largest competitors, the excellently run Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL). Figure 1 shows the ROIC earned by the two companies since 1998: Figure 1: Colgate-Palmolive’s ROIC Strongly Outperforms P&G 


 Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings. Through the late 1990s and early 2000s, the two companies earned similar ROICs, but that all changed with PG’s $54 billion acquisition of Gillette in 2005. The acquisition was a big blow to P&G’s ROIC from which the company has never recovered. Since the acquisition, PG stock is up just 48% vs. 178% for CL and 142% for the Consumer Staples SPDR ETF (NYSEARCA:XLP). It’s surprising that the Gillette deal doesn’t find its way on to more lists of the worst corporate acquisitions. Need To Focus On ROIC The Gillette acquisition represents a classic case of executive incentives misaligned with shareholder interests. Buying Gillette helped P&G grow revenue and earnings per share significantly, which led to significant increases in bonuses for top executives, even as ROIC and shareholder return lagged peers. These misaligned incentives also helped to create the “overly complex and bureaucratized corporate structure” that Peltz criticized. Excessive focus on sales growth and earnings per share pushes managers to invest in low return opportunities. As a result, you end up with a bloated organization that can’t maintain leadership in its value-creating products because it’s bogged down by bureaucracy and distracted by failed projects. As Trian’s proxy statement points out, P&G’s volume growth has trailed its peers in four out of the past five years, which would indicate the company’s key brands are losing market share. The company states as much in its most recent 10-K by admitting it has lost market share in its Beauty, Grooming, Personal Health, Fabric & Home Care, Baby, Feminine, & Family Care segments over the past two years. This declining market share points to a real systematic issue facing P&G. Its ROIC underperformance may have started with the Gillette acquisition, but that doesn’t tell the whole story. Even if we totally wiped that $54 billion in invested capital off the books, PG would still have an ROIC of ~18%, behind CL’s 19%. Notably, CL began tying executive compensation to ROIC in 2014.
 P&G should follow in CL’s footsteps. Tying executive compensation to ROIC would not only prevent a repeat of the Gillette acquisition, it would also lay the groundwork for a more disciplined and efficient corporate structure. This change in executive compensation wouldn’t just be good for shareholders, it would be in the best interests of management. General Motors (NYSE:GM) successfully held off an activist campaign in 2015 partly through a renewed emphasis on ROIC. If P&G is determined to keep Peltz off the board, a similar shift could help to placate shareholders. Peltz’s Track Record Peltz and Trian have a solid history of helping struggling consumer brands turn their fortunes around. In the late '90s, Trian took over Snapple (NYSE:DPS), a company that had lost 80% of its value in three years, and in another three years managed to restore a good portion of that lost value. Trian helped push Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) to a similarly lucrative buyout and more recently it waged a large campaign against PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP). Although Peltz failed to convince the company to split up, his initiatives did spur an increase in ROIC from 9% to 11% even as rival Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) saw its ROIC decline. Most importantly from our perspective, PEP began tying executive compensation to ROIC shortly after Peltz took his position in the stock. We don’t know if Peltz was responsible for this decision, but the fact that Trian’s white paper on the company highlighted its poor ROIC suggests he might have had a hand in it. Either way, Peltz’s track record shows that he has the expertise in brand management, cost discipline, and capital allocation required to help PG end its recent run of underperformance. Value Opportunity Unsurprisingly, given P&G’s underperformance, the stock trades at a discount to its peers. Figure 2 shows ROIC and enterprise value/invested capital (a cleaner version of price to book) for PG and 12 of its peers.[1] Figure 2: ROIC Vs. Enterprise Value For Household Products Companies
 

 Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings. According to the equation in Figure 2, ROIC explains over 95% of the differences in valuation for these household products stocks and PG trades at a roughly 15% discount to its implied EV/IC. Even if Peltz can’t bring any operational improvements, just convincing the market to value P&G at a level commensurate with its ROIC would create upside. If, on the other hand, Peltz can deliver tangible gains in sales and profitability, P&G could offer significant returns to investors. For example, Figure 3 shows the “% Upside” to P&G stock for a few relatively conservative scenarios. Column 2 shows 42% upside if P&G can grow revenue 4% for the next five years. Column 3 shows 60% upside if P&G’s cost cutting initiatives also succeed in increasing the company’s pretax margin from 22.5% to 25%. Figure 3: Implied Valuation Scenarios 

 Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings.   To drive this valuation gain, Trian and P&G will need to convince the market of the sustainability of its ROIC. The way to convince the market of one’s commitment to ROIC is the same as we’ve suggested many times:  Link it to compensation Build into all capital allocation processes Show 100% support from the CEO  This article originally published on July 25, 2017.

Tide detergent dominated the American laundry room for decades and helped make Procter & Gamble a consumer products behemoth.But consumers have increasingly been shunning premium-priced brands like Tide for cheaper versions of laundry detergent. And the detergent market is just one of many in which Procter & Gamble is battling to keep bargain-hunting customers.Across a number of its mission-critical, multibillion-dollar product lines — from Pampers diapers to Olay skin creams to Gillette razors — Procter & Gamble is fighting to retain its market share.Those struggles have now attracted the attention of Nelson Peltz, a billionaire investor and activist shareholder.

Arguing in a regulatory filing that the company was in need of a shake-up, Mr. Peltz announced on Monday that he was seeking a seat on the board of Procter & Gamble. His investment firm, Trian Fund Management, disclosed a $3.5 billion stake in February. Continue reading the main story

The filing signals a ratcheting-up in the size of the corporate targets of activist investors, who through behind-the-scenes cajoling or sometimes high-profile public proxy wars try to force companies to change their strategies with an eye toward profits for themselves.Activist investing has attracted larger and larger pools of money, allowing managers like Mr. Peltz to hunt for ever-bigger corporate game. A proxy fight at Procter & Gamble, which has a market value of nearly $225 billion, would be among the biggest in corporate history.And Procter & Gamble, based in Cincinnati, is merely the latest consumer-driven company to capture the attention of activist investors.Last month, Daniel S. Loeb’s hedge fund, Third Point, said he would agitate for changes at Nestlé, and Jana Partners had earlier pressured the retailer Whole Foods to revamp its board. Whole Foods ultimately announced that it would sell itself to Amazon.This is not the first time that Procter & Gamble has faced activist pressure: The billionaire William A. Ackman pushed the board to oust Robert A. McDonald as chief executive in 2013, prompting Mr. McDonald’s predecessor, Alan G. Lafley, to return to the post from retirement.

Companies with mature consumer brands — like Procter & Gamble, with its Tide detergent and Gillette razors — can be ripe targets for activists because their days of surging growth are often well behind them.While companies may want to keep the brands, enjoying the cash they can generate, activist investors tend to be more aggressive in their approach. They often look for ways to sell the brands and reinvest in new technologies or brands that can generate better growth opportunities, said Damien Park, a managing director at Spotlight Advisors, a firm that consults with companies and funds on activist campaigns. (Mr. Park is not involved in Mr. Peltz’s crusade with Procter & Gamble.)

That Procter & Gamble has become the quarry for activist investors is a sign of how far the once-iconic giant has fallen.For years, Procter & Gamble attracted the best-and-brightest marketing M.B.A.s from the nation’s top schools. It spurred many a Harvard Business School study of its internal methodologies and disruptive innovations. And it was the home to many big consumer hits, like the Swiffer duster and Crest Whitestrips.But thanks in no small part to lackluster economic growth overseas, combined with a strong dollar, Procter & Gamble has had 13 consecutive quarters of sales declines. Its shares have lagged behind the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index.The company is on its third chief executive, David Taylor, in eight years. It is slashing billions of dollars in costs and shrinking its work force.

To meet the challenges, Procter & Gamble has moved quickly to reduce its portfolio of brands, selling about 40 beauty brands, including CoverGirl makeup and Clairol Nice ’n Easy hair coloring, to Coty last year.But analysts say what has gone missing from Procter & Gamble is innovation, new products or designs that will spur top-line growth.“Olay hasn’t grown in years,” said Mark Astrachan, an analyst with Stifel Financial. “Pantene has been relaunched I don’t know how many times at this point. On shaving, it was not focused on the fact the market was moving online and to products offered at a lower price point. It didn’t launch a shaving club until it had lost considerable market share.”And while the company is beginning to lower the prices of its goods to compete with less expensive products, the prices of its brands are, on average, 40 percent higher than the average price in the category, said Ali Dibadj, an analyst at Bernstein Research. Tide is twice the average price in the laundry detergent arena, Mr. Dibadj said.









 



For now, Mr. Peltz has emphasized cutting costs and trimming the layers of management bureaucracy at Procter & Gamble, but not much else.

Since taking its stake in Procter & Gamble in February, Trian had held about a half-dozen meetings with the company, outlining its arguments, according to two people briefed on the matter. The company made its own counterarguments, including asking for more time to prove the worth of its current strategy.Those discussions reached a head last week when Procter & Gamble formally declined to give Mr. Peltz a seat.In a statement on Monday, the company said it had had “an active and constructive dialogue” with Trian. It also said that its board was “confident that the changes being made are producing results” and that it “expresses complete support for the company’s strategy, plans and management.”Trian said Monday that it was not seeking to break up Procter & Gamble — a well-worn tactic of activists — or seeking to replace David S. Taylor, who has been the company’s chief executive for less than two years. If Mr. Peltz is elected, Trian said, the firm will renominate the director who had been defeated, effectively expanding Procter & Gamble’s board by one seat.For the most part, Trian has tended to apply pressure behind the scenes with corporate management, a self-described “constructivist” tact. Mr. Peltz meets regularly with management teams and board members, often discussing lengthy analyses that the firm has put together. (The firm’s “white paper” on General Electric ran to about 80 pages.)Since setting up Trian in 2005, Mr. Peltz and his partners, Peter W. May and Edward P. Garden, had resorted to proxy fights just twice before Procter & Gamble. That is out of 23 campaigns at 20 companies, according to data from FactSet.Trian’s win rate in its proxy fights is 50 percent. In the battle against the ketchup maker Heinz for board seats, Trian won two of the five seats it sought. But with the chemical maker DuPont, shareholders rejected Trian outright and re-elected all of the sitting directors, although the company’s chief executive, Ellen J. Kullman, retired five months later, after the company fell short on financial performance targets.People with knowledge of Trian’s interactions with Procter & Gamble stressed that the discussions had been cordial, with the two sides agreeing on a number of issues.While Mr. Peltz has not signaled any interest in breaking up Procter & Gamble, some analysts say that could still be the ultimate outcome.

“For almost a decade, they have been talking about improvement, and for all of their efforts and advantages, I haven’t seen it play out at all,” said Mr. Dibadj, the Bernstein analyst, who has advocated a breakup of the company. “This is an organization that is simply too big and too complex.”

 Correction: July 19, 2017  
An article on Tuesday about efforts by the investor Nelson Peltz to gain a seat on the board of Procter & Gamble misstated the name of the company that bought beauty brands from Procter & Gamble last year. It is Coty, not Cody.

Early life and education[edit]
Peltz was born to a Jewish family in 1942 in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Claire (née Wechsler) and Maurice Herbert Peltz.[9][10][11] Peltz was enrolled at the undergraduate program at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, where he joined the Fraternity of Phi Gamma Delta,[12] but never completed his degree.[9]
In 1963, he dropped out of the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School with the intention of becoming a ski instructor in Oregon.[13] However, he ended up driving a delivery truck for A. Peltz & Sons, a wholesale food distribution business founded by his grandfather Adolph in 1896, which delivered fresh produce and frozen food (Snow Top)[14] to restaurants in New York.[6][9]
His father gave him free rein with the company, and over the next 15 years he and his older brother, Robert B. Peltz, grew the business gradually shifting the product line from produce to institutional frozen foods.[15] Over the next 10 years, Peltz bought up several food companies, and in 1972, he and his brother took their company, then called Flagstaff Corp., with $150 million in sales, public.[9][13] In 1982 his brother Robert bought back the assets of Peltz Food from Flagstaff after it went bankrupt.[15]
Investment career[edit]
In the 1980s, Peltz and his business partner, Peter May, who had joined Flagstaff as chief financial officer after having been its accountant, went looking for new acquisitions. In April 1983, the two bought a stake in vending-machine and wire company Triangle Industries Inc. with the idea of using it to make acquisitions, building it into a Fortune 100 industrial company.[16] Triangle was sold to Pechiney in 1988.[17]
In 1997, through an investment vehicle they controlled, Triarc Cos,[18] Peltz and May acquired Snapple, from Quaker Oats. Snapple, together with other beverage brands was sold to Cadbury Schweppes in 2000. The Snapple turnaround was featured as a Harvard Business School case study.[18]
In 2005, Peltz, May, and Ed Garden, founded Trian Fund Management, L.P. As an activist investing firm, Trian has invested in such companies as Heinz,[19] Cadbury, Kraft Foods,[20] Ingersoll Rand,[21] Wendy’s,[22] DuPont,[23] Mondelēz,[3] PepsiCo,[24] State Street Corporation [25] and Family Dollar.[26]
In 2006, Trian was involved in a proxy contest with Heinz to get five independent directors on the board of Heinz. Trian succeeded in getting two members on the board, including Peltz.[27]
In 2007, Trian bought a 3% share of Cadbury-Schweppes. Cadbury Schweppes Americas Beverages was later spun off from the Cadbury Schweppes confectionery group. In 2007, Trian also bought $1.8 billion in shares of Kraft Foods, roughly a 3% of the total equity of the food maker.[28]
In April 2008, it was announced that Triarc Cos. would merge with burger chain Wendy's.[29] The merger was completed on September 29, 2008.[30] The new company was named Wendy's Arby's Group and traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol WEN. On July 25, 2011, Wendy's Arby's sold Arby's to Roark Capital Group and changed its name to The Wendy's Company.[31] According to CNBC, on February 15, 2011, Trian offered to buy Family Dollar for $55–60 per share.
In February 2011, Trian announced it had accumulated an 8% stake in the Family Dollar company and indicated a willingness to participate in a take private LBO for the company with a total value of about $7 to $8 billion. This overture was rejected by the company management and board of directors.[32] In September 2011, Ed Garden, Trian’s Chief Investment Officer, joined the Family Dollar board.[33]
Peltz was appointed to the Ingersoll-Rand board of directors in 2012.[34]
In August 2013, it was reported that Trian held an approximate $1.25 billion stake in DuPont.[23]
In January 2014, as one of the company’s largest shareholders, with a current beneficial ownership of more than 46 million shares, Peltz was appointed to the board of directors of global snacking company, Mondelēz International (NASDAQ: MDLZ).[35][36]
In February 2014, as a beneficial owner of approximately $1.2 billion of PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE: PEP) common shares, Trian publicly released a letter to PepsiCo’s board of directors and a white paper detailing why separating global snacks and beverages into two independent public companies would be the right long-term decision for the business and would create substantial value for shareholders.[37] Trian said it would immediately begin to engage fellow shareholders in a public dialogue with the goal of creating a groundswell of support for a separation of snacks and beverages.[38]
In February 2014, Forbes listed Peltz as one of the 25 highest-earning hedge fund managers in 2013, with total earnings of $430 million, ranked 16th.[39]
In May 2015, Trian was unsuccessful in a bitter proxy contest to appoint four of its nominees to the board of DuPont.[40] Five months later the CEO of DuPont, Ellen Kullman, resigned; at the time DuPont acknowledged lower than expected earnings and the need to accelerate a cost-cutting plan.[41]
In October 2015, Trian bought a $2.5 billion stake in General Electric.[42]
Personal life[edit]




Peltz's children, Will and Nicola, at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival


Peltz has been married three times. His third wife is Claudia Heffner, a former fashion model, with whom he has eight children. He has two children from his prior marriages.[43] Among Peltz's children are actors Nicola Peltz[44] and Will Peltz.[45] His son Brad Peltz was a professional ice hockey player who played in the ECHL during the 2012–13 ECHL season.[46]

Early life and education[edit]
Peltz was born to a Jewish family in 1942 in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Claire (née Wechsler) and Maurice Herbert Peltz.[9][10][11] Peltz was enrolled at the undergraduate program at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, where he joined the Fraternity of Phi Gamma Delta,[12] but never completed his degree.[9]
In 1963, he dropped out of the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School with the intention of becoming a ski instructor in Oregon.[13] However, he ended up driving a delivery truck for A. Peltz & Sons, a wholesale food distribution business founded by his grandfather Adolph in 1896, which delivered fresh produce and frozen food (Snow Top)[14] to restaurants in New York.[6][9]
His father gave him free rein with the company, and over the next 15 years he and his older brother, Robert B. Peltz, grew the business gradually shifting the product line from produce to institutional frozen foods.[15] Over the next 10 years, Peltz bought up several food companies, and in 1972, he and his brother took their company, then called Flagstaff Corp., with $150 million in sales, public.[9][13] In 1982 his brother Robert bought back the assets of Peltz Food from Flagstaff after it went bankrupt.[15]
Investment career[edit]
In the 1980s, Peltz and his business partner, Peter May, who had joined Flagstaff as chief financial officer after having been its accountant, went looking for new acquisitions. In April 1983, the two bought a stake in vending-machine and wire company Triangle Industries Inc. with the idea of using it to make acquisitions, building it into a Fortune 100 industrial company.[16] Triangle was sold to Pechiney in 1988.[17]
In 1997, through an investment vehicle they controlled, Triarc Cos,[18] Peltz and May acquired Snapple, from Quaker Oats. Snapple, together with other beverage brands was sold to Cadbury Schweppes in 2000. The Snapple turnaround was featured as a Harvard Business School case study.[18]
In 2005, Peltz, May, and Ed Garden, founded Trian Fund Management, L.P. As an activist investing firm, Trian has invested in such companies as Heinz,[19] Cadbury, Kraft Foods,[20] Ingersoll Rand,[21] Wendy’s,[22] DuPont,[23] Mondelēz,[3] PepsiCo,[24] State Street Corporation [25] and Family Dollar.[26]
In 2006, Trian was involved in a proxy contest with Heinz to get five independent directors on the board of Heinz. Trian succeeded in getting two members on the board, including Peltz.[27]
In 2007, Trian bought a 3% share of Cadbury-Schweppes. Cadbury Schweppes Americas Beverages was later spun off from the Cadbury Schweppes confectionery group. In 2007, Trian also bought $1.8 billion in shares of Kraft Foods, roughly a 3% of the total equity of the food maker.[28]
In April 2008, it was announced that Triarc Cos. would merge with burger chain Wendy's.[29] The merger was completed on September 29, 2008.[30] The new company was named Wendy's Arby's Group and traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol WEN. On July 25, 2011, Wendy's Arby's sold Arby's to Roark Capital Group and changed its name to The Wendy's Company.[31] According to CNBC, on February 15, 2011, Trian offered to buy Family Dollar for $55–60 per share.
In February 2011, Trian announced it had accumulated an 8% stake in the Family Dollar company and indicated a willingness to participate in a take private LBO for the company with a total value of about $7 to $8 billion. This overture was rejected by the company management and board of directors.[32] In September 2011, Ed Garden, Trian’s Chief Investment Officer, joined the Family Dollar board.[33]
Peltz was appointed to the Ingersoll-Rand board of directors in 2012.[34]
In August 2013, it was reported that Trian held an approximate $1.25 billion stake in DuPont.[23]
In January 2014, as one of the company’s largest shareholders, with a current beneficial ownership of more than 46 million shares, Peltz was appointed to the board of directors of global snacking company, Mondelēz International (NASDAQ: MDLZ).[35][36]
In February 2014, as a beneficial owner of approximately $1.2 billion of PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE: PEP) common shares, Trian publicly released a letter to PepsiCo’s board of directors and a white paper detailing why separating global snacks and beverages into two independent public companies would be the right long-term decision for the business and would create substantial value for shareholders.[37] Trian said it would immediately begin to engage fellow shareholders in a public dialogue with the goal of creating a groundswell of support for a separation of snacks and beverages.[38]
In February 2014, Forbes listed Peltz as one of the 25 highest-earning hedge fund managers in 2013, with total earnings of $430 million, ranked 16th.[39]
In May 2015, Trian was unsuccessful in a bitter proxy contest to appoint four of its nominees to the board of DuPont.[40] Five months later the CEO of DuPont, Ellen Kullman, resigned; at the time DuPont acknowledged lower than expected earnings and the need to accelerate a cost-cutting plan.[41]
In October 2015, Trian bought a $2.5 billion stake in General Electric.[42]
Personal life[edit]

Peltz has been married three times. His third wife is Claudia Heffner, a former fashion model, with whom he has eight children. He has two children from his prior marriages.[43] Among Peltz's children are actors Nicola Peltz[44] and Will Peltz.[45] His son Brad Peltz was a professional ice hockey player who played in the ECHL during the 2012–13 ECHL season.[46]
Peltz resides in Bedford, New York.[2] He also owns Montsorrel, which is his house in Palm Beach, Florida[1] previously owned by Anita Young, the sister of Georgia O'Keeffe. He has recently begun a refurbishment and expansion project for the property.[47]
Wealth and philanthropy[edit]

In 2005, Peltz was among 53 entities that contributed the maximum of $250,000 to the second inauguration of President George W. Bush.[49][50][51] He is also a heavy contributor to Jewish causes.[52]

Peltz & Sons, a wholesale food distribution business founded by his grandfather Adolph in 1896, which delivered fresh produce and frozen food (Snow Top)[14] to restaurants in New York.[6][9]
His father gave him free rein with the company, and over the next 15 years he and his older brother, Robert B. Peltz, grew the business gradually shifting the product line from produce to institutional frozen foods.[15] Over the next 10 years, Peltz bought up several food companies, and in 1972, he and his brother took their company, then called Flagstaff Corp., with $150 million in sales, public.[9][13] In 1982 his brother Robert bought back the assets of Peltz Food from Flagstaff after it went bankrupt.[15]
Investment career[edit]
In the 1980s, Peltz and his business partner, Peter May, who had joined Flagstaff as chief financial officer after having been its accountant, went looking for new acquisitions. In April 1983, the two bought a stake in vending-machine and wire company Triangle Industries Inc. with the idea of using it to make acquisitions, building it into a Fortune 100 industrial company.[16] Triangle was sold to Pechiney in 1988.[17]
In 1997, through an investment vehicle they controlled, Triarc Cos,[18] Peltz and May acquired Snapple, from Quaker Oats. Snapple, together with other beverage brands was sold to Cadbury Schweppes in 2000. The Snapple turnaround was featured as a Harvard Business School case study.[18]
In 2005, Peltz, May, and Ed Garden, founded Trian Fund Management, L.P. As an activist investing firm, Trian has invested in such companies as Heinz,[19] Cadbury, Kraft Foods,[20] Ingersoll Rand,[21] Wendy’s,[22] DuPont,[23] Mondelēz,[3] PepsiCo,[24] State Street Corporation [25] and Family Dollar.[26]
In 2006, Trian was involved in a proxy contest with Heinz to get five independent directors on the board of Heinz. Trian succeeded in getting two members on the board, including Peltz.[27]
In 2007, Trian bought a 3% share of Cadbury-Schweppes. Cadbury Schweppes Americas Beverages was later spun off from the Cadbury Schweppes confectionery group. In 2007, Trian also bought $1.8 billion in shares of Kraft Foods, roughly a 3% of the total equity of the food maker.[28]
In April 2008, it was announced that Triarc Cos. would merge with burger chain Wendy's.[29] The merger was completed on September 29, 2008.[30] The new company was named Wendy's Arby's Group and traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol WEN. On July 25, 2011, Wendy's Arby's sold Arby's to Roark Capital Group and changed its name to The Wendy's Company.[31] According to CNBC, on February 15, 2011, Trian offered to buy Family Dollar for $55–60 per share.
In February 2011, Trian announced it had accumulated an 8% stake in the Family Dollar company and indicated a willingness to participate in a take private LBO for the company with a total value of about $7 to $8 billion. This overture was rejected by the company management and board of directors.[32] In September 2011, Ed Garden, Trian’s Chief Investment Officer, joined the Family Dollar board.[33]
Peltz was appointed to the Ingersoll-Rand board of directors in 2012.[34]
In August 2013, it was reported that Trian held an approximate $1.25 billion stake in DuPont.[23]
In January 2014, as one of the company’s largest shareholders, with a current beneficial ownership of more than 46 million shares, Peltz was appointed to the board of directors of global snacking company, Mondelēz International (NASDAQ: MDLZ).[35][36]
In February 2014, as a beneficial owner of approximately $1.2 billion of PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE: PEP) common shares, Trian publicly released a letter to PepsiCo’s board of directors and a white paper detailing why separating global snacks and beverages into two independent public companies would be the right long-term decision for the business and would create substantial value for shareholders.[37] Trian said it would immediately begin to engage fellow shareholders in a public dialogue with the goal of creating a groundswell of support for a separation of snacks and beverages.[38]
In February 2014, Forbes listed Peltz as one of the 25 highest-earning hedge fund managers in 2013, with total earnings of $430 million, ranked 16th.[39]
In May 2015, Trian was unsuccessful in a bitter proxy contest to appoint four of its nominees to the board of DuPont.[40] Five months later the CEO of DuPont, Ellen Kullman, resigned; at the time DuPont acknowledged lower than expected earnings and the need to accelerate a cost-cutting plan.[41]
In October 2015, Trian bought a $2.5 billion stake in General Electric.[42]

Early life and education[edit]
Peltz was born to a Jewish family in 1942 in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Claire (née Wechsler) and Maurice Herbert Peltz.[9][10][11] Peltz was enrolled at the undergraduate program at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, where he joined the Fraternity of Phi Gamma Delta,[12] but never completed his degree.[9]
In 1963, he dropped out of the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School with the intention of becoming a ski instructor in Oregon.[13] However, he ended up driving a delivery truck for A. Peltz & Sons, a wholesale food distribution business founded by his grandfather Adolph in 1896, which delivered fresh produce and frozen food (Snow Top)[14] to restaurants in New York.[6][9]
His father gave him free rein with the company, and over the next 15 years he and his older brother, Robert B. Peltz, grew the business gradually shifting the product line from produce to institutional frozen foods.[15] Over the next 10 years, Peltz bought up several food companies, and in 1972, he and his brother took their company, then called Flagstaff Corp., with $150 million in sales, public.[9][13] In 1982 his brother Robert bought back the assets of Peltz Food from Flagstaff after it went bankrupt.[15]
Investment career[edit]
In the 1980s, Peltz and his business partner, Peter May, who had joined Flagstaff as chief financial officer after having been its accountant, went looking for new acquisitions. In April 1983, the two bought a stake in vending-machine and wire company Triangle Industries Inc. with the idea of using it to make acquisitions, building it into a Fortune 100 industrial company.[16] Triangle was sold to Pechiney in 1988.[17]

As an activist investing firm, Trian has invested in such companies as Heinz,[19] Cadbury, Kraft Foods,[20] Ingersoll Rand,[21] Wendy’s,[22] DuPont,[23] Mondelēz,[3] PepsiCo,[24] State Street Corporation [25] and Family Dollar.[26]

Trian's Peltz seeks a seat on board at Procter & Gamble

Back to Gallery
















NEW YORK (AP) — Activist investor Nelson Peltz is attempting to secure a seat on the board at Procter & Gamble, seeking faster changes at the consumer products company.
Peltz's Trian Fund Management LP, which owns about $3.3 billion worth of Procter & Gamble Co. shares, said Monday that Procter & Gamble's financial performance over the last 10 years has been disappointing.



David Taylor was named CEO of the company two years ago and P&G under his lead has attempted to transform itself, focusing on its bigger brands with growth potential. The Cincinnati-based company has already shed some of the smaller brands it says collectively contribute little to its operating profit.
But that has hurt sales, which have declined over the past three years, and the company's share price.
Shares of P&G are up less than 4 percent this year. Rival Johnson & Johnson's stock is up 15 percent in the same period, Colgate-Palmolive Co. is up 11 percent and Kimberly-Clark Corp. is up 9 percent.

Trian said that it's not looking to break up P&G, replace Taylor or remove other board members.
P&G said in a statement that it's maintained an active dialogue with Trian, but that it's sticking with its current strategy. Trian hasn't provided any "new or actionable ideas" that will help create more shareholder value, it said.

Analyst Kevin Grundy of Jeffries said in a client note that while P&G has taken "sensible" steps to boost shareholder value and there's no guarantee that Peltz will get a seat on P&G's board, "the perceived value of his presence may lead to greater/faster realization of cost savings and/or raise the execution bar at P&G."

Nelson Peltz’ Trian Versus P&G: Juggernaut Proxy Fight
Trian Fund Management says P&G has an "overly complex organizational structure and a slow moving and insular culture." The firm is urging shareholders to vote Nelson Peltz on to the consumer product giant's board of directors.

 Nelson Peltz' Trian Fund Management is waging battle against Procter & Gamble's (PG) for a seat on its board, according to the Wall Street Journal. The goal: to get the consumer product juggernaut's sales and profit growth moving again. Shares of P&G have risen 0.52% on the news in pre-market trading to a recent $87.55. Trian has been in talks with the maker of Tide detergent and Bounty paper towels for five months, which culminated last week in P&G rejecting the asset manager's demand to name its co-founding partner Peltz as a director. Trian, which owns roughly $3.3 billion of P&G stock, urged shareholders to vote Peltz at the company's meeting. The firm outlined reasons in a filing:  Weak Total Shareholder Returns. Over the past decade, the Company has underperformed relative to both its peers and to the S&P 500. In fact, the Company’s total return to shareholders over the last ten years was less than half that of its peers. We believe P&G needs to address the factors contributing to this consistent underperformance.  Deteriorating Market Share. Over the past five years, P&G’s organic sales growth has decelerated and the Company has lost market share across most of its categories. The Trian Group believes that disruptive and existential threats are impacting the entire consumer packaged goods industry, including changes in technology and consumer behavior, and the Company must act with the greatest possible urgency to address the market share it is losing to both its peers and smaller local competitors, who are adapting to industry changes more effectively than P&G.  Excessive Cost and Bureaucracy. The Company’s management acknowledges the need to reduce cost and bureaucracy, but it is clear to us that these critical issues have not been sufficiently addressed. · Trian’s analysis shows that the Company’s $10 billion cost-cutting program, launched in 2012, has had no discernible impact on profits or sales growth. In particular, the program did not drive earnings growth given that operating profit was essentially flat from 2012 to 2016. · Although the Company has stated that it has identified up to $13 billion of additional cost savings, given P&G’s track record, the Trian Group is concerned that this initiative will be as ineffective as the 2012 program in driving sales growth, earnings growth and shareholder value creation.  WSJ's David Benoit pointed out that the $223 billion company is "the largest ever to face a proxy fight."

Trian takes off the gloves, aiming to put Peltz on P&G's board | Reuters

Trian Fund Management LP on Monday announced the nomination of its chief executive and co-founder Peltz, launching the largest proxy fight ever against a $223 billion consumer products juggernaut that sells everything from Tide detergent and Gillette razors to Pampers diapers.  Peltz's nomination comes after five months of behind-the-scenes discussions between Trian and P&G's top executives and board, according to the company's proxy filing. At one point, the two sides nearly struck a truce in May that would involve P&G laying out certain performance metrics over the next year.  But any sign of an agreement was absent on Monday when both came out swinging. The 180-year-old company, founded on a hand-shake agreement by a soap and a candle maker, issued a statement strongly backing its board and strategic plan. See Breakingviews column: Trian, which owns about $3.3 billion of P&G's stock, or 1.5 percent of the company, has until an October annual meeting to convince fellow shareholders that Peltz deserves to be voted onto the board.  The firm's campaign website (revitalizepg.com) and press release has few immediate changes proposed for the company other than advocating for a geographic organizational structure that it believes will empower divisional leaders to make faster and better decisions. Shares of P&G were up slightly at $87.72 in afternoon trade.      Trian's previous battle with a consumer goods conglomerate was with PepsiCo Inc (PEP.N), where it pressured the company to spin off its beverage business from its snacks division, a campaign that the company never heeded though it did hand the investor a board seat in 2015 to make peace. (reut.rs/2uvu0ea) That campaign began with Trian advocating Peltz for Pepsi's board and ended with industry veteran William Johnson joining as Trian's representative.  In a CNBC interview on Monday, Peltz, 75, talked more about Trian's track record with companies such as H.J. Heinz than actual operational changes needed at P&G. Peltz railed against the company's "suffocating bureaucracy," but noted he was on good terms with CEO David Taylor. Trian said it wants P&G to cut costs more efficiently, and that it does not want to replace Taylor, any board directors, or to break-up the company. Since Taylor became CEO in November, 2015, P&G's stock has gained 0.3 percent. In contrast, the S&P 500 Household Products index .SPLRCPROD, which includes Kimberly-Clark Corp (KMB.N) and Clorox Co (CLX.N), has risen 12 percent over the same period.      P&G's quarterly organic sales, which excludes acquisitions and divestitures, has fallen just once during his one and half years at the helm. For this year, the consumer goods giant expects a 2-3 percent rise in organic sales growth. Battle Lines FILE PHOTO - Nelson Peltz speaks at the WSJD Live conference in Laguna Beach, California October 25, 2016.Mike BlakeThe Trian-P&G battle comes as activist investors, emboldened by years of successful campaigns for changes at corporations across the U.S. and abroad, use their growing coffers to seek bigger targets. Trian won two seats on H.J. Heinz's board in its 2006 proxy fight, and lost its battle to get board representation at industrial conglomerate DuPont (DD.N) in 2015.  P&G's proxy filing, disclosed on Monday, shows that Trian's dialogue with the company goes back to Feb. 16, when Peltz called Taylor shortly after disclosing the stake to make the introduction and set up an in-person meeting.  "I am quite surprised and very disappointed because I think David (Taylor) and I have developed a very positive relationship," Peltz told CNBC, when asked if he was surprised that the dialogue had turned into a proxy fight. "I like the man."  Trian said in a press release that its bid to get Peltz on the board centers on P&G's continuing underperformance, costs, complexity and culture. (bit.ly/2t7h62c) October Annual Meeting With P&G's annual meeting usually held in October, the two sides have roughly three months to discuss ways to avoid a shareholder vote on Peltz. If elected, Trian has said it wants P&G to expand the board to 12 members rather than have Peltz replace a sitting director. P&G's current board has six past or current CEOs, including American Express CEO Kenneth Chenault and Hewlett Packard Enterprise CEO Meg Whitman. "P&G has a best-in-class board of directors that is fully supportive of and actively engaged in overseeing the company’s transformation," the company said on Monday. P&G's proxy filing noted that last Tuesday, in a meeting between Trian and members of P&G's board, Trian said it was moving ahead to elect Peltz because the company was not moving fast enough to improve its performance.  P&G directors at the meeting said they too were not happy with the performance, but that they felt that Trian’s representation on the board was unnecessary in light of recent initiatives undertaken by the company," the filing said.  In a bid to boost profits even as sales remain stagnant, P&G has sold unprofitable brands, including 41 beauty brands to Coty Inc (COTY.N), and focused on core brands. However, the efforts have failed to boost the stock much beyond the level where it traded at the beginning of this year.  Trian said that P&G's last cost-cutting plan, launched in 2012, failed to impact profit or sales growth. Barclays noted on Monday that Trian is working with former P&G CFO Clayt Daley, a consultant on the campaign who could become a potential board candidate to replace Peltz as part of the negotiations.

The Associated Press

































































NEW YORK • Activist investor Nelson Peltz is seeking a board seat at Procter & Gamble as he pushes for faster changes at the consumer products company.Peltz’s Trian Fund Management LP, which owns about $3.3 billion worth of Procter & Gamble Co. shares, said Monday that Procter & Gamble’s financial performance over the last 10 years has been disappointing.
David Taylor was named CEO of the company two years ago, and under his lead P&G has attempted to transform itself, focusing on its bigger brands with growth potential. The Cincinnati-based company already has shed some small brands, but that has hurt sales, which have declined over the past three years.Shares of P&G are up less than 4 percent this year, compared with 15 percent for rival Johnson & Johnson, 11 percent for Colgate-Palmolive Co. and 9 percent for Kimberly-Clark Corp.

Trian said it’s not looking to break up P&G, replace Taylor or remove other board members.P&G said in a statement it has maintained an active dialogue with Trian but is sticking with its current strategy. Trian hasn’t provided any “new or actionable ideas,” the statement said.Analyst Kevin Grundy of Jeffries said in a client note that while P&G has taken “sensible” steps to boost shareholder value and there’s no guarantee that Peltz will get a board seat, “the perceived value of his presence may lead to greater/faster realization of cost savings and/or raise the execution bar at P&G.”

Peltz Must Target Retail Investors In P&G Fight









Ronald Orol




Jul 26, 2017 2:28 PM EDT













 







































Nelson Peltz




















 The largest director-election battle ever to be held is in its second week fully in the public sphere and both its protagonist, activist Nelson Peltz and his target, Procter & Gamble Co. (PG) , will soon begin focusing a lot of attention on the company's hundreds of thousands of retail investors. "They both know that retail investors can make or break Trian's campaign," said Thomas Ball, managing director at proxy solicitor Morrow Sodali. "There are typically lots of retail investors in companies like P&G, where lots of people use their products." At issue is a director-election battle launched last week by Peltz, who is seeking one seat on the packaged goods company's board. Peltz says he wants to see the company eliminate what he calls its "suffocating bureaucracy" by simplifying its matrixed organizational structure, a system that he contends doesn't give division leaders the power to control their destiny. Observers argue that Peltz actually would like to see the company break itself up as a means of simplifying the business, thus eliminating said bureaucracy, though Trian has explicitly said it doesn't want to do that. Both sides are digging in for a long battle that likely will end at the company's annual meeting, expected in October. A settlement seems unlikely as Peltz only wants one seat for himself, which the company is fighting tooth and nail. First, up will be Procter & Gamble's fourth quarter earnings release and analyst call, scheduled for Thursday. Expect Procter & Gamble CEO David Taylor to make a case for not including Peltz on the board.

Early life and education[edit]
Peltz was born to a Jewish family in 1942 in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Claire (née Wechsler) and Maurice Herbert Peltz.[9][10][11] Peltz was enrolled at the undergraduate program at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, where he joined the Fraternity of Phi Gamma Delta,[12] but never completed his degree.[9]
In 1963, he dropped out of the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School with the intention of becoming a ski instructor in Oregon.[13] However, he ended up driving a delivery truck for A. Peltz & Sons, a wholesale food distribution business founded by his grandfather Adolph in 1896, which delivered fresh produce and frozen food (Snow Top)[14] to restaurants in New York.[6][9]
His father gave him free rein with the company, and over the next 15 years he and his older brother, Robert B. Peltz, grew the business gradually shifting the product line from produce to institutional frozen foods.[15] Over the next 10 years, Peltz bought up several food companies, and in 1972, he and his brother took their company, then called Flagstaff Corp., with $150 million in sales, public.[9][13] In 1982 his brother Robert bought back the assets of Peltz Food from Flagstaff after it went bankrupt.[15]
Investment career[edit]
In the 1980s, Peltz and his business partner, Peter May, who had joined Flagstaff as chief financial officer after having been its accountant, went looking for new acquisitions. In April 1983, the two bought a stake in vending-machine and wire company Triangle Industries Inc. with the idea of using it to make acquisitions, building it into a Fortune 100 industrial company.[16] Triangle was sold to Pechiney in 1988.[17]
In 1997, through an investment vehicle they controlled, Triarc Cos,[18] Peltz and May acquired Snapple, from Quaker Oats. Snapple, together with other beverage brands was sold to Cadbury Schweppes in 2000. The Snapple turnaround was featured as a Harvard Business School case study.[18]
In 2005, Peltz, May, and Ed Garden, founded Trian Fund Management, L.P. As an activist investing firm, Trian has invested in such companies as Heinz,[19] Cadbury, Kraft Foods,[20] Ingersoll Rand,[21] Wendy’s,[22] DuPont,[23] Mondelēz,[3] PepsiCo,[24] State Street Corporation [25] and Family Dollar.[26]
In 2006, Trian was involved in a proxy contest with Heinz to get five independent directors on the board of Heinz. Trian succeeded in getting two members on the board, including Peltz.[27]
In 2007, Trian bought a 3% share of Cadbury-Schweppes. Cadbury Schweppes Americas Beverages was later spun off from the Cadbury Schweppes confectionery group. In 2007, Trian also bought $1.8 billion in shares of Kraft Foods, roughly a 3% of the total equity of the food maker.[28]
In April 2008, it was announced that Triarc Cos. would merge with burger chain Wendy's.[29] The merger was completed on September 29, 2008.[30] The new company was named Wendy's Arby's Group and traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol WEN. On July 25, 2011, Wendy's Arby's sold Arby's to Roark Capital Group and changed its name to The Wendy's Company.[31] According to CNBC, on February 15, 2011, Trian offered to buy Family Dollar for $55–60 per share.
In February 2011, Trian announced it had accumulated an 8% stake in the Family Dollar company and indicated a willingness to participate in a take private LBO for the company with a total value of about $7 to $8 billion. This overture was rejected by the company management and board of directors.[32] In September 2011, Ed Garden, Trian’s Chief Investment Officer, joined the Family Dollar board.[33]
Peltz was appointed to the Ingersoll-Rand board of directors in 2012.[34]
In August 2013, it was reported that Trian held an approximate $1.25 billion stake in DuPont.[23]
In January 2014, as one of the company’s largest shareholders, with a current beneficial ownership of more than 46 million shares, Peltz was appointed to the board of directors of global snacking company, Mondelēz International (NASDAQ: MDLZ).[35][36]
In February 2014, as a beneficial owner of approximately $1.2 billion of PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE: PEP) common shares, Trian publicly released a letter to PepsiCo’s board of directors and a white paper detailing why separating global snacks and beverages into two independent public companies would be the right long-term decision for the business and would create substantial value for shareholders.[37] Trian said it would immediately begin to engage fellow shareholders in a public dialogue with the goal of creating a groundswell of support for a separation of snacks and beverages.[38]
In February 2014, Forbes listed Peltz as one of the 25 highest-earning hedge fund managers in 2013, with total earnings of $430 million, ranked 16th.[39]
In May 2015, Trian was unsuccessful in a bitter proxy contest to appoint four of its nominees to the board of DuPont.[40] Five months later the CEO of DuPont, Ellen Kullman, resigned; at the time DuPont acknowledged lower than expected earnings and the need to accelerate a cost-cutting plan.[41]
In October 2015, Trian bought a $2.5 billion stake in General Electric.[42]
Personal life[edit]




Peltz's children, Will and Nicola, at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival


Peltz has been married three times. His third wife is Claudia Heffner, a former fashion model, with whom he has eight children. He has two children from his prior marriages.[43] Among Peltz's children are actors Nicola Peltz[44] and Will Peltz.[45] His son Brad Peltz was a professional ice hockey player who played in the ECHL during the 2012–13 ECHL season.[46]
Peltz resides in Bedford, New York.[2] He also owns Montsorrel, which is his house in Palm Beach, Florida[1] previously owned by Anita Young, the sister of Georgia O'Keeffe. He has recently begun a refurbishment and expansion project for the property.[47]
Wealth and philanthropy[edit]
According to Forbes Magazine, he has a net worth of $1.51 billion as of February 2017. This makes him the 432nd richest person in the US.[48]
In 2005, Peltz was among 53 entities that contributed the maximum of $250,000 to the second inauguration of President George W. Bush.[49][50][51] He is also a heavy contributor to Jewish causes.[52]
Awards and recognition[edit]
He was recognized by the National Association of Corporate Directors (NACD) in 2010, 2011 and 2012 as among the most influential people in global corporate governance.[53]

Early life and education[edit]
Peltz was born to a Jewish family in 1942 in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Claire (née Wechsler) and Maurice Herbert Peltz.[9][10][11] Peltz was enrolled at the undergraduate program at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, where he joined the Fraternity of Phi Gamma Delta,[12] but never completed his degree.[9]
In 1963, he dropped out of the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School with the intention of becoming a ski instructor in Oregon.[13] However, he ended up driving a delivery truck for A. Peltz & Sons, a wholesale food distribution business founded by his grandfather Adolph in 1896, which delivered fresh produce and frozen food (Snow Top)[14] to restaurants in New York.[6][9]
His father gave him free rein with the company, and over the next 15 years he and his older brother, Robert B. Peltz, grew the business gradually shifting the product line from produce to institutional frozen foods.[15] Over the next 10 years, Peltz bought up several food companies, and in 1972, he and his brother took their company, then called Flagstaff Corp., with $150 million in sales, public.[9][13] In 1982 his brother Robert bought back the assets of Peltz Food from Flagstaff after it went bankrupt.[15]
Investment career[edit]
In the 1980s, Peltz and his business partner, Peter May, who had joined Flagstaff as chief financial officer after having been its accountant, went looking for new acquisitions. In April 1983, the two bought a stake in vending-machine and wire company Triangle Industries Inc. with the idea of using it to make acquisitions, building it into a Fortune 100 industrial company.[16] Triangle was sold to Pechiney in 1988.[17]
In 1997, through an investment vehicle they controlled, Triarc Cos,[18] Peltz and May acquired Snapple, from Quaker Oats. Snapple, together with other beverage brands was sold to Cadbury Schweppes in 2000. The Snapple turnaround was featured as a Harvard Business School case study.[18]
In 2005, Peltz, May, and Ed Garden, founded Trian Fund Management, L.P. As an activist investing firm, Trian has invested in such companies as Heinz,[19] Cadbury, Kraft Foods,[20] Ingersoll Rand,[21] Wendy’s,[22] DuPont,[23] Mondelēz,[3] PepsiCo,[24] State Street Corporation [25] and Family Dollar.[26]
In 2006, Trian was involved in a proxy contest with Heinz to get five independent directors on the board of Heinz. Trian succeeded in getting two members on the board, including Peltz.[27]
In 2007, Trian bought a 3% share of Cadbury-Schweppes. Cadbury Schweppes Americas Beverages was later spun off from the Cadbury Schweppes confectionery group. In 2007, Trian also bought $1.8 billion in shares of Kraft Foods, roughly a 3% of the total equity of the food maker.[28]
In April 2008, it was announced that Triarc Cos. would merge with burger chain Wendy's.[29] The merger was completed on September 29, 2008.[30] The new company was named Wendy's Arby's Group and traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol WEN. On July 25, 2011, Wendy's Arby's sold Arby's to Roark Capital Group and changed its name to The Wendy's Company.[31] According to CNBC, on February 15, 2011, Trian offered to buy Family Dollar for $55–60 per share.
In February 2011, Trian announced it had accumulated an 8% stake in the Family Dollar company and indicated a willingness to participate in a take private LBO for the company with a total value of about $7 to $8 billion. This overture was rejected by the company management and board of directors.[32] In September 2011, Ed Garden, Trian’s Chief Investment Officer, joined the Family Dollar board.[33]
Peltz was appointed to the Ingersoll-Rand board of directors in 2012.[34]
In August 2013, it was reported that Trian held an approximate $1.25 billion stake in DuPont.[23]
In January 2014, as one of the company’s largest shareholders, with a current beneficial ownership of more than 46 million shares, Peltz was appointed to the board of directors of global snacking company, Mondelēz International (NASDAQ: MDLZ).[35][36]
In February 2014, as a beneficial owner of approximately $1.2 billion of PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE: PEP) common shares, Trian publicly released a letter to PepsiCo’s board of directors and a white paper detailing why separating global snacks and beverages into two independent public companies would be the right long-term decision for the business and would create substantial value for shareholders.[37] Trian said it would immediately begin to engage fellow shareholders in a public dialogue with the goal of creating a groundswell of support for a separation of snacks and beverages.[38]
In February 2014, Forbes listed Peltz as one of the 25 highest-earning hedge fund managers in 2013, with total earnings of $430 million, ranked 16th.[39]
In May 2015, Trian was unsuccessful in a bitter proxy contest to appoint four of its nominees to the board of DuPont.[40] Five months later the CEO of DuPont, Ellen Kullman, resigned; at the time DuPont acknowledged lower than expected earnings and the need to accelerate a cost-cutting plan.[41]
In October 2015, Trian bought a $2.5 billion stake in General Electric.[42]
Personal life[edit]




Peltz's children, Will and Nicola, at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival


Peltz has been married three times. His third wife is Claudia Heffner, a former fashion model, with whom he has eight children. He has two children from his prior marriages.[43] Among Peltz's children are actors Nicola Peltz[44] and Will Peltz.[45] His son Brad Peltz was a professional ice hockey player who played in the ECHL during the 2012–13 ECHL season.[46]
Peltz resides in Bedford, New York.[2] He also owns Montsorrel, which is his house in Palm Beach, Florida[1] previously owned by Anita Young, the sister of Georgia O'Keeffe. He has recently begun a refurbishment and expansion project for the property.[47]
Wealth and philanthropy[edit]
According to Forbes Magazine, he has a net worth of $1.51 billion as of February 2017. This makes him the 432nd richest person in the US.[48]
In 2005, Peltz was among 53 entities that contributed the maximum of $250,000 to the second inauguration of President George W. Bush.[49][50][51] He is also a heavy contributor to Jewish causes.[52]
Awards and recognition[edit]
He was recognized by the National Association of Corporate Directors (NACD) in 2010, 2011 and 2012 as among the most influential people in global corporate governance.[53]

Early life and education[edit]
Peltz was born to a Jewish family in 1942 in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Claire (née Wechsler) and Maurice Herbert Peltz.[9][10][11] Peltz was enrolled at the undergraduate program at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, where he joined the Fraternity of Phi Gamma Delta,[12] but never completed his degree.[9]
In 1963, he dropped out of the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School with the intention of becoming a ski instructor in Oregon.[13] However, he ended up driving a delivery truck for A. Peltz & Sons, a wholesale food distribution business founded by his grandfather Adolph in 1896, which delivered fresh produce and frozen food (Snow Top)[14] to restaurants in New York.[6][9]
His father gave him free rein with the company, and over the next 15 years he and his older brother, Robert B. Peltz, grew the business gradually shifting the product line from produce to institutional frozen foods.[15] Over the next 10 years, Peltz bought up several food companies, and in 1972, he and his brother took their company, then called Flagstaff Corp., with $150 million in sales, public.[9][13] In 1982 his brother Robert bought back the assets of Peltz Food from Flagstaff after it went bankrupt.[15]
Investment career[edit]
In the 1980s, Peltz and his business partner, Peter May, who had joined Flagstaff as chief financial officer after having been its accountant, went looking for new acquisitions. In April 1983, the two bought a stake in vending-machine and wire company Triangle Industries Inc. with the idea of using it to make acquisitions, building it into a Fortune 100 industrial company.[16] Triangle was sold to Pechiney in 1988.[17]
In 1997, through an investment vehicle they controlled, Triarc Cos,[18] Peltz and May acquired Snapple, from Quaker Oats. Snapple, together with other beverage brands was sold to Cadbury Schweppes in 2000. The Snapple turnaround was featured as a Harvard Business School case study.[18]
In 2005, Peltz, May, and Ed Garden, founded Trian Fund Management, L.P. As an activist investing firm, Trian has invested in such companies as Heinz,[19] Cadbury, Kraft Foods,[20] Ingersoll Rand,[21] Wendy’s,[22] DuPont,[23] Mondelēz,[3] PepsiCo,[24] State Street Corporation [25] and Family Dollar.[26]
In 2006, Trian was involved in a proxy contest with Heinz to get five independent directors on the board of Heinz. Trian succeeded in getting two members on the board, including Peltz.[27]
In 2007, Trian bought a 3% share of Cadbury-Schweppes. Cadbury Schweppes Americas Beverages was later spun off from the Cadbury Schweppes confectionery group. In 2007, Trian also bought $1.8 billion in shares of Kraft Foods, roughly a 3% of the total equity of the food maker.[28]
In April 2008, it was announced that Triarc Cos. would merge with burger chain Wendy's.[29] The merger was completed on September 29, 2008.[30] The new company was named Wendy's Arby's Group and traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol WEN. On July 25, 2011, Wendy's Arby's sold Arby's to Roark Capital Group and changed its name to The Wendy's Company.[31] According to CNBC, on February 15, 2011, Trian offered to buy Family Dollar for $55–60 per share.
In February 2011, Trian announced it had accumulated an 8% stake in the Family Dollar company and indicated a willingness to participate in a take private LBO for the company with a total value of about $7 to $8 billion. This overture was rejected by the company management and board of directors.[32] In September 2011, Ed Garden, Trian’s Chief Investment Officer, joined the Family Dollar board.[33]
Peltz was appointed to the Ingersoll-Rand board of directors in 2012.[34]
In August 2013, it was reported that Trian held an approximate $1.25 billion stake in DuPont.[23]
In January 2014, as one of the company’s largest shareholders, with a current beneficial ownership of more than 46 million shares, Peltz was appointed to the board of directors of global snacking company, Mondelēz International (NASDAQ: MDLZ).[35][36]
In February 2014, as a beneficial owner of approximately $1.2 billion of PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE: PEP) common shares, Trian publicly released a letter to PepsiCo’s board of directors and a white paper detailing why separating global snacks and beverages into two independent public companies would be the right long-term decision for the business and would create substantial value for shareholders.[37] Trian said it would immediately begin to engage fellow shareholders in a public dialogue with the goal of creating a groundswell of support for a separation of snacks and beverages.[38]
In February 2014, Forbes listed Peltz as one of the 25 highest-earning hedge fund managers in 2013, with total earnings of $430 million, ranked 16th.[39]
In May 2015, Trian was unsuccessful in a bitter proxy contest to appoint four of its nominees to the board of DuPont.[40] Five months later the CEO of DuPont, Ellen Kullman, resigned; at the time DuPont acknowledged lower than expected earnings and the need to accelerate a cost-cutting plan.[41]
In October 2015, Trian bought a $2.5 billion stake in General Electric.[42]
Personal life[edit]




Peltz's children, Will and Nicola, at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival


Peltz has been married three times. His third wife is Claudia Heffner, a former fashion model, with whom he has eight children. He has two children from his prior marriages.[43] Among Peltz's children are actors Nicola Peltz[44] and Will Peltz.[45] His son Brad Peltz was a professional ice hockey player who played in the ECHL during the 2012–13 ECHL season.[46]
Peltz resides in Bedford, New York.[2] He also owns Montsorrel, which is his house in Palm Beach, Florida[1] previously owned by Anita Young, the sister of Georgia O'Keeffe. He has recently begun a refurbishment and expansion project for the property.[47]
Wealth and philanthropy[edit]
According to Forbes Magazine, he has a net worth of $1.51 billion as of February 2017. This makes him the 432nd richest person in the US.[48]
In 2005, Peltz was among 53 entities that contributed the maximum of $250,000 to the second inauguration of President George W. Bush.[49][50][51] He is also a heavy contributor to Jewish causes.[52]
Awards and recognition[edit]
He was recognized by the National Association of Corporate Directors (NACD) in 2010, 2011 and 2012 as among the most influential people in global corporate governance.[53]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
