            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

Data Format: CSV

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Dish TV-Videocon D2h merger gets NCLT nod
The Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has approved the "scheme of arrangement amongst Videocon D2h Limited and Dish TV India Ltd and their respective shareholders and creditors," Dish TV India said in a statement.














Direct-to-home (DTH) operators Dish TV and Videocon D2h have moved a step closure towards their merger as they received the mandatory nod from NCLT.The Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has approved the "scheme of arrangement amongst Videocon D2h Limited and Dish TV India Ltd and their respective shareholders and creditors," Dish TV India said in a statement.The appointment date for the scheme is October 1, 2017.

Earlier, on May 10, the Zee group firm had said that it got approval from the fair trade regulator, the Competition Commission of India (CCI), for the proposed merger.

Videocon d2h is an Indian pay TV company, providing direct broadcast satellite service—including satellite television, audio programming, and interactive television services—to commercial and residential customers in India. It uses H.264 or MPEG-4 Part 10, Advanced Video Coding (MPEG-4 AVC) with DVB S2 digital compression technology, transmitting using ST-2 satellite. Videocon d2h has 11.86 million subscribers as of March 2016.[2]
On 11 November 2016, the Board of Directors of Videocon d2h and Dish TV agreed to an all-stock merger of their DTH operations. The merger will create the largest DTH provider in India with a total valuation of ₹17,000 crore (US$2.6 billion). The merged entity will be called Dish TV Videocon Limited. Dish TV will hold a 55.4% stake in the merged entity, while Videocon d2h will own the remaining shares. The two companies combined would have 27.6 million subscribers out of the estimated 175 million Indian households that own a television.[3][4][5] The deal is subject to regulatory approvals, which will take a minimum of 8 months.[6][7]The merger has been succesfully completed and effective Oct'17 Dish Tv and Videcon d2h are officially one.However, the operations still run under their respective brand names.The operational and infrastructure costs are expected to be leveraged with collaborative use of the existing infrastructure of individual companies.Apart from the leveraged costs,now both the brands can effectively handle the existing subscriber base and address the rapidly growing Indian DTH market.
Technical information[edit]
Videocon d2h has 10, 54 MHz transponders on Satellite ST-2. Videocon d2h is aligned at 88° East on the Clark Belt. Videocon d2h uses MPEG-4 technology, which permits high compression for video and DVB-S2 technology, which allows more efficient transmission of satellite signals.
