You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.

Cornell University law professor Michael C. Dorf argues that if President Trump were to pardon himself, that action itself would not cause a constitutional crisis, but other actions Trump has already taken have already placed us far along a road to a constitutional crisis.

Would a Trump Self-Pardon Precipitate a Constitutional Crisis?



Cornell University law professor Michael C. Dorf argues that if President Trump were to pardon himself, that action itself would not cause a constitutional crisis, but other actions Trump has already taken have already placed us far along a road to a constitutional crisis.

From mono to stereo, today the world meets the next step in sound evolution: Ambidio
LOS ANGELES, March 15, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Ambidio, a Los Angeles-based sound company, backed by Grammy award-winning artist will.i.am and Horizons Ventures, is launching worldwide today. Ambidio brings a high quality, immersive sound experience to companies and consumers alike, using only software. Treating the brain as a decoder, Ambidio's technology creates a continuous sound field with a sense of depth and dimension to be utilized through any device with stereo speakers.
Ambidio has enlisted Lucasfilm's Skywalker Sound, which has been redefining immersive sound for nearly 4 decades for film, TV and videogames, as a strategic advisor to assist with Ambidio's technology and creative development.
"Finding solutions to maintain sound fidelity across multiple platforms is something we care deeply about," stated Josh Lowden, General Manager of Skywalker Sound.  "We are very excited for the opportunity to work with Iris and the talented team at Ambidio."
In development for over 2 years, Ambidio's industry leading technology processes content in real time for any stereo speaker configuration.
"Technology is transforming the way we experience music and, as an artist and producer, I'm always looking to what's next – where the innovation is. Ambidio brings music to life through immersive sound, giving people a chance to experience music in a whole new way," says will.i.am of his involvement.
While attending graduate school at New York University, Iris Wu, Founder of Ambidio, was trying to create a quality listening experience but was dissatisfied with the results due to living in a small New York City apartment. She began experimenting with sound engineering through code rather than hardware and Ambidio's technology began to take shape.
"The brain is a powerful mechanism that can interpret the directional origin of different sounds in everyday life," says Iris, "however, when consuming content on a device, such as a laptop, sound consistently comes from a fixed point – the front. Ambidio creates an immersive sound experience using only stereo speakers by inserting common cues into audio files that the brain then uses to identify and perceive where different sounds within the audio stream would have come from. Essentially, our brains process the sound the way it does in everyday life." 
Ambidio works in one of two ways – it can be embedded directly into movie and audio files to have a continuous Ambidio sound experience or it can be used as a plug-in to process the audio output of any content played on a device in real time. Ambidio can be enabled through any device that has stereo speakers, including laptops, TVs and some Android mobile phones.
Offering a new way for people to experience sound, Ambidio has a range that is at least three times wider than conventional methods that simulates three dimensional sound, using traditional speakers and headphones, allowing for a fully immersive experience.
