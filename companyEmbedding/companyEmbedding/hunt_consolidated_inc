Robillard's career with Hunt began in 1983 as the manager of international accounting. The next year he transferred to Yemen where he held various management roles at Yemen Hunt Oil Company, ultimately becoming vice president of finance. His experiences in Yemen included his participation in bringing the first oil from Yemen into production, the development of 12 commercial oil fields, the construction of two production facilities, a refinery, the drilling of 500 wells and the completion of a 250 mile export pipeline.
In 1992 Robillard returned to Dallas. Since then he has headed the finance areas of Hunt Oil Company and later Hunt Consolidated. Robillard notes that when he was hired the oil industry was in a downturn and that now that he is retiring it is just coming out of a downturn. "This is a volatile business. I cannot think of a more exciting industry to have spent a career in or a better place than the Hunt organization," said Robillard. 
Although Robillard is retiring, he will remain with the organization as CEO and chairman of ES Xplore, LLC a direct hydrocarbon indicator technology company developed at Hunt. "Don has provided outstanding leadership over the years. He has seen the company grow exponentially during his tenure and I am excited that he has agreed to remain a part of the Hunt family of companies," said Chris Kleinert, co-CEO of Hunt Consolidated, Inc. 
Jamie Beggs joined Hunt Consolidated January 30, as senior vice president and chief financial officer of Hunt Consolidated, Inc.  Previously, Beggs worked for Celanese Corporation where she held a number of finance and business related positions over the last 10 years, including vice president and treasurer and chief financial officer of their Materials Solutions division. 
Jamie is originally from Houston and attended the University of Texas at Austin where she earned a B.B.A degree, with highest honors and an M.P.A degree in accounting. After graduation, she was hired by PricewaterhouseCoopers where she became a certified public accountant and served primarily oil and gas audit clients. Subsequently, she relocated to Dallas to work for the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board before joining Celanese. 
"Under Jamie's leadership, I am confident that Hunt Consolidated will continue to grow. Her experience across all of the major disciplines within finance will be a true asset as we take on exciting new opportunities across the globe," said Kleinert.
About Hunt Consolidated, Inc.Hunt Consolidated Inc. is a diversified holding company directed by Ray L. Hunt, Hunter L. Hunt and Christopher W. Kleinert with its major subsidiaries engaged in oil and gas exploration and production, refining, LNG, power, real estate, investments, ranching and infrastructure.

About HUNT CONSOLIDATED, INC.

   Hunt Consolidated is a holding company for the oil, real estate, and other businesses of Ray Hunt, son of legendary Texas wildcatter and company founder H.L. Hunt. Hunt Oil is an oil and gas production and exploration company with primary interests in North and South America (Peru). Hoping to repeat huge discoveries in Yemen, Hunt Oil is exploring in Canada, Ghana, Iraq, Madagascar, and Oman. Hunt Realty Investments handles commercial and residential real estate investment management activities. Affiliate Hunt Refining operates three refineries in Alabama and Mississippi, while Hunt Power invests in power grids and electric services.
   Operations
 Hunt Oil is one of the few independent oil and gas companies with LNG projects as a major line of business. Hunt LNG Company is a lead shareholder of the PERU LNG project, with partners Repsol, SK Corp, and Marubeni. It also participates in the Yemen LNG project with Total, SK Corp, Hyundai, KOGAS, and the government of Yemen.
  

   Hunt Consolidated also invests in renewable energy (primarily wind projects) through Hunt Energy Horizons, while Hunt Mexico is focused on developing real estate, natural gas, electric power, and private equity opportunities in Mexico.
  

   Other affiliated businesses include liquefied natural gas (LNG) investments (Hunt LNG), ranching (Hoodoo Land and Cattle), and private equity investments (Hunt Investment Group).
  
Geographic Reach

   Hunt Consolidated has assets in Australia, Canada, Colombia, Italy, Kurdistan(Iraq), Mexico, Chile, Oman, Peru, Romania, the UAE, the US, and Yemen. Production and development activities are conducted in Europe, the Middle East, and South America, including in Australia, Canada, Peru, Romania, and Yemen. It has exploration activities in Argentina, Canada, Chile, Ethiopia, France, Ghana, Guyana, Laos, Madagascar, Niger, Oman, Peru, Portugal, Togo, the UK, Yemen and in a number of other countries.
  
Strategy

   Hunt Consolidated operates as a holding company to manage the Hunt family's diverse interests. It has two intermediate holding companies: Hunt Consolidated Energy, which oversees energy and infrastructure activities; and Hunt Consolidated Investments, which is responsible for real estate, investment, and agribusiness operations, and for new ventures. The broad range of operations helps to protect Hunt Consolidated's revenues from dependence on Hunt Oil's high risk/high return approach to exploration and production, and the boom and bust cycles of the oil and gas market.
  

   The company's oil business focuses on exploring and developing new unconventional resource plays. It looks for acquisition opportunities involving quality producing properties with major exploration upside, either as entire companies or as packages of assets.
  

   In 2014 Hunt Consolidated stepped into the Energy Future Holdings bankruptcy case, seeking to gain control of the transmission company Oncor. Hunt had previously tried to buy Oncor through Sharyland, its transmission subsidiary.
  

   To raise cash, in 2014 Hunt Oil agreed to sell natural gas, oil, and natural gas liquids assets in North Louisiana and East Texas to Vanguard Natural Resources for $278 million.
  
Company Background

   Expanding its oil operations, in 2011 Hunt Oil relocated its London office to Romania, where it has an active exploration and production program.
  

   In a strategic move to avoid income taxes, in 2010 the company formed two real estate investment trusts (REITs) for $2.1 billion, to hold its electricity transmission infrastructure and its natural gas pipelines. REITs do not pay income taxes, as long as they distribute their earnings to shareholders (who then pay the taxes).
  

   Hunt Oil was founded in 1934 (reportedly with wildcatter H.L. Hunt's poker winnings). Hunt Consolidated was formed in 1980.
