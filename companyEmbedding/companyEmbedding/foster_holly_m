Some hollies do better in cooler climates with a brief period of cold and the fosteri holly is one.  I purchased three young plants from a grower in Calif (seedlings 16-18") early 2012 and tucked them away in an obscure part of my garden for the season.  The 3 are now 24-28" and I plan to transplant at the end of a Leyland Cypress screen and cedar fence which will provide a buffer from winter elements.  The grower indicated the plants were Fosteri #2  Z6-9 15-20 ft height and spread of 8-10 ft - which is consistent with Missouri Botanical Garden...  "Foster #2 is a small to medium-sized, broadleaf evergreen tree with a dense, upright, pyramidal habit. It typically grows to a mature height of 20-30' tall with a spread of 10-15' unless pruned."

 I believe only the #2 commercially available.  All three of mine produced berries.  I'm Z6B

While on a trip to Tennessee in the mid '90s we saw these beautiful Foster hollies, and had to have one.  They were at least 20' tall, covered with red berries and shaped like a Christmas tree.  Not knowing anything about plants, we picked what looked like a healthy plant, brought back to Dallas Tx. and planted.  

Years later, it's still alive.  Never produced any berries, and today is only 6' tall.  I've finally did some research and learned several things.  Although not positive of our specific variety, I think it needs a opposite gender to pollinate for berries.  I also planted directly from the pot, so no telling if it suffers from girdled roots.  I think I've watered correctly.  Soil samples sent to Texas A & M confim a 7.5 Ph level, so I tried to ammend with peat moss,... read more general purpose fertilizers and soil acidifier.  I've only recently covered the drip line area with mulch.  Despite my best efforts to kill the plant, it still stays a beautiful green throughout the year.  
I sit here writing, trying to figure out how to determine its gender and buy its mate to produce berries (I found one site where examining its leaves can determine male/female).  I have no place to put another plant, so I am considering growing one from a pot.  
I buried my father in Dyserburg, Tenn.; that's why I was there. My first sighting of the hollies were at the funeral home, so the plant means a lot to me. Any info. I find may help the plant thrive.

I've found additional info.:  Through research I found that foster #1 and #3 are not common.  The #4 is a male:  it has stamens coming from the flower, whereas the female has a green berry in the flower center.  I've gone to a local dallas tx. nursery and found a #2 (it had a few berries), and planted within 75' of the male.

Unfortunately, internet information can conflict.  I found that a #4 can produce berries!  This being mid-November, I await flower production to really know what I have.

When healthy, this is a beautiful tree.  But it is highly susceptible to white fly, scale and aphids, all of which can induce sooty mold.

Foster Holly is a beautiful evergreen small tree that is unique among hollies for flowering without a second tree to pollinate it. It will grow in sun or partial-shade and it will be smothered in bright red berries all winter long.   This tree will grow to 25 feet as a beautiful specimen tree or it can be planted as an attractive screen, or trimmed into a beautiful dense hedge. The deep-green leaves have small spines on them and they are glossy and healthy-looking all year round. In spring your tree will have small white flowers which develop into the traditional holly berries loved by everyone for the holiday season.

The only holly that produces berries on just one plant
Dense and healthy evergreen foliage
Beautiful specimen tree, screen or hedge
Easily grown in sun or partial-shade
Grows well in damp soil but also drought-resistant

Plant your Foster Holly Tree in average garden soil, or even in wetter areas. Once established it is drought-resistant and it has no significant pest or diseases. Whether you plant it as a single specimen, or grow a hedge, you can be sure of a big crop of berries every winter. Whether in full sun or partial shade, this is an ideal evergreen for every garden and it is hardy and reliable throughout all but the coldest parts of the country.

Holly is a popular evergreen shrub for hedges and specimen plants, but its main attraction has to be the red berries that are such a traditional part of Christmas celebrations. So a lot of people buy a holly tree – but then never see any berries – a big disappointment. This is because holly trees are separate male and female trees and most female trees will not produce berries without a male around. This means planting another tree – if of course you have enough room – just to get berries on your first tree, and the male tree will then never produce berries. All-in-all this is a bit of a nuisance, especially if you have a small garden. So at the Tree Center we decided to solve this problem for our customers. We talked to growers and experts and we found the Foster Holly.
Foster Holly is a hybrid female holly tree that produces a bumper crop of bright-red berries just in time for Christmas, but this tree will do it all by herself, without needing a male tree at all. This is very unusual among hollies, but it makes the Foster Holly the perfect holly for every garden, especially if you don’t have room for more than one holly tree. This vigorous small tree will grow 15 to 25 feet tall and 8 to 12 feet wide, if left untrimmed. It makes a great specimen in an open area, or a background plant, filling a corner of your garden behind other bushes. Since it is evergreen it also makes an excellent screening plant, as a row along the edge of your property. Since it can easily be trimmed, it is also a perfect choice for a hedge, especially since it will grown in partial shade and in full sun.
Foster Holly has evergreen leaves that are 2 to 3 inches long, with an irregular margin and several sharp, tiny spines on the leaf. These are not much of a problem, but they do mean that a well-clipped holly hedge is very unpleasant to push through and will deter most humans and animals from coming into your garden. The leaves are glossy, a rich olive-green in color and look attractive all year round. The tree usually grows with a single trunk and branches radiating off it, unless of course it has been pruned back, in which case it will develop multiple stems and a bushier appearance. This makes the Foster Holly very versatile, since it can be shaped to fit the purpose you have in mind.
In spring small white flowers will appear on your tree, to be followed by a heavy crop of bright-red berries, which are produced without the need for a male tree to pollinate it. The berries will ripen before Christmas, just in time to decorate your home for the holiday season, and they will also stay colorful and attractive on the tree all winter. They are not edible but birds will often eat them.
Plant your Foster Holly in a sunny or partially-shaded location. It will grow in damp soil as well as ordinary garden soil, but once established it is also drought-resistant, so this is a great low-maintenance garden plant. It has no significant pests or diseases and is vigorous with a good growth-rate. It is hardy to minus 10 degrees Fahrenheit, so it can be grown in most of the country, from Ohio to Kansas and south, as well as all through the West.
The Foster Holly is a hybrid between two American species of wild holly. One is the American Holly, Ilex opaca, which grows wild in eastern and central states. The other species is the Dahoon, Ilex cassine, which grows further south, from Virginia to Texas and even in Cuba. In the 1950s E. E. Foster, who owned Foster Nursery in Bessemer, Alabama, crossed these two plants and raised five seedlings. When these grew into full-sized plants it turned out that the plant he had called #2 was the best, since it was a female tree that produced a heavy crop of berries without a male tree being needed. Since then this tree has been grown and tested in many gardens, and is probably the best holly available to grow as a single tree.
As you can imagine, these plants must be carefully raised from stem cuttings taken from trees guaranteed to be the correct variety, so other cheaper holly bushes will not be the Foster Holly and will only be a disappointment, never producing berries for you from a single plant.
To plant a screen of Foster Holly, space your trees 6 to 8 feet apart, depending on how quickly you want the screen to fill in. For a hedge, space the plants 3 feet apart and lightly clip from the first year, as your hedge grows, to develop a dense structure. Always keep the top of your hedge narrower than the bottom, so that you keep leaves growing right to the ground. Trim in late winter, before flowering, to get the maximum crop of berries, and trim again in late summer if necessary.
At the Tree Center we strive to give our customers the best, and with the Foster Holly Tree we really feel this is the best holly you can buy. Plants of this quality are always in high demand and our stocks are limited, so order a single specimen or several to make a beautiful hedge or screen. You will not be disappointed, but order now while stocks last.

More Info










History/Lore/Use:
Botanically Foster's Holly #2 is a parthenocarpic from the Greek parthenos meaning virgin and karpos meaning fruit. It is a female holly that will produce fruit without fertilization from a male pollinator.


Leaves:
Evergreen, alternate, simple, glossy green, 1 1/2"-3" long, spiny margins.
Flower Color:
White


Fruit Description:
Deep red fruits that persist through winter.









Despite its strong ties to the holiday season, holly makes a great year-round landscape addition. Glossy dark green leaves persist through the seasons. Small white flowers arrive in the spring. And deep red berries winter gardens. A dense, compact, upright growth and neat habit makes Foster's No. 2 holly ideal for use as a tightly clipped screen or hedge or as a specimen, foundation or container planting.
This holly is a female cultivar, but there’s no need to plant a male specimen to ensure berry production. It is parthenocarpic, meaning it can produce fruit without pollination.

We're sorry, but this tree can't be shipped to AK, AZ, HI, territories, or countries outside the United States. This is due to the agricultural laws within these locations.




When you order trees from The Arbor Day Foundation, your order is guaranteed to arrive in a good, healthy condition or we'll replace them at no charge. Your trees will be shipped at a suitable time for planting.
Each tree and plant is guaranteed to grow, or we'll replace it within one year of shipment.
The benefits of bare-root trees
Our trees are delivered with natural bare roots which have been dipped in hydrating gel prior to shipment to keep the roots moist and healthy. As their abundant, fibrous roots aren't confined by a container, bare-root trees get off to a more vigorous start compared to containerized roots which typically need more time to adjust to transplanting. Bare-root trees typically surpass the size of larger containerized trees in only a few years.











Natural Root and Containerized Trees


Natural root (also called bare root) trees are shipped without soil around their roots. They are shipped when dormant in the spring and fall seasons. We dip the roots in a hydrating gel to keep them moist during shipping.
                
There are a number of advantages to natural root trees:

They are very affordable.
Their roots re-establish themselves well once they are planted in their permanent location. 
They are easy to plant at the correct depth.

The Urban Horticulture Institute at Cornell University has an interesting article about the benefits of planting natural root trees. Look for the PDF entitled Creating the Urban Forest: The Bare Root Method



Potted (also called containerized) trees come in 4" containers.

The Holly, Foster's No. 2, Ilex crenata, resembles boxwood, but its growth habit is lower and more spreading.
The leaves are dark green, glossy, ovate to elliptic, with slightly scalloped edges. Foster's berries are small and black, though sometimes white or yellow. They will appear after the spring blooms and will attract an assortment of birds!
A popular landscape plant, it does well in rich, moist, slightly acidic soil with good drainage, and thick mulch to control weeds. It will not tolerate drought, and while best in full sun, it will do well in medium shade.
This holly has a slow growth rate and should have a regular watering schedule throughout the first growing season to help establish a root system.
Foster Holly is an excellent plant for planting near an entry or off the corner of the house to provide vertical accent. It can be grown as a free-standing specimen, massed together or be sheared to form a hedge.
Foster's No. 2 provides year round ornamental interest because of its nice evergreen foliage and showy, dark red berries!
* Pyramidal shape
* Food for wildlife
* Attractive vertical accent tree
