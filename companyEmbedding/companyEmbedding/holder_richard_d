CLEVELAND

 … Diversified industrial manufacturer Eaton Corporation (NYSE:ETN) today announced that Richard D. Holder has been named president of the newly formed Electrical Components Organization reporting to Jerry R. Whitaker, president - Americas Region, Eaton’s Electrical Sector. He will be located at the company's Electrical Sector headquarters in Cherrington, Penn.


"To continue our focus on driving customer satisfaction, developing our distribution partners, growing market share and building our organizational capability, we are combining our Industrial Controls Division, Residential Products Division, and Low-Voltage and Medium-Voltage Circuit Breaker Divisions under Rich's leadership in the new Electrical Components Organization," said Jerry R. Whitaker, president - Americas Region, Eaton’s Electrical Sector. "Rich’s leadership, vision, and drive coupled with his wealth of experience will ensure our continued growth and performance in the Electrical Component business.”


Holder joined Eaton in 2001 as vice president, Supply Chain and Operational Excellence in the company's Electrical Group.

Prior to joining Eaton, Holder was director of Aircraft and Technical Purchasing for US Airways, director of Strategic Materials for Allied Signal, and held positions of increasing responsibility in supply chain and engineering at Parker Hannifin's aerospace division in California.
Holder earned a bachelor's degree in Aviation Management from Southern Illinois University in Carbondale, Ill., and a master's degree in business from Webster University in St. Louis, Mo.

Diversified industrial manufacturer Eaton Corp. announced that Richard D. Holder has been named president of the newly formed Electrical Components organization, reporting to Jerry R. Whitaker, president, Americas Region, Eaton’s Electrical Sector. Holder, who most recently served as executive vice president for Eaton Business System, will be succeeded in that position by Uday Yadav, who will be located at the company’s headquarters in Cleveland and will report to Alexander M. Cutler, Eaton’s chairman and chief executive officer.
Holder will be located at the company’s Electrical Sector headquarters in Cherrington, Penn. “To continue our focus on driving customer satisfaction, developing our distribution partners, growing market share and building our organizational capability, we are combining our Industrial Controls Division, Residential Products Division and Low-Voltage and Medium-Voltage Circuit Breaker Divisions under Rich’s leadership in the new Electrical Components Organization,” Whitaker says. “Rich’s leadership, vision and drive, coupled with his wealth of experience, will ensure our continued growth and performance in the Electrical Component business.”
Holder joined Eaton in 2001 as vice president, Supply Chain and Operational Excellence in the company’s Electrical Group. He then became vice president and general manager of the group’s Power Distribution and Assemblies Division before becoming executive vice president for Eaton Business System. Prior to joining Eaton, Holder was director of Aircraft and Technical Purchasing for US Airways, was director of Strategic Materials for Allied Signal, and held positions of increasing responsibility in supply chain and engineering at Parker Hannifin’s aerospace division in California.
Yadav, who will be responsible for the processes that support Eaton’s integrated operating system, also will have responsibility for the company’s lean manufacturing, quality, supply chain management, environmental, health and safety, and flight operations functions. “Uday has a proven track record and the business, functional and global experience to succeed in this key leadership role,” Cutler says. “I am looking forward to working with him. I also want to thank Rich Holder for his contributions in the EBS role.”
Most recently, Yadav was senior vice president and general manager of Hydraulics, Asia Pacific. He joined Eaton in 1994 and has held the roles of vice president of Supply Chain Management for the Fluid Power Group, director and general manager of Eaton’s Global Hose Division, and local managing director for Eaton in India, as well as leadership positions in the Automotive Fluid Connectors business and the former Aeroquip’s European Operations. Prior to joining Eaton, he worked with Lucas Engineering and Systems in the United Kingdom.

Search results are sorted by a combination of factors to give you a set of choices in response to your search criteria. These factors are similar to those you might use to determine which business to select from a local Yellow Pages directory, including proximity to where you are searching, expertise in the specific services or products you need, and comprehensive business information to help evaluate a business's suitability for you. “Preferred” listings, or those with featured website buttons, indicate YP advertisers who directly provide information about their businesses to help consumers make more informed buying decisions. YP advertisers receive higher placement in the default ordering of search results and may appear in sponsored listings on the top, side, or bottom of the search results page.Sort:DefaultDefaultDistanceRatingName (A - Z)Sponsored LinksAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection1. Dr. Richard D.
