Pioneer Hi-Bred Chairman Dean Oestreich to retire


April 18, 2011 | 1:05 pm EDT


Comments 







Print










DES MOINES -- DuPont announced that Dean C. Oestreich, DuPont vice president and Pioneer Hi-Bred chairman, has elected to retire effective Dec. 31.
Oestreich was named chairman in November 2007 and has been instrumental in developing long-term business and growth strategy for Pioneer. He plans to remain active in business following his retirement, working with Pioneer and others to further increase agriculture productivity.
"Dean's contributions, from his early days as a plant breeder to his leadership roles across the organization, have helped shape the successful business Pioneer is today," said James C. Borel, DuPont executive vice president. "He has dedicated his career to improving agriculture, and we look forward to tapping into his expertise and leadership in the future."
Oestreich joined Pioneer in 1974 as a corn breeder and quickly moved up the ranks to leadership positions in information management, production operations, international sales operations and North America business management. He was named a Pioneer vice president in 1999 and became the 10th president of Pioneer in January 2004.
In addition, he serves on the board of directors of Alliant Energy; is a director for the Chinese Cultural Center of America, a member of the Iowa Business Council; and serves on the executive committee of the Biosciences Alliance of Iowa, as well as the board of directors for the Civic Center of Greater Des Moines.
Pioneer Hi-Bred, a DuPont business, is the world's leading source of customized solutions for farmers, livestock producers and grain and oilseed processors. With headquarters in Des Moines, Iowa, Pioneer provides access to advanced plant genetics in nearly 70 countries.
DuPont is a science-based products and services company. Founded in 1802, DuPont puts science to work by creating sustainable solutions essential to a better, safer, healthier life for people everywhere. Operating in more than 70 countries, DuPont offers a wide range of innovative products and services for markets including agriculture and food; building and construction; communications; and transportation.SOURCE: Pioneer Hi-Bred.

Dean C. Oestreich
Biography (At time of award presentation in 2008)
Dean C. Oestreich received a bachelor's degree in Agronomy from the University of Minnesota in 1974.  After graduating, he went to work for Pioneer Hi-Bred International, a DuPont Company, which is considered the world's leading developer and supplier of advanced plant genetics to farmers throughout the world.  Over the course of thirty-three years, he advanced through the ranks of the company to become Chairman of Pioneer and Vice President of DuPont.  He is credited for the establishment of the first worldwide production planning organization in Pioneer.  Under his leadership, Pioneer gained #1 market share positions in both soybeans and corn, and the company's seed sale outside of North America passed the $1 billion mark.  He is described as someone who is committed to improving peoples' lives and livelihoods by improving health and safety.  One person wrote, "Dean's contributions have helped farmers not only in Minnesota and North America, but throughout the world, and have significantly helped agriculture better meet the world's growing food demand."   In addition, he is an active volunteer for several organizations including the Chinese Cultural Center of America, the national FFA organization, the Bioscience Alliance of Iowa, the World Food Prize, and the Young Women's Resource Center of Des Moines.
