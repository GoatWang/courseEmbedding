PRIMECAP Odyssey Aggressive Growth Fund  
Effective January 20, 2014, the Fund is closed to most new investors
Investment Objective
The Fund seeks to provide long-term capital appreciation.
Principal Investment Strategies
The Fund invests primarily in the common stocks of U.S. companies, emphasizing those companies with prospects for rapid earnings growth. The Fund may invest in stocks across all market sectors and market capitalizations and has historically invested significant portions of its assets in mid- and small-capitalization companies. Because of the bottom-up stock selection process of PRIMECAP Management Company (the "Advisor"), the Fund may maintain a significantly overweight or underweight position in a particular sector relative to the S&P 500® index,  a  market  capitalization-weighted  index  of  500  large- capitalization stocks commonly used to represent the U.S. equity market, at any time. The Fund may also invest in foreign securities through depository receipts or stocks traded on a foreign exchange.
The Advisor, through its fundamental research, seeks to identify stocks that are poised for rapid earnings growth. Catalysts for the desired growth may include new products, new markets, new management, restructuring, a structural shift in demand or supply, or other changes in industry dynamics. These stocks typically provide little or no current income. The Advisor looks for companies that, in its judgment, will grow faster and/or will be more profitable than their current market valuations suggest and for companies with asset values that are not adequately reflected in their stock prices. The Advisor may sell a stock if its market price appears to have risen above its fundamental value, if other securities appear to be more favorably priced, or if the reasons for which the stock was purchased no longer hold true. The Advisor maintains a long-term focus and attempts to identify stocks that it believes will outperform the S&P 500® index over a three- to five-year time frame.

Risks

You may lose money by investing in the Fund. You should expect the Fund's share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall stock market. The Fund's performance could be hurt by:

Stock market risk. The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices.
 
Manager risk. The chance that, as a result of poor security selection by the Advisor, the Fund may underperform relative to benchmarks or other funds with similar investment objectives.
 
Investment style risk. The chance that returns from the mix of small- and mid-cap stocks in the Fund's portfolio will trail returns from the overall stock market. Historically, these stocks have been more volatile in price than the large-cap stocks that dominate the overall stock market, and they often perform quite differently. Additionally, from time to time, growth stocks may be more volatile than the overall stock market.
 
Growth stocks risk. The chance that returns from growth stocks in the Fund's portfolio will trail returns from the overall stock market. Growth stocks are likely to be more volatile in price than the stock market as a whole. Historically, growth funds have tended to outperform the market as a whole in rising markets and underperform the market as a whole in declining markets. Of course, there is no guarantee that this pattern will continue in the future.
 
Sector-focus risk. The chance that investing a significant portion of the Fund's assets in one sector of the market exposes the Fund to greater market risk and potential monetary losses than if those assets were spread among various sectors.
 
Small- and mid-cap stocks risk. The chance that small- and mid-cap stocks may trade less frequently or in more limited volume than those of larger, more established companies; may fluctuate in value more; and, as a group, may suffer more severe price declines during periods of generally declining stock prices.
 
Foreign securities risk. The chance that the value of foreign securities will be adversely affected by the political and economic environments and other overall economic conditions in the countries where the Fund invests. Investing in foreign securities involves: country risk, which is the chance that domestic events - such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters - will weaken a country's securities markets; and currency risk, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates.

PRIMECAP Odyssey Stock Fund
Investment Objective
The Fund seeks to provide long-term capital appreciation.
Principal Investment Strategies
The Fund invests primarily in the common stocks of U.S. companies. The Fund invests at least 80% of its assets in stocks (the Fund will provide its shareholders with at least 60 days' prior notice of any change in this non-fundamental investment policy). The Fund may invest in stocks across all market sectors and market capitalizations, though it has historically invested primarily in large- and mid-capitalization companies. Because of the bottom-up selection process of PRIMECAP Management Company (the "Advisor"), the Fund may maintain a significantly overweight or underweight position in a particular sector relative to the S&P 500® index, a market capitalization-weighted index of 500 large- capitalization stocks commonly used to represent the U.S. equity market, at any time. The Fund may also invest in foreign securities through depository receipts or stocks traded on a foreign exchange.
The Advisor, through its fundamental research, seeks to identify stocks with attractive growth prospects that are trading at reasonable valuations. The Advisor looks for companies that, in its judgment, will grow faster and/or will be more profitable than their current market valuations suggest and for companies with asset values that are not adequately reflected in their stock prices. The Advisor may sell a stock if its market price appears to have risen above its fundamental value, if other securities appear to be more favorably priced, or if the reasons for which the stock was purchased no longer hold true. The Advisor maintains a long-term focus and attempts to identify stocks that it believes will outperform the S&P 500® index over a three-to five-year time frame.

The Advisor, through its fundamental research, seeks to identify stocks that have above average growth aspects or attributes that may contribute to accelerated earnings growth in the foreseeable future. Catalysts for growth may include new products, new markets, new management, restructuring, a structural shift in demand or supply, or other changes in industry dynamics. These stocks typically provide little current income. The Advisor looks for companies that, in its judgment, will grow faster and/or will be more profitable than their current market valuations suggest and for companies with asset values that are not adequately reflected in their stock prices. The Advisor may sell a stock if its market price appears to have risen above its fundamental value, if other securities appear to be more favorably priced, or if the reasons for which the stock was purchased no longer hold true. The Advisor maintains a long-term focus and attempts to identify stocks that it believes will outperform the S&P 500® index over a three-to five-year time frame.

Risks

You may lose money by investing in the Fund. You should expect the Fund's share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall stock market. The Fund's performance could be hurt by:

Stock market risk. The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices.
 
Manager risk. The chance that, as a result of poor security selection by the Advisor, the Fund may underperform relative to benchmarks or other funds with similar investment objectives.
 
Investment style risk. The chance that returns from the mix of small-, mid-, and large-cap stocks in the Fund's portfolio will trail returns from the overall stock market. Historically, small- and mid-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than the large-cap stocks that dominate the overall stock market, and they often perform quite differently. Additionally, from time to time, growth stocks may be more volatile than the overall stock market.
 
Growth stocks risk. The chance that returns from growth stocks in the Fund's portfolio will trail returns from the overall stock market. Growth stocks are likely to be more volatile in price than the stock market as a whole. Historically, growth funds have tended to outperform the market as a whole in rising markets and underperform the market as a whole in declining markets. Of course, there is no guarantee that this pattern will continue in the future.
 
Sector-focus risk. The chance that investing a significant portion of the Fund's assets in one sector of the market exposes the Fund to greater market risk and potential monetary losses than if those assets were spread among various sectors.
 
Foreign securities risk. The chance that the value of foreign securities will be adversely affected by the political and economic environments and other overall economic conditions in the countries where the Fund invests. Investing in foreign securities involves: country risk, which is the chance that domestic events - such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters - will weaken a country's securities markets; and currency risk, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates.
 
Small- and mid-cap stocks risk. The chance that small- and mid-cap stocks may trade less frequently or in more limited volume than those of larger, more established companies; may fluctuate in value more; and, as a group, may suffer more severe price declines during periods of generally declining stock prices.

Summary







 


Overall Rating

4 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 4 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 1277 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.

What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Above Average


This fund scores Above Average because it delivered returns that were in the top 22.5% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Below Average


This fund's expenses are rated as Below Average because they fall between the 20th and 40th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category





How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Fund Overview




Objective



The investment seeks to provide long-term capital appreciation.




Strategy



The fund invests primarily in the common stocks of U.S. companies, emphasizing those companies with the potential for above average earnings growth. It may invest in stocks across all market sectors and market capitalizations. Although it has historically invested primarily in large- and mid-capitalization companies, it has also invested a significant portion of its assets in small-cap stocks.


Risk



Growth stocks can perform differently from the market as a whole and can be more volatile than other types of stocks. Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments. These risks may be magnified in foreign markets. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


High

This fund scores High because Morningstar has rated its risk above the 80th percentile when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Above Average


This fund scores Above Average because it delivered returns that were in the top 22.5% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

The "Mutual Funds" area at the top of each page allows access to mutual fund holdings with individual and joint Fidelity non-retirement accounts. Individual stock positions, ETFs and 529 funds are not available through this view. For the full list of your holdings visit Portfolio Summary.Mutual Funds are priced as of the previous business day's market close when the market is open. Mutual fund positions are priced as of the official market close (typically 4p.m.) and prices are generally available between 5 p.m. and 6p.m.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. Transaction Fee:A transaction fee is similar to a  brokerage fee or commission which you pay when you buy or sell a stock. For some funds available through Fidelity you are required to pay a transaction fee. However, you will not pay a sales load on Transaction Fee (TF) funds. You will only be charged a transaction fee when you buy a FundsNetwork TF fund, not when you sell one. All other fees and expenses described in a fund's prospectus still apply. You can choose to buy or sell shares directly from the fund itself or its principal underwriter or distributor without paying a transaction fee to Fidelity.Online Transaction Fees:  $49.95 for most funds.  Certain funds will have a transaction fee of $75. To identify any applicable transaction fees associated with the purchase of a given fund, please refer to the "Fees and Distributions" tab.Fidelity Automated Service Telephone (FAST): 25% off representative-assisted rates, Maximum: $187.50, Minimum:$75Representative-Assisted: 0.75% of principal, Maximum: $250, Minimum: $100Automatic Investment: $5 per transaction, after the initial investment.Sales load:A sales charge added to the price of the fund.  Funds have different sales charge structures, including front-end loads, back-end loads (deferred), and no loads. Sales loads can either be charged when a fund is purchased, commonly known as a front-end load, or when a fund is sold, known as a deferred load. Not  all funds charge a load. Refer to the Loads, Expense and Minimums section of the fund's prospectus for details on these amounts. Although no load funds do not have a front-end or deferred load, they may incur other fees, such as a 12b-1 fee.
2. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated.  Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.
3. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
4. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
5. Initial minimum investments into group retirement accounts such as Fidelity Simplified Employee Pension-IRA, Keogh, Self-Employed 401(k), and Non-Fidelity Prototype Retirement accounts are $500 or higher. Additional investments into Regular, IRA, and Group accounts are $250 or higher.
6. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
7. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
8. StyleMap� depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
9. Please note Regional Diversification information is based on the equity components only.


Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.  Although Fidelity believes the data gathered from these third-party sources is reliable, it does not review such information and cannot warrant it to be accurate, complete or timely.  Fidelity is not responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this third-party information.

Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund or annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a free prospectus and, if available, summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

Investment Process
PRIMECAP Management Company utilizes a multiple counselor system in which each portfolio manager independently manages a portion of each Fund or institutional client account.
Portfolio managers use only their highest conviction stock selections in their respective portfolios. Diversification is achieved through the aggregation of each portfolio manager's investment positions. Since portfolio managers choose only their highest conviction ideas for their portfolios, sector allocation often differs substantially from that of the S&P 5001. PRIMECAP Management Company believes that this will provide a superior return over the long term, but in any given year, its results can differ materially from the returns of the S&P 500.
Portfolio managers also provide leadership in the research effort for particular stocks and industry groups. In this regard, the firm's portfolio managers perform in an industry group specialist role similar to that of its financial analysts. To the extent that an individual portfolio manager or financial analyst convinces others of the merits of a particular investment idea, the firm's weighting in that idea may become significant due to the collective ownership by multiple portfolio managers. Historically, this cross-pollination of ideas has led to a fairly concentrated portfolio. The top ten positions typically represent more than 25 percent of the assets in each Fund or institutional client account.
Although PRIMECAP Management Company places a strong emphasis on individual decision-making, its investment professionals do not work in isolation. Portfolio managers and financial analysts benefit from a high degree of interaction, including daily meetings in which they discuss portfolio-related news and information, observations from recent research trips, and investment ideas. In addition, the firm conducts weekly research meetings during which industry updates and investment ideas can be presented and discussed. Each investment professional is a member of the Investment Team, which maintains an "Action List" in which all companies owned in the portfolio are rated "buy", "hold", or "sell". Individual portfolio managers or financial analysts may propose a change or addition to the Action List at any time.
Diversification does not assure a profit or protect against loss in a declining market.
1The S&P 500 is a market capitalization-weighted index of 500 large-capitalization stocks commonly used to represent the U.S. equity market. You cannot invest directly in an index.
