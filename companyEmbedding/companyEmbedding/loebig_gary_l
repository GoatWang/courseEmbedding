Multimedia Games Names Gary L. Loebig Interim President and Chief Executive Officer | Business Wire


























































Multimedia Games Names Gary L. Loebig Interim President and Chief 
      Executive Officer




Company Expects Diluted Earnings Per Share for the Quarter Ended 
      March 31, 2008 to be in a Range of $0.03–$0.05 
      






April 01, 2008 09:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



AUSTIN, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Multimedia Games, Inc. (Nasdaq: MGAM) (“Multimedia”), 
      announced today that Gary L. Loebig, 60, who currently serves as 
      Executive Vice President of Sales, has been named Interim President and 
      Chief Executive Officer of the Company, effective immediately. 
      Clifton E. Lind, 61, who has served as Multimedia’s 
      President and CEO since February 2003 and as a Director since May 2000, 
      is stepping down from those positions to spend more time with his 
      family. Mr. Lind’s departure from the 
      Board of Directors reduces the size of the Board to five members, all of 
      whom are considered “independent” 
      according to the corporate governance rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market. 
      Multimedia Games plans to engage in a search for a permanent CEO. 
      Mr. Lind will continue to serve Multimedia and the Board of Directors in 
      a non-executive capacity during a transition period.
    


      Mr. Loebig joined Multimedia Games as Vice President for New Market 
      Development in December 1998, and was elected Executive Vice President 
      of Sales in December 2001. At Multimedia, Mr. Loebig has been 
      responsible for establishing new market opportunities and managing and 
      maintaining relationships with the Company’s 
      customer base. From 1984 until December 1998, Mr. Loebig served in 
      various capacities at Stuart Entertainment, which does business as Bingo 
      King, a publicly traded company engaged in the manufacture and sale of 
      bingo cards and related equipment and products. At Bingo King, 
      Mr. Loebig began as general sales manager and advanced to the position 
      of Senior Vice President – Market and Product 
      Development. Mr. Loebig received both Bachelor and Master of Business 
      Administration degrees from the University of Iowa.
    

      Michael J. Maples, Sr., Chairman of the Board of Directors, commented, “During 
      his tenure as President and CEO, Clifton contributed greatly to 
      Multimedia Games. Gary Loebig has strong relationships with our 
      employees and customers and is well suited to assume the CEO 
      responsibilities at this time. The Company’s 
      Board remains committed to maximizing shareholder value.”


      The Company also reported that it expects its diluted earnings per share 
      for the quarter ended March 31, 2008 to be in a range of $0.03 – 
      $0.05 before any charges that may result from the CEO transition.

      Cautionary Language
    

      This press release contains forward-looking statements based on 
      Multimedia's current expectations. The words "will," "expect," “believe” 
      and similar words and phrases as they relate to Multimedia and its 
      products and markets are intended to identify such forward-looking 
      statements. In particular, our expectation of quarterly earnings for the 
      quarter ended March 31, 2008, is a forward-looking statement. These 
      forward-looking statements reflect the current views and assumptions of 
      Multimedia, and are subject to various risks and uncertainties that 
      could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. These 
      risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the risk that 
      our preliminary estimate of quarterly earnings may be subject to 
      revision in the course of our quarter-end closing process or adjustments 
      identified by internal financial or external audit personnel. Other 
      important risks and uncertainties that may affect the Company's business 
      are detailed from time to time in the "Certain Risks" and "Risk Factors" 
      sections and elsewhere in Multimedia's filings with the Securities and 
      Exchange Commission. Multimedia disclaims any intention or obligation to 
      update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of 
      new information, future events or otherwise.
