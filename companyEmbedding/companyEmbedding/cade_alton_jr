In 1957, Alton Cade, Jr. joined his dad in the business, helping to oversee the daily operations of a growing company. The store opened in its present location in Mineola, Texas, in 1985. Alton Cade, Jr. became president of the company in 1988 and held that position until his retirement in 2007. The company is currently owned and operated by his daughter, Deborah Cade Nail.Cade's Building Materials consists of a full service lumberyard and hardware store.
