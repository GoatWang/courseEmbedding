Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Carmike Cinemas' 2015 Second Quarter Results Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Monday, July 27, 2015.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Norberto Aja, Investor Relations for Carmike. Please go ahead.
Norberto Aja
Thank you, operator, and good afternoon everyone. Thank you for participating in Carmike's 2015 second quarter conference call. Joining me today on the call are Carmike's President and CEO, David Passman, and Richard Hare, Carmike's’ CFO. Following some prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions.
Before we get started, however, I would like to take a minute to read the Safe Harbor language. Certain statements by Carmike management in today's call may constitute forward looking statements which are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause the Company's actual performance to be materially different from the performance indicated or implied with such statements.
Such risks and uncertainties and other factors are set forth in Carmike's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 and in other SEC filings. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.
Today's call taking place on July 27, 2015 may include non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of the SEC Regulation G. When required, a reconciliation of the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP can be found in today's press release as well as the Company's Web-site.
With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Carmike's President and CEO, David Passman. Please go ahead, David.
S. David Passman III
Thanks, Norberto. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. First, on behalf of the entire Carmike family, I want to express how deeply saddened we are about the tragic incident that took place at Louisiana last week and express our deepest condolences to the families and loved ones of the victims and the members of the local community. We also want to express our gratitude to the first responders as well as theatre personnel for quickly and professionally dealing with the situation.
Now turning to the purpose of this afternoon's call, I will start with a review of our second quarter results and the progress we are making towards our growth strategies and theatre-level initiatives to further enhance long-term shareholder value. Richard will then provide additional details regarding our Q2 results and capital structure, after which we will open the call to your questions.
Carmike's strong operating and financial momentum continues in 2015 as highlighted by our record second quarter performance across several key financial metrics, including solid growth in all revenue sources, adjusted EBITDA and theatre-level cash flow. The ongoing success of our theatre-level initiatives and the continued progress we are achieving in our value-building theatre acquisition and organic growth strategies allowed us to leverage the healthy industry box office to generate all-time quarterly record operating revenues $219 million.

Carmike's second quarter total operating revenue growth of 20% led to a 43% plus improvement in operating income, resulting in the Company's highest ever quarterly adjusted EBITDA and theatre-level cash flow, which increased by over 24% and 25% respectively.
Admissions revenue growth of 17% was significantly exceeded the industry average, reflection of attendance increase of 14% in aggregate and approximately 8.5% on a per screen basis, the per screen metric substantially in line with the industry. As a reminder, Carmike materially outperformed this sector in year-over-year growth by approximately 600 basis points each in both 2014 and 2013, a rather aggressive 1,200 basis point over indexing for the combined period.
We believe the year-to-date performance for Carmike and the sector in general is a positive indication of the overall health of the movie business and reiterates what we and our industry peers believe, that a compelling, diverse and well-spaced slate of high-quality studio film product combined with exhibitors' uniquely immersive entertainment offerings including large-screen digital projection and premium amenities will drive strong and sustainable attendance by bringing customers unrivalled cinema going entertainment experiences.
Notably, Carmike's ongoing success in generating consistent admissions and attendance increase reflects the benefit of our expanded scale through ongoing M&A and organic growth initiatives as well as our Company-wide focus of providing best-in-class theatre-level service.
Similar to the first quarter of 2015, the year-over-year rise in our average screen count of 8% reflects several new build locations as well as the integration of screens acquired from Digiplex in the second half of 2014. Carmike remains focused on advancing the guest experience by increasing our unique services and entertainment offerings. In this regard, we announced a new venture with Fathom Events in May to expand our alternative programming to 150 locations by early 2016, more than half of all Carmike locations. We believe this will help us deliver new entertainment experiences and content options to our customers while also providing us with the potential to drive incremental attendance and revenue over the long-term during non-peak box office periods.
Carmike recently expanded our IMAX relationship with an agreement to add three new IMAX theatres, one each in Missoula and Billings, Montana and a new development project to be announced soon. The agreement brings the first commercial IMAX theatres to moviegoers in Montana and increases Carmike total IMAX commitment to 24 theatres. Our IMAX, Big D and 3-D offerings bring customers more premium presentation choices and help generate revenue and attendance growth across our circuit.
Carmike's record second quarter results also reflect strong growth in concessions and other revenue, which rose 24% year-over-year to an all-time quarterly mark in excess of $84 million. The ongoing success in further development and innovation with food and beverage initiatives drove a 9% increase in concessions and other spending per patron to $4.75. Carmike's record level concessions and other spending per patron marks the 22nd consecutive reporting period of year-over-year growth.
In addition to our existing menu of snacks, candy, popcorn and soda, we have a growing number of locations offering enhanced selections including hot foods such as pizza, hot dogs and chicken tenders among other items. As we mentioned previously, the number of Carmike locations offering beer, wine and other adult beverages stands at roughly 3.5 dozen. We have additional alcohol license applications pending approval with the goal of expanding this service to approximately half of our locations. We're very pleased with the results to-date and are confident that these initiatives can continue to make positive contributions to our growth in revenue and earnings.

We recently launched our third Ovation dine-in complex in Athens, Georgia. Our first two Ovation dine-in locations in Bloomington, Illinois and Richmond, Virginia opened during the first quarter. Customers are responding well to these new locations which feature special amenities including reserved seat, a cocktail and dining lounge and a convenient in-seat service button allowing guests to order from a menu of quality appetizers, entrees, desserts and beverages both before and during the movie.
Our food and beverage diversification initiatives and in-theatre dining strategies are focused on enhancing the overall movie-going experience by creating a unique dining and entertainment environment where our customers may enjoy a full evening out of the home, off-campus or base at an attractive value and from one convenient location.
From an industry perspective, the box office is performing very well with year-over-year domestic box office revenue increases over 20% quarter-to-date and nearly 9% year-to-date. Minions, the prequel to the family-friendly Despicable Me franchise, achieved the best ever opening day and the second highest grossing opening weekend debut for an animated film in North America generating over $250 million in box office revenues quarter-to-date. With many more promising film titles set for release including Mission Impossible 5 and Fantastic Four, we fully expect the favorable box office environment to continue this quarter. We're also optimistic about the overall second half of 2015 with many franchise films and exciting tadpoles on tap for Q4 including Star Wars Episode VII, the James Bond movie Spectre, The Hunger Games Mockingjay Part 2, and others.
As we've previously discussed, we believe growing our footprint through selective acquisitions is one of the most effective ways to optimize our theatre operations and create additional shareholder value. Over the last three years, we've completed the acquisition of approximately 50 theatres' 750 screens, representing more than 25% of today's total screen count. These completed transactions brought further diversification and scale to our operations while delivering visible and quantifiable financial benefits for our Company and its shareholders. We continue to actively pursue opportunities and remain confident in our ability to further execute on additional value building transactions.
We have also been expanding organically both in existing and greenfield locations working with some of the nation's leading commercial developers and REITs and plan to continue on this path. Our new builds typically have between 10 and 14 screens with at least one premium large format screen. We have a very strong balance sheet that includes over $132 million in cash and a recently refinanced capital structure.
Our Board, management team and I remain confident in the Company's prospects to further strategically expand the business by adding roughly 500 screens to our existing platform through acquisitions. We believe our M&A focused capital allocation strategy will deliver increased value and returns for our stakeholders and intend to remain one of the industry's top consolidators.
We're pleased with our record operating performance for the first half, our ability to execute against our theatre-level initiatives and the continued success for the box office environment and remain optimistic that the positive operating environment will continue in the back half of 2015. Richard?
Richard B. Hare
Thank you, David. I'll start with the review of Carmike's second quarter financial results, after which I'll provide an update on our capital structure. For the second quarter, we generated record quarterly total revenues of $219.1 million, 19.7% higher than in Q2 2014, including $135 million of admissions as well as $84 million in concession and other revenues. We are pleased with our admissions revenue for the second quarter which grew 17.3% as attendance grew by 13.8% to over 17.7 million attendees. We're also pleased with our average ticket price of $7.62, a 3.1% increase compared to the year ago period.

We also enjoyed a very healthy performance across our concession segment. This concession and other revenue increased 23.9% year-over-year with concessions and other revenue per patron spend growing 8.9% to $4.75, our highest quarterly concession and other revenue per cap in the Company's history. These results reflect the ongoing focus and high level of success we are achieving in our concessions initiatives including the enhancement and refinement of our food menu and beverage offerings and our ability to implement modest price increases. The combination of both healthy admissions and concession spend led to total second quarter per patron spend of $12.37, an all-time quarterly record, and a 5.3% increase from $11.75 per patron in the second quarter of 2014.
Turning our attention to costs, the largest of our cost inputs, film exhibition cost, rose to $79.3 million representing 58.7% of admissions revenue, an increase of 270 basis points compared to the same period last year. The increase was due to significant increase in the box office concentration of top-performing titles. As a reminder, film rent trends to be higher during periods where top-performing titles represent a larger percentage of the total box office and this was certainly the case in the second quarter as the top five films represented over 55% of the industry's box office in Q2 2015, and the top five titles represented only 38% of the industry box office in Q2 2014.
Concession cost as a percentage of concessions and other revenue decreased by 20 basis points from 11.8% in the second quarter of 2014 to 11.6% in the second quarter of 2015. The year-over-year decline is primarily attributable to lower supply costs.
Our theatre-level expense categories increased during the quarter, primarily resulting from our expanded circuit following recent acquisitions and new build-to-suit theatre openings. Salaries and benefits rose $2.6 million to $26.1 million but declined as a percentage of total operating revenues to 11.9% versus 12.8% a year ago. Theatre occupancy cost increased $2.9 million to $23.9 million in Q2 2015, while other theatre operating costs increased $4.5 million to $33.1 million in Q2 2015.
Our operating leverage was clearly demonstrated in the second quarter of 2015 as our three primary operating expense categories as a percentage of total operating revenues was 37.9%, a decrease of 200 basis points over the prior year. As a result, second quarter operating income rose 43.5% to $26.9 million compared to $18.7 million in the year ago period. Operating income margin improved 210 basis points to 12.3% compared to the year ago period.
General and administrative expenses were $8.2 million, which included a $1.2 million of non-cash share-based compensation and $800 million of merger and acquisition related costs. Depreciation and amortization expense was $13.7 million, which reflects the increased circuit size following our acquisition of Digiplex in 2014. Quarterly interest expense in 2015 decreased to $12.6 million as a result of slightly lower balances in capital leases and financing obligations. Following the refinancing of our senior secured notes in June of 2015, interest expense is expected to approximate $50 million on an annual basis.
In addition, we recorded a $2.3 million gain on the sale of property and equipment, recognized an approximate $500,000 impairment charge on long-lived assets and recorded income of $600,000 from unconsolidated affiliates with the majority attributable to our profits interest in Screenvision.
As a result of our recent debt financing, we incurred $17.6 million of debt extinguishment costs related to the termination of our $210 million 7.375% senior secured notes due 2019, including a prepayment premium of $11.6 million. The refinancing has afforded us both a maturity extension as well as a slight increase in borrowing capacity and is expected to yield approximately $1.7 million of annual interest expense savings through 2023. We recorded an income tax benefit of $1.3 million during the second quarter of 2015, due primarily to our debt extinguishment charges. We recorded income tax expense of $2.4 million in the second quarter of 2014.

Combined, these factors led to a net loss of $1.4 million or a loss of $0.06 per share on a diluted basis for the second quarter. This compares to net income of $3.2 million or $0.14 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2014. Eliminating debt extinguishment costs and other one-time expenses, on an adjusted basis we generated net income of $8.8 million or $0.36 per diluted share.
Theatre-level cash flow rose 25.1% to $47 million and adjusted EBITDA expanded 24.4% to $40.8 million. Year-to-date, Carmike generated theatre-level cash flow and adjusted EBITDA of $82.5 million and $70.6 million respectively reflecting the success of our initiatives and an overall health of our business. Reconciliations of these two non-GAAP measures are provided in today's press release which is also posted on our Web-site.
Turning to our balance sheet, Carmike had cash and cash equivalents of $132.8 million at June 30, 2015 as second quarter cap expenditures were $27.1 million primarily related to the recently constructed build-to-suit theatres, the conversion of certain traditional theatres to our casual in-theatre dining concept and theatre renovations. Our full year 2015 CapEx guidance of approximately $60 million remains unchanged and we continue to expect they will be approximately equally divided across new build projects, full-service casual dining theatres, remodels including premium large format auditorium construction and maintenance CapEx and IT expenditures.
As it relates to new builds, during the first six months of the year we opened two new theatres with a total of 22 screens. We also completed the renovation of a third theatre to include our Ovation dine-in concept. Going forward, we anticipate opening up four new build-to-suit theatres during the balance of 2015 and intend to include one large format auditorium in each of our new build-to-suit theatres.
In June of 2015, we completed refinancing of our $210 million 7.375% senior secured notes that were due in 2019. We replaced these notes with $230 million 6% senior secured notes maturing in 2023. In conjunction with the issuance of the $230 million senior secured notes, we entered into a $50 million revolving credit facility which replaced our $25 million revolving credit facility.
Reflecting cash of $132.8 million at June 30, 2015 in our recent refinancing, we ended the second quarter with $326.6 million of net debt compared with $347.5 million at December 31, 2014. In total, debt outstanding including the capital leases and long-term financing obligations plus our senior notes due 2023 was $459.4 million. For covenant reporting purposes, gross leverage was approximately 3.8x and net leverage was approximately 2.7x on a trailing 12-month basis at the end of June 2015.
In summary, our attention continues to focus on expanding our theatre circuit through accretive acquisitions and new locations through build-to-suit arrangements. Our improving operating metrics including growth in adjusted EBITDA demonstrate our recent success with this strategy and we believe that our current capital structure has positioned us well for the future.
With that, I'd like to open the call up for questions. Operator?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of David Miller with Topeka Capital Markets. Please proceed.
David Miller
I probably speak for most of the folks on this call, buy side or sell side, when I say that the overall bullish thesis on you guys is and has always been that you'll continue to kind of clock it on perhaps with regard to dining per caps, that you'll always outperform the general market or at least meet it like you did in the second quarter, but cost just seemed to be an issue two out of four quarters on average. This time it was rents which was inexorably high and then other theatre OpEx. I'm just wondering why there wasn't more operating leverage on the other theatre OpEx category just given your higher screen count. I would have thought you guys would have been able to kind of smooth that out a little bit more given that you guys have 220 or so more screens than you did last year, and then I have a follow-up, thanks.

Richard B. Hare
David, let me address those two points. On film rent, there was certainly a larger concentration this quarter of top-performing titles generating more box office than the previous year and we expect there to be pressure on film this year with the slate performing the way it is but the second quarter's concentration was very high, and as you know we've had these scale ranges in place for a very long time and so when the box office generates these record levels, these scale agreements come into play and our film rate is somewhat higher, and there certainly was pressure on that metric in the second quarter.
With regard to theatre cost itself, if you look at where we ended up, if you combine all of the three components of theatre cost, we started out last year baseline around $73 million and then we got Digiplex runs about $6 million a quarter and new builds are about $2 million a quarter. So you kind of bake in around $81 million or so as a normalized run rate. And quite frankly the 3-D as a percentage of the box office was up to around 21.5% and it was fairly – excuse me, our premium box office was around 21.5%, so that includes 3-D and IMAX and Big D, et cetera, and last year it was only around 16.8%.
So we had not $1 million but it was close to it and additional large screen format type experiences that we would expect to pay, and then the rest of the balance is just going to be increased salaries as it relates to higher attendance and a little bit more in repair costs. So, we did see some significant improvement in our operating leverage and our EBITDA margins and we expect to continue to see that on a going forward basis this year with this type of box office.
David Miller
So film exhibition cost at close to 59%, is that generally a pattern that we should model for the third and fourth quarters in your opinion?
Richard B. Hare
In my opinion, I would expect to see more pressure on that line item but I don't think based on what I'm reading about the third quarter and the projections out there for movies, I don't think that concentration will be as concentrated in the third quarter as it was in the second quarter. And in the fourth quarter, it might be a little bit more pressure but this second quarter was – these concentration levels were very high and we certainly haven't seen anything like that in the past.
David Miller
Okay. And then final question, are you guys spending any dollars that you're expensing on the old Muvico and Digiplex assets now on certain categories that will moderate in the next say two, three, four quarters, any categories that should soften with regard to getting those assets up to snuff, up to your standards?
Richard B. Hare
No, I would just say we baked in $60 million of total CapEx for the year and we feel comfortable with that and the normal repair and maintenance I wouldn't expect anything unusual for Digiplex or Muvico or the circuit in general.
David Miller
All right, thank you very much.
Operator
Our next question is from James Marsh with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.
James Marsh
I guess I just want to follow-up on that film rental question and just get your sense on whether this is just a cyclical issue or a secular issue because it seems like the studios want to focus on fewer bigger films which would hit the tops of the scales that you talked about there, Richard, so obviously they're going to continue to move in that direction, maybe it starts to shift towards just the bigger films doing bigger box office and your numbers just stay sustainably higher up there. What's your take on that?
Richard B. Hare
I would just say, if you go back and look at the titles in the second quarter and how Jurassic World, Avengers, Fast & Furious, and to a lesser degree Inside Out and Pitch Perfect performed, and look at how Captain America, Transformers [indiscernible] and X-Men last year did, we expect to see an increase in film rent during the year but in the second quarter you had more. But if you look back at it, I'm trying to pull my numbers to see how these specific ones did, but the gross box office for Jurassic World is over $500 million, Avengers was over $400 million and Fast & Furious was over $300 million, and last year you didn't have any over $300 million. So that's just a function of the math on the scale deals. I would expect us to continue to see some pressure on that line item during the year but I wouldn't expect it to be to that level in the third quarter.

S. David Passman III
Let me just add just a tad to that, James. The number one film for the second quarter 2015 did twice, did 200% of what the number one film did in 2014. That $500 million movie in most of these major studios with their major tadpoles are of scale deals which we've discussed many times in the past, but as the movie does better, particularly when it's a $500 million movie or like Avengers which was $450 million movie, film rent goes up, it goes up proportionate to the amount that the movie does.
Last year, if you just compare in the second quarter, I believe that the highest grossing film for the entire second quarter last year was $257 million Avengers, or Captain America I'm sorry, and this year the top three films were over $300 million each, and that is going to bring with it some higher film rent just because of the scale, and I guess we cry all the way to the bank when it's all said and done.
James Marsh
Yes. I guess my question is really, is this what the studios are trying to do, are they doing fewer bigger films and your model just changes now and maybe you need to start looking at either having an equity interest in those films like Open Road or focusing more on concession growth, just share with the studios, but it would seem to me that's more of a secular nature and you guys should have a plan to kind of get around it?
S. David Passman III
I guess that's certainly an avenue worth talking about but I dare say Open Road didn't got to have a $500 million movie and it spreads by having more movie product available, which by the way there are several new studios that are trying to fill that gap where some of these major studios have abandoned the middle market and in favor of the very, very large tadpole movies. I think what you're suggesting is, the more product we have the lower the average film rent is going to be because the less or the greater the percentage of movies that won't be in that $400 million and $500 million event, and again we are not complaining about three movies doing in excess of $300 million this quarter, we're actually quite pleased that we had three movies to that kind of volume, a heck of a lot better than a year ago even with higher film rent.
James Marsh
Yes, but there's no operating leverage, that's the problem. As you get to 20% revenue growth and you did 24% EBITDA growth and one of the big factors was you paid 56% last year and you paid 59% film rental this year. So I wouldn't be saying, you laughed all the way to the bank. I'd like to see more operating leverage. But anyway I'll let the next question in the queue go, but thank you guys.
Operator
Our next question is from Eric Wold with B. Riley. Please proceed.
Eric Wold
A couple of questions. One, kind of follow-up on margin but just more so kind of thinking other than film rent which is I guess somewhat out of your control kind of with the line items that you can control, your field of operating expenses, G&A, kind of what is your target margin [over the coming year] [ph], just where you're going to get more leverage out of that from the lines you can control more effectively?
Richard B. Hare
I'd say on the G&A side, typically that's kind of flat. It runs around $6 million when you back up the M&A and the stock-based comp expense, and that's kind of historical. And then if you look at our other cost and our theatre cost, we're kind of where we thought they would be. We had a little bit incremental expenses related to the large screen format screens but that's just part of the – we got the revenue pickup on that. So we had a little bit, slightly more, maybe $400,000 or so more of salary expense year-over-year but we had a lot more attendance as well. So we were pleased with the 18.6% adjusted EBITDA margins, we were up last quarter as well and we would expect them to continue to improve during the year with this kind of box office.

Eric Wold
Okay, now on the acquisition front, I know you're gradually looking for targets, it obviously takes willing sellers to get a transaction done, how willing would you characterize the seller market right now? Can you talk about any of your discussions as being on the go line? And then lastly, were you considering Starplex ahead of AMC making that acquisition?
S. David Passman III
With regard to where we're at in discussions with folks, we can't comment as to where or how close to the go line we are. We just make it a practice not to comment on pending discussions. But I will say, we are actively discussing with a number of sellers and I think if you take a look at sellers' motivations, they would have the same motivations today they had six months ago, and that is as the big circuits get bigger, the smaller circuits by definition as a percentage of the total are getting smaller, and that's a little disconcerting to them. We really believe that they are looking to avoid another round of investment on additional amenities or technology upgrades or those type things and when we look at our industry, I think I said in my prepared remarks that we believe we can expand another 500 screens with current capital structure that we have and cash available.
If you take a look at the industry, you've heard me say this a gazillion times, the top four circuits control 50% of the U.S. screen count. The next 50 exhibitors own between 8,000 and 9,000 screens. We're looking to acquire about 500. We really don't believe that that's an overly aggressive goal to shoot for in the foreseeable future. It does require patience, it does require tenacity in these discussions but they will occur. I think most recent case in point was the Starplex announcement, good looking circuit, nearly three dozen locations, I think 75% of those are first-run theatres, and for AMC with what it was looking to do, we applaud them on the acquisition. We're not going to discuss where we were at in that process but we think it like many of the regional circuits, it's available and it will transact.
Eric Wold
Perfect. Thank you.
Operator
We have a question from Jeff Logsdon with JBL Advisors. Please proceed.
Jeffrey Logsdon
I won't beat the dead horse again but I'll ask it a little bit differently, is anybody at any film level of revenue getting more than 62% in film rentals?
S. David Passman III
Jeff, that's a difficult question for us to answer because we're not privy to what everybody else pays for film rent. That's on an individual theatre by theatre and studio by studio discussion or negotiation. So I really couldn't as we guessed on…
Jeffrey Logsdon
And can we just turn that towards you guys? Are there any films that are getting more than 62% rentals this past quarter? You don't have to identify the film but [indiscernible].
S. David Passman III
Unfortunately, Jeff, we don't discuss or disclose what individual films cost us and we really don't want to start now.
Jeffrey Logsdon
Okay, alright, that's fair. Is there a percentage of your workforce that is at the minimum wage level and will any changes that are on that, is that going to change the G&A cost much? I mean obviously [indiscernible].
S. David Passman III
Yes – I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you.
Jeffrey Logsdon
'No, it's okay.
S. David Passman III
We employ about 9,000 folks, 75 or so percentage of those are high school and college or retired folks and the lion's share of those, more than 50% of those are paid beginning wages at minimum. So depending on what state we're in or whether they are under the federal rules, we've got a very large percentage that would be at the minimum wage and we have gone through and taken a look at and tried to postulate on what minimum wage laws are going to look like in the future, I think I would just say that we adjust our cost structure as necessary for government regulations and we adjust our pricing to compensate for that or to make-up for any of that increased cost.

Jeffrey Logsdon
Same question then really around healthcare and healthcare costs.
Richard B. Hare
The healthcare cost, we kind of implemented it already and it's been very minimal on Carmike. So that's everything that everybody is – the whole industry, it's not just us, has kind of incorporated and made adjustments in how we manage hours and people and we don't think it's a significant impact on us.
Jeffrey Logsdon
Just lastly, if you can talk about Screenvision, the advertising environment and now that they will remain independent, how we should view that investment going forward?
S. David Passman III
I think I've said on the last couple of calls after the NCM-Screenvision transaction was terminated that Screenvision is keeping on business as usual but during the period that it was in limbo, while the Justice Department was reviewing the transaction, they lost some key employees and we are for lack of a better term in a rebuilding mode as we speak. And I use the term 'we' only because I serve on the Board of Directors of Screenvision. Carmike does not actively manage any of the operations for Screenvision or with Screenvision.
We are in a search, have an excellent search firm working to find a new CEO and the candidate pool that we have, and I've interviewed several of the candidates for that, is nothing short of outstanding. I expect that in the very near term Screenvision will be announcing the hiring of a CEO and that will be followed pretty quickly by some key sales and other positions, particularly the revenue position or Chief Revenue Officer.
Screenvision is alive and well, it's doing just fine. The advertising market is a pretty good one right now as you would expect with the great slate that we have for 2015 and expected for 2016. So we're only expecting improvements in the future with Screenvision.
Operator
We have a question from Jim Goss with Barrington Research. Please proceed.
Jim Goss
First, the slight decline in theatres and screens in the latest quarter, was that just the way the lease renewals happen to work out or is that the sort of organic trend you'd expect potentially offset by whatever acquisitions you are able to make?
Richard B. Hare
They were just basically our normal theatre closures, nothing out of the ordinary there. I think we closed three locations, 25 screens.
Jim Goss
Okay. And in terms of the notion that some of your acquisitions could be occurring in the second half, is there any sense that there was some rather sense to do any deals in the first half because of the huge movies coming out and that we're getting to the stage where that might not be as much of an issue going forward?
S. David Passman III
I'll defer to other peers in the industry, Jim, but from Carmike's perspective we were as active in discussions and negotiations in the first quarter this year as we were in any quarter in the last eight quarters.
Jim Goss
Okay. So it's still just a matter of when things happen?
S. David Passman III
Yes. I wish we could control that piece of the equation but unfortunately with every transaction there is a buyer and a seller and we only represent one of those parties.
Jim Goss
Okay. Regarding your POS strategy, I think you did shift a couple of the Big Ds to IMAX and I'm wondering what's your strategy is there going forward and are you thinking that you'll eventually roll through a pretty high share of your existing platform to put in a POS screen if it doesn't exist in the existing infrastructure?
S. David Passman III
With regard to the IMAX relationship, that was a two-party agreement and IMAX had targeted several of our markets in the past, and when we inherited the relationship I believe with our first Rave acquisition, we began discussing with them what their strategy was across the U.S. in what markets, and they identified several markets where Carmike had existing large-format screens, and as we negotiated for what now has become 24 separate IMAX locations, there were some give and take in various markets, in some we converted from a Big D to an IMAX screen and in some we added a Big D to an IMAX and in others we simply are doing new builds with an IMAX in desired markets for them.

Suffice it to say that all things being equal, in any particular market if we have an opportunity for an IMAX screen, we are going to take it very, very seriously because it is indisputable that IMAX draws foot traffic, it increases attendance, and if you're going to be in a market that would support an IMAX screen, the chances are there will be a competitor in that market and we would certainly prefer to have it be Carmike that gets that additional foot traffic.
Jim Goss
Alright, that's a great endorsement. And then lastly, related to Fathom, I was wondering what the terms are of your expanded agreement with them. I noticed one of your existing theatres had Carmike classic movies or Carmike classic films which struck me as the same sort of thing Cinemark has been doing. So I imagine it's a similar program. So how does that work in terms of your relationship economically speaking? And if you might add to that the alternative content share of total, where that stands these days?
S. David Passman III
The classics that we're doing are proprietary, they are not normally with the Fathom Events, but we are looking to have a fairly large number of Fathom Events, particularly in 2016 as we get these things rolled out. But the Metropolitan, Opera and things like that that Fathom does exclusive, we really want to participate in. So that kind of gave rise to the Fathom agreement.
The classics and other alternative programming and content that we're doing, we're hoping to have rolled out in at least that many theatres as well. And I think in the second quarter we're still tethering in the 1% to 1.5% of box office. So these are still the early days for alternative programming but we're quite optimistic and very bullish on what it will look like.
Jim Goss
Alright, thanks very much.

Our next question is from Chad Beynon with Macquarie. Please proceed.
Chad Beynon
First one I have with respect to accretive acquisitions, your equity is now trading at EV multiples that we haven't seen in a few years on the back of some industry-specific concerns and obviously the overall market pullback. So with that in mind, how do you think about different ways of capital allocation if the M&A market isn't as opportunistic as you see it now with respect to buybacks?
S. David Passman III
We went through a lot of trouble to issue equity and get cash on our balance sheet so that we could pursue acquisitions. We're not ready to throw in the towel on M&A. And I think as I said a little earlier, we see 500 screens as a reasonable, realistic and timely target. So if that changes we'll certainly consider things like dividends or stock buyback, but we really don't expect that to change.
Chad Beynon
Okay, thank you. Next question I had is with respect to just kind of the overall moviegoer audience in light of a very high attendance quarter, so I guess firstly, did you see a significant increase in your new Rewards members, and what I'm getting at, are you seeing the same people coming back and watching Jurassic Park and Avengers multiple times or you getting people getting off their couches who haven't come to the theatre in a long time? And then maybe if you could add onto that, what you're seeing with kind of the teenage group given that the summer is a critically important time?
S. David Passman III
Unfortunately, and I'm embarrassed to say this, but unfortunately we don't know an awful lot about the customers that are not Reward customers. As you know with the privacy rules, we're not allowed to capture information except for those who are willing to share it with us, and I dare say more don't share than do.
Having said that, yes, we are happy with what we see in terms of repeat business and I would say that avid moviegoers are the primary driver of our attendance in basically all of 2015, but the teens and the tweens were terrific for Jurassic Park and Inside Out. I believe we're going to see a lot of people between your age and mine at Mission Impossible 5, and then revert back to the 18 to 30 year old for most of the rest of the movies this year. Man from U.N.C.L.E., I'm a little uncertain as to whether those are going to be all my age group or between yours and mine, for those who remember Man from U.N.C.L.E.

But I really can't do anything more than speculate as to who is coming that's driving the increased attendance. I can tell you though that we get on our Facebook page and Web-site an awful lot of folks who say they've seen it more than one time and I think that was just because of the quality of the movie and they wanted to share with friends and family.
Chad Beynon
Okay. And the last one if I may, Richard, you mentioned that these scale agreements have been in place with the studios for some time. Is there an opportunity to renegotiate these just given that Carmike of today is significantly different from a quality and size standpoint from maybe what the Company looked like when these negotiations were put in place?
Richard B. Hare
These conversations are confidential between Carmike and the studios. The reason I really wanted to prefix my remarks by saying they've been in place for some time, there were some media reports earlier in the year that indicated that some exhibitors had changed their scale agreements and I wanted you and the market to know that these have been in place over a long period of time.
Chad Beynon
Okay, appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question is from Mike Hickey with The Benchmark Company. Please proceed.
Michael Hickey
Pretty deep in the queue here, forgive me if these have been asked in part, but obviously a few of us here are looking at 2016 and it appears on the surface at least a more difficult environment for the markets to grow. And so curious of how you guys are thinking about your cost side, your fixed expense, into that environment as you look forward in terms of where you can reduce some of your fixed costs, that would be helpful, thank you.
Richard B. Hare
Let me start with our cost structure and then if David wants to supplement with anything about the 2016 slate. We don't foresee any changes in our – let's talk about our cost structure in two categories, on the G&A side and then theatre cost side. Our G&A side has been running at a normalized run rate around $6 million for some time now. It has not increased as a result of our circuit increasing. So we feel confident and pretty comfortable where we are with regard to G&A cost.
Then if you look at our theatre cost, the theatre cost has basically been running at these levels since we've expanded the circuit. And what I mean by that is, you just take our baseline and you add the additional Digiplex fixed costs and our new build fixed cost, that's basically it. You've got a few other variances but nothing substantial.
So we don't see the cost structure in our business or in other exhibitors' business changing significantly. It's a highly fixed cost environment. Around 70% to 80% of our costs are fixed and we can take cost in salaries or other areas, we certainly will do that to be more efficient, but we feel very confident about our structure.
S. David Passman III
Mike, in terms of the slate for 2016, I mean we need to all temper our thinking here a bit. If 2015 ends up at what most of you on this call are predicting to be at $11.2 billion, or possibly even $11.3 billion year, an historic high, I don't think it's realistic to assume that that is a growth rate in overall box office that is going to straight-line into infinity. If we retract in 2016 as an industry all the way back to 2013 and only do $10.95 billion, that's still going to be a pretty darker year. And right now I don't think that's an unrealistic possibility for 2016. If you take a look at the movies that are slated for 2016 through basically 2019, there are going to be some great movie years ahead of us.
So I think what that says is that we have a fairly consistent, fairly predictable, within a range of several hundred basis points, good strong movie-going attendance and box office that we can make decent profits on. The way that Carmike – and we don't see our EBITDA margin improving dramatically over what it's going to be this year. The way for us to improve the EBITDA dollars, the net margin dollars is through M&A activities and that why we believe that our strategy is a good one and making acquisitions and getting EBITDA growth, dollar growth through M&A activities rather than through cost-cutting or unrealistic expectations about box office increases. Does that make sense?

Michael Hickey
Yes, David, thanks. I appreciate it. There's obviously a backdrop in my next question with the recent executive turnover at one of your competitors, and I ask this with the utmost respect but I was hoping, David, you could take a moment to reset with us your passion to continue to run the business. Obviously, you and your team have created tremendous shareholder value, it's been an incredible turnaround, but now perhaps the environment is finally more difficult to perhaps the challenges that you'll face for continued growth of change. So your thoughts there would be wonderful.
S. David Passman III
You bet. I'll start with the conclusion, I don't plan on going anywhere. I'm having the time of my life. And I think the more challenges we have in our industry, although at times they are very, very difficult, the more opportunities there are in our industry. Mike, I don't think you were following us back in 2009 when I first came onboard full-time, but our concessions per cap were under $3 as I recall. If they weren't under $3, they were right around $3. And today in this quarter they were $4.75, a dramatic improvement to our operating cash flow and the thing that we can control which is consumer spending money at our concession stand and the profit that we get from that.
Movie slate is going to change year in and year out, there will be some good years and some bad years, but even the bad years are still going to be tolerable and able to provide enough revenue for us at the box office to be able to make good returns for our shareholders. And I really look forward to the things, the innovation that we're working on, the dine-in concept that we've got, the alternative programming, and of course M&A which is kind of a treat that I've had for the last couple of decades that I just love doing M&A, M&A that makes sense of course, but I love doing M&A and I see that in our foreseeable future.
Michael Hickey
Thank you, David. Good luck, guys.
Operator
We have a question from Leo Kulp with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Leo Kulp
Just on the potential seller side, it sounds to us like some of the equipment manufacturers, CD manufacturers in particular, are now offering financing to smaller circuits to help fund upgrades for premium offerings. Do you see that dampening the need for smaller circuits to sell? And then also on the M&A side, if the box office is down 2% to 3%, is that going to change the desire of sellers to potentially sell?
S. David Passman III
I think the answer to both of those questions is the same actually, and they are very directly related. Getting financing is one thing, having to repay the loans is another thing, and what you have to guarantee in some cases and whether it's recourse or nonrecourse in some cases is a big, big question for an independent theatre [indiscernible].
When our industry six years or seven years ago began converting to digital projection, financing wasn't all that difficult to obtain. What was difficult to obtain was nonrecourse financing and those projectors were not cheap and many independent exhibitors had to borrow money and put mortgages on their homes or guarantee loans for the down payment on those projectors. And for an independent who had never previously had to guarantee loans, that was a big deal. I see seating, I see the challenges of the future, all of that stuff for independents as being more difficult than even when they converted to projection.
So all the amenities that we are adding out of cash flow for re-seating or for dine-in conversions, we're able to do without having to increase our debt capacity, and a lot of these regional guys now having to take previously spendable profits and pour that back into their businesses. So I would say that now is a good time from a seller's perspective to be in teams of people like Carmike about exiting the industry while it's got a great [indiscernible].

Leo Kulp
Okay. And then do you think if the box office is down 2% to 3%, does that sort of flow through on the EBITDA line drive incremental sellers or shouldn't have a lot of impact?
S. David Passman III
I think it's the same kind of thing that a down box office – a seller of course always wants to sell at the peak. Any time you have a home and you want to upgrade to a new home, you want to try to sell at the peak and buy at the low. As the industry may temper a bit next year, I would think that a lot of sellers would be motivated to have discussions now rather than wait, and if they do wait then what would the subsequent year look like. So we are at an historic all-time high and I think that is going to probably be the high watermark for the next year or two. And if I were ever thinking about selling, I think I would be wanting to have discussions today rather than wait till it tempers a bit.
Leo Kulp
Got it. Thank you very much.
Operator
I believe that's all the time we have for questions today. I will now turn the call back to David Passman, CEO.
S. David Passman III
Thank you. In closing, I just want to take an opportunity to thank the very talented and dedicated team of associates we have across the Carmike circuit. Their work really drove our success in the second quarter, as it does in every quarter. We look forward to speaking with you again when we report Carmike's 2015 third quarter results later this year. Have a good evening.

Carmike's new direction: Veteran executives reinvigorate pioneering U.S. theatre circuit

“I am a movie junkie, as is my wife,” admits David Passman, the newly appointed president and chief executive officer of Carmike Cinemas Inc. Passman, a respected fixture on the Columbus, Georgia-based circuit’s board since June 2003, had been serving as its chairman since January. That position is now held by Roland C. Smith, a seven-year board veteran who counts president and chief executive officer of Wendy’s/Arby’s Group, Inc. among his other responsibilities.
“When the opportunity to join the Carmike board first presented itself back in 2003, it was quite easy for me to decide,” Passman recalls about his reasons for joining a motion picture exhibitor that at last count operated 249 theatres with 2,288 screens (www.carmike.com). 
During that time, his financial background made him a commodity “as an independent candidate for board positions,” he explains. “I got to interview a lot of public companies but…navigated in the general direction of entertainment… Secondly, as Carmike had just emerged from bankruptcy, from a legal-liability, fiduciary-responsibility, preservation-of-personal-wealth standpoint, it was a fairly safe thing to do, because Carmike was starting with a clean slate. Frankly speaking, my due diligence was a lot easier that way.” Thirdly, he “wanted a middle-market company that wasn’t a dominant player already [but instead] provided the opportunity to grow with them and offered something that I could make an impact on.”
Passman’s announcement that senior VP, general counsel and secretary Lee Champion was sitting in on his conversation with Film Journal International had its own impact on this author, who had never had a legal eagle present in his many years of reporting. I assumed it was all about watching the all-important forward-looking statements as a publicly traded company (see disclaimer below). “That’s not why Lee’s here,” Passman insisted. “Lee’s part of my executive team.” Chief operating officer Fred Van Noy and chief financial officer Richard B. Hare also joined the interview.
Thankfully, the presence of legal counsel had nothing to do with the author’s reputation either. “Not at all,” Passman laughed, “I have been advised that this would be a very pleasant experience.” He said he and his team selected FJI specifically to share the news about changes at the company. “Within our exhibition industry,” he notes, “Carmike has been kind of a silent player… We have not been involved on industry matters as much as our size would dictate. My message to the industry would be: ‘Carmike is back’ and Carmike is going to be a good industry player and partner to other exhibitors.”
As a company player, Passman sets the tone on partnership as well. “First and foremost, let me restate ‘running’ the company to ‘leading’ it,” he clarifies. “The reason why I’ve got three gentlemen in this room with me is that I’m not running the company, we all are. The leadership change that has recently occurred is not to indict the management, it’s rather to say that change was needed. The board and I believed and continue to believe…that we have very good leadership within the Carmike management team.”
Having said that, Passman tells our readers “that there is not an awful lot of change in strategy that is needed at Carmike, but a sharper focus on attention to detail” instead. “We are still going through a strategic review to determine how many theatres we want to have over what period of time in order to make this circuit all that it can be. Everything is on the table,” he confirms, “from shutting down underperforming theatres, to building more aggressively new theatres, to acquiring smaller circuits, to additional financing and re-financings, public offerings and all that. Everything is under study strategically until we come up with a plan that we are ready to publish.”
Touching on just one of the options, “Yes, you can absolutely grow in [smaller] markets,” Passman affirms. “Small-town America is a wonderful marketplace for us in two respects. One is that each of the communities that we target are not big enough and don’t look to become big enough to warrant a lot of competition. Secondly, there are still many communities across America where people have to drive up to an hour to see a movie. Those are very attractive markets for us.”
“The core focus of our business model has always been and still is to stay in the small- to mid-markets, “concurs CEO Fred Van Noy. “Going through the unfortunate process of Chapter 11 reorganization did not cause us to move away from that model. That [situation] was more a function of the stadium-seating revolution that changed our entire industry” than the actual location of the theatres. “I’m not trying to pat ourselves on the back here, but we are the experts in small-town operations. We understand the markets and have plenty of experience to prove it.” While Carmike has theatres in several major cities as well, “we have opened or are under construction with five new theatres in small markets that are doing very well. We see no reason to move outside of that model.” 
As the first circuit to fully deploy d-cinema on a large scale in partnership with Christie Digital and Cinedigm, “we are completely done and there is nothing more for us to do,” Van Noy enthuses. “We’re very pleased with the decision and the systems.” With the rollout, including some 500 digital 3D installations, “absolutely behind us,” he affirms, “now our job is to capitalize on the new technology and open all the doors that we feel this opportunity provides us with.” While there is “not one regret” to be had about going with DLP Cinema, utilizing the technology in new ways and working with alternative content “is a work in progress from now ’til who-knows-when.” Although Carmike is trying out “every bit of content that we can get our hands on,” he feels, “at this point we are just scratching the surface.” 
Ranking number four circuit-wide in terms of 2008 box-office performance, while not even scratching the top ten nationwide, the Hannah Montana 3D concert movie is proof positive, Van Noy says. “This solidifies what we can do with the technology and demonstrates the material effect that pushing that door open can have by capitalizing on something that is hot and new.” Big-time and big-city entertainment on the small-town big screen sounds like a promising proposition indeed. In the long term, he predicts, “It is about changing the consumer mindset from a theatre-down-the-street to an entertainment complex that offers more product outside of the movies.”
“If we have a six-screen theatre in Village Ville,” he says, illustrating another benefit, “there are certain movies that are perhaps not worth the gamble of taking up that limited screen space. While it is an absolute no-brainer to play the large platform pictures, it’s somewhat harder to try out a movie that traditionally doesn’t play in that type of market.” With digital technology, however, “the flexibility allows us to test a lot more different product, thereby potentially increasing attendance and widening the spectrum of moviegoing.”
In fact, showing “art-type feature presentations in select locations” becomes as simple as “beaming them in over satellite,” Passman adds. “I am really excited with regards to digital that we have an avenue to do things in our complexes that we could not while showing celluloid film only. We can do real-time business conferences, church programs, concerts and live sports.”
The latter by the way, are possible “in three-dimensional, total-immersion viewing,” Passman reminds, citing the BCS Championship back in January. “Shown on only three percent of our available screens, it became our number-one grossing performer for the entire circuit on that Thursday night.” For Passman, it is all about “better utilization of those massive structures that the industry has built. We have 2,200 of them ourselves and we want to use them better.” With digital technology, “we see a lot of upside potential to get more patrons to more of our locations and more frequently.” 
“We had the first-mover advantage with this fantastic technology,” confirms chief financial officer Richard Hare about the off-balance-sheet financing with minimal investment on Carmike’s part. “In essence, we are leasing the equipment. In addition to paying an annual maintenance fee, our out-of-pocket cost was for the installation and prep work at our theatres.” Though he doesn’t address whether the investors were happy about this financially prudent way of going digital—we’ll just assume they never are—Hare will attest that “the investment community was pleased with the results of our first quarter.” Carmike had increases in EBITDA, in adjusted and net incomes as well. “We had a very strong quarter as we continued to de-lever the business. In addition to the industry upswing in box office, we lowered our debt and strengthened our balance sheet. Over the past 12 months we’ve paid down about $30 million worth of our debt, and as we go on to make improvements in our operations and in our overhead, we’ll see that reflected in our stock price.”
“Carmike’s performance kind of lagged the industry a bit over the past couple of years,” Passman notes, just as he did at the annual shareholders meeting. “The company’s operating performance lag resulted in our stock prices dropping rather dramatically. What I believe happened is that our stockholders had lost confidence in our ability to generate meaningful and sustainable profitability.” After all, “No one questioned our strategy on digital, no one questioned our circuit strategy on building in markets with limited competition, but people were questioning our ability to just be paying attention to the details.” Consequently, Passman has set out “what our new marching orders are.”
Admittedly, “we took our eyes off the ball in the past, but we’re putting them back where they belong. Frankly, details matter. If a patron comes into the theatre and isn’t greeted by a friendly face and isn’t thanked for his or her business, if they have to stand in line at the concession stand after the movie starts and go into a restroom finding it to be less than clean…he or she isn’t probably all that inclined to want to come back to our theatre.” This said, “by making a few changes in select locations over just a really short period of time,” Passman “has seen that the attendance and concession unit sales increase in direct proportion to the cleanliness and the friendliness of the environment that the patron experiences.”
With attention to detail revived, Passman names “the biggest challenge right now for Carmike as a company is returning to certainty in leadership. If you want to run a really good company, the troops have to have faith in their leadership and they need to know consistent leadership. If you have a ‘Flavor of the Month Club,’ where you are always issuing a new strategic direction for the company, employees get callused to any kind of change. For us as the leadership team, the challenge then becomes to instill that degree of confidence. The direction we are headed is a straight line, not a jagged one: We are really serious about the patron experience.”
Drawing that line, not just in the sand but into the future, will people still be going to the movies 10 or 15 years from now? Passman certainly thinks they will. “They may be viewing a different kind of presentation,” he envisions. “Today the buzz is three-dimensional viewing, which we believe immerses the patron into the experience of the actual feature movie. I believe tomorrow you will see interactive 3D and, some time further into the future, you will see some different type of three-dimensional, bordering on holograms perhaps. But you’ll always have the big screen and joint experience with a group of people.”The author wishes to thank Lisa De La Cruz for her assistance.
(As with all publicly traded companies, the conversations reflected in this article include “forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.” These include, without being limited to, “statements that are not historical facts, including statements about [the company’s] beliefs, expectations and future performance,” especially “expectations regarding…future prospects and positioning to further enhance shareholder value.”)
Executive BiosCarmike Cinemas’ new president and chief executive officer, S. David Passman III, recently retired from his position as president and CEO of IBS-STL, Inc., a book publishing and distribution company, where he had served since June 2005. Previously, he served as president of the Harland Printed Products and Harland Checks divisions of John H. Harland Company, a provider of printed products and software and related services to the financial institution market, from 1999 to 2003, and also served as its CFO from 1996 to 1999. Passman is a former partner of Deloitte & Touche LLP, a public accounting firm, where he served as the managing partner of the Atlanta office from 1993 to 1996. 
“I’ve got some 25 greatest movies of all time,” but if pressed, Passman would name Braveheart. His favorite movie theatre “far and away” is the Carmike 15 in Columbus, Georgia, just seven miles away from corporate headquarters. “Its big screen is just amazing.” Not to mention its gourmet caramel popcorn and Coke Zero on tap.
Fred W. Van Noy has served as a director since December 2004. He joined Carmike in 1975, served as a district manager from 1984 to 1985 and as Western division manager from 1985 to 1988, when he became VP and general manager. In December 1997, he was elected to the position of senior VP, operations. In November 2000, he became senior VP and chief operating officer.
“I love large popcorn in other’s people hands,” Van Noy says. “And, of course, Coca-Cola. We’re from the South and we love Coke!! There are a number of favorite movies, so it would be a close tie between Forrest Gump and Gladiator.”
Richard B. Hare joined Carmike as senior VP of finance, treasurer and chief financial officer effective March 31, 2006. He previously served as chief accounting officer and controller for Greenfuels Holding Company, LLC, an energy development and management services company, and its affiliates from August 2002 to March 2006. From October 2000 until June 2002, he served as assistant treasurer for Sanmina-SCI Corporation, a manufacturer of electronic components. From 1997 until October 2000, Hare was treasurer of Wolverine Tube, Inc., a manufacturer of copper and copper alloy products. A certified public accountant, he began his career in 1989 at Coopers & Lybrand, a public accounting firm.
A fan of Diet Coke and “large popcorn and Milk Duds mixed in,” Hare says his favorite film “without a doubt is Trading Places with Dan Aykroyd and Eddie Murphy. It’s got economics in there and Wall Street.” The Carmike Wynnsong 16 in Auburn, Alabama, is his favorite theatre not only because it was the first in the circuit to go fully digital, but because it is located “near my alma mater.”
Lee Champion rejoined Carmike Cinemas as senior VP, general counsel and secretary in September 2005. He had previously served in the same capacity from Jan. 1, 1998, to Dec. 31, 2001. From January 2002 until his return to Carmike, he was a partner at Page, Scrantom, Sprouse, Tucker and Ford in Columbus, Georgia. From 1975 until 1998, he was a partner in the law firm of Champion & Champion in Columbus, Georgia.
Champion’s favorite theatre is the Carmike 10 in LaGrange, Georgia, and he always opts for “popcorn with no butter and a large Coke.” As for favorite movies, he “enjoyed all the films in The Godfather series.”
