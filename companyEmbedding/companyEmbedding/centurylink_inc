Mbps, or megabits per second, is the speed of your Internet connection. Higher Mbps speeds will load web pages more quickly, allow more devices to run on the same connection simultaneously, and enable fast download speeds for music, photos, streaming movies and more.









Go with CenturyLink® High-Speed Internet and  choose from a wide range of available speeds.

Pay your bill online





If you want to pay your bill online, you have two options. One lets you pay without signing in. The other requires you take a couple minutes to set up an account, but then you don't have to re-enter data every time you make a payment. Which one you choose largely depends how often you plan to pay your bills online -- rarely or regularly.






There is a small convenience fee to use a credit or debit card when paying your bill via the one-time MyAccount or Quick Bill Pay services. There are two ways to avoid this fee and still enjoy the ease of paying online:

Enroll in AutoPay and pay via credit card, debit card, savings account, or checking account. Every month, your bill will be paid automatically from your designated payment source.
Use the  MyAccount or Quick Bill Pay service to make a one-time payment, and choose to pay by checking account.






	        Option 1: If you pay online, rarely 
        
 



Use Quick Bill Pay if you're in a hurry, have no interest in creating an account and/or you only need to pay your bill online every now and then.






GO TO QUICK BILL PAY 






	        Option 2: If you pay online, regularly
        
 



Use My Account if you anticipate wanting to pay your bill online more than once. It lets you save your payment information so you don't have to re-enter it every time you pay a bill. While you're signed in, you can also look at old bills, make changes to your services and update your account.






GO TO MY ACCOUNT 






Both My Account and Quick Bill Pay are mobile friendly so you can use your smartphone or other device to submit your payment.






Did you know? Just because you set up an account, you're not locked into paying online. You can still pay using other methods whenever you want.

What is "Mbps" and how much do I need


Mbps, or megabits per second, is the speed of your Internet connection. Higher Mbps speeds will load web pages more quickly, allow more devices to run on the same connection simultaneously, and enable fast download speeds for music, photos, streaming movies and more.

CenturyLink launches government cloud product

FedRAMP-certified product available on GSA Networx contract 

WASHINGTON, Feb. 16, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- CenturyLink, Inc. (NYSE: CTL) recently added a new Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) offering known as CenturyLink Government Cloud to its hybrid IT services portfolio. The cloud service is now available to federal government agencies via CenturyLink's General Services Administration (GSA) Networx contract and is planned to be available on other GSA contracts.

CenturyLink Government Cloud brings together the best of public, private and hybrid cloud offerings, enabling agencies to seamlessly migrate and extend their data center workloads to the cloud while complying with federal security standards. By supplying cloud, colocation and managed hosting services over its carrier-class network, CenturyLink provides government agencies with the security and reliability they need to carry out their missions.  
Through the VMware vCloud Air Network Managed Services Provider Model, CenturyLink is using the award-winning VMware vCloud® Government Services™.  This IaaS product is accredited under the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), which means it meets the government's rigorous security standards.
FedRAMP is a government-wide risk management framework that provides a standardized approach to security assessment, authorization and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services. Managed by GSA, the program was designed to provide a cost-effective, risk-based approach for the federal government's adoption and use of cloud-based services.
As the blend of IT services changes in response to shifting priorities, agencies need a full range of reliable and secure IT services, including FedRAMP-certified solutions that meet strict data security, cloud security and risk management standards.
"CenturyLink's collaboration with VMware enables us to help government agencies move their IT services to the cloud via innovative infrastructure services that are built on a secure, FedRAMP-approved platform," said CenturyLink Senior Vice President and General Manager Tim Meehan, who leads the company's federal government team. "CenturyLink Government Cloud combines the power of the VMware cloud with our carrier-class network and secure data centers, positioning us as a leading provider of hybrid IT solutions to the government."
"CenturyLink is proud to offer agencies an innovative cloud infrastructure service that complies with the government's strict security requirements as well as our own," said Dave Mahon, CenturyLink's chief security officer. "We invest heavily in robust cybersecurity protections across our extensive network and data center footprint."
CenturyLink is ranked No. 37 on Washington Technology's 2015 Top 100 list of federal government IT contractors.

History[edit]
The earliest predecessor of CenturyLink was the Oak Ridge Telephone Company in Oak Ridge, Louisiana, which was owned by F. E. Hogan, Sr. In 1930, Hogan sold the company, with 75 paid subscribers, to William Clarke and Marie Williams, for $500. They moved the switchboard to the Williams family front parlor. In 1946, the Williams' son, Clarke McRae Williams, received ownership of the family's telephone company as a wedding gift.[1] In 1947, Clarke Williams learned the telephone company in Marion, Louisiana was for sale. With a loan from business associate Joe Sydney Carter, Clarke purchased the Marion Telephone Company and eventually made it his base of operation as he grew his company through more acquisitions. CenturyLink still maintains offices in the former headquarters building.[6] The company remained as a family-operated business until it became incorporated in 1968.[1][7]
Central Telephone and Electronics[edit]
By 1967, Oak Ridge Telephone Company served three states with 10,000 access lines. That year the company was incorporated as Central Telephone and Electronics. Clarke M. Williams served as president and chairman of the board.[1] Between 1972 and 1975, Clarke gradually moved his headquarters from Marion to Monroe, Louisiana, to access the larger employee base and to be near the airport.
Century Telephone Enterprises[edit]




Century Telephone logo


In 1971, the company was renamed as Century Telephone Enterprises, Inc.[1][7] In 1972, Century Telephone acquired the La Crosse Telephone Corporation, of Wisconsin.[1]
On October 24, 1978, Century Telephone moved to the New York Stock Exchange for the first time and began to trade under the ticker symbol CTL.[1]
Century Telephone performed well during the long bear market of the 1970s, as its stock rose over fourfold. The company provided telephone service in parts of 14 states by that time.[8]
In 1981, Century Telephone acquired War Telephone in West Virginia.
In 1982, Century Telephone's earnings peaked at $14 million, then declined in 1983 following the early 1980s recession, and finally began to recover in 1984. However, the 1983 decline led to a loss of half the value of the company's stock in 1984.[8]
In 1985, both earnings and the stock price had recovered to new record highs. But by then, the company had accumulated $206 million in long-term debt.[8] Century Telephone sold the operations of War Telephone and two other companies to Colonial Telephone for $4.66 million.[9]
In 1987, the stock price nearly doubled from its low that year, and from its old 1982 record high, before falling back by a third in the 1987 stock market crash. Earnings had steadily grown each year from their 1983 low, and by 1987 reached nearly US$20 million.[8]
In 1989, Century Telephone Enterprises acquired Universal Telephone, Inc. for US$90 million in cash.[1] During the late 1980s the company began a long trend in which it performed extremely well. The stock split three-for-two twice in this period, as earnings steadily grew, through the 1990-1991 recession, and by year-end 1991, they reached nearly US$40 million, double from what they had been in 1987.[8]
In 1992, Century Telephone acquired Central Telephone Company of Ohio, a Centel subsidiary, for $135 million. The acquisition served more than 65,000 access lines, and added 20% to Century's access line total. Also that year Glen F. Post III became Chief Executive Officer and, named Vice Chairman of the Board of Century Telephone.[1]
In 1993, Century Telephone revenues were over $425 million, up from about $350 million in 1992. 1993 earnings were nearly $80 million, up from about $70 million in 1992, excluding a nearly $16 million charge in 1992 due to the cumulative effect from an accounting change that year.[8][10] Also in 1993 the company split its stock three-for-two yet again. However, by then the company had accumulated nearly $520 million in long-term debt.[8]
By 1995, Century Telephone Enterprises had been added to the S&P MidCap 400 index. Earnings had continued their steady growth trend through the 1994 economic soft landing, and by 1995 they reached over US$115 million. But the long-term debt continued to grow as well, reaching US$623 million that year.[8]
In 1997, Century Telephone acquired Delta Security Alarm Co., Inc. of Monroe, Louisiana, and its largest acquisition up until that time, Pacific Telecom, doubling its size with 660,000 additional telephone access lines in 12 states.[1] Pacific Telecom, Inc., would continue existence and was renamed CenturyTel of the Northwest, Inc.
In 1998, Century Telephone split its stock three-for-two once again. The company acquired another Monroe, Louisiana security company, Century Protection Systems, and also acquired 89,000 access lines and 19 exchanges in 21 northern Wisconsin communities from Ameritech. The affected customers had formerly been served by Wisconsin Bell. Ameritech's directory publishing operations serving those customers were also acquired.[11]
CenturyTel[edit]

In 1999, the company was renamed as CenturyTel, Inc.[12] It split its stock three-for-two once more, and was added to the Standard & Poor's 500 Index that year.[1]
In 2000, CenturyTel acquired 230,500 GTE lines in Arkansas, and also bought 127,000 GTE lines in Missouri in partnership with Spectra Communications.[13][14] In Wisconsin, it acquired 133,000 additional lines, and 70,500 access lines for US$195 million from Verizon. That year CenturyTel also bought 62,650 lines for US$170 million in partnership with Telephone USA of Wisconsin, LLC.[15]
In 2001, CenturyTel acquired CSW Net, Inc. of Russellville, Arkansas, and fended off a hostile take-over attempt by ALLTEL, Inc.[16][17]
In 2002, the son of the company's original founder and Chairman of the Board Clarke M. Williams died. He was succeeded by then Vice Chairman Glen F. Post III. The company sold its wireless business to ALLTEL, to become a pure-play rural local exchange carrier. Also that year CenturyTel acquired 300,000 Verizon access lines in Alabama, and 354,000 Verizon access lines in Missouri, bringing its total operations to 22 states with 2.5 million access lines.[18]
In 2003, CenturyTel acquired half ownership of SkyComm International, Inc. in Houston, Texas, in March, to form a satellite teleport for its global Network Access Point (NAP) system. In June, CenturyTel also acquired the fiber network of Digital Teleport, Inc., a 5,700-mile (9,200 km) route running from Illinois to Texas, and adjoining states.[19] CenturyTel renamed the network company LightCore.[20] Closing out the year, in December CenturyTel acquired the Midwest Fiber Optic Network (MFON) from Level 3 Communications, Inc. in December, a stand-alone system in the same core central states as LightCore.[1]
In August 2004, it partnered with EchoStar Communications Corporation for DISH Network multi-channel digital TV.[21] In September, CenturyTel began a relationship with Cingular Wireless.[22]
In 2005, CenturyTel began a wireless voice and data service, and bought a number of fiber networks in the central United States, from KMC Telecom Holdings, Inc.[23]
In 2006, CenturyTel sold its Arizona assets to Hopi Telecommunications, Inc., bringing total operations to 23 states.[1]
In May 2007, CenturyTel acquired Madison River Communications, based out of Mebane, NC and parent company to four LECs (AL, GA, IL, and NC) as well as CLEC operations in IL, LA, and NC. The LECs included Mebtel Communications, a telephone company serving Alamance County, North Carolina;[24][25] GulfTel Communications, based out of Foley, AL and serving Baldwin and surrounding counties;[26][27] Coastal Communications, based out of Hinesville, GA; and Gallatin River Communications, serving the Dixon, Galesburg, and Pekin areas of IL.
In late 2007, the Customer Respect Group, an international research and consulting firm that focuses on how corporations treat their online customers, ranked CenturyTel the best among six leading communications providers.
Acquisition of Embarq[edit]

On October 27, 2008, Embarq announced that it would be acquired by CenturyTel, Inc. in an all-stock transaction valued at about $6 billion.[28][29] CenturyTel's CEO Glen Post would remain CEO of the merged company following the acquisition,[30] and remained CEO as of 2015.[31] Embarq was the former landline business of Sprint and served cities in 18 states, including Nevada, Florida, North Carolina and Ohio.[32] The deal made CenturyTel the third-largest landline phone provider in Pennsylvania behind Verizon (through both Verizon Pennsylvania and Verizon North) and Comcast.
Name change to CenturyLink[edit]
On June 2, 2009, a press release announced that the combined CenturyTel/Embarq entity would be called CenturyLink.[33] Denver-based Monigle Associates was retained to formulate the new brand strategy. The acquisition was completed on July 1, 2009.[34]
On October 19, 2009, CenturyTel and Embarq brandings were retired, and all business was officially conducted under the CenturyLink banner, continuing to trade on the NYSE under the CenturyTel stock ticker CTL. The new corporate name, CenturyLink, Inc., did not become official until May 2010.[35][29]
Acquisition of Qwest[edit]




Network map of combined Qwest and CenturyLink assets


On April 22, 2010, CenturyLink (at this point still legally known as CenturyTel, Inc.) announced it would acquire Qwest in a stock-for-stock transaction.[36] Under the agreement, CenturyLink would swap 0.1664 of its shares for each share of Qwest; as a result, CenturyLink shareholders prior to the merger wound up with 50.5% share of ownership in the combined company, while former Qwest shareholders gained the remaining 49.5%.[37] The valuation of CenturyLink's purchase was $12 billion.[28] The merger was completed on April 1, 2011.[38][39]
The addition of Qwest allowed CenturyLink to become the third largest telecommunications company in the United States, and the largest landline phone provider in the state of Colorado.[31] The new company has 17 million access lines, 5 million broadband customers, and 1.4 million video subscribers across 37 states.[40] The merger also made CenturyLink owner of one of the so-called Baby Bells: Qwest included what was once US West, the Baby Bell for much of the western United States.
Acquisition of Savvis[edit]
On July 15, 2011,[32] CenturyLink acquired Savvis, Inc., a global provider of cloud infrastructure and hosted IT solutions for $2 billion, which represented all outstanding shares of Savvis common stock at $40 per share.[28][41] This acquisition allowed CenturyLink to provide expanded managed hosting and cloud services.[42]
On December 4, 2012,[43] CenturyLink launched an integrated suite of cloud services called savvisdirect.[44] Savvisdirect was an expansion of CenturyLink’s portfolio of Savvis cloud services and includes cloud application hosting,[45] cloud servers,[46] cloud storage,[47] and private cloud[48] for small businesses, IT admins and developers. CenturyLink later shuttered the savvisdirect subsidiary, consolidating their cloud service offerings internally.
On October 16, 2012 Savvis acquired to ITO Business Division of Ciber thereby adding managed services to the portfolio.
Acquisition of AppFog[edit]
On June 14, 2013, CenturyLink announced the acquisition of AppFog, a Portland-based Platform as a Service used by over 100,000 developers to automate the deployment of software on public clouds such as Amazon Web Services and OpenStack.[49]

CenturyLink Fiber is a fiber to the premises service in the United States, providing broadband Internet and Prism TV to a small and slowly growing number of locations. The service was first introduced to Omaha, Nebraska,[73] and next rolled out to Las Vegas, Nevada,[74] with plans for expansion to several other markets.[75] Unlike the company's existing high speed Internet deployments, which utilize fiber-to the node/neighborhood to increase the speed of DSL up to 40 Mbit/s with ADSL+ or VDSL2 technology,[76] in these markets CenturyLink now installs their fiber optic cable all the way to the home or business with speeds up to 1,000 Mbit/s download and 1,000 Mbit/s upload[77] using Calix Optical Network Terminals.[78] On Feb. 2, 2014, CenturyLink announced the availability of Gigabit fiber service to multi-tenant businesses in Salt Lake City and surrounding communities.[79] On Aug. 5, 2014, CenturyLink announced the expansion of its gigabit fiber service to 16 additional markets.[80] On Sep, 15, 2015, CenturyLink announced the expansion of its gigabit fiber service to residential and business customers in six additional states, increasing the company's service coverage to select areas of 17 states.[81]

History[edit]
The earliest predecessor of CenturyLink was the Oak Ridge Telephone Company in Oak Ridge, Louisiana, which was owned by F. E. Hogan, Sr. In 1930, Hogan sold the company, with 75 paid subscribers, to William Clarke and Marie Williams, for $500. They moved the switchboard to the Williams family front parlor. In 1946, the Williams' son, Clarke McRae Williams, received ownership of the family's telephone company as a wedding gift.[1] In 1947, Clarke Williams learned the telephone company in Marion, Louisiana was for sale. With a loan from business associate Joe Sydney Carter, Clarke purchased the Marion Telephone Company and eventually made it his base of operation as he grew his company through more acquisitions. CenturyLink still maintains offices in the former headquarters building.[6] The company remained as a family-operated business until it became incorporated in 1968.[1][7]
Central Telephone and Electronics[edit]
By 1967, Oak Ridge Telephone Company served three states with 10,000 access lines. That year the company was incorporated as Central Telephone and Electronics. Clarke M. Williams served as president and chairman of the board.[1] Between 1972 and 1975, Clarke gradually moved his headquarters from Marion to Monroe, Louisiana, to access the larger employee base and to be near the airport.
Century Telephone Enterprises[edit]

In 1971, the company was renamed as Century Telephone Enterprises, Inc.[1][7] In 1972, Century Telephone acquired the La Crosse Telephone Corporation, of Wisconsin.[1]
On October 24, 1978, Century Telephone moved to the New York Stock Exchange for the first time and began to trade under the ticker symbol CTL.[1]
Century Telephone performed well during the long bear market of the 1970s, as its stock rose over fourfold. The company provided telephone service in parts of 14 states by that time.[8]
In 1981, Century Telephone acquired War Telephone in West Virginia.
In 1982, Century Telephone's earnings peaked at $14 million, then declined in 1983 following the early 1980s recession, and finally began to recover in 1984. However, the 1983 decline led to a loss of half the value of the company's stock in 1984.[8]
In 1985, both earnings and the stock price had recovered to new record highs. But by then, the company had accumulated $206 million in long-term debt.[8] Century Telephone sold the operations of War Telephone and two other companies to Colonial Telephone for $4.66 million.[9]
In 1987, the stock price nearly doubled from its low that year, and from its old 1982 record high, before falling back by a third in the 1987 stock market crash. Earnings had steadily grown each year from their 1983 low, and by 1987 reached nearly US$20 million.[8]
In 1989, Century Telephone Enterprises acquired Universal Telephone, Inc. for US$90 million in cash.[1] During the late 1980s the company began a long trend in which it performed extremely well. The stock split three-for-two twice in this period, as earnings steadily grew, through the 1990-1991 recession, and by year-end 1991, they reached nearly US$40 million, double from what they had been in 1987.[8]
In 1992, Century Telephone acquired Central Telephone Company of Ohio, a Centel subsidiary, for $135 million. The acquisition served more than 65,000 access lines, and added 20% to Century's access line total. Also that year Glen F. Post III became Chief Executive Officer and, named Vice Chairman of the Board of Century Telephone.[1]
In 1993, Century Telephone revenues were over $425 million, up from about $350 million in 1992. 1993 earnings were nearly $80 million, up from about $70 million in 1992, excluding a nearly $16 million charge in 1992 due to the cumulative effect from an accounting change that year.[8][10] Also in 1993 the company split its stock three-for-two yet again. However, by then the company had accumulated nearly $520 million in long-term debt.[8]
By 1995, Century Telephone Enterprises had been added to the S&P MidCap 400 index. Earnings had continued their steady growth trend through the 1994 economic soft landing, and by 1995 they reached over US$115 million. But the long-term debt continued to grow as well, reaching US$623 million that year.[8]
In 1997, Century Telephone acquired Delta Security Alarm Co., Inc. of Monroe, Louisiana, and its largest acquisition up until that time, Pacific Telecom, doubling its size with 660,000 additional telephone access lines in 12 states.[1] Pacific Telecom, Inc., would continue existence and was renamed CenturyTel of the Northwest, Inc.
In 1998, Century Telephone split its stock three-for-two once again. The company acquired another Monroe, Louisiana security company, Century Protection Systems, and also acquired 89,000 access lines and 19 exchanges in 21 northern Wisconsin communities from Ameritech. The affected customers had formerly been served by Wisconsin Bell. Ameritech's directory publishing operations serving those customers were also acquired.[11]
CenturyTel[edit]

In 1999, the company was renamed as CenturyTel, Inc.[12] It split its stock three-for-two once more, and was added to the Standard & Poor's 500 Index that year.[1]
In 2000, CenturyTel acquired 230,500 GTE lines in Arkansas, and also bought 127,000 GTE lines in Missouri in partnership with Spectra Communications.[13][14] In Wisconsin, it acquired 133,000 additional lines, and 70,500 access lines for US$195 million from Verizon. That year CenturyTel also bought 62,650 lines for US$170 million in partnership with Telephone USA of Wisconsin, LLC.[15]
In 2001, CenturyTel acquired CSW Net, Inc. of Russellville, Arkansas, and fended off a hostile take-over attempt by ALLTEL, Inc.[16][17]
In 2002, the son of the company's original founder and Chairman of the Board Clarke M. Williams died. He was succeeded by then Vice Chairman Glen F. Post III. The company sold its wireless business to ALLTEL, to become a pure-play rural local exchange carrier. Also that year CenturyTel acquired 300,000 Verizon access lines in Alabama, and 354,000 Verizon access lines in Missouri, bringing its total operations to 22 states with 2.5 million access lines.[18]
In 2003, CenturyTel acquired half ownership of SkyComm International, Inc. in Houston, Texas, in March, to form a satellite teleport for its global Network Access Point (NAP) system. In June, CenturyTel also acquired the fiber network of Digital Teleport, Inc., a 5,700-mile (9,200 km) route running from Illinois to Texas, and adjoining states.[19] CenturyTel renamed the network company LightCore.[20] Closing out the year, in December CenturyTel acquired the Midwest Fiber Optic Network (MFON) from Level 3 Communications, Inc. in December, a stand-alone system in the same core central states as LightCore.[1]
In August 2004, it partnered with EchoStar Communications Corporation for DISH Network multi-channel digital TV.[21] In September, CenturyTel began a relationship with Cingular Wireless.[22]
In 2005, CenturyTel began a wireless voice and data service, and bought a number of fiber networks in the central United States, from KMC Telecom Holdings, Inc.[23]
In 2006, CenturyTel sold its Arizona assets to Hopi Telecommunications, Inc., bringing total operations to 23 states.[1]
In May 2007, CenturyTel acquired Madison River Communications, based out of Mebane, NC and parent company to four LECs (AL, GA, IL, and NC) as well as CLEC operations in IL, LA, and NC. The LECs included Mebtel Communications, a telephone company serving Alamance County, North Carolina;[24][25] GulfTel Communications, based out of Foley, AL and serving Baldwin and surrounding counties;[26][27] Coastal Communications, based out of Hinesville, GA; and Gallatin River Communications, serving the Dixon, Galesburg, and Pekin areas of IL.
In late 2007, the Customer Respect Group, an international research and consulting firm that focuses on how corporations treat their online customers, ranked CenturyTel the best among six leading communications providers.
Acquisition of Embarq[edit]

On October 27, 2008, Embarq announced that it would be acquired by CenturyTel, Inc. in an all-stock transaction valued at about $6 billion.[28][29] CenturyTel's CEO Glen Post would remain CEO of the merged company following the acquisition,[30] and remained CEO as of 2015.[31] Embarq was the former landline business of Sprint and served cities in 18 states, including Nevada, Florida, North Carolina and Ohio.[32] The deal made CenturyTel the third-largest landline phone provider in Pennsylvania behind Verizon (through both Verizon Pennsylvania and Verizon North) and Comcast.
Name change to CenturyLink[edit]
On June 2, 2009, a press release announced that the combined CenturyTel/Embarq entity would be called CenturyLink.[33] Denver-based Monigle Associates was retained to formulate the new brand strategy. The acquisition was completed on July 1, 2009.[34]
On October 19, 2009, CenturyTel and Embarq brandings were retired, and all business was officially conducted under the CenturyLink banner, continuing to trade on the NYSE under the CenturyTel stock ticker CTL. The new corporate name, CenturyLink, Inc., did not become official until May 2010.[35][29]
Acquisition of Qwest[edit]




Network map of combined Qwest and CenturyLink assets


On April 22, 2010, CenturyLink (at this point still legally known as CenturyTel, Inc.) announced it would acquire Qwest in a stock-for-stock transaction.[36] Under the agreement, CenturyLink would swap 0.1664 of its shares for each share of Qwest; as a result, CenturyLink shareholders prior to the merger wound up with 50.5% share of ownership in the combined company, while former Qwest shareholders gained the remaining 49.5%.[37] The valuation of CenturyLink's purchase was $12 billion.[28] The merger was completed on April 1, 2011.[38][39]
The addition of Qwest allowed CenturyLink to become the third largest telecommunications company in the United States, and the largest landline phone provider in the state of Colorado.[31] The new company has 17 million access lines, 5 million broadband customers, and 1.4 million video subscribers across 37 states.[40] The merger also made CenturyLink owner of one of the so-called Baby Bells: Qwest included what was once US West, the Baby Bell for much of the western United States.
Acquisition of Savvis[edit]
On July 15, 2011,[32] CenturyLink acquired Savvis, Inc., a global provider of cloud infrastructure and hosted IT solutions for $2 billion, which represented all outstanding shares of Savvis common stock at $40 per share.[28][41] This acquisition allowed CenturyLink to provide expanded managed hosting and cloud services.[42]
On December 4, 2012,[43] CenturyLink launched an integrated suite of cloud services called savvisdirect.[44] Savvisdirect was an expansion of CenturyLink’s portfolio of Savvis cloud services and includes cloud application hosting,[45] cloud servers,[46] cloud storage,[47] and private cloud[48] for small businesses, IT admins and developers. CenturyLink later shuttered the savvisdirect subsidiary, consolidating their cloud service offerings internally.

History[edit]
The earliest predecessor of CenturyLink was the Oak Ridge Telephone Company in Oak Ridge, Louisiana, which was owned by F. E. Hogan, Sr. In 1930, Hogan sold the company, with 75 paid subscribers, to William Clarke and Marie Williams, for $500. They moved the switchboard to the Williams family front parlor. In 1946, the Williams' son, Clarke McRae Williams, received ownership of the family's telephone company as a wedding gift.[1] In 1947, Clarke Williams learned the telephone company in Marion, Louisiana was for sale. With a loan from business associate Joe Sydney Carter, Clarke purchased the Marion Telephone Company and eventually made it his base of operation as he grew his company through more acquisitions. CenturyLink still maintains offices in the former headquarters building.[6] The company remained as a family-operated business until it became incorporated in 1968.[1][7]
Central Telephone and Electronics[edit]
By 1967, Oak Ridge Telephone Company served three states with 10,000 access lines. That year the company was incorporated as Central Telephone and Electronics. Clarke M. Williams served as president and chairman of the board.[1] Between 1972 and 1975, Clarke gradually moved his headquarters from Marion to Monroe, Louisiana, to access the larger employee base and to be near the airport.
Century Telephone Enterprises[edit]




Century Telephone logo


In 1971, the company was renamed as Century Telephone Enterprises, Inc.[1][7] In 1972, Century Telephone acquired the La Crosse Telephone Corporation, of Wisconsin.[1]
On October 24, 1978, Century Telephone moved to the New York Stock Exchange for the first time and began to trade under the ticker symbol CTL.[1]
Century Telephone performed well during the long bear market of the 1970s, as its stock rose over fourfold. The company provided telephone service in parts of 14 states by that time.[8]
In 1981, Century Telephone acquired War Telephone in West Virginia.
In 1982, Century Telephone's earnings peaked at $14 million, then declined in 1983 following the early 1980s recession, and finally began to recover in 1984. However, the 1983 decline led to a loss of half the value of the company's stock in 1984.[8]
In 1985, both earnings and the stock price had recovered to new record highs. But by then, the company had accumulated $206 million in long-term debt.[8] Century Telephone sold the operations of War Telephone and two other companies to Colonial Telephone for $4.66 million.[9]
In 1987, the stock price nearly doubled from its low that year, and from its old 1982 record high, before falling back by a third in the 1987 stock market crash. Earnings had steadily grown each year from their 1983 low, and by 1987 reached nearly US$20 million.[8]
In 1989, Century Telephone Enterprises acquired Universal Telephone, Inc. for US$90 million in cash.[1] During the late 1980s the company began a long trend in which it performed extremely well. The stock split three-for-two twice in this period, as earnings steadily grew, through the 1990-1991 recession, and by year-end 1991, they reached nearly US$40 million, double from what they had been in 1987.[8]
In 1992, Century Telephone acquired Central Telephone Company of Ohio, a Centel subsidiary, for $135 million. The acquisition served more than 65,000 access lines, and added 20% to Century's access line total. Also that year Glen F. Post III became Chief Executive Officer and, named Vice Chairman of the Board of Century Telephone.[1]
In 1993, Century Telephone revenues were over $425 million, up from about $350 million in 1992. 1993 earnings were nearly $80 million, up from about $70 million in 1992, excluding a nearly $16 million charge in 1992 due to the cumulative effect from an accounting change that year.[8][10] Also in 1993 the company split its stock three-for-two yet again. However, by then the company had accumulated nearly $520 million in long-term debt.[8]
By 1995, Century Telephone Enterprises had been added to the S&P MidCap 400 index. Earnings had continued their steady growth trend through the 1994 economic soft landing, and by 1995 they reached over US$115 million. But the long-term debt continued to grow as well, reaching US$623 million that year.[8]
In 1997, Century Telephone acquired Delta Security Alarm Co., Inc. of Monroe, Louisiana, and its largest acquisition up until that time, Pacific Telecom, doubling its size with 660,000 additional telephone access lines in 12 states.[1] Pacific Telecom, Inc., would continue existence and was renamed CenturyTel of the Northwest, Inc.
In 1998, Century Telephone split its stock three-for-two once again. The company acquired another Monroe, Louisiana security company, Century Protection Systems, and also acquired 89,000 access lines and 19 exchanges in 21 northern Wisconsin communities from Ameritech. The affected customers had formerly been served by Wisconsin Bell. Ameritech's directory publishing operations serving those customers were also acquired.[11]
CenturyTel[edit]

In 1999, the company was renamed as CenturyTel, Inc.[12] It split its stock three-for-two once more, and was added to the Standard & Poor's 500 Index that year.[1]
In 2000, CenturyTel acquired 230,500 GTE lines in Arkansas, and also bought 127,000 GTE lines in Missouri in partnership with Spectra Communications.[13][14] In Wisconsin, it acquired 133,000 additional lines, and 70,500 access lines for US$195 million from Verizon. That year CenturyTel also bought 62,650 lines for US$170 million in partnership with Telephone USA of Wisconsin, LLC.[15]
In 2001, CenturyTel acquired CSW Net, Inc. of Russellville, Arkansas, and fended off a hostile take-over attempt by ALLTEL, Inc.[16][17]
In 2002, the son of the company's original founder and Chairman of the Board Clarke M. Williams died. He was succeeded by then Vice Chairman Glen F. Post III. The company sold its wireless business to ALLTEL, to become a pure-play rural local exchange carrier. Also that year CenturyTel acquired 300,000 Verizon access lines in Alabama, and 354,000 Verizon access lines in Missouri, bringing its total operations to 22 states with 2.5 million access lines.[18]
In 2003, CenturyTel acquired half ownership of SkyComm International, Inc. in Houston, Texas, in March, to form a satellite teleport for its global Network Access Point (NAP) system. In June, CenturyTel also acquired the fiber network of Digital Teleport, Inc., a 5,700-mile (9,200 km) route running from Illinois to Texas, and adjoining states.[19] CenturyTel renamed the network company LightCore.[20] Closing out the year, in December CenturyTel acquired the Midwest Fiber Optic Network (MFON) from Level 3 Communications, Inc. in December, a stand-alone system in the same core central states as LightCore.[1]
In August 2004, it partnered with EchoStar Communications Corporation for DISH Network multi-channel digital TV.[21] In September, CenturyTel began a relationship with Cingular Wireless.[22]
In 2005, CenturyTel began a wireless voice and data service, and bought a number of fiber networks in the central United States, from KMC Telecom Holdings, Inc.[23]
In 2006, CenturyTel sold its Arizona assets to Hopi Telecommunications, Inc., bringing total operations to 23 states.[1]
In May 2007, CenturyTel acquired Madison River Communications, based out of Mebane, NC and parent company to four LECs (AL, GA, IL, and NC) as well as CLEC operations in IL, LA, and NC. The LECs included Mebtel Communications, a telephone company serving Alamance County, North Carolina;[24][25] GulfTel Communications, based out of Foley, AL and serving Baldwin and surrounding counties;[26][27] Coastal Communications, based out of Hinesville, GA; and Gallatin River Communications, serving the Dixon, Galesburg, and Pekin areas of IL.
In late 2007, the Customer Respect Group, an international research and consulting firm that focuses on how corporations treat their online customers, ranked CenturyTel the best among six leading communications providers.
Acquisition of Embarq[edit]

On October 27, 2008, Embarq announced that it would be acquired by CenturyTel, Inc. in an all-stock transaction valued at about $6 billion.[28][29] CenturyTel's CEO Glen Post would remain CEO of the merged company following the acquisition,[30] and remained CEO as of 2015.[31] Embarq was the former landline business of Sprint and served cities in 18 states, including Nevada, Florida, North Carolina and Ohio.[32] The deal made CenturyTel the third-largest landline phone provider in Pennsylvania behind Verizon (through both Verizon Pennsylvania and Verizon North) and Comcast.
Name change to CenturyLink[edit]
On June 2, 2009, a press release announced that the combined CenturyTel/Embarq entity would be called CenturyLink.[33] Denver-based Monigle Associates was retained to formulate the new brand strategy. The acquisition was completed on July 1, 2009.[34]
On October 19, 2009, CenturyTel and Embarq brandings were retired, and all business was officially conducted under the CenturyLink banner, continuing to trade on the NYSE under the CenturyTel stock ticker CTL. The new corporate name, CenturyLink, Inc., did not become official until May 2010.[35][29]
Acquisition of Qwest[edit]




Network map of combined Qwest and CenturyLink assets


On April 22, 2010, CenturyLink (at this point still legally known as CenturyTel, Inc.) announced it would acquire Qwest in a stock-for-stock transaction.[36] Under the agreement, CenturyLink would swap 0.1664 of its shares for each share of Qwest; as a result, CenturyLink shareholders prior to the merger wound up with 50.5% share of ownership in the combined company, while former Qwest shareholders gained the remaining 49.5%.[37] The valuation of CenturyLink's purchase was $12 billion.[28] The merger was completed on April 1, 2011.[38][39]
The addition of Qwest allowed CenturyLink to become the third largest telecommunications company in the United States, and the largest landline phone provider in the state of Colorado.[31] The new company has 17 million access lines, 5 million broadband customers, and 1.4 million video subscribers across 37 states.[40] The merger also made CenturyLink owner of one of the so-called Baby Bells: Qwest included what was once US West, the Baby Bell for much of the western United States.
Acquisition of Savvis[edit]
On July 15, 2011,[32] CenturyLink acquired Savvis, Inc., a global provider of cloud infrastructure and hosted IT solutions for $2 billion, which represented all outstanding shares of Savvis common stock at $40 per share.[28][41] This acquisition allowed CenturyLink to provide expanded managed hosting and cloud services.[42]
On December 4, 2012,[43] CenturyLink launched an integrated suite of cloud services called savvisdirect.[44] Savvisdirect was an expansion of CenturyLink’s portfolio of Savvis cloud services and includes cloud application hosting,[45] cloud servers,[46] cloud storage,[47] and private cloud[48] for small businesses, IT admins and developers. CenturyLink later shuttered the savvisdirect subsidiary, consolidating their cloud service offerings internally.
On October 16, 2012 Savvis acquired to ITO Business Division of Ciber thereby adding managed services to the portfolio.
Acquisition of AppFog[edit]
On June 14, 2013, CenturyLink announced the acquisition of AppFog, a Portland-based Platform as a Service used by over 100,000 developers to automate the deployment of software on public clouds such as Amazon Web Services and OpenStack.[49]
Acquisition of Tier 3[edit]
On November 19, 2013, CenturyLink announced the acquisition of Tier 3, a Seattle-based infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform, and advanced cloud management company[50] based on Cloud Foundry.[51]
Acquisition of Cognilytics[edit]
On December 11, 2014, CenturyLink announced the acquisition of Cognilytics, a predictive analytics and big data solution provider.[52]
Acquisition of Level 3[edit]
On October 31, 2016, CenturyLink announced its intent to acquire Level 3 Communications in a deal valued at around $25 billion.[53]

Fiber[edit]
CenturyLink Fiber is a fiber to the premises service in the United States, providing broadband Internet and Prism TV to a small and slowly growing number of locations. The service was first introduced to Omaha, Nebraska,[73] and next rolled out to Las Vegas, Nevada,[74] with plans for expansion to several other markets.[75] Unlike the company's existing high speed Internet deployments, which utilize fiber-to the node/neighborhood to increase the speed of DSL up to 40 Mbit/s with ADSL+ or VDSL2 technology,[76] in these markets CenturyLink now installs their fiber optic cable all the way to the home or business with speeds up to 1,000 Mbit/s download and 1,000 Mbit/s upload[77] using Calix Optical Network Terminals.[78] On Feb. 2, 2014, CenturyLink announced the availability of Gigabit fiber service to multi-tenant businesses in Salt Lake City and surrounding communities.[79] On Aug. 5, 2014, CenturyLink announced the expansion of its gigabit fiber service to 16 additional markets.[80] On Sep, 15, 2015, CenturyLink announced the expansion of its gigabit fiber service to residential and business customers in six additional states, increasing the company's service coverage to select areas of 17 states.[81]

** Citizens of these communities dispute this data. CenturyLink has provided fiber backbone to some areas, but most customers in these areas are not even served with basic broadband. The local broadband committee was unable to find any residential houses with fiber to the house.
Data centers[edit]

History[edit]
The earliest predecessor of CenturyLink was the Oak Ridge Telephone Company in Oak Ridge, Louisiana, which was owned by F. E. Hogan, Sr. In 1930, Hogan sold the company, with 75 paid subscribers, to William Clarke and Marie Williams, for $500. They moved the switchboard to the Williams family front parlor. In 1946, the Williams' son, Clarke McRae Williams, received ownership of the family's telephone company as a wedding gift.[1] In 1947, Clarke Williams learned the telephone company in Marion, Louisiana was for sale. With a loan from business associate Joe Sydney Carter, Clarke purchased the Marion Telephone Company and eventually made it his base of operation as he grew his company through more acquisitions. CenturyLink still maintains offices in the former headquarters building.[6] The company remained as a family-operated business until it became incorporated in 1968.[1][7]
Central Telephone and Electronics[edit]
By 1967, Oak Ridge Telephone Company served three states with 10,000 access lines. That year the company was incorporated as Central Telephone and Electronics. Clarke M. Williams served as president and chairman of the board.[1] Between 1972 and 1975, Clarke gradually moved his headquarters from Marion to Monroe, Louisiana, to access the larger employee base and to be near the airport.
Century Telephone Enterprises[edit]




Century Telephone logo


In 1971, the company was renamed as Century Telephone Enterprises, Inc.[1][7] In 1972, Century Telephone acquired the La Crosse Telephone Corporation, of Wisconsin.[1]
On October 24, 1978, Century Telephone moved to the New York Stock Exchange for the first time and began to trade under the ticker symbol CTL.[1]
Century Telephone performed well during the long bear market of the 1970s, as its stock rose over fourfold. The company provided telephone service in parts of 14 states by that time.[8]
In 1981, Century Telephone acquired War Telephone in West Virginia.
In 1982, Century Telephone's earnings peaked at $14 million, then declined in 1983 following the early 1980s recession, and finally began to recover in 1984. However, the 1983 decline led to a loss of half the value of the company's stock in 1984.[8]
In 1985, both earnings and the stock price had recovered to new record highs. But by then, the company had accumulated $206 million in long-term debt.[8] Century Telephone sold the operations of War Telephone and two other companies to Colonial Telephone for $4.66 million.[9]
In 1987, the stock price nearly doubled from its low that year, and from its old 1982 record high, before falling back by a third in the 1987 stock market crash. Earnings had steadily grown each year from their 1983 low, and by 1987 reached nearly US$20 million.[8]
In 1989, Century Telephone Enterprises acquired Universal Telephone, Inc. for US$90 million in cash.[1] During the late 1980s the company began a long trend in which it performed extremely well. The stock split three-for-two twice in this period, as earnings steadily grew, through the 1990-1991 recession, and by year-end 1991, they reached nearly US$40 million, double from what they had been in 1987.[8]
In 1992, Century Telephone acquired Central Telephone Company of Ohio, a Centel subsidiary, for $135 million. The acquisition served more than 65,000 access lines, and added 20% to Century's access line total. Also that year Glen F. Post III became Chief Executive Officer and, named Vice Chairman of the Board of Century Telephone.[1]
In 1993, Century Telephone revenues were over $425 million, up from about $350 million in 1992. 1993 earnings were nearly $80 million, up from about $70 million in 1992, excluding a nearly $16 million charge in 1992 due to the cumulative effect from an accounting change that year.[8][10] Also in 1993 the company split its stock three-for-two yet again. However, by then the company had accumulated nearly $520 million in long-term debt.[8]
By 1995, Century Telephone Enterprises had been added to the S&P MidCap 400 index. Earnings had continued their steady growth trend through the 1994 economic soft landing, and by 1995 they reached over US$115 million. But the long-term debt continued to grow as well, reaching US$623 million that year.[8]
In 1997, Century Telephone acquired Delta Security Alarm Co., Inc. of Monroe, Louisiana, and its largest acquisition up until that time, Pacific Telecom, doubling its size with 660,000 additional telephone access lines in 12 states.[1] Pacific Telecom, Inc., would continue existence and was renamed CenturyTel of the Northwest, Inc.
In 1998, Century Telephone split its stock three-for-two once again. The company acquired another Monroe, Louisiana security company, Century Protection Systems, and also acquired 89,000 access lines and 19 exchanges in 21 northern Wisconsin communities from Ameritech. The affected customers had formerly been served by Wisconsin Bell. Ameritech's directory publishing operations serving those customers were also acquired.[11]
CenturyTel[edit]

In 1999, the company was renamed as CenturyTel, Inc.[12] It split its stock three-for-two once more, and was added to the Standard & Poor's 500 Index that year.[1]
In 2000, CenturyTel acquired 230,500 GTE lines in Arkansas, and also bought 127,000 GTE lines in Missouri in partnership with Spectra Communications.[13][14] In Wisconsin, it acquired 133,000 additional lines, and 70,500 access lines for US$195 million from Verizon. That year CenturyTel also bought 62,650 lines for US$170 million in partnership with Telephone USA of Wisconsin, LLC.[15]
In 2001, CenturyTel acquired CSW Net, Inc. of Russellville, Arkansas, and fended off a hostile take-over attempt by ALLTEL, Inc.[16][17]
In 2002, the son of the company's original founder and Chairman of the Board Clarke M. Williams died. He was succeeded by then Vice Chairman Glen F. Post III. The company sold its wireless business to ALLTEL, to become a pure-play rural local exchange carrier. Also that year CenturyTel acquired 300,000 Verizon access lines in Alabama, and 354,000 Verizon access lines in Missouri, bringing its total operations to 22 states with 2.5 million access lines.[18]
In 2003, CenturyTel acquired half ownership of SkyComm International, Inc. in Houston, Texas, in March, to form a satellite teleport for its global Network Access Point (NAP) system. In June, CenturyTel also acquired the fiber network of Digital Teleport, Inc., a 5,700-mile (9,200 km) route running from Illinois to Texas, and adjoining states.[19] CenturyTel renamed the network company LightCore.[20] Closing out the year, in December CenturyTel acquired the Midwest Fiber Optic Network (MFON) from Level 3 Communications, Inc. in December, a stand-alone system in the same core central states as LightCore.[1]
In August 2004, it partnered with EchoStar Communications Corporation for DISH Network multi-channel digital TV.[21] In September, CenturyTel began a relationship with Cingular Wireless.[22]
In 2005, CenturyTel began a wireless voice and data service, and bought a number of fiber networks in the central United States, from KMC Telecom Holdings, Inc.[23]
In 2006, CenturyTel sold its Arizona assets to Hopi Telecommunications, Inc., bringing total operations to 23 states.[1]
In May 2007, CenturyTel acquired Madison River Communications, based out of Mebane, NC and parent company to four LECs (AL, GA, IL, and NC) as well as CLEC operations in IL, LA, and NC. The LECs included Mebtel Communications, a telephone company serving Alamance County, North Carolina;[24][25] GulfTel Communications, based out of Foley, AL and serving Baldwin and surrounding counties;[26][27] Coastal Communications, based out of Hinesville, GA; and Gallatin River Communications, serving the Dixon, Galesburg, and Pekin areas of IL.
In late 2007, the Customer Respect Group, an international research and consulting firm that focuses on how corporations treat their online customers, ranked CenturyTel the best among six leading communications providers.
Acquisition of Embarq[edit]

On October 27, 2008, Embarq announced that it would be acquired by CenturyTel, Inc. in an all-stock transaction valued at about $6 billion.[28][29] CenturyTel's CEO Glen Post would remain CEO of the merged company following the acquisition,[30] and remained CEO as of 2015.[31] Embarq was the former landline business of Sprint and served cities in 18 states, including Nevada, Florida, North Carolina and Ohio.[32] The deal made CenturyTel the third-largest landline phone provider in Pennsylvania behind Verizon (through both Verizon Pennsylvania and Verizon North) and Comcast.
Name change to CenturyLink[edit]
On June 2, 2009, a press release announced that the combined CenturyTel/Embarq entity would be called CenturyLink.[33] Denver-based Monigle Associates was retained to formulate the new brand strategy. The acquisition was completed on July 1, 2009.[34]
On October 19, 2009, CenturyTel and Embarq brandings were retired, and all business was officially conducted under the CenturyLink banner, continuing to trade on the NYSE under the CenturyTel stock ticker CTL. The new corporate name, CenturyLink, Inc., did not become official until May 2010.[35][29]
Acquisition of Qwest[edit]




Network map of combined Qwest and CenturyLink assets


On April 22, 2010, CenturyLink (at this point still legally known as CenturyTel, Inc.) announced it would acquire Qwest in a stock-for-stock transaction.[36] Under the agreement, CenturyLink would swap 0.1664 of its shares for each share of Qwest; as a result, CenturyLink shareholders prior to the merger wound up with 50.5% share of ownership in the combined company, while former Qwest shareholders gained the remaining 49.5%.[37] The valuation of CenturyLink's purchase was $12 billion.[28] The merger was completed on April 1, 2011.[38][39]
The addition of Qwest allowed CenturyLink to become the third largest telecommunications company in the United States, and the largest landline phone provider in the state of Colorado.[31] The new company has 17 million access lines, 5 million broadband customers, and 1.4 million video subscribers across 37 states.[40] The merger also made CenturyLink owner of one of the so-called Baby Bells: Qwest included what was once US West, the Baby Bell for much of the western United States.
Acquisition of Savvis[edit]
On July 15, 2011,[32] CenturyLink acquired Savvis, Inc., a global provider of cloud infrastructure and hosted IT solutions for $2 billion, which represented all outstanding shares of Savvis common stock at $40 per share.[28][41] This acquisition allowed CenturyLink to provide expanded managed hosting and cloud services.[42]
On December 4, 2012,[43] CenturyLink launched an integrated suite of cloud services called savvisdirect.[44] Savvisdirect was an expansion of CenturyLink’s portfolio of Savvis cloud services and includes cloud application hosting,[45] cloud servers,[46] cloud storage,[47] and private cloud[48] for small businesses, IT admins and developers. CenturyLink later shuttered the savvisdirect subsidiary, consolidating their cloud service offerings internally.
On October 16, 2012 Savvis acquired to ITO Business Division of Ciber thereby adding managed services to the portfolio.
Acquisition of AppFog[edit]
On June 14, 2013, CenturyLink announced the acquisition of AppFog, a Portland-based Platform as a Service used by over 100,000 developers to automate the deployment of software on public clouds such as Amazon Web Services and OpenStack.[49]

On November 19, 2013, CenturyLink announced the acquisition of Tier 3, a Seattle-based infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform, and advanced cloud management company[50] based on Cloud Foundry.[51]

CenturyLink formerly offered Dish Network bundles to their customers,[58] a remnant from the company's days before its acquisition of Qwest. In May 2014, CenturyLink reported that it had nearly 200,000 Prism TV subscribers.[59]

Fiber[edit]
CenturyLink Fiber is a fiber to the premises service in the United States, providing broadband Internet and Prism TV to a small and slowly growing number of locations. The service was first introduced to Omaha, Nebraska,[73] and next rolled out to Las Vegas, Nevada,[74] with plans for expansion to several other markets.[75] Unlike the company's existing high speed Internet deployments, which utilize fiber-to the node/neighborhood to increase the speed of DSL up to 40 Mbit/s with ADSL+ or VDSL2 technology,[76] in these markets CenturyLink now installs their fiber optic cable all the way to the home or business with speeds up to 1,000 Mbit/s download and 1,000 Mbit/s upload[77] using Calix Optical Network Terminals.[78] On Feb. 2, 2014, CenturyLink announced the availability of Gigabit fiber service to multi-tenant businesses in Salt Lake City and surrounding communities.[79] On Aug. 5, 2014, CenturyLink announced the expansion of its gigabit fiber service to 16 additional markets.[80] On Sep, 15, 2015, CenturyLink announced the expansion of its gigabit fiber service to residential and business customers in six additional states, increasing the company's service coverage to select areas of 17 states.[81]

** Citizens of these communities dispute this data. CenturyLink has provided fiber backbone to some areas, but most customers in these areas are not even served with basic broadband. The local broadband committee was unable to find any residential houses with fiber to the house.
Data centers[edit]
CenturyLink currently operates 55 data centers in North America,[87] Asia Pacific,[88] and Europe,[89] and is the second largest retail colocation provider in the US.[90] The company is currently constructing 3 new data centers in Chicago, IL, Minneapolis, MN, and Irvine, CA.[91]
Organizational structure[edit]
The combined company's 37-state service area is organized into five regions and led by region presidents.[92] The region presidents are responsible for revenue, customer retention, customer satisfaction, and service delivery throughout their local markets.[93] The regions, region presidents, region headquarters locations, and states within each region are:

History[edit]
The earliest predecessor of CenturyLink was the Oak Ridge Telephone Company in Oak Ridge, Louisiana, which was owned by F. E. Hogan, Sr. In 1930, Hogan sold the company, with 75 paid subscribers, to William Clarke and Marie Williams, for $500. They moved the switchboard to the Williams family front parlor. In 1946, the Williams' son, Clarke McRae Williams, received ownership of the family's telephone company as a wedding gift.[1] In 1947, Clarke Williams learned the telephone company in Marion, Louisiana was for sale. With a loan from business associate Joe Sydney Carter, Clarke purchased the Marion Telephone Company and eventually made it his base of operation as he grew his company through more acquisitions. CenturyLink still maintains offices in the former headquarters building.[6] The company remained as a family-operated business until it became incorporated in 1968.[1][7]
Central Telephone and Electronics[edit]
By 1967, Oak Ridge Telephone Company served three states with 10,000 access lines. That year the company was incorporated as Central Telephone and Electronics. Clarke M. Williams served as president and chairman of the board.[1] Between 1972 and 1975, Clarke gradually moved his headquarters from Marion to Monroe, Louisiana, to access the larger employee base and to be near the airport.
Century Telephone Enterprises[edit]




Century Telephone logo


In 1971, the company was renamed as Century Telephone Enterprises, Inc.[1][7] In 1972, Century Telephone acquired the La Crosse Telephone Corporation, of Wisconsin.[1]
On October 24, 1978, Century Telephone moved to the New York Stock Exchange for the first time and began to trade under the ticker symbol CTL.[1]
Century Telephone performed well during the long bear market of the 1970s, as its stock rose over fourfold. The company provided telephone service in parts of 14 states by that time.[8]
In 1981, Century Telephone acquired War Telephone in West Virginia.
In 1982, Century Telephone's earnings peaked at $14 million, then declined in 1983 following the early 1980s recession, and finally began to recover in 1984. However, the 1983 decline led to a loss of half the value of the company's stock in 1984.[8]
In 1985, both earnings and the stock price had recovered to new record highs. But by then, the company had accumulated $206 million in long-term debt.[8] Century Telephone sold the operations of War Telephone and two other companies to Colonial Telephone for $4.66 million.[9]
In 1987, the stock price nearly doubled from its low that year, and from its old 1982 record high, before falling back by a third in the 1987 stock market crash. Earnings had steadily grown each year from their 1983 low, and by 1987 reached nearly US$20 million.[8]
In 1989, Century Telephone Enterprises acquired Universal Telephone, Inc. for US$90 million in cash.[1] During the late 1980s the company began a long trend in which it performed extremely well. The stock split three-for-two twice in this period, as earnings steadily grew, through the 1990-1991 recession, and by year-end 1991, they reached nearly US$40 million, double from what they had been in 1987.[8]
In 1992, Century Telephone acquired Central Telephone Company of Ohio, a Centel subsidiary, for $135 million. The acquisition served more than 65,000 access lines, and added 20% to Century's access line total. Also that year Glen F. Post III became Chief Executive Officer and, named Vice Chairman of the Board of Century Telephone.[1]
In 1993, Century Telephone revenues were over $425 million, up from about $350 million in 1992. 1993 earnings were nearly $80 million, up from about $70 million in 1992, excluding a nearly $16 million charge in 1992 due to the cumulative effect from an accounting change that year.[8][10] Also in 1993 the company split its stock three-for-two yet again. However, by then the company had accumulated nearly $520 million in long-term debt.[8]
By 1995, Century Telephone Enterprises had been added to the S&P MidCap 400 index. Earnings had continued their steady growth trend through the 1994 economic soft landing, and by 1995 they reached over US$115 million. But the long-term debt continued to grow as well, reaching US$623 million that year.[8]
In 1997, Century Telephone acquired Delta Security Alarm Co., Inc. of Monroe, Louisiana, and its largest acquisition up until that time, Pacific Telecom, doubling its size with 660,000 additional telephone access lines in 12 states.[1] Pacific Telecom, Inc., would continue existence and was renamed CenturyTel of the Northwest, Inc.
In 1998, Century Telephone split its stock three-for-two once again. The company acquired another Monroe, Louisiana security company, Century Protection Systems, and also acquired 89,000 access lines and 19 exchanges in 21 northern Wisconsin communities from Ameritech. The affected customers had formerly been served by Wisconsin Bell. Ameritech's directory publishing operations serving those customers were also acquired.[11]
CenturyTel[edit]

In 1999, the company was renamed as CenturyTel, Inc.[12] It split its stock three-for-two once more, and was added to the Standard & Poor's 500 Index that year.[1]
In 2000, CenturyTel acquired 230,500 GTE lines in Arkansas, and also bought 127,000 GTE lines in Missouri in partnership with Spectra Communications.[13][14] In Wisconsin, it acquired 133,000 additional lines, and 70,500 access lines for US$195 million from Verizon. That year CenturyTel also bought 62,650 lines for US$170 million in partnership with Telephone USA of Wisconsin, LLC.[15]
In 2001, CenturyTel acquired CSW Net, Inc. of Russellville, Arkansas, and fended off a hostile take-over attempt by ALLTEL, Inc.[16][17]
In 2002, the son of the company's original founder and Chairman of the Board Clarke M. Williams died. He was succeeded by then Vice Chairman Glen F. Post III. The company sold its wireless business to ALLTEL, to become a pure-play rural local exchange carrier. Also that year CenturyTel acquired 300,000 Verizon access lines in Alabama, and 354,000 Verizon access lines in Missouri, bringing its total operations to 22 states with 2.5 million access lines.[18]
In 2003, CenturyTel acquired half ownership of SkyComm International, Inc. in Houston, Texas, in March, to form a satellite teleport for its global Network Access Point (NAP) system. In June, CenturyTel also acquired the fiber network of Digital Teleport, Inc., a 5,700-mile (9,200 km) route running from Illinois to Texas, and adjoining states.[19] CenturyTel renamed the network company LightCore.[20] Closing out the year, in December CenturyTel acquired the Midwest Fiber Optic Network (MFON) from Level 3 Communications, Inc. in December, a stand-alone system in the same core central states as LightCore.[1]
In August 2004, it partnered with EchoStar Communications Corporation for DISH Network multi-channel digital TV.[21] In September, CenturyTel began a relationship with Cingular Wireless.[22]
In 2005, CenturyTel began a wireless voice and data service, and bought a number of fiber networks in the central United States, from KMC Telecom Holdings, Inc.[23]
In 2006, CenturyTel sold its Arizona assets to Hopi Telecommunications, Inc., bringing total operations to 23 states.[1]
In May 2007, CenturyTel acquired Madison River Communications, based out of Mebane, NC and parent company to four LECs (AL, GA, IL, and NC) as well as CLEC operations in IL, LA, and NC. The LECs included Mebtel Communications, a telephone company serving Alamance County, North Carolina;[24][25] GulfTel Communications, based out of Foley, AL and serving Baldwin and surrounding counties;[26][27] Coastal Communications, based out of Hinesville, GA; and Gallatin River Communications, serving the Dixon, Galesburg, and Pekin areas of IL.
In late 2007, the Customer Respect Group, an international research and consulting firm that focuses on how corporations treat their online customers, ranked CenturyTel the best among six leading communications providers.
Acquisition of Embarq[edit]

On October 27, 2008, Embarq announced that it would be acquired by CenturyTel, Inc. in an all-stock transaction valued at about $6 billion.[28][29] CenturyTel's CEO Glen Post would remain CEO of the merged company following the acquisition,[30] and remained CEO as of 2015.[31] Embarq was the former landline business of Sprint and served cities in 18 states, including Nevada, Florida, North Carolina and Ohio.[32] The deal made CenturyTel the third-largest landline phone provider in Pennsylvania behind Verizon (through both Verizon Pennsylvania and Verizon North) and Comcast.
Name change to CenturyLink[edit]
On June 2, 2009, a press release announced that the combined CenturyTel/Embarq entity would be called CenturyLink.[33] Denver-based Monigle Associates was retained to formulate the new brand strategy. The acquisition was completed on July 1, 2009.[34]
On October 19, 2009, CenturyTel and Embarq brandings were retired, and all business was officially conducted under the CenturyLink banner, continuing to trade on the NYSE under the CenturyTel stock ticker CTL. The new corporate name, CenturyLink, Inc., did not become official until May 2010.[35][29]
Acquisition of Qwest[edit]




Network map of combined Qwest and CenturyLink assets


On April 22, 2010, CenturyLink (at this point still legally known as CenturyTel, Inc.) announced it would acquire Qwest in a stock-for-stock transaction.[36] Under the agreement, CenturyLink would swap 0.1664 of its shares for each share of Qwest; as a result, CenturyLink shareholders prior to the merger wound up with 50.5% share of ownership in the combined company, while former Qwest shareholders gained the remaining 49.5%.[37] The valuation of CenturyLink's purchase was $12 billion.[28] The merger was completed on April 1, 2011.[38][39]
The addition of Qwest allowed CenturyLink to become the third largest telecommunications company in the United States, and the largest landline phone provider in the state of Colorado.[31] The new company has 17 million access lines, 5 million broadband customers, and 1.4 million video subscribers across 37 states.[40] The merger also made CenturyLink owner of one of the so-called Baby Bells: Qwest included what was once US West, the Baby Bell for much of the western United States.
Acquisition of Savvis[edit]
On July 15, 2011,[32] CenturyLink acquired Savvis, Inc., a global provider of cloud infrastructure and hosted IT solutions for $2 billion, which represented all outstanding shares of Savvis common stock at $40 per share.[28][41] This acquisition allowed CenturyLink to provide expanded managed hosting and cloud services.[42]
On December 4, 2012,[43] CenturyLink launched an integrated suite of cloud services called savvisdirect.[44] Savvisdirect was an expansion of CenturyLink’s portfolio of Savvis cloud services and includes cloud application hosting,[45] cloud servers,[46] cloud storage,[47] and private cloud[48] for small businesses, IT admins and developers. CenturyLink later shuttered the savvisdirect subsidiary, consolidating their cloud service offerings internally.
On October 16, 2012 Savvis acquired to ITO Business Division of Ciber thereby adding managed services to the portfolio.

On June 14, 2013, CenturyLink announced the acquisition of AppFog, a Portland-based Platform as a Service used by over 100,000 developers to automate the deployment of software on public clouds such as Amazon Web Services and OpenStack.[49]

Fiber[edit]
CenturyLink Fiber is a fiber to the premises service in the United States, providing broadband Internet and Prism TV to a small and slowly growing number of locations. The service was first introduced to Omaha, Nebraska,[73] and next rolled out to Las Vegas, Nevada,[74] with plans for expansion to several other markets.[75] Unlike the company's existing high speed Internet deployments, which utilize fiber-to the node/neighborhood to increase the speed of DSL up to 40 Mbit/s with ADSL+ or VDSL2 technology,[76] in these markets CenturyLink now installs their fiber optic cable all the way to the home or business with speeds up to 1,000 Mbit/s download and 1,000 Mbit/s upload[77] using Calix Optical Network Terminals.[78] On Feb. 2, 2014, CenturyLink announced the availability of Gigabit fiber service to multi-tenant businesses in Salt Lake City and surrounding communities.[79] On Aug. 5, 2014, CenturyLink announced the expansion of its gigabit fiber service to 16 additional markets.[80] On Sep, 15, 2015, CenturyLink announced the expansion of its gigabit fiber service to residential and business customers in six additional states, increasing the company's service coverage to select areas of 17 states.[81]

<p>To further support the annual food drive, the CenturyLink <a href="http://www.clarkewilliamscenturylink.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Clarke M. Williams</a> Foundation contributed a <span class="xn-money">$1 million</span> match to local food bank beneficiaries based on the amount of donations they received through the online donation site. Food banks that offer backpack programs were asked to direct 50 percent of their gifts from the CenturyLink Clarke M. Williams Foundation to those programs.</p>

<p>Food Banks can provide an average of five meals for each dollar they receive. Therefore, the CenturyLink Backpack Buddies Food Drive will help provide over nine million meals throughout its communities.</p>

<p>Since its inception in 2009, donations from the CenturyLink Backpack Buddies Food Drive have provided more than 56 million meals across the country. The goals of the yearly drive are to generate donations for local food banks and help raise awareness of the need for backpack programs.</p>

<p>Backpack programs are crucial to children who rely on school breakfasts and lunches to meet their nutritional needs each day. These programs provide nutritional, shelf-stable meals for at-risk students during weekends and school breaks.</p>

<p>&quot;We&#39;re happy to have partnered with so many local agencies in the communities CenturyLink serves to support their efforts to fight hunger,&quot; said CenturyLink&#39;s Manager of Community Relations Kristy LaCroix. &quot;We hope that our food drive has helped raise awareness of the hunger relief needs across our markets, as well as across the nation.&quot;</p>

<p>CenturyLink&rsquo;s national ad campaign, &ldquo;Two Sides,&rdquo; reinforces how the company improves the lives of its customers by connecting them to the power of the digital world. From major cities to small towns, the company provides a connection and innovative platform for collaboration. That power of connectivity made Jones an overnight singing success after a classmate posted a video of him on the internet that received a million views in 24 hours. CenturyLink and Jones turned that experience into a campaign showing how broadband service can help unite people and celebrate talent on a global scale when enabled by CenturyLink.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>MONROE, La.&nbsp;and&nbsp;BROOMFIELD, Colo.,</strong> Oct, 31, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- CenturyLink (NYSE:&nbsp;<a href="http://studio-5.financialcontent.com/prnews?Page=Quote&amp;Ticker=CTL" target="_blank" title="CTL">CTL</a>) and Level 3 Communications, Inc. (NYSE:&nbsp;<a href="http://studio-5.financialcontent.com/prnews?Page=Quote&amp;Ticker=LVLT" target="_blank" title="LVLT">LVLT</a>) today announced that their Boards of Directors have unanimously approved a definitive merger agreement under which CenturyLink will acquire Level 3 in a cash and stock transaction valued at approximately&nbsp;$34 billion, including the assumption of debt. Under terms of the agreement, Level 3 shareholders will receive&nbsp;$26.50&nbsp;per share in cash and a fixed exchange ratio of 1.4286 shares of CenturyLink stock for each Level 3 share they own, which implies a purchase price of&nbsp;$66.50&nbsp;per Level 3 share (based on a CenturyLink&nbsp;$28.00&nbsp;per share reference price) and a premium of approximately 42 percent based on Level 3&#39;s unaffected closing share price of&nbsp;$46.92&nbsp;on&nbsp;October 26, 2016, the last trading day prior to market speculation about a potential transaction. Upon the closing of the transaction, CenturyLink shareholders will own approximately 51 percent and Level 3 shareholders will own approximately 49 percent of the combined company.</p>

<p>The combined company will have the ability to offer CenturyLink&#39;s larger enterprise customer base the benefits of Level 3&#39;s global footprint with a combined presence in more than 60 countries. In addition, the combined company will be positioned to further invest in the reach and speeds of its broadband infrastructure for small businesses and consumers.</p>

<p>&quot;The digital economy relies on broadband connectivity, and together with Level 3 we will have one of the most robust fiber network and high-speed data services companies in the world,&quot; said&nbsp;Glen Post, CenturyLink Chief Executive Officer and President. &quot;This transaction furthers our commitment to providing our customers with the network to improve their lives and strengthen their businesses. It is this focus on providing fiber connectivity that will continue to distinguish CenturyLink from our competitors. CenturyLink shareholders will benefit from the significant synergies and financial flexibility provided by the combined company&#39;s revenue growth and strong cash flow. For employees, this combination will bring together two highly customer-focused organizations and provide employees growth and advancement opportunities the companies could not offer separately.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;This is a compelling transaction for our customers, shareholders and employees,&quot; said&nbsp;Jeff Storey, President and Chief Executive Officer of Level 3.&nbsp;&quot;In addition to the substantial value delivered to shareholders, the combined company will be uniquely positioned to meet the evolving and global needs of enterprise customers.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Strategic and Financial Benefits</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Highly Complementary Businesses with Expanded Fiber Networks:</strong>&nbsp;This transaction increases CenturyLink&#39;s network by 200,000 route miles of fiber, which includes 64,000 route miles in 350 metropolitan areas and 33,000 subsea route miles connecting multiple continents. Accounting for those served by both companies, CenturyLink&#39;s on-net buildings are expected to increase by nearly 75 percent to approximately 75,000, including 10,000 buildings in EMEA and&nbsp;Latin America. Overall, the complementary domestic and international networks will provide cost efficiencies by focusing capital investment on increasing capacity and extending the reach of the combined company&#39;s high-bandwidth fiber network.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Enhanced Competitive Offerings in Business Network Services:</strong>&nbsp;The combined company will have significantly improved network capabilities, creating a world-class enterprise player with approximately&nbsp;$19 billion&nbsp;in pro forma business revenue and$13 billion&nbsp;in business strategic revenue, for the trailing twelve months ended&nbsp;June 30, 2016. Together, CenturyLink&#39;s and Level 3&#39;s revenue will be 76 percent derived from business customers, and 65 percent of the combined company&#39;s core revenue will be from strategic services. Given the complementary nature of the portfolios, the combined company will offer an even broader range of services and solutions to meet customers&#39; demand for more bandwidth and new applications in an increasingly complex operating environment.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Enhanced Broadband Infrastructure:</strong>&nbsp;This transaction will provide the combined company with increased opportunity to invest in its broadband infrastructure and enhance broadband speed for small businesses and consumers.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Strong Financial Profile:</strong>&nbsp;The combined company is expected to have improved adjusted EBITDA margins, revenue growth and pro forma net leverage of less than 3.7x at close, including run-rate synergies. The combined company will benefit from Level 3&#39;s nearly&nbsp;$10 billion&nbsp;of net operating losses (&quot;NOLs&quot;). These NOLs will substantially reduce the combined company&#39;s net cash tax expense over the next several years, positioning it to generate substantial free cash flow.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Improved Dividend Coverage:&nbsp;</strong>The improved free cash flow will enhance the combined company&#39;s financial flexibility and significantly lower its payout ratio. CenturyLink expects to maintain its annual dividend of&nbsp;$2.16&nbsp;per share.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Significantly Accretive to Free Cash Flow with Multiple Opportunities for Growth:</strong>&nbsp;CenturyLink expects the transaction to be accretive to free cash flow in the first full year following the close of the transaction and significantly accretive on an annual run-rate basis thereafter. Furthermore, the transaction will be accretive to CenturyLink&#39;s existing growth profile with additional upside opportunities, including the ability to deploy CenturyLink&#39;s and Level 3&#39;s product portfolio across the combined customer bases. With increased network scale, and dense local metro areas and global reach, the combined company will be positioned to further expand internationally.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Substantial Run-Rate Synergies:</strong>&nbsp;Both companies have a proven ability to integrate and meet or exceed synergy targets. The increased scale afforded by the combined company is expected to generate&nbsp;$975 million&nbsp;of annual run-rate cash synergies, primarily from the elimination of duplicative functions, systems consolidation, and increased operational and capital efficiencies.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Management, Board and Location</strong></p>

<p>After the close of the transaction,&nbsp;Glen Post&nbsp;will continue to serve as Chief Executive Officer and President and&nbsp;Sunit Patel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Level 3, will serve as Chief Financial Officer of the combined company.</p>

<p>The Chairman of CenturyLink&#39;s Board at the time of the closing of the transaction will continue to serve as Chairman of the combined company. CenturyLink has agreed to appoint four Level 3 Board members at closing, one of whom will be a representative of STT Crossing&nbsp;(a wholly owned subsidiary of ST Telemedia).</p>

<p>The combined company will be headquartered in&nbsp;Monroe, Louisiana&nbsp;and will maintain a significant presence in&nbsp;Colorado&nbsp;and the Denver&nbsp;metropolitan area.</p>

<p><strong>Financing and Approvals</strong></p>

<p>CenturyLink intends to finance the cash portion of the transaction and pay related fees and expenses through a combination of cash on hand at CenturyLink and Level 3, and approximately&nbsp;$7 billion&nbsp;of additional indebtedness. In connection therewith, CenturyLink has received financing commitments from BofA Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC totaling approximately&nbsp;$10.2 billion&nbsp;for new secured debt facilities, comprised of a new&nbsp;$2 billion&nbsp;secured revolving credit facility and approximately&nbsp;$8.2 billion&nbsp;of other secured debt facilities, including the refinancing of indebtedness expected to mature prior to closing of the transaction. All existing indebtedness of Level 3 is expected to remain in place at Level 3 and Level 3 will not incur any incremental indebtedness or guarantee any indebtedness of CenturyLink to finance the transaction.</p>

<p>The companies anticipate closing the transaction by the end of third quarter 2017. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals, including expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, review by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, certain state regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. The transaction is also subject to the approval of CenturyLink and Level 3 shareholders.</p>

<p>CenturyLink has entered into a voting agreement with STT Crossing (a wholly owned subsidiary of ST Telemedia), holder of approximately 18 percent of Level 3&#39;s outstanding common stock, pursuant to which it will vote its Level 3 shares in favor of the transaction.</p>

<p><span class="xn-location">PLATTEVILLE, Wis.</span>, <span class="xn-chron">Sept. 12, 2016</span> /<a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/" target="_blank">PRNewswire</a>/ --&nbsp;<a href="http://www.centurylink.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">CenturyLink, Inc.</a> (NYSE: CTL), a leading broadband services provider in <span class="xn-location">the United States</span>, today announced that it has installed G.fast technology in <span class="xn-location">Platteville, Wis.</span>, resulting in the largest G.fast deployment in <span class="xn-location">North America</span>. Using existing copper and internal coaxial cable infrastructure, CenturyLink installed G.fast technology in 44 multi-dwelling units (MDUs) to provide internet speeds of up to 500 Mbps and higher to nearly 800 apartments in <span class="xn-location">Platteville</span>.</p>

<div id="prni_dvprnejpgabe4left" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left; WIDTH: 100%"><img align="middle" alt="CenturyLink logo." border="0" id="prnejpgabe4left" src="http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20140806/134213" title="CenturyLink logo." /></div>

<p>&quot;CenturyLink&#39;s commercial G.fast deployment in <span class="xn-location">Platteville, Wisconsin</span> is the largest single G.fast implementation in the U.S. to date, highlighting the company&#39;s commitment to delivering ultra-broadband services &ndash; including Gigabit access &ndash; to its customer base,&quot; said <span class="xn-person">Erik M. Keith</span>, principal analyst of broadband networks and multiplay services at Current Analysis. &quot;With the ongoing evolution towards unicast, OTT streaming video services, including 4KTV, demand for ultra-broadband connectivity continues to escalate. To this end, CenturyLink is leveraging extensive fiber network build-outs in conjunction with key endpoint technologies, with G.fast providing de facto FTTH services over existing copper access lines.&quot;</p>

<p>In 2015, CenturyLink deployed fiber-to-the-premises technology to the majority of residential and business customers in <a href="http://news.centurylink.com/news/centurylink-launches-prismR-tv-and-up-to-1-gbps-internet-speeds-in-platteville" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Platteville</a> to upgrade the CenturyLink Televideo TV service to CenturyLink<sup>&reg;</sup> Prism<sup>&reg;</sup> TV service. That fiber network enhancement also enabled most residential and business customers in <span class="xn-location">Platteville</span> access to broadband speeds up to 1 gigabit per second. Many apartment complexes in this area that did not have access to those faster speeds are now able to connect to speeds up to 500 Mbps and higher, and to Prism TV service, through this G.fast deployment.</p>

<p>&quot;We saw a great opportunity to use existing copper assets in our <span class="xn-location">Platteville</span> network to bring ultra-fast internet speeds to customers who live in areas that typically don&#39;t have access to these new broadband technologies delivering higher speeds,&quot; said <span class="xn-person">Aamir Hussain</span>, CenturyLink executive vice president and chief technology officer. &quot;We take a fiber-first approach when deploying faster broadband speeds but enabling G.fast over copper infrastructure helps us&nbsp;reduce costs, speed time to market and effectively connect our customers to the power of the digital world in areas where fiber deployment is less feasible.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>CenturyLink is evaluating other locations, beyond MDUs, where G.fast technology can be used to give customers access to faster speeds, such as fiber-fed multi-tenant units (MTUs) and neighborhoods where fiber-to-the-curb (FTTC) allows for G.fast to push higher speeds over the short amount of copper into the home. CenturyLink is utilizing other new technologies on its existing network infrastructure to accommodate the growing broadband needs of its customers, including the delivery of internet speeds up to 100 Mbps to nearly 1 million homes and businesses using VDSL2 vectoring.</p>

<p>CenturyLink is utilizing the Calix AXOS G.fast solution for its G.fast deployment in <span class="xn-location">Platteville</span>, with all systems and services managed via the cloud through Calix&#39;s Compass Consumer Connect Plus software.</p>

<p><span class="xn-location">MONROE, La.</span>, <span class="xn-chron">Oct. 19, 2015</span> /<a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/" target="_blank">PRNewswire</a>/ --<a href="http://www.centurylink.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">CenturyLink, Inc.</a> (NYSE: CTL) today announced that it has taken a leadership position in building a service-centric environment for customers through the integration of its network and cloud, combined with virtualization functions. The company is currently building an end-to-end network platform with software-defined networking (SDN) and network functions virtualization (NFV) capabilities to deliver a self-service application marketplace and on-demand services, creating an enhanced customer experience currently offered by few providers.</p>

<div id="prni_dvprnejpg41a0left" style="TEXT-ALIGN: left; WIDTH: 100%"><img align="middle" alt="CenturyLink logo." border="0" id="prnejpg41a0left" src="http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20140806/134213" title="CenturyLink logo." /></div>

<p>CenturyLink is aggressively working to transform its existing core network into an SDN and NFV-based environment and will virtualize 40 percent of its global IP core network locations by end of 2015 with plans to have full global virtualization coverage in its IP core network and data centers by 2018. The company has already built its NFV platform in 36 network and data center locations in seven countries, with plans to expand into a total of 44 locations by the end of the year. CenturyLink also was one of the first providers to use NFV technology to virtualize security features such as firewalls and a content delivery network (CDN) to distribute video through its Prism<b><sup>&reg;</sup></b> TV service, providing quicker delivery of these services. In the coming months, CenturyLink will begin deploying a range of virtualized data and voice infrastructure services, including virtualized Multi Protocol&nbsp;Label Switching (MPLS) routers and Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) to enable dynamic delivery of scalable services for customers.</p>

<p>&quot;CenturyLink is taking its network assets and combining them with our expanded NFV platform and cloud services to create a customizable and dynamic applications marketplace infrastructure that will give businesses near real-time provisioning and more control over their service experience,&quot; said <span class="xn-person">Aamir Hussain</span>, CenturyLink executive vice president and chief technology officer. &quot;The customer experience is a top priority for CenturyLink. Integrating virtualized services into our network and developing an interactive marketplace and portal for our customers allows us to be more responsive to market opportunities and meet changing customer demands. We are pleased that our efforts position CenturyLink as an industry leader in virtualization.&quot;</p>

<p>CenturyLink is actively replacing hardware with software over its recently launched Programmable Services Backbone (PSB) to quickly deliver new services to enterprises and small and medium businesses through virtualized functions. CenturyLink and Ciena (formerly Cyan) <a href="http://news.centurylink.com/news/centurylink-to-offer-nfv-enhanced-services-to-enterprise-and-smb-customers-with-cyans-blue-planet" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> in <span class="xn-chron">March 2015</span> that the PSB will be mobilized by Ciena&#39;s <a href="http://www.blueplanet.com/products/nfv-orchestration.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Blue Planet NFV</a> Orchestrator. The PSB platform will bring SDN and NFV functions to CenturyLink&#39;s core and metro networks, and new next-generation CPE, bringing the company&#39;s networking, cloud, hosting and IT services into an integrated offering that will be accessed through a portal and set of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).</p>

<p>CenturyLink began implementing network virtualization and automation in 2013 when it partnered with five vendors to develop an open environment through common API structures, creating interoperability and enhancing the creation of applications. In <span class="xn-chron">February 2014</span>, CenturyLink <a href="http://news.centurylink.com/news/centurylink-will-enhance-customer-experience-with-ericsson-service-agility" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> its agreement with Ericsson to deliver a next-generation Operations Support Systems (OSS) and Business Support Systems (BSS) solution through a single, reliable transport infrastructure which can rapidly fulfill customer demands and create the support needed for implementing NFV and SDN services.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<p><strong>MONROE, La. </strong>&ndash; <a href="http://www.centurylink.com/">CenturyLink, Inc.</a> (NYSE: CTL) today announced that it has one of the largest fiber-enabled gigabit networks in the country and continues as an industry leader in the number of homes it has enabled with broadband speeds up to 1 gigabit per second (Gbps). CenturyLink now offers gigabit Internet service to residential and small business customers in <a href="http://news.centurylink.com/multimedia/album?id=53da4abaee750e413d00f8e7&amp;t=photo&amp;p=12&amp;s=order" target="_blank" title="">parts of 17 states</a> and, by the end of 2015, should have more than 700,000 households across the country enabled with fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) technology capable of uploading and downloading information at speeds up to 1 Gbps.</p>

<p>CenturyLink first launched gigabit service to residents and small businesses in <a href="http://news.centurylink.com/news/centurylink-to-make-omaha-one-of-the-fastest-broadband-cities-in-america">Omaha</a> in 2013 as part of a fiber network trial and in August 2014, <a href="http://news.centurylink.com/news/centurylink-expands-its-gigabit-service-to-16-cities-delivering-broadband-speeds-up-to-1-gigabit-per-second">announced</a> that it had expanded that gigabit service to residential and business customers in 16 markets. In May of this year, CenturyLink extended gigabit <a href="http://news.centurylink.com/news/centurylink-s-1-gbps-fiber-now-available-to-nearly-490-000-smb-locations-in-17-states-delivering-enterprise-class-ip-networking-voip-and-cloud-capabilities">fiber service</a> to additional small and midsized businesses (SMBs) located near the company&#39;s fiber network backbone or in fiber-fed multi-tenant unit office buildings, resulting in gigabit service being available to nearly 490,000 SMBs.</p>

<p>Today, CenturyLink is announcing that this ultra-fast gigabit service is now available to residential and small business customers in parts of six new states including Arizona, Idaho, Iowa, New Mexico, North Carolina and South Dakota.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We said from the very beginning that we weren&rsquo;t going to just talk about bringing gigabit speeds to our customers, but that we were going to deliver these speeds now. That&rsquo;s exactly what we&rsquo;ve done,&rdquo; said Shirish Lal, CenturyLink chief marketing officer. &ldquo;Consumers and small businesses are ready for a broadband service that is capable of keeping up with today&rsquo;s bandwidth demands. With the proliferation of the Internet of Things and the connection of everyday objects to the Internet and to one another, we are pleased to deliver speeds that can support these new technologies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>CenturyLink&rsquo;s efforts to enhance broadband speeds across the country are being noticed. The company was recently honored for being a national leader in the advancement of broadband fiber services and was given the 2015 FTTH Council&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.ftthcouncil.org/blog/ftth-council-recognizes-award-recipients-during-2015-annual-conference-expo">Chairman&rsquo;s Award</a> in acknowledgement of the company&rsquo;s tremendous efforts to promote, educate and accelerate deployment of fiber-to-the-home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;CenturyLink does not boast about their success unless the deployment is real, and in our opinion, they&#39;ve certainly got a lot to be proud of,&rdquo; said FTTH Council President and CEO Heather Burnett Gold. &ldquo;It is clear the company is on fire for fiber!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A recent FTTH Council <a href="http://www.ftthcouncil.org/blog/study-shows-home-values-up-3.1-with-access-to-fiber">study</a> shows that access to gigabit networking can add more than $5,400 to the value of the average U.S. home.</p>

<p>CenturyLink is also deploying Prism<strong><sup>&reg;</sup></strong> TV, an interactive TV service delivered through CenturyLink&rsquo;s nationwide fiber optic network, in many cities where it is offering gigabit service and has secured franchise agreements. Prism<strong><sup>&reg;</sup></strong> TV is an alternative to cable and satellite services and provides customers with the latest in entertainment technology.</p>

<p><strong>MONROE, La</strong>. &ndash; <a href="http://www.centurylink.com/">CenturyLink, Inc.</a> (NYSE: CTL) is dedicated to protecting its customers. To help its customers from becoming victims of scammers, CenturyLink is sharing information regarding one of the most common forms of fraud called &ldquo;phishing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phishing has become one of the fastest growing forms of fraud. It is a criminal activity that uses e-mail or unsolicited phone calls to acquire personal information, such as banking information, Social Security numbers, user IDs or passwords.</p>

<p>&ldquo;CenturyLink strives to protect its customers from phishing attacks. We will never call or email &nbsp;customers to ask for bank account information, social security numbers or to verify a home address.&nbsp;These are all examples of potential phishing scams,&rdquo; said Dave Mahon, CenturyLink&rsquo;s vice president and chief security officer. &ldquo;In the case of a suspected phishing call, live or automated, we advise you to hang up. We welcome calls from our customers with any questions or concerns.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The concept behind phishing involves leveraging a trusted relationship between a person and a familiar business in order to lure that person into revealing sensitive information. An e-mail message may include text urgently asking to &ldquo;verify your account&rdquo; or &ldquo;confirm billing information.&rdquo; A phishing phone call may appear to be from a familiar source, a highly-recognizable business or a survey conductor attempting to gain personal and financial information.</p>

<p>If a phone call is suspected as a scam, hang up without offering personal information. If an email is received and suspected as a scam, consider installing filtering software and forwarding the message to the actual organization. CenturyLink customers can take advantage of the company&rsquo;s filtering software and forward emails to <a href="mailto:phishing@centurylinkservices.net">phishing@centurylinkservices.net</a>.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.ftthcouncil.org/blog/study-shows-home-values-up-3.1-with-access-to-fiber" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">new study</a> from the Fiber to the Home (FTTH) Council verifies what consumers, analysts and media have also acknowledged: There is strong economic benefit and steadily growing demand for high-speed Internet in areas where 1 gigabit bandwidth is present, even for the consumers who don&#39;t yet require gigabit access and the neighborhoods where gigabit service has not yet arrived.</p>

<p>CenturyLink is a national leader in the advancement of broadband fiber services and was recently given the 2015 FTTH Council&#39;s <a href="http://www.ftthcouncil.org/blog/ftth-council-recognizes-award-recipients-during-2015-annual-conference-expo" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Chairman&#39;s Award</a> in acknowledgement of the company&#39;s tremendous efforts to promote, educate and accelerate deployment of fiber-to-the-home. Since its initial announcement of gigabit capability in 2013, the company has made gigabit service available to residential and business customers in parts of 17 states, including <span class="xn-location">Utah</span>, where gigabit speeds are available to residents, businesses and educational institutions. CenturyLink currently provides gigabit broadband services to more than 20,000 <span class="xn-location">Utah</span> residential customers and will make the service available to 100,000 residential locations within the next 12 months. Gigabit service is also available to almost 20,000 <span class="xn-location">Utah</span> business locations.</p>

<p>&quot;CenturyLink&#39;s significant investment in Internet speeds up to 1 gigabit per second is bringing great economic opportunities to <span class="xn-location">Utah</span>,&quot; said <span class="xn-person">Jeremy Ferkin</span>, CenturyLink vice president of operations for <span class="xn-location">Utah</span>. &quot;For businesses, schools and homes, the benefits of the &#39;Gigabit Economy&#39; are clear.&quot;</p>

<p>The FTTH <a href="http://www.ftthcouncil.org/blog/study-shows-home-values-up-3.1-with-access-to-fiber" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">study</a> shows that access to gigabit networking can add more than <span class="xn-money">$5,400</span> to the value of the average U.S. home, and that sales prices were seven percent higher than for homes with broadband speeds of 25 Mbps or lower.</p>

<p>&quot;Our recent <a href="http://www.ftthcouncil.org/p/bl/ar/blogaid=305" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">studies</a> suggest that communities where gigabit service is broadly available have a per capita gross domestic product (GDP) that is 1.1 percent higher than communities with little or no access to gigabit services,&quot; said FTTH Council President and CEO <span class="xn-person">Heather Gold</span>. &quot;In dollar terms, this has meant approximately <span class="xn-money">$1.4 billion</span> in additional GDP for the communities with broad access. Clearly, every community should be a gigabit community.&quot;</p>

<p>As the first provider to bring gigabit fiber service to <span class="xn-location">Salt Lake City</span>, CenturyLink is demonstrating its commitment and gratitude to Utahns by performing good deeds in <span class="xn-location">Salt Lake City</span> during the three-day celebration <span class="xn-chron">July 27-29</span>. CenturyLink employees will perform a variety of scheduled and spontaneous acts of charity in <span class="xn-location">Salt Lake City</span> to celebrate that CenturyLink is #HereForGood:&nbsp;</p>

<ul type="disc">
	<li>On <span class="xn-chron">July 27</span>, CenturyLink will provide free gigabit service to selected recipients in their home, donate Smart Classroom equipment to a school and will interview a business on the game changing benefits of gigabit service and how it has impacted their business.</li>
	<li>On <span class="xn-chron">July 28</span>, company employees will celebrate the speed of 1 gigabit service, which is equivalent to 1,000 megabits per second, by providing 1,000 free juice smoothies at the City Creek Center in Salt Lake during the lunch hour. In addition, the company will give 1,000 tennis balls to the Liberty Park Tennis Center and donate 1,000 cans of food to the Utah Food Bank.</li>
	<li>On <span class="xn-chron">July 29</span>, company employees will perform spontaneous good deeds throughout the city to promote the emphasis on not only being <span class="xn-location">Salt Lake City&#39;s</span> first provider of gigabit fiber services, but also to demonstrate the company&#39;s commitment to the <span class="xn-location">Utah</span> community, thus the campaign #HereForGood.</li>

<p>&ldquo;CenturyLink does not boast about their success unless the deployment is real, and in our opinion, they&#39;ve certainly got a lot to be proud of,&rdquo; said FTTH Council President and CEO Heather Burnett Gold. &ldquo;Since CenturyLink announced its first gigabit pilot in mid-2013, it has carefully rolled out service in several communities in 17 states across the U.S. It is clear the company is on fire for fiber!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Chairman&rsquo;s Award, given at the discretion of the Chairman of the FTTH Council Board of Directors, singles out an individual or company that has shown tremendous effort to promote, educate or accelerate the deployment of fiber-to-the-home.</p>

History[edit]
The earliest predecessor of CenturyLink was the Oak Ridge Telephone Company in Oak Ridge, Louisiana, which was owned by F. E. Hogan, Sr. In 1930, Hogan sold the company, with 75 paid subscribers, to William Clarke and Marie Williams, for $500. They moved the switchboard to the Williams family front parlor. In 1946, the Williams' son, Clarke McRae Williams, received ownership of the family's telephone company as a wedding gift.[1] In 1947, Clarke Williams learned the telephone company in Marion, Louisiana was for sale. With a loan from business associate Joe Sydney Carter, Clarke purchased the Marion Telephone Company and eventually made it his base of operation as he grew his company through more acquisitions. CenturyLink still maintains offices in the former headquarters building.[6] The company remained as a family-operated business until it became incorporated in 1968.[1][7]
Central Telephone and Electronics[edit]
By 1967, Oak Ridge Telephone Company served three states with 10,000 access lines. That year the company was incorporated as Central Telephone and Electronics. Clarke M. Williams served as president and chairman of the board.[1] Between 1972 and 1975, Clarke gradually moved his headquarters from Marion to Monroe, Louisiana, to access the larger employee base and to be near the airport.
Century Telephone Enterprises[edit]




Century Telephone logo


In 1971, the company was renamed as Century Telephone Enterprises, Inc.[1][7] In 1972, Century Telephone acquired the La Crosse Telephone Corporation, of Wisconsin.[1]
On October 24, 1978, Century Telephone moved to the New York Stock Exchange for the first time and began to trade under the ticker symbol CTL.[1]
Century Telephone performed well during the long bear market of the 1970s, as its stock rose over fourfold. The company provided telephone service in parts of 14 states by that time.[8]
In 1981, Century Telephone acquired War Telephone in West Virginia.
In 1982, Century Telephone's earnings peaked at $14 million, then declined in 1983 following the early 1980s recession, and finally began to recover in 1984. However, the 1983 decline led to a loss of half the value of the company's stock in 1984.[8]
In 1985, both earnings and the stock price had recovered to new record highs. But by then, the company had accumulated $206 million in long-term debt.[8] Century Telephone sold the operations of War Telephone and two other companies to Colonial Telephone for $4.66 million.[9]
In 1987, the stock price nearly doubled from its low that year, and from its old 1982 record high, before falling back by a third in the 1987 stock market crash. Earnings had steadily grown each year from their 1983 low, and by 1987 reached nearly US$20 million.[8]
In 1989, Century Telephone Enterprises acquired Universal Telephone, Inc. for US$90 million in cash.[1] During the late 1980s the company began a long trend in which it performed extremely well. The stock split three-for-two twice in this period, as earnings steadily grew, through the 1990-1991 recession, and by year-end 1991, they reached nearly US$40 million, double from what they had been in 1987.[8]
In 1992, Century Telephone acquired Central Telephone Company of Ohio, a Centel subsidiary, for $135 million. The acquisition served more than 65,000 access lines, and added 20% to Century's access line total. Also that year Glen F. Post III became Chief Executive Officer and, named Vice Chairman of the Board of Century Telephone.[1]
In 1993, Century Telephone revenues were over $425 million, up from about $350 million in 1992. 1993 earnings were nearly $80 million, up from about $70 million in 1992, excluding a nearly $16 million charge in 1992 due to the cumulative effect from an accounting change that year.[8][10] Also in 1993 the company split its stock three-for-two yet again. However, by then the company had accumulated nearly $520 million in long-term debt.[8]
By 1995, Century Telephone Enterprises had been added to the S&P MidCap 400 index. Earnings had continued their steady growth trend through the 1994 economic soft landing, and by 1995 they reached over US$115 million. But the long-term debt continued to grow as well, reaching US$623 million that year.[8]
In 1997, Century Telephone acquired Delta Security Alarm Co., Inc. of Monroe, Louisiana, and its largest acquisition up until that time, Pacific Telecom, doubling its size with 660,000 additional telephone access lines in 12 states.[1] Pacific Telecom, Inc., would continue existence and was renamed CenturyTel of the Northwest, Inc.
In 1998, Century Telephone split its stock three-for-two once again. The company acquired another Monroe, Louisiana security company, Century Protection Systems, and also acquired 89,000 access lines and 19 exchanges in 21 northern Wisconsin communities from Ameritech. The affected customers had formerly been served by Wisconsin Bell. Ameritech's directory publishing operations serving those customers were also acquired.[11]
CenturyTel[edit]

In 1999, the company was renamed as CenturyTel, Inc.[12] It split its stock three-for-two once more, and was added to the Standard & Poor's 500 Index that year.[1]
In 2000, CenturyTel acquired 230,500 GTE lines in Arkansas, and also bought 127,000 GTE lines in Missouri in partnership with Spectra Communications.[13][14] In Wisconsin, it acquired 133,000 additional lines, and 70,500 access lines for US$195 million from Verizon. That year CenturyTel also bought 62,650 lines for US$170 million in partnership with Telephone USA of Wisconsin, LLC.[15]
In 2001, CenturyTel acquired CSW Net, Inc. of Russellville, Arkansas, and fended off a hostile take-over attempt by ALLTEL, Inc.[16][17]
In 2002, the son of the company's original founder and Chairman of the Board Clarke M. Williams died. He was succeeded by then Vice Chairman Glen F. Post III. The company sold its wireless business to ALLTEL, to become a pure-play rural local exchange carrier. Also that year CenturyTel acquired 300,000 Verizon access lines in Alabama, and 354,000 Verizon access lines in Missouri, bringing its total operations to 22 states with 2.5 million access lines.[18]
In 2003, CenturyTel acquired half ownership of SkyComm International, Inc. in Houston, Texas, in March, to form a satellite teleport for its global Network Access Point (NAP) system. In June, CenturyTel also acquired the fiber network of Digital Teleport, Inc., a 5,700-mile (9,200 km) route running from Illinois to Texas, and adjoining states.[19] CenturyTel renamed the network company LightCore.[20] Closing out the year, in December CenturyTel acquired the Midwest Fiber Optic Network (MFON) from Level 3 Communications, Inc. in December, a stand-alone system in the same core central states as LightCore.[1]
In August 2004, it partnered with EchoStar Communications Corporation for DISH Network multi-channel digital TV.[21] In September, CenturyTel began a relationship with Cingular Wireless.[22]
In 2005, CenturyTel began a wireless voice and data service, and bought a number of fiber networks in the central United States, from KMC Telecom Holdings, Inc.[23]
In 2006, CenturyTel sold its Arizona assets to Hopi Telecommunications, Inc., bringing total operations to 23 states.[1]
In May 2007, CenturyTel acquired Madison River Communications, based out of Mebane, NC and parent company to four LECs (AL, GA, IL, and NC) as well as CLEC operations in IL, LA, and NC. The LECs included Mebtel Communications, a telephone company serving Alamance County, North Carolina;[24][25] GulfTel Communications, based out of Foley, AL and serving Baldwin and surrounding counties;[26][27] Coastal Communications, based out of Hinesville, GA; and Gallatin River Communications, serving the Dixon, Galesburg, and Pekin areas of IL.
In late 2007, the Customer Respect Group, an international research and consulting firm that focuses on how corporations treat their online customers, ranked CenturyTel the best among six leading communications providers.
Acquisition of Embarq[edit]

On October 27, 2008, Embarq announced that it would be acquired by CenturyTel, Inc. in an all-stock transaction valued at about $6 billion.[28][29] CenturyTel's CEO Glen Post would remain CEO of the merged company following the acquisition,[30] and remained CEO as of 2015.[31] Embarq was the former landline business of Sprint and served cities in 18 states, including Nevada, Florida, North Carolina and Ohio.[32] The deal made CenturyTel the third-largest landline phone provider in Pennsylvania behind Verizon (through both Verizon Pennsylvania and Verizon North) and Comcast.
Name change to CenturyLink[edit]
On June 2, 2009, a press release announced that the combined CenturyTel/Embarq entity would be called CenturyLink.[33] Denver-based Monigle Associates was retained to formulate the new brand strategy. The acquisition was completed on July 1, 2009.[34]
On October 19, 2009, CenturyTel and Embarq brandings were retired, and all business was officially conducted under the CenturyLink banner, continuing to trade on the NYSE under the CenturyTel stock ticker CTL. The new corporate name, CenturyLink, Inc., did not become official until May 2010.[35][29]
Acquisition of Qwest[edit]




Network map of combined Qwest and CenturyLink assets


On April 22, 2010, CenturyLink (at this point still legally known as CenturyTel, Inc.) announced it would acquire Qwest in a stock-for-stock transaction.[36] Under the agreement, CenturyLink would swap 0.1664 of its shares for each share of Qwest; as a result, CenturyLink shareholders prior to the merger wound up with 50.5% share of ownership in the combined company, while former Qwest shareholders gained the remaining 49.5%.[37] The valuation of CenturyLink's purchase was $12 billion.[28] The merger was completed on April 1, 2011.[38][39]
The addition of Qwest allowed CenturyLink to become the third largest telecommunications company in the United States, and the largest landline phone provider in the state of Colorado.[31] The new company has 17 million access lines, 5 million broadband customers, and 1.4 million video subscribers across 37 states.[40] The merger also made CenturyLink owner of one of the so-called Baby Bells: Qwest included what was once US West, the Baby Bell for much of the western United States.
Acquisition of Savvis[edit]
On July 15, 2011,[32] CenturyLink acquired Savvis, Inc., a global provider of cloud infrastructure and hosted IT solutions for $2 billion, which represented all outstanding shares of Savvis common stock at $40 per share.[28][41] This acquisition allowed CenturyLink to provide expanded managed hosting and cloud services.[42]
On December 4, 2012,[43] CenturyLink launched an integrated suite of cloud services called savvisdirect.[44] Savvisdirect was an expansion of CenturyLink’s portfolio of Savvis cloud services and includes cloud application hosting,[45] cloud servers,[46] cloud storage,[47] and private cloud[48] for small businesses, IT admins and developers. CenturyLink later shuttered the savvisdirect subsidiary, consolidating their cloud service offerings internally.
On October 16, 2012 Savvis acquired to ITO Business Division of Ciber thereby adding managed services to the portfolio.
Acquisition of AppFog[edit]
On June 14, 2013, CenturyLink announced the acquisition of AppFog, a Portland-based Platform as a Service used by over 100,000 developers to automate the deployment of software on public clouds such as Amazon Web Services and OpenStack.[49]
Acquisition of Tier 3[edit]
On November 19, 2013, CenturyLink announced the acquisition of Tier 3, a Seattle-based infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform, and advanced cloud management company[50] based on Cloud Foundry.[51]
Acquisition of Cognilytics[edit]
On December 11, 2014, CenturyLink announced the acquisition of Cognilytics, a predictive analytics and big data solution provider.[52]
Acquisition of Level 3[edit]
On October 31, 2016, CenturyLink announced its intent to acquire Level 3 Communications in a deal valued at around $25 billion.[53]

Television[edit]
Main article: Prism TV
CenturyLink offers a fiber-optic based IPTV service named Prism TV in select markets.[57] In areas where Prism TV is not available, CenturyLink partners with DirecTV. CenturyLink formerly offered Dish Network bundles to their customers,[58] a remnant from the company's days before its acquisition of Qwest. In May 2014, CenturyLink reported that it had nearly 200,000 Prism TV subscribers.[59]

Fiber[edit]
CenturyLink Fiber is a fiber to the premises service in the United States, providing broadband Internet and Prism TV to a small and slowly growing number of locations. The service was first introduced to Omaha, Nebraska,[73] and next rolled out to Las Vegas, Nevada,[74] with plans for expansion to several other markets.[75] Unlike the company's existing high speed Internet deployments, which utilize fiber-to the node/neighborhood to increase the speed of DSL up to 40 Mbit/s with ADSL+ or VDSL2 technology,[76] in these markets CenturyLink now installs their fiber optic cable all the way to the home or business with speeds up to 1,000 Mbit/s download and 1,000 Mbit/s upload[77] using Calix Optical Network Terminals.[78] On Feb. 2, 2014, CenturyLink announced the availability of Gigabit fiber service to multi-tenant businesses in Salt Lake City and surrounding communities.[79] On Aug. 5, 2014, CenturyLink announced the expansion of its gigabit fiber service to 16 additional markets.[80] On Sep, 15, 2015, CenturyLink announced the expansion of its gigabit fiber service to residential and business customers in six additional states, increasing the company's service coverage to select areas of 17 states.[81]

** Citizens of these communities dispute this data. CenturyLink has provided fiber backbone to some areas, but most customers in these areas are not even served with basic broadband. The local broadband committee was unable to find any residential houses with fiber to the house.
Data centers[edit]
CenturyLink currently operates 55 data centers in North America,[87] Asia Pacific,[88] and Europe,[89] and is the second largest retail colocation provider in the US.[90] The company is currently constructing 3 new data centers in Chicago, IL, Minneapolis, MN, and Irvine, CA.[91]
Organizational structure[edit]
The combined company's 37-state service area is organized into five regions and led by region presidents.[92] The region presidents are responsible for revenue, customer retention, customer satisfaction, and service delivery throughout their local markets.[93] The regions, region presidents, region headquarters locations, and states within each region are:

History[edit]
The earliest predecessor of CenturyLink was the Oak Ridge Telephone Company in Oak Ridge, Louisiana, which was owned by F. E. Hogan, Sr. In 1930, Hogan sold the company, with 75 paid subscribers, to William Clarke and Marie Williams, for $500. They moved the switchboard to the Williams family front parlor. In 1946, the Williams' son, Clarke McRae Williams, received ownership of the family's telephone company as a wedding gift.[1] In 1947, Clarke Williams learned the telephone company in Marion, Louisiana was for sale. With a loan from business associate Joe Sydney Carter, Clarke purchased the Marion Telephone Company and eventually made it his base of operation as he grew his company through more acquisitions. CenturyLink still maintains offices in the former headquarters building.[6] The company remained as a family-operated business until it became incorporated in 1968.[1][7]
Central Telephone and Electronics[edit]
By 1967, Oak Ridge Telephone Company served three states with 10,000 access lines. That year the company was incorporated as Central Telephone and Electronics. Clarke M. Williams served as president and chairman of the board.[1] Between 1972 and 1975, Clarke gradually moved his headquarters from Marion to Monroe, Louisiana, to access the larger employee base and to be near the airport.
Century Telephone Enterprises[edit]




Century Telephone logo


In 1971, the company was renamed as Century Telephone Enterprises, Inc.[1][7] In 1972, Century Telephone acquired the La Crosse Telephone Corporation, of Wisconsin.[1]
On October 24, 1978, Century Telephone moved to the New York Stock Exchange for the first time and began to trade under the ticker symbol CTL.[1]
Century Telephone performed well during the long bear market of the 1970s, as its stock rose over fourfold. The company provided telephone service in parts of 14 states by that time.[8]
In 1981, Century Telephone acquired War Telephone in West Virginia.
In 1982, Century Telephone's earnings peaked at $14 million, then declined in 1983 following the early 1980s recession, and finally began to recover in 1984. However, the 1983 decline led to a loss of half the value of the company's stock in 1984.[8]
In 1985, both earnings and the stock price had recovered to new record highs. But by then, the company had accumulated $206 million in long-term debt.[8] Century Telephone sold the operations of War Telephone and two other companies to Colonial Telephone for $4.66 million.[9]
In 1987, the stock price nearly doubled from its low that year, and from its old 1982 record high, before falling back by a third in the 1987 stock market crash. Earnings had steadily grown each year from their 1983 low, and by 1987 reached nearly US$20 million.[8]
In 1989, Century Telephone Enterprises acquired Universal Telephone, Inc. for US$90 million in cash.[1] During the late 1980s the company began a long trend in which it performed extremely well. The stock split three-for-two twice in this period, as earnings steadily grew, through the 1990-1991 recession, and by year-end 1991, they reached nearly US$40 million, double from what they had been in 1987.[8]
In 1992, Century Telephone acquired Central Telephone Company of Ohio, a Centel subsidiary, for $135 million. The acquisition served more than 65,000 access lines, and added 20% to Century's access line total. Also that year Glen F. Post III became Chief Executive Officer and, named Vice Chairman of the Board of Century Telephone.[1]
In 1993, Century Telephone revenues were over $425 million, up from about $350 million in 1992. 1993 earnings were nearly $80 million, up from about $70 million in 1992, excluding a nearly $16 million charge in 1992 due to the cumulative effect from an accounting change that year.[8][10] Also in 1993 the company split its stock three-for-two yet again. However, by then the company had accumulated nearly $520 million in long-term debt.[8]
By 1995, Century Telephone Enterprises had been added to the S&P MidCap 400 index. Earnings had continued their steady growth trend through the 1994 economic soft landing, and by 1995 they reached over US$115 million. But the long-term debt continued to grow as well, reaching US$623 million that year.[8]
In 1997, Century Telephone acquired Delta Security Alarm Co., Inc. of Monroe, Louisiana, and its largest acquisition up until that time, Pacific Telecom, doubling its size with 660,000 additional telephone access lines in 12 states.[1] Pacific Telecom, Inc., would continue existence and was renamed CenturyTel of the Northwest, Inc.
In 1998, Century Telephone split its stock three-for-two once again. The company acquired another Monroe, Louisiana security company, Century Protection Systems, and also acquired 89,000 access lines and 19 exchanges in 21 northern Wisconsin communities from Ameritech. The affected customers had formerly been served by Wisconsin Bell. Ameritech's directory publishing operations serving those customers were also acquired.[11]
CenturyTel[edit]

In 1999, the company was renamed as CenturyTel, Inc.[12] It split its stock three-for-two once more, and was added to the Standard & Poor's 500 Index that year.[1]
In 2000, CenturyTel acquired 230,500 GTE lines in Arkansas, and also bought 127,000 GTE lines in Missouri in partnership with Spectra Communications.[13][14] In Wisconsin, it acquired 133,000 additional lines, and 70,500 access lines for US$195 million from Verizon. That year CenturyTel also bought 62,650 lines for US$170 million in partnership with Telephone USA of Wisconsin, LLC.[15]
In 2001, CenturyTel acquired CSW Net, Inc. of Russellville, Arkansas, and fended off a hostile take-over attempt by ALLTEL, Inc.[16][17]
In 2002, the son of the company's original founder and Chairman of the Board Clarke M. Williams died. He was succeeded by then Vice Chairman Glen F. Post III. The company sold its wireless business to ALLTEL, to become a pure-play rural local exchange carrier. Also that year CenturyTel acquired 300,000 Verizon access lines in Alabama, and 354,000 Verizon access lines in Missouri, bringing its total operations to 22 states with 2.5 million access lines.[18]
In 2003, CenturyTel acquired half ownership of SkyComm International, Inc. in Houston, Texas, in March, to form a satellite teleport for its global Network Access Point (NAP) system. In June, CenturyTel also acquired the fiber network of Digital Teleport, Inc., a 5,700-mile (9,200 km) route running from Illinois to Texas, and adjoining states.[19] CenturyTel renamed the network company LightCore.[20] Closing out the year, in December CenturyTel acquired the Midwest Fiber Optic Network (MFON) from Level 3 Communications, Inc. in December, a stand-alone system in the same core central states as LightCore.[1]
In August 2004, it partnered with EchoStar Communications Corporation for DISH Network multi-channel digital TV.[21] In September, CenturyTel began a relationship with Cingular Wireless.[22]
In 2005, CenturyTel began a wireless voice and data service, and bought a number of fiber networks in the central United States, from KMC Telecom Holdings, Inc.[23]
In 2006, CenturyTel sold its Arizona assets to Hopi Telecommunications, Inc., bringing total operations to 23 states.[1]
In May 2007, CenturyTel acquired Madison River Communications, based out of Mebane, NC and parent company to four LECs (AL, GA, IL, and NC) as well as CLEC operations in IL, LA, and NC. The LECs included Mebtel Communications, a telephone company serving Alamance County, North Carolina;[24][25] GulfTel Communications, based out of Foley, AL and serving Baldwin and surrounding counties;[26][27] Coastal Communications, based out of Hinesville, GA; and Gallatin River Communications, serving the Dixon, Galesburg, and Pekin areas of IL.
In late 2007, the Customer Respect Group, an international research and consulting firm that focuses on how corporations treat their online customers, ranked CenturyTel the best among six leading communications providers.
Acquisition of Embarq[edit]

On October 27, 2008, Embarq announced that it would be acquired by CenturyTel, Inc. in an all-stock transaction valued at about $6 billion.[28][29] CenturyTel's CEO Glen Post would remain CEO of the merged company following the acquisition,[30] and remained CEO as of 2015.[31] Embarq was the former landline business of Sprint and served cities in 18 states, including Nevada, Florida, North Carolina and Ohio.[32] The deal made CenturyTel the third-largest landline phone provider in Pennsylvania behind Verizon (through both Verizon Pennsylvania and Verizon North) and Comcast.
Name change to CenturyLink[edit]
On June 2, 2009, a press release announced that the combined CenturyTel/Embarq entity would be called CenturyLink.[33] Denver-based Monigle Associates was retained to formulate the new brand strategy. The acquisition was completed on July 1, 2009.[34]
On October 19, 2009, CenturyTel and Embarq brandings were retired, and all business was officially conducted under the CenturyLink banner, continuing to trade on the NYSE under the CenturyTel stock ticker CTL. The new corporate name, CenturyLink, Inc., did not become official until May 2010.[35][29]
Acquisition of Qwest[edit]

On April 22, 2010, CenturyLink (at this point still legally known as CenturyTel, Inc.) announced it would acquire Qwest in a stock-for-stock transaction.[36] Under the agreement, CenturyLink would swap 0.1664 of its shares for each share of Qwest; as a result, CenturyLink shareholders prior to the merger wound up with 50.5% share of ownership in the combined company, while former Qwest shareholders gained the remaining 49.5%.[37] The valuation of CenturyLink's purchase was $12 billion.[28] The merger was completed on April 1, 2011.[38][39]
The addition of Qwest allowed CenturyLink to become the third largest telecommunications company in the United States, and the largest landline phone provider in the state of Colorado.[31] The new company has 17 million access lines, 5 million broadband customers, and 1.4 million video subscribers across 37 states.[40] The merger also made CenturyLink owner of one of the so-called Baby Bells: Qwest included what was once US West, the Baby Bell for much of the western United States.
Acquisition of Savvis[edit]
On July 15, 2011,[32] CenturyLink acquired Savvis, Inc., a global provider of cloud infrastructure and hosted IT solutions for $2 billion, which represented all outstanding shares of Savvis common stock at $40 per share.[28][41] This acquisition allowed CenturyLink to provide expanded managed hosting and cloud services.[42]
On December 4, 2012,[43] CenturyLink launched an integrated suite of cloud services called savvisdirect.[44] Savvisdirect was an expansion of CenturyLink’s portfolio of Savvis cloud services and includes cloud application hosting,[45] cloud servers,[46] cloud storage,[47] and private cloud[48] for small businesses, IT admins and developers. CenturyLink later shuttered the savvisdirect subsidiary, consolidating their cloud service offerings internally.
On October 16, 2012 Savvis acquired to ITO Business Division of Ciber thereby adding managed services to the portfolio.
Acquisition of AppFog[edit]
On June 14, 2013, CenturyLink announced the acquisition of AppFog, a Portland-based Platform as a Service used by over 100,000 developers to automate the deployment of software on public clouds such as Amazon Web Services and OpenStack.[49]
Acquisition of Tier 3[edit]
On November 19, 2013, CenturyLink announced the acquisition of Tier 3, a Seattle-based infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform, and advanced cloud management company[50] based on Cloud Foundry.[51]
Acquisition of Cognilytics[edit]
On December 11, 2014, CenturyLink announced the acquisition of Cognilytics, a predictive analytics and big data solution provider.[52]
Acquisition of Level 3[edit]
On October 31, 2016, CenturyLink announced its intent to acquire Level 3 Communications in a deal valued at around $25 billion.[53]

Main article: Prism TV
CenturyLink offers a fiber-optic based IPTV service named Prism TV in select markets.[57] In areas where Prism TV is not available, CenturyLink partners with DirecTV. CenturyLink formerly offered Dish Network bundles to their customers,[58] a remnant from the company's days before its acquisition of Qwest. In May 2014, CenturyLink reported that it had nearly 200,000 Prism TV subscribers.[59]

Fiber[edit]
CenturyLink Fiber is a fiber to the premises service in the United States, providing broadband Internet and Prism TV to a small and slowly growing number of locations. The service was first introduced to Omaha, Nebraska,[73] and next rolled out to Las Vegas, Nevada,[74] with plans for expansion to several other markets.[75] Unlike the company's existing high speed Internet deployments, which utilize fiber-to the node/neighborhood to increase the speed of DSL up to 40 Mbit/s with ADSL+ or VDSL2 technology,[76] in these markets CenturyLink now installs their fiber optic cable all the way to the home or business with speeds up to 1,000 Mbit/s download and 1,000 Mbit/s upload[77] using Calix Optical Network Terminals.[78] On Feb. 2, 2014, CenturyLink announced the availability of Gigabit fiber service to multi-tenant businesses in Salt Lake City and surrounding communities.[79] On Aug. 5, 2014, CenturyLink announced the expansion of its gigabit fiber service to 16 additional markets.[80] On Sep, 15, 2015, CenturyLink announced the expansion of its gigabit fiber service to residential and business customers in six additional states, increasing the company's service coverage to select areas of 17 states.[81]

** Citizens of these communities dispute this data. CenturyLink has provided fiber backbone to some areas, but most customers in these areas are not even served with basic broadband. The local broadband committee was unable to find any residential houses with fiber to the house.
Data centers[edit]
CenturyLink currently operates 55 data centers in North America,[87] Asia Pacific,[88] and Europe,[89] and is the second largest retail colocation provider in the US.[90] The company is currently constructing 3 new data centers in Chicago, IL, Minneapolis, MN, and Irvine, CA.[91]
Organizational structure[edit]
The combined company's 37-state service area is organized into five regions and led by region presidents.[92] The region presidents are responsible for revenue, customer retention, customer satisfaction, and service delivery throughout their local markets.[93] The regions, region presidents, region headquarters locations, and states within each region are:

History[edit]
The earliest predecessor of CenturyLink was the Oak Ridge Telephone Company in Oak Ridge, Louisiana, which was owned by F. E. Hogan, Sr. In 1930, Hogan sold the company, with 75 paid subscribers, to William Clarke and Marie Williams, for $500. They moved the switchboard to the Williams family front parlor. In 1946, the Williams' son, Clarke McRae Williams, received ownership of the family's telephone company as a wedding gift.[1] In 1947, Clarke Williams learned the telephone company in Marion, Louisiana was for sale. With a loan from business associate Joe Sydney Carter, Clarke purchased the Marion Telephone Company and eventually made it his base of operation as he grew his company through more acquisitions. CenturyLink still maintains offices in the former headquarters building.[6] The company remained as a family-operated business until it became incorporated in 1968.[1][7]
Central Telephone and Electronics[edit]
By 1967, Oak Ridge Telephone Company served three states with 10,000 access lines. That year the company was incorporated as Central Telephone and Electronics. Clarke M. Williams served as president and chairman of the board.[1] Between 1972 and 1975, Clarke gradually moved his headquarters from Marion to Monroe, Louisiana, to access the larger employee base and to be near the airport.
Century Telephone Enterprises[edit]

In 1971, the company was renamed as Century Telephone Enterprises, Inc.[1][7] In 1972, Century Telephone acquired the La Crosse Telephone Corporation, of Wisconsin.[1]
On October 24, 1978, Century Telephone moved to the New York Stock Exchange for the first time and began to trade under the ticker symbol CTL.[1]
Century Telephone performed well during the long bear market of the 1970s, as its stock rose over fourfold. The company provided telephone service in parts of 14 states by that time.[8]
In 1981, Century Telephone acquired War Telephone in West Virginia.
In 1982, Century Telephone's earnings peaked at $14 million, then declined in 1983 following the early 1980s recession, and finally began to recover in 1984. However, the 1983 decline led to a loss of half the value of the company's stock in 1984.[8]
In 1985, both earnings and the stock price had recovered to new record highs. But by then, the company had accumulated $206 million in long-term debt.[8] Century Telephone sold the operations of War Telephone and two other companies to Colonial Telephone for $4.66 million.[9]
In 1987, the stock price nearly doubled from its low that year, and from its old 1982 record high, before falling back by a third in the 1987 stock market crash. Earnings had steadily grown each year from their 1983 low, and by 1987 reached nearly US$20 million.[8]
In 1989, Century Telephone Enterprises acquired Universal Telephone, Inc. for US$90 million in cash.[1] During the late 1980s the company began a long trend in which it performed extremely well. The stock split three-for-two twice in this period, as earnings steadily grew, through the 1990-1991 recession, and by year-end 1991, they reached nearly US$40 million, double from what they had been in 1987.[8]
In 1992, Century Telephone acquired Central Telephone Company of Ohio, a Centel subsidiary, for $135 million. The acquisition served more than 65,000 access lines, and added 20% to Century's access line total. Also that year Glen F. Post III became Chief Executive Officer and, named Vice Chairman of the Board of Century Telephone.[1]
In 1993, Century Telephone revenues were over $425 million, up from about $350 million in 1992. 1993 earnings were nearly $80 million, up from about $70 million in 1992, excluding a nearly $16 million charge in 1992 due to the cumulative effect from an accounting change that year.[8][10] Also in 1993 the company split its stock three-for-two yet again. However, by then the company had accumulated nearly $520 million in long-term debt.[8]
By 1995, Century Telephone Enterprises had been added to the S&P MidCap 400 index. Earnings had continued their steady growth trend through the 1994 economic soft landing, and by 1995 they reached over US$115 million. But the long-term debt continued to grow as well, reaching US$623 million that year.[8]
In 1997, Century Telephone acquired Delta Security Alarm Co., Inc. of Monroe, Louisiana, and its largest acquisition up until that time, Pacific Telecom, doubling its size with 660,000 additional telephone access lines in 12 states.[1] Pacific Telecom, Inc., would continue existence and was renamed CenturyTel of the Northwest, Inc.
In 1998, Century Telephone split its stock three-for-two once again. The company acquired another Monroe, Louisiana security company, Century Protection Systems, and also acquired 89,000 access lines and 19 exchanges in 21 northern Wisconsin communities from Ameritech. The affected customers had formerly been served by Wisconsin Bell. Ameritech's directory publishing operations serving those customers were also acquired.[11]
CenturyTel[edit]

In 1999, the company was renamed as CenturyTel, Inc.[12] It split its stock three-for-two once more, and was added to the Standard & Poor's 500 Index that year.[1]
In 2000, CenturyTel acquired 230,500 GTE lines in Arkansas, and also bought 127,000 GTE lines in Missouri in partnership with Spectra Communications.[13][14] In Wisconsin, it acquired 133,000 additional lines, and 70,500 access lines for US$195 million from Verizon. That year CenturyTel also bought 62,650 lines for US$170 million in partnership with Telephone USA of Wisconsin, LLC.[15]
In 2001, CenturyTel acquired CSW Net, Inc. of Russellville, Arkansas, and fended off a hostile take-over attempt by ALLTEL, Inc.[16][17]
In 2002, the son of the company's original founder and Chairman of the Board Clarke M. Williams died. He was succeeded by then Vice Chairman Glen F. Post III. The company sold its wireless business to ALLTEL, to become a pure-play rural local exchange carrier. Also that year CenturyTel acquired 300,000 Verizon access lines in Alabama, and 354,000 Verizon access lines in Missouri, bringing its total operations to 22 states with 2.5 million access lines.[18]
In 2003, CenturyTel acquired half ownership of SkyComm International, Inc. in Houston, Texas, in March, to form a satellite teleport for its global Network Access Point (NAP) system. In June, CenturyTel also acquired the fiber network of Digital Teleport, Inc., a 5,700-mile (9,200 km) route running from Illinois to Texas, and adjoining states.[19] CenturyTel renamed the network company LightCore.[20] Closing out the year, in December CenturyTel acquired the Midwest Fiber Optic Network (MFON) from Level 3 Communications, Inc. in December, a stand-alone system in the same core central states as LightCore.[1]
In August 2004, it partnered with EchoStar Communications Corporation for DISH Network multi-channel digital TV.[21] In September, CenturyTel began a relationship with Cingular Wireless.[22]
In 2005, CenturyTel began a wireless voice and data service, and bought a number of fiber networks in the central United States, from KMC Telecom Holdings, Inc.[23]
In 2006, CenturyTel sold its Arizona assets to Hopi Telecommunications, Inc., bringing total operations to 23 states.[1]
In May 2007, CenturyTel acquired Madison River Communications, based out of Mebane, NC and parent company to four LECs (AL, GA, IL, and NC) as well as CLEC operations in IL, LA, and NC. The LECs included Mebtel Communications, a telephone company serving Alamance County, North Carolina;[24][25] GulfTel Communications, based out of Foley, AL and serving Baldwin and surrounding counties;[26][27] Coastal Communications, based out of Hinesville, GA; and Gallatin River Communications, serving the Dixon, Galesburg, and Pekin areas of IL.
In late 2007, the Customer Respect Group, an international research and consulting firm that focuses on how corporations treat their online customers, ranked CenturyTel the best among six leading communications providers.
Acquisition of Embarq[edit]

On October 27, 2008, Embarq announced that it would be acquired by CenturyTel, Inc. in an all-stock transaction valued at about $6 billion.[28][29] CenturyTel's CEO Glen Post would remain CEO of the merged company following the acquisition,[30] and remained CEO as of 2015.[31] Embarq was the former landline business of Sprint and served cities in 18 states, including Nevada, Florida, North Carolina and Ohio.[32] The deal made CenturyTel the third-largest landline phone provider in Pennsylvania behind Verizon (through both Verizon Pennsylvania and Verizon North) and Comcast.
Name change to CenturyLink[edit]
On June 2, 2009, a press release announced that the combined CenturyTel/Embarq entity would be called CenturyLink.[33] Denver-based Monigle Associates was retained to formulate the new brand strategy. The acquisition was completed on July 1, 2009.[34]
On October 19, 2009, CenturyTel and Embarq brandings were retired, and all business was officially conducted under the CenturyLink banner, continuing to trade on the NYSE under the CenturyTel stock ticker CTL. The new corporate name, CenturyLink, Inc., did not become official until May 2010.[35][29]
Acquisition of Qwest[edit]




Network map of combined Qwest and CenturyLink assets


On April 22, 2010, CenturyLink (at this point still legally known as CenturyTel, Inc.) announced it would acquire Qwest in a stock-for-stock transaction.[36] Under the agreement, CenturyLink would swap 0.1664 of its shares for each share of Qwest; as a result, CenturyLink shareholders prior to the merger wound up with 50.5% share of ownership in the combined company, while former Qwest shareholders gained the remaining 49.5%.[37] The valuation of CenturyLink's purchase was $12 billion.[28] The merger was completed on April 1, 2011.[38][39]
The addition of Qwest allowed CenturyLink to become the third largest telecommunications company in the United States, and the largest landline phone provider in the state of Colorado.[31] The new company has 17 million access lines, 5 million broadband customers, and 1.4 million video subscribers across 37 states.[40] The merger also made CenturyLink owner of one of the so-called Baby Bells: Qwest included what was once US West, the Baby Bell for much of the western United States.
Acquisition of Savvis[edit]
On July 15, 2011,[32] CenturyLink acquired Savvis, Inc., a global provider of cloud infrastructure and hosted IT solutions for $2 billion, which represented all outstanding shares of Savvis common stock at $40 per share.[28][41] This acquisition allowed CenturyLink to provide expanded managed hosting and cloud services.[42]
On December 4, 2012,[43] CenturyLink launched an integrated suite of cloud services called savvisdirect.[44] Savvisdirect was an expansion of CenturyLink’s portfolio of Savvis cloud services and includes cloud application hosting,[45] cloud servers,[46] cloud storage,[47] and private cloud[48] for small businesses, IT admins and developers. CenturyLink later shuttered the savvisdirect subsidiary, consolidating their cloud service offerings internally.
On October 16, 2012 Savvis acquired to ITO Business Division of Ciber thereby adding managed services to the portfolio.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .


If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
