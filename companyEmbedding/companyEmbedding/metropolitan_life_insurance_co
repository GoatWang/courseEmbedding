No matter when you start, you always want to start off on the right foot.
And with a term life insurance policy from New York Life Insurance Company you’re starting off on the best foot possible.

Term life is simple and affordable and you pay a low monthly premium based on the term length and the amount of coverage you need. At the end of your term, you may be able to renew your coverage, often at a higher premium without having to provide evidence of good health. Buying term life insurance can be a wise decision while you are young and healthy, since premiums tend to be much lower. So why wait? Protect the ones you love and keep good going in your life.

The many benefits of a term life insurance policy include:


Affordable premiums: cover yourself, spouse, family or business without breaking the bank
Guaranteed death benefit paid out to a beneficiary or beneficiaries you select
Guaranteed coverage for the duration of the term selected (example: 5, 10, 20 years)
Conversion privilege at the end of the term to a permanent policy (certain limitations apply)


To get started, fill out the form above and a local, professionally-trained agent will get back to you with a no-cost, no-obligation consultation.

In Oregon, the policy form numbers are as follows: Family Protection - 206-110.27; Level Premium Convertible Term - 210-60.27; One-Year Non Renewable Term - 209-125.27; and Yearly Convertible Term - 210-135-27.

Consumer Tip: Lifely Term is a term life insurance product issued with limited underwriting and limited medical evidence of insurability. You may be able to purchase other life insurance products (including our other term life products) for substantially less cost if you apply for a life insurance product with full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability. However, if you submit to full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability, you may be required to pay more for a fully underwritten product that if you purchased a Lifely Term policy.

FAQ
These FAQs provide some information about Lifely Term and about life insurance generally. Only a policy will have complete details on how the policy works, how to qualify for benefits, what restrictions or limitations apply, and terms for keeping the policy in effect. 
What else should I know about life insurance?


What is term insurance?

Term insurance is a type of life insurance that provides protection for a set period of time. If you (the insured person) die during this period, the policy will pay a death benefit to the person or people you designate; these are called your beneficiaries. 
With Lifely Term, you can choose a term period of 10, 15, or 20 years. The policy and death benefit coverage end when the term period expires. The policy is not convertible to another policy, it does not have cash value and it does not have a return of premium feature.


What is a premium?

Premiums are the amounts you pay to begin your policy and keep it in effect. 
For Lifely Term, your premium is automatically deducted each month from the bank account you choose.

What happens if I miss a payment?

Your policy will enter a grace period. If you do not pay your premium by the end of the grace period shown in your policy, your policy will end without value and you will no longer be covered.

How do I know which term period to select?

Think about the reasons you’re purchasing the policy. Consider not only the expenses you want to help ensure your family will be able to pay without your income but also for how long they will still rely on your financial support.
Also consider that life insurance generally becomes more expensive as one gets older.  Once your policy ends, if you want to buy another policy, you typically will need to qualify again. In the time between policies, your health may change, perhaps causing you to pay a higher premium or even be denied coverage later on.

How do I know which death benefit payment period to choose?

For how many years after your death will your family need the financial support of this policy’s death benefit? The answer to this question will guide you.

How does the death benefit get paid to my beneficiaries?

The death benefit will be paid to your beneficiaries in monthly payments. These payments will be for the benefit amount you choose and for the number of years you select.
With Lifely Term, you can choose the benefit payment period—the number of years that you’d like your beneficiaries to receive payments from this policy if you pass away. You can choose benefit payment periods of 10, 15, 20, or 30 years. Please note that you cannot change the payment period after the policy is issued.

Will the monthly death benefit be taxed?

Yes. Although the death benefit of most other life insurance policies is paid out generally free of federal income tax, a portion of Lifely Term's benefit, which is paid out monthly as chosen when you apply, will be considered income to your beneficiary for income tax purposes. Please keep this in mind when considering Lifely Term.

Are death benefits paid out as the result of a suicide?

In general, if the insured person dies by suicide in the first two years from when the policy is issued, the policy will end and all premiums will be returned. A new suicide exclusion period may begin if we agree to reinstate a policy that ends because of a missed premium payment.

Why are you asking about my health and lifestyle?

We use information about your health and habits to determine your eligibility for the policy.

What if I want to change or add beneficiaries later?

As a policyholder, you can change your beneficiary designation at any time and as often as you’d like by contacting Customer Service at 844-499-0771.

If I die, when will my beneficiaries receive the money?

Monthly payment of benefits will begin after we receive proof of death and the forms we require.

When does my coverage start?

Assuming your policy is approved, coverage begins immediately once we have received your first payment and your signed acceptance of your policy.

Can I cancel my policy at any time?

Yes. Please refer to your policy for cancellation details or call Customer Service at 844-499-0771.

Where does the information come from?

We are able to search public records, such as county or city records.  We do not access or affect your credit file.

How can you check my identity online?

We are able to search public records, such as county or city records.  We do not access or affect your credit file.

What do you do with the answers?

The information you provide is used only to verify your identity.  We do not maintain a record of the information reviewed while verifying your identity.

How does Prudential protect my personal information?

Prudential respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. Please select the Customer Privacy Notice button that appears on the bottom of this website's pages to view our privacy statement.

How can I be sure my privacy is protected?

Prudential respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. Please select the Customer Privacy Notice button that appears on the bottom of this website's pages to view our privacy statement.

What is an eSignature?

Whenever you apply for a life insurance policy, you need to sign a few documents during the process. Since this process is over the Internet and you cannot physically sign the documents, we use electronic signature, or eSignature, to get your signature.

Lifely Term (PCT-2016) is issued in California by Pruco Life Insurance Company, Newark, NJ.

What else should i know about life insurance?


THE BENEFITS OF LIFE INSURANCE
If you're like most people, you don't want to think about the possibility of dying. You expect to live for a long time and purchasing life insurance is not your first priority. But, have you considered the consequences of not having life insurance?   Because of the many different types of life insurance products available, making the right choice appears to be complicated, but it needn't be so. 


WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF INSURANCE?
There are two basic types of life insurance: term life insurance and permanent life insurance.  Term Life Insurance is an attractive solution to help protect you and your family with affordable and flexible policy options.
Term insurance can provide inexpensive coverage to meet specific needs.  It provides a stated benefit when you pass away, provided your death occurs within a specified time period. Term life insurance does not provide any benefits in case of disability or accidental injury.  In general, term products do not have cash values available for loan or withdrawal. Term life insurance premiums are generally lower for a period of time. After this period, some term policies end while others may be renewed, but with dramatically higher premiums. Purchasing a new policy after the end of your term period can be very expensive and you may have to have a medical exam to prove insurability.
Term is often considered appropriate when coverage is only required for a specific period of time; for instance, until your children graduate from college. The benefits can be used to replace income you would have earned to help pay off a mortgage or help maintain your family's lifestyle, for example. In addition, benefits can help cover funeral expenses.
Return of premium term is a slightly different type of term insurance. Premiums tend to be higher with the benefit being that the premiums paid are returned to you at the end of the level term period, provided you meet the conditions set by the insurance company.
Some term insurance policies include a conversion privilege. This benefit gives you the option to convert your term policy to a permanent policy before the end of the conversion period without having to take another medical exam to be approved for coverage. However, in most cases, premiums for the permanent policy will be higher than the premiums you've been paying for the term policy.
Permanent insurance can cover you for as long as you live (as long as you pay sufficient premiums and there are no substantial loans or withdrawals). The premiums are generally higher than term insurance during the term period. After this period, however, premiums for a permanent policy may be less than term policy premiums. 
Permanent insurance combines the security of insurance protection with the ability to accumulate some cash values inside the policy. These funds are generally allowed to grow within the policy on a tax-deferred basis and may be used to supplement income, or meet emergency or other financial needs in the future. These values may be accessed through policy loans or withdrawals during the insured's lifetime.  Please note that, although you can use the cash value of your whole life insurance for these purposes, the primary reason for purchasing life insurance should be for the death benefit it provides.
Also keep in mind that unpaid loans and withdrawals will reduce future cash value, policy benefits and guarantees. Under certain circumstances withdrawals may be taxable; loans are generally not taxable. Any loans that are outstanding when a policy lapses or is surrendered will cause immediate taxation on the amount loaned in excess of the premium paid¹.  Any outstanding loans at the time of death will be deducted from the proceeds of the death benefit along with any accrued interest on the loan.
There are three types of permanent life insurance: 1) traditional (or "classic" ); 2) universal (also called "flexible premium" or "adjustable" ); 3) variable.  All types offer cash values and guaranteed death benefits. Traditional and universal life policies offer cash values that are a combination of guaranteed and non-guaranteed elements. The non-guaranteed elements usually include any dividends earned (traditional) or earnings in excess of the contractually guaranteed cash values (universal).
While most variable life policies also provide a guaranteed death benefit, the cash value of a variable life insurance policy is not guaranteed and fluctuates based on the performance of the underlying investment options that you choose. Because you bear the investment risk as opposed to the insurance company, variable life is considered a "security," subject to federal securities laws and protections, and is sold by prospectus. With a variable life insurance policy, the guarantees are based on the claims-paying ability of the applicable issuing company and they do not apply to the investment performance or safety of the underlying subaccounts in the particular policy.


CONSIDERATIONS
There are some risks you should consider when purchasing life insurance.  These are:

Insurability Risk
Inadequate Coverage Risk
Premium Risk
Cash Value Accumulation Risk

Most people have a certain risk threshold - a comfort zone.  To manage your zone, it is helpful to understand the risks present in each situation and how they may apply to you.

Insurability Risk
Life insurance premiums are based on age and health.  The younger and healthier you are, the more inexpensive it is.  As you age, life insurance becomes more costly.  Typically you become less healthy over time; in addition, serious illnesses can strike at any time.  This could affect your ability to purchase life insurance in the future, or the premiums you pay.  This is called "insurability risk". 
Permanent insurance has a lower degree of insurability risk because coverage lasts throughout your lifetime without having to reapply, as long as you pay premiums when due and there are no substantial loans or withdrawals (though some variable life policies provide no guaranteed coverage). Buying permanent insurance when you are young and healthy can lock in lower premiums for life.
Some term insurance, with no conversion privilege, has a higher degree of insurability risk because your insurance coverage lasts for only a specified period of time (such as ten years). 

Inadequate Coverage Risk
Unfortunately death is a certainty.  Life insurance provides your beneficiaries with money to help meet their current and future financial obligations.  They may use the funds to pay off debts, cover college costs, continue your business or manage other financial obligations.  Without sufficient money to meet these obligations, your beneficiaries may be left with credit card bills or outstanding loans, or may be forced to alter their lifestyles significantly.
You have taken an important first step by considering the purchase of insurance at this time.  We encourage you to regularly and carefully evaluate whether your insurance portfolio is right for you given your financial status, objectives, obligations, and risk tolerance at any point in time.  It's no secret that as your life changes, your needs change too. 

Premium Risk
The two questions most people ask when considering the purchase of life insurance are: "How will I pay for this now?" and "Will I be able to afford this in the future?"
When considering which type of insurance is right for you, there are two risks associated with premium payments that you should think about: one, premiums may increase in the future; and two, premiums may need to be paid longer than you expected. These risks are called "premium risk".
From the perspective of being able to cover current premium payments, term insurance has a lower degree of premium risk because its initial cost is generally lower than of permanent insurance.  From the perspective of affording premium payments in the future, particularly if you need coverage longer than you initially thought, term insurance has a higher degree of premium risk.  The reason for this is that if you purchase new coverage in the future, as discussed earlier, premium costs become higher the older you become.  Health impairments may also increase the cost of new coverage.  And if you choose to keep your original term product, the premiums may increase sharply after the initial level term period.

Cash Value Accumulation Risk
If you are like most people, you have two distinct needs-one for a death benefit and the other to accumulate funds to meet life's expenses as they arise. A life insurance policy definitely meets the first need.  Although the primary reason to purchase life insurance is for the death benefit protection, some types of life insurance may also provide you the opportunity to accumulate accessible cash value within the policy itself. 
Permanent life insurance is the type of product that can accumulate cash values. These cash values may be accessed via loans and/or withdrawals to help in any number of ways, including paying off your mortgage early, supplementing your retirement income, or taking advantage of potential business opportunities. (Remember that withdrawals and loans will reduce policy cash values and the death benefit and may have tax consequences.)  However, you need to be aware of the costs and expenses that are associated with the policy that you purchase, and how these may impact the growth of your cash value.
Some types of permanent insurance actually allow you to pay more premiums than required to help give a boost to your cash values.  However , there is a limit on just how much you can pay into the policy; if you put in too much money, it becomes more expensive to access the cash values.  Your policy has now become a Modified Endowment Contract (MEC).  Instead of being able to withdraw up to basis (the amount equal to the premiums you have paid) and then borrow the balance of your accumulated cash values, all value you access will be taxable to the extent of income in the policy and there may be an additional 10% federal income tax on distributions prior to age 59½. 
One way that many people use to meet both their need of death benefit protection and their need for additional cash is to buy a lower cost term insurance product and then save or invest the difference between the term insurance cost and the permanent insurance cost.  The earlier you are able to put aside some funds the better as you may receive the positive affects of compound interest growth on your money.  The longer you delay, the greater your risk becomes in not being able to accumulate the funds you need.  This approach requires a commitment to regularly set money aside for savings.  This commitment may be difficult to meet when unexpected expenses arise and may not be for everyone.


MAKING YOUR DECISION
Now that you are a little more knowledgeable, take a look at your personal situation, consider the types of insurance available to you and make the decision that works for you and your family. 
Everyone has their own goals for personal financial security and the important thing is that you progress towards achieving your goals. You may wish to maximize your insurance coverage today or you may wish to purchase a policy you can "personalize" to meet your needs by adding riders that provide you with additional insurance coverage. You may wish to purchase a permanent life insurance policy and supplement it with term insurance for additional coverage during a particular period of time. For example, you may want extra protection during certain years such as coverage to help cover payments on a mortgage, or added protection for your children or spouse.
Look at your options and determine what works for you.  We're here to help.

Hi. Welcome to Lifely by Prudential! Thanks for stopping by.You may be wondering what Lifely is — and that's a good question. Lifely by Prudential is a program aimed to make purchasing life insurance easier.  We are trying to think differently about life insurance for today's consumer. To that end, we introduce Lifely Term, a policy offered by Pruco Life Insurance Company, a Prudential Financial company.  
 
When You Take Care of the Ones You Love, You Take Care of the World. 
 
There's an old adage in the insurance world that "Life insurance is sold, not bought." But we think that times are changing, and people today are more informed and more in control of their financial future. You know you need life insurance, right? So, we set out to design a way for you to be able to access, learn about, and purchase life insurance that makes it easy. We know that life insurance can be difficult to understand, can make you feel like you don't know where to start, and sometimes can turn people away (We have to mention "death." That’s uncomfortable.) 
So we're trying to change all of that. 
You are thinking big about your impact on the world and constantly looking for small ways to improve the world we live in. We want to help you understand that, by protecting the ones you love with life insurance, you can free them to go on to do great things for this world after you’re gone. Maybe even make all of humanity a little better. The way we see it, when you take care of the ones you love, you take care of the world. It's just that simple. 
 
Quick. Click. Insure our Humanity. 

Lifely Term is a practical life insurance policy designed with you in mind. The process is easy (online) and easy to understand (Just answer a few simple questions), and a policy is easy to purchase (Get it done today!). 
Right now, Lifely Term is available only in the state of California. (Sorry, remaining 49 states! We hope to be available to you soon!)
Thanks for coming by. We hope you stick around and maybe even help insure our humanity.
Lifely is a brand name of The Prudential Insurance Company of America and its subsidiaries.
Lifely Term (PCT-2016) is issued in California by the Pruco Life Insurance Company, located in Newark, NJ. The Pruco Life Insurance Company and The Prudential Insurance Company of America are Prudential Financial companies and each is solely responsible for its own financial condition and contractual obligations.

Consumer Tip: Lifely Term is a term life insurance product issued with limited underwriting and limited medical evidence of insurability. You may be able to purchase other life insurance products (including our other term life products) for substantially less cost if you apply for a life insurance product with full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability. However, if you submit to full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability, you may be required to pay more for a fully underwritten product that if you purchased a Lifely Term policy.

Life Settlements Guide 



Home / Life Settlements / Life Settlements Guide 












BasicsEligibilityYour BrokerThe ProcessReasons to SellReasons Not to Sell



What is a Life Settlement? 
A life settlement* is a transaction in which you sell a life policy that you own to a third party. You receive an immediate cash payment for selling your policy. The purchaser becomes the new owner of the policy, and is responsible for future premium payments. When the insured (which may be someone other than you) dies, the purchaser receives the policy’s benefit.
What is a Viatical Settlement? 
A viatical settlement* is a life settlement that involves a serious or terminal illness. Open Life Settlements and its principals are the preeminent brokers of viatical settlements. If you are considering a viatical settlement, please see our guide to viaticals or contact us for more information.
Why would I want to sell my policy?
If you would prefer to have more money now rather than a future death benefit, you should consider a life settlement. There are many reasons why your policy may no longer meet your needs, including changes in your family, in financial circumstances, in tax law, and in your policy’s performance. A life settlement can give you far more cash for your policy than you would receive from surrendering it to the insurance company.

How can a life settlement get me more money than surrender?
If you surrender your policy to the insurer, they will cancel your policy and return any cash value to you. That cash value doesn’t take into account the value of the death benefit you are giving up. A life settlement pays you the cash value plus a portion of your death benefit’s value.
How can I find out if I am eligible?
Simply call us at 866.877.4054 or e-mail us. Or you may use our online calculator to quickly estimate your eligibility and the potential value of your policy.
How much more could I get?
On average, major life settlement providers (purchasers) report paying about four times the cash surrender value for a policy. In other words, you could get about 300 percent more money through a life settlement.
What can I do with money from a life settlement?
Whatever you want — it’s your money. Some common uses include:



Saving for future health care or retirement costs,
Making gifts to loved ones or charities,
Paying off debt,
Making investments, and
Fulfilling dreams such as a long-delayed trip overseas.


 * Note: The legal terminology used to describe life and viatical settlements varies from state to state. Your state of residence may describe all settlements as viatical settlements or all settlements as life settlements.






Who is eligible for a life settlement?
Generally, you may be eligible to sell your policy if:

you directly own it (or it is owned by a business or trust that you control), and
the insured (the person whose life is being insured) is at least age 65 (although in some cases the insured can be as young as 56).

Does the insured have to be in good health?
No. In fact, you are more likely to be eligible if the insured has some medical conditions.
What type of policies are eligible?
Almost any type, even some term or group insurance. Universal life policies and convertible term policies are especially popular.
How can I find out if I am eligible?
Simple — use our online eligibility calculator, or just give us a call at 866.877.4054.






Is it difficult to get offers for my policy?
No. Open Life Settlements can work for you as a life settlements broker to obtain offers from multiple sources. We do all the hard work. You just need to fill out our application package, and decide whether to accept any offers we receive.
Do I have to accept an offer for my policy?
Absolutely not. You can decline any and all offers you receive from us. You even have a short period after selling to refund your payment and get back your policy.
How much does Open Life Settlements charge?
We don’t get paid anything unless you actually decide to accept an offer. Once you sell, we are paid a commission by the buyer. We’ll tell you exactly what that commission would be when we present you each offer.
Why should I retain Open Life Settlements to broker my policy?
Every employee and affiliate of Open Life Settlements is committed to offering our clients an experience that we feel is very different than what people have come to expect from the insurance industry. Too often, life insurance is marketed as a financial “cure-all” by agents focused on commissions, while clients struggle to make rational decisions in the absence of vital information.
We are different. We pride ourselves on providing detailed information in plain English, so that you are never confused about your options. We are completely transparent in our operations. You will receive information about every offer we get for your policy, including the commission we are offered. And we will never pressure you to accept an offer. We believe that you, not we, should be in control of your financial life.






How does the life settlement process work?
From your point of view, it’s fairly simple:

Determine your eligibility and get an instant estimate.
Fill out our application form.
Decide whether to accept any of the offers we obtain for your policy.
Close the transaction and receive your money.


Get an instant estimate
First, you should fill out our calculator to get a free estimate of your policy’s value. It’s easy, and, unlike most other brokers, Open Life Settlements doesn’t require you to enter your personal contact information to get an estimate. If you need help or prefer to get your estimate over the phone, give us a call toll-free at 866.877.4054.
Fill out an application
Second, you’ll need to fill out our application. The easiest way to do this is by calling Open Life Settlements at 866.877.4054. We’ll ask you some questions, fill out the form for you, and then express mail the completed application to you for your review and signature. Return the signed application in our postage-paid envelope, and your work is done.
Decide on offers
Next, Open Life Settlements will scour our network of purchasers to get the highest offer for your policy. We do all the work, while you relax. We will report all offers to you as we get them, including our commission. You simply need to select the highest offer. If none of the offers are high enough to satisfy you, you can walk away with no obligation.
Close and enjoy your wealth
If you accept an offer, we will help you fill out the closing agreement in which you sell your policy to the purchaser. Your payment will be placed in escrow. Once the purchaser receives your policy, the payment will be released from escrow into your bank account. At that point, that money is yours to do with as you please. If, however, you change your mind about the transaction, you will have a brief period to return the money and receive your policy back.
Start today
Seeking offers for your life policy is easy, free, and entails no obligation. If we can’t get you the offer you want, you can just say “no thanks.” We won’t charge you anything, and we won’t hassle you about your decision. You literally have nothing to lose by calling us at 866.877.4054 — but you may lose thousands of dollars if you don’t!
Get your free estimate.






What are common reasons for which people enter into a life settlement?
The major reasons for settling a policy fall within the following categories:

Changes in life circumstances
New financial needs
Inadequate policy performance
Changes in financial or estate planning.

What are some changes in life circumstances that could make a life settlement a good idea?
According to surveys, almost 80 percent of life insurance is bought primarily for income protection. If your beneficiary no longer depends on your income, the life policy may be unneeded. One of the most common reasons that a life insurance policy may not serve your needs is that you have outlived your beneficiary. Another common change in life circumstances is that your beneficiary has achieved financial independence and no longer needs the protection of life insurance.
If no one needs protection in the event of your death, a life insurance policy may not be a good choice. If you would rather have cash than a death benefit, you should consider a life settlement.
Unfortunately, sometimes the required premium payments for a policy become burdensome or simply beyond the owner’s means. In such cases, a life settlement can be a way to salvage some value from the policy; the value of a policy that lapses is zero.






A life settlement is not a panacea or “cure-all”. We believe that educated clients make good decisions, so we encourage you to think about reasons that a life settlement may not be appropriate in your personal situation.
No Immediate Plans for Cash
If you cannot formulate a definite plan for the proceeds of a life settlement, selling your policy now may not be the best option. We will be there in the future if you change your mind.
Personal Circumstances
Some personal circumstances provide strong reasons not to sell your policy. A leading reason that many people who apply for a life settlement decide not to accept an offer is that they discover they still need some insurance protection, but cannot obtain replacement insurance. No financial product is a true substitute for insurance. If you need insurance, make sure that you can get suitable replacement coverage before you sell your policy.
You Prefer Other Alternatives
A life settlement is only one way to deal with a policy that isn’t meeting your needs. A number of alternatives exist beyond simply surrendering your policy. Consider policy loans, withdrawals, and premium financing as alternatives. . If you need money due to medical circumstances, be sure to check your policy for provisions that may help.
However, many of these alternatives can affect the future marketability of your policy if you later decide that you do want to sell it. We are happy to discuss these alternatives with you before you make a decision on the best way to proceed.

Car Insurance
Car insurance covers you in case of an accident or theft. Save with an employee or association discount! For service, please call 1-800-422-4272 (individual policies) or 1-800-438-6381 (group customers).








Car Insurance



When you're in the driver's seat, keep your car, yourself, and your family protected with quality car insurance from MetLife Auto & Home®.

Group Car Insurance



If your employer offers MetLife Auto & Home's group car insurance program as part of your employee benefits, you could receive special savings. Some membership associations have discounts, too.

 Find out if you're eligible:

Group discounts. Most people saved an average of $536 per year!3 We can offer these savings because your employer provides you access to a group insurance program with special low rates as part of your employee benefits.
Coverage that stays with you. If you retire, leave your company or go on leave, you can still continue your coverage without interruption or change.
Great features. Even though the policy's cheaper, you'll still have access to all our policy benefits. These include replacement coverage for total loss, rewards for good driving, enhanced rental car damage coverage, identify theft protection and more.2

        FAQs 
      




 What types of basic auto insurance coverage does MetLife Auto & Home offer?








MetLife Auto & Home® offers a wide variety of coverage options, including:

Liability protection, which pays claims if you're responsible for an accident that causes bodily injuries and property damage.
Collision and comprehensive coverage, which pays for damage to your car if it hit another vehicle or object, no matter who caused the accident.4 It also pays for damage to your car caused by events like theft, vandalism, fire, flood, and hail.
Personal injury protection, which covers the costs of doctors, hospitals, and funeral expenses for you, members of your household, and/or your passengers, if a covered accident occurs, no matter who was at fault. You'll also be protected when you drive another person's car (with permission) or if a vehicle hits you or a family member as pedestrians.4
Uninsured motorists coverage, which pays the cost of damages and injuries resulting from being hit by an uninsured or hit-and-run driver. Coverage for both you and your passengers includes medical expenses, lost wages, and other injury-related losses.4
Underinsured motorists coverage, which pays for damages if you're injured in an accident caused by someone who doesn't have enough insurance to cover your medical expenses.





What other types of coverage are available?








MetLife Auto & Home® offers a wide variety of coverage options, including:

Rental car coverage. This will pay costs to the rental agency if you have an accident driving a rental car.
New car replacement. If you total your new car within one year of purchase or during the first 15,000 miles—whichever comes first—you get it repaired or it will be replaced with a new car with no deduction for depreciation.5
Special parts replacement. We'll pay to replace certain major parts—like tire, brakes and batteries--no matter what their wear-and-tear/depreciated value at the time of the accident.6
Glass repairs without a deductible. If your windshield is chipped or cracked, we'll repair it and waive your deductible.
Towing and roadside assistance and labor cost coverage. If your car breaks down while traveling, this can help reimburse you for towing and other roadside-assistance expenses.
Legal defense costs. If you're sued, we'll cover your legal fees. We'll also reimburse you for up to $200 per day for lost wages, if you attend a hearing or trial at our request.
Lease/loan gap coverage. Your vehicle's lease or loan will be paid off if your vehicle is a total loss due to an accident, even if the amount exceeds the value of your vehicle.





 What types of car insurance discounts and rewards does MetLife Auto & Home offer?









Deductible Savings Benefit. Automatically earn $50 every year you don't make a claim (to a maximum of $250) that may be used toward your deductible, if you have a covered loss.1
Defensive Driver Discount. Earn up to a 7% discount by completing a qualifying driver training course, like the one on the National Safety Council website.7
Superior Driver Discounts and MetRewards. Earn up to a 12% Superior Driver Discount if all of the drivers in your household have outstanding driving records, or up to 20% off your policy through the MetRewards program, if you are claim and violation-free for 5 years.8
Bundle and save. Save up to 10% with our multi-product and multi-policy discounts for having home as well as auto insurance with us. Check out our Bundle and Save page for more details! Sample multi-policy discounts:
          
Auto/Home multi-policy discount: 10%
Auto/Life multi-policy discount: 5% 9
 
Good Student Discount. Your star high school or college student could earn you a 15% discount if he or she qualifies.





 If I have a group policy, what happens if I retire, go on leave or change companies?








No worries! Your policy and coverage will continue without interruption, subject to policy terms and conditions. You'd be able to pay your insurance premiums through our EFT payment plan, by credit or debit card, through bills received by mail, or, in some cases, by pension deduction. If your premium is currently deducted from your paycheck and you go on short-term disability, like parental leave, your coverage stays in effect throughout your leave (subject to policy terms). If you were on payroll deduction and you're not receiving a regular paycheck from your employer, you'll receive a bill directly by mail.10




 What's the process for reporting an accident and filing a claim?








To file a claim with MetLife Auto & Home, call 1-800-854-6011—we're open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. If you need to file a claim against another driver, you'll need to contact that person's insurance company or agent and give the other company your insurance information. If you purchased collision coverage, you won't have to wait for the other driver to pay for damages: we will pay for damage to your car minus your deductible, regardless of who is at fault. Depending on the claim, you may be assigned a primary adjuster who conducts a thorough investigation of the accident, a field adjuster who appraises your car vehicle, a total loss specialist who finalizes the vehicle value, and a medical payments/personal injury protection adjuster who handles medical bills, like emergency room visits. If your repair shop finds additional damage that wasn't included in the original estimate, your repair shop will advise the appraiser, who will then write up a supplemental estimate that includes the additional damage. A second check is issued for the additional damage.         




My lienholder is showing up on the claim I've reported and/or the claim check. What should I do?








If you've paid off your auto loan but your lienholder is showing up on the claim reported, contact your primary claim adjuster right away. You will be asked to mail or fax a copy of your vehicle's title with the stamp indicating that the lien was discharged. The claim adjuster will forward the copy of the title to our service center, which will update your policy automatically. If you lease your vehicle or if you are still making loan payments, the leasing company or lienholder must be listed on the claim check. To cash the check, simply contact your lienholder's or leasing company's customer service department to find out how it will arrange to endorse the check. Once it has been endorsed, you may deposit it into your bank account.

What is life insurance and why do I need it?








A death in the family is not only emotionally devastating, it can also take a tremendous toll on the future financial security of a family. Suddenly, without the deceased’s income, paying the mortgage or providing for a child's college education may become much more difficult.   
Those who buy life insurance do so to help ensure their loved ones are taken care of financially. Life insurance is a promise by an insurance company to pay those who depend on you a sum of money upon your death. In return, you make periodic payments called premiums. Premiums can be based on factors such as age, gender, medical history and the dollar amount of the life insurance you purchase.
In the event of your passing, life insurance provides money directly to the individuals you select, your beneficiaries, who can use the money as they see fit, including:

Replacing lost income
Covering basic living expenses
Paying household debts, estate taxes and funeral expenses
Funding a child’s education
Supplementing retirement savings





What kinds of life insurance can I get at work?








Life insurance comes in two main types – term and permanent – which may both be available through your workplace.
Term life insurance pays a specific lump sum to your loved ones for a specified period of time – usually from one to 20 years. If you stop paying premiums, the insurance stops. Term policies pay benefits if you die during the period covered by the policy, but they do not build cash value. They may also give you the option to port. That is, you can take the coverage with you if you leave your company.
Generally, you should consider a term life insurance policy to:

Get valuable coverage at an affordable price
Help cover specific financial responsibilities like a mortgage or college expenses
Supplement a permanent policy

 Permanent life insurance policies do not expire. They are intended to protect your loved ones permanently, as long as you pay your premiums. Some permanent life insurance policies accumulate cash value. That means, the value of the policy will grow each year, tax-deferred, until it matches the face value of the policy. The cash can generally be accessed via loans or withdrawals, and can be used for a variety of purposes. This type of plan is typically portable so coverage can continue if employment terminates. 
Consider a permanent insurance policy if you want:

Protection for life
Payments that stay the same each year
To put additional money into the policy on a tax-favored basis
Cash value you can use while you are living





What are the advantages of purchasing life insurance through work?








Getting life insurance through work can be an easy way to protect your family. If your employer offers a group plan, consider signing up for advantages that may include:

Competitive group rates
Guaranteed issue, meaning you can get a certain amount of coverage without answering health questions or taking a medical exam
Convenient payroll deductions
Easy access to enrollment and educational tools that can help you make the right decisions about the type and amount of insurance that’s right for you
The confidence of knowing that your employer has reviewed and selected the plan

 All you have to do is sign up, and sometimes enrollment is automatic.




How much life insurance do I need?








While you won’t be able to pinpoint the amount you’ll need to the penny, you can make a sound estimate.  Your goal should be to develop a life insurance plan that, following your death, will allow your family to live comfortably without your economic contribution. Also consider the effect of inflation over time. The amount needed for retirement or college 20 years from now is likely to be significantly higher than today.
To estimate the amount of life insurance your family would need, first calculate everything you now provide for your family including:

Salary
Benefits/health insurance
401(k) and retirement savings
Personal services you perform for your family, such as child care, cooking, home maintenance, etc.

 Then, subtract your personal expenses including:

Annual spending on personal needs, such as food, clothing, entertainment, etc.





How much does life insurance cost?








Life insurance through your workplace may be more affordable than you think. In fact, many people can get term life insurance coverage from a quality company for a surprisingly low price.1
Premiums are typically based on factors such as:

Age, sex, height and weight
Health status, including whether or not you smoke
Participation in high-risk occupations

 Life insurance gets more expensive as you get older, and the type of coverage you choose will also affect your premium. Rates for term insurance are typically lower, while rates for permanent policies are typically higher.




Does MetLife offer an individual one year term life insurance product?








Yes.  MetLife’s one year term products offer affordable protection when you require insurance for the short term. These products are designed to provide the right amount of protection when it’s needed most, or to supplement a policy you already have. Premium rates can be found here. For more information contact MetLife's Specialized Benefit Resources at 877-638-3932, and press 2 for New Business.




What are the tax advantages of life insurance?








Death benefits are generally received income tax-free by your beneficiaries. In the case of permanent life insurance policies, cash values accumulate on an income tax-deferred basis. That means you would not have to pay income tax on any of the policy’s earnings as long as the policy remains in effect. In addition, most policy loans and withdrawals are not taxable (although withdrawals and loans will reduce the cash value and death benefit).2

Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Key Developments

AcelRx Pharmaceuticals Enters into a Second Amendment with Metropolitan Life Insurance Company
Jun 20 17
On June 14, 2017, AcelRx Pharmaceuticals Inc. entered into a second amendment (the Lease Amendment") to that certain lease dated December 21, 2011, as amended by a first amendment, dated as of May 2, 2014, with Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (the Landlord") for the Company's current principal executive offices, approximately 26,000 square feet located at 301-351 Galveston Drive, Redwood City, California. Pursuant to the Lease Amendment, the term of the Existing Lease has been extended for a period of 72 months (the Extended Term") beginning February 1, 2018 and expiring January 31, 2024, unless sooner terminated pursuant to the terms of the Lease. Pursuant to the Lease Amendment, the Company will pay on a monthly basis annual rent of approximately $1.2 million, with annual increases each 12-month period beginning February 1, and the first two months to be abated provided that the Company is not in default thereunder. In addition, the Company will pay the Landlord specified percentages of certain operating expenses related to the leased facility incurred by the Landlord.


MetLife Signs Pension Buyout Agreement with PPG
Jun 28 16
Metropolitan Life Insurance Company has announced that PPG has entered into an agreement with both MetLife and Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company to provide annuity benefits to approximately 13,400 retirees in PPG's defined benefit (DB) pension plans, representing pension obligations of $1.6 billion. The transaction involves two groups of retirees salaried and non-union hourly. For 11,000 salaried retirees, MetLife and MassMutual are each providing 50% of the monthly benefits. MassMutual will act as lead administrator. MetLife will pay its portion of the benefits through an administration agreement with MassMutual. MetLife will be the exclusive provider for the non-union hourly group, making payments directly to the retirees.


Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Approves Amendments to the Charter and By-Laws
May 19 16
On May 16, 2016, the Superintendent of Financial Services of the State of New York approved amendments to the Charter and By-Laws of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company previously approved by the company's Board of Directors rendering them effective. The Charter and By-Laws now provide for the date of each annual meeting of shareholders to be held within thirty days before or after the second Tuesday of June, rather than on the fourth Tuesday of April or within sixty days thereafter. They now provide for a minimum of seven directors, at least one of whom must be a resident of the State of New York; they previously provided for at least thirteen directors, at least three whom had to be New York residents. They also now authorize the Company's shareholders to elect officers of the Company (except for any Chief Executive Officer, Chairman, President, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary, Treasurer, Controller, General Counsel, officer of the rank of Executive Vice President or higher, or any officer who is deemed to be a principal officer of the Company under Section 1202(b) of the New York Insurance Law) and for the shareholders to remove officers they have elected. The Board retains the authority to appoint, and remove officers it has appointed, that the Charter and By-Laws previously gave it. The Charter now includes an updated definition of life insurance consistent with the current statutory definition and requires Superintendent consent for the issuance of any additional shares of Company common stock. The Charter did not previously require such consent. The By-Laws now provide for the Board to determine which director will preside at Board meetings and which officer shall be the Chief Executive Officer, rather to determine these roles from among the officer directors. The By-Laws also now provide, with respect to acts or omissions on or after February 25, 2014, for a limited indemnity of directors of the Company who are not employees of the Company or its affiliates. The By-laws previously provided for a limited indemnity for all directors and officers of the Company. The foregoing description of the Charter and By-Laws is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Charter and By-Laws, which are filed as exhibit hereto in redline form showing the amendments described above and in unmarked form, and are incorporated herein by reference.

History[edit]
Early years[edit]




Home office of the New England Mutual Life Insurance Co. one of the predecessor companies of MetLife. see [30]


The predecessor company to MetLife began in 1863 when a group of New York City businessmen raised $100,000 to found the National Union Life and Limb Insurance Company. The company insured Civil War sailors and soldiers against disabilities due to wartime wounds, accidents, and sickness. On March 24, 1868, it became known as Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and shifted its focus to the life insurance business.[31][32]




The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company tower, which previously served as company headquarters, was featured in its advertising for many years.


A severe business depression that began with the Panic of 1873 forced the company to contract, until it reached its lowest point in the late 1870s. After observing the insurance industry in Great Britain in 1879, MetLife President Joseph F. Knapp brought “industrial” or “workingmen’s” insurance programs to the United States – insurance issued in small amounts on which premiums were collected weekly or monthly at the policyholder’s home. By 1880, sales had exceeded a quarter million of such policies, resulting in nearly $1 million in revenue from premiums. In 1909, MetLife had become the nation’s largest life insurer in the United States, as measured by life insurance in force (the total value of life insurance policies issued).[31][33]
In 1907, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company tower was commissioned to serve as MetLife’s 23rd Street headquarters in Lower Manhattan. Completed two years later, the building was the world's tallest until 1913 and remained the company's headquarters until 2005. For many years, an illustration of the building (with light emanating from the tip of its spire and the slogan, "The Light That Never Fails") featured prominently in MetLife’s advertising.[34] By 1930, MetLife insured every fifth man, woman, and child in the United States and Canada.[35] During the 1930s, it also began to diversify its portfolio by reducing the percentage of individual mortgages in favor of public utility bonds, investments in government securities, and loans for commercial real estate.[35] The company financed the construction of the Empire State Building in 1929 as well as provided capital to build Rockefeller Center in 1931. During World War II, MetLife placed more than 51 percent of its total assets in war bonds, and was the largest single private contributor to the Allied cause.[35]
Postwar[edit]

During the postwar era, the company expanded its suburban presence, decentralized operations, and refocused its career agency system to serve all market segments. It also began to market group insurance products to employers and institutions. By 1979, operations were segmented into four primary businesses: group insurance, personal insurance, pensions, and investments.[35] In 1981, MetLife purchased what became known as the MetLife building for $400 million from a group that included Pan American World Airways.[36][37]

De-mutualization and IPO[edit]
In 2000, MetLife converted from a mutual insurance company operated for the benefit of its policyholders to a for-profit public company. The de-mutualization process allowed MetLife to enter unrelated insurance businesses and increase executive compensation.
Policyholders received some stock in the new company in this process.[38] MetLife was accused of breaching federal securities laws by misrepresenting and omitting information in materials given to policyholders during this process, resulting in years of litigation ending with a $50 million settlement in 2009.[39]
Acquisitions, sales, and major deals[edit]

1992 - merged with United Mutual Life Insurance Company, the only African-American life insurer in New York, in 1992.[40]
1992 - [41] acquired Executive Life's single premium deferred annuity business, which was worth approximately $1.2 billion. MetLife also acquired the firm's life insurance business, valued at about $260 million.[42]
1995 - purchased New England Mutual Life Insurance Company.[43]
1997 - acquired Security First Group in 1997 for $377 million.[44][45]
1999 - acquired Lincoln National Corporation's individual disability income unit.[46]
1999 - bought out reinsurance provider GenAmerica Corporation for $1.2 billion, as well as its subsidiaries, Reinsurance Group of America and Conning Corporation.[47][48] That year, the company had grown to serve 7 million policyholders.[49]
2000 - de-mutualization and IPO.[50][51] The initial public offering was valued at $6.5 billion, which was the largest IPO to that date in United States financial history.[50][51] MetLife policyholders were asked to choose a cash or stock stake. This IPO made MetLife the most widely owned stock in the United States, and it raised MetLife's value to over $4 billion.[52][53] By 2000, MetLife's reported number of policyholders had risen to 11 million,[53] and that year it had become the United States' number one life insurer, surpassing Prudential, according to The New York Times.[54]
2000 - $470 million voice and data network management deal with AT&T Solutions.[55]
2001 - acquired Grand Bank of Kingston, New Jersey, which was renamed MetLife Bank.[56][57]
2001 - invested $1 billion in the United States stock market during 2001, immediately after the September 11th terrorist attacks.[58]
2005 - acquired Citigroup’s Travelers Life & Annuity and all of Citigroup’s international insurance businesses for $11.8 billion.[59][60] At the time of the deal, which was completed on July 1, 2005, the Travelers acquisition made MetLife the largest individual life insurer in North America based on sales.[61]
2006 - opened joint-venture insurance company in Shanghai, in May 2006.[62][63]
2006 - sold Peter Cooper Village, or Stuyvesant Town, the largest apartment complexes in New York City at the time, for $5.4 billion.[64][65] MetLife had developed the apartment complexes between 1945 and 1947, to house veterans returning home from serving in World War II.[66]
2010 - bought American Life Insurance Company from AIG for US$15,500,000,000.[59]
2011 - sold MetLife bank to GE Capital, exiting banking business.[67]

Current era[edit]
From 2004 to 2011, MetLife continued to hold its position as the largest life insurer in the United States.[16][68] The company had $2.5 trillion in policies written, $350 billion in assets under management, over 12 million customers in the United States, 8 million customers outside the United States, and a net income in 2003 of $2.2 billion.[68] That year, Barron's reported that 13 million American households owned at least one product from MetLife.[69]
MetLife named Robert H. Benmosche as chairman and CEO in July 1999. Benmosche occupied the position until 2006, when he was replaced by C. Robert Henrikson.[16][70][71]
The company's sales grew 11.5% between 2008 and 2009, despite the national recession.[72] In 2011, CEO Robert Henrikson was replaced by Steven A. Kandarian, who had overseen the company's "US$450,000,000,000 investment portfolio" as chief investment officer.[16] Henrikson remained the company's chairman to the end of 2011, at which point he reached the company's mandatory retirement age.[16]
In 2015, MetLife was ranked as number one on Fortune magazine's list of World's Most Admired Companies in the Insurance: Life and Health category.[73]
In the summer of 2017, MetLife plans to add a third office building of 255,000 square feet at its Cary, North Carolina Global Technology Campus, giving the company a total of 655,000 square feet at a location which has over 1,000 employees in such areas as engineering, software and technology. This plan was the result of North Carolina awarding the company $94 million in incentives in 2013 for creating over 2,600 jobs, half in Cary and half in Charlotte.[74]
"Too big to fail"[edit]
In 2012, MetLife failed the Federal Reserve’s (the Fed's) Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review stress test, intended to predict the potential failure of the company in a recession. The Fed stated that the minimum total risk-based capital ratio should be 8% and it estimated MetLife's ratio at 6%. The company had requested approval for a US$2,000,000,000 share repurchase to prop up the stock price, along with an increased dividend.[75] Because MetLife owned MetLife Bank, it was subject to stricter financial regulation. To escape that level of regulation, MetLife announced the sale of its banking unit to GE Capital.[76][77] On November 2, 2012, MetLife said it was selling its US$70,000,000,000 mortgage servicing business to JPMorgan Chase for an undisclosed amount.[78] Both sales were part of its strategy to focus on the insurance side of its business.
The attempt to escape "too big to fail" regulation was not successful. In September 2014, the United States government observed the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law by proposing the application of an official label to MetLife as "systemically important" to the American economy.[79] If implemented, MetLife would be subject to different sets of rules and regulations, with increased oversight from the Federal Reserve.[79][80] The company appealed this proposal in November 2014.[81] In December 2014, federal regulators decided that MetLife required the special regulations reserved for financial companies and organizations deemed "systemically important," or "too big to fail".[82] MetLife announced in January 2015 that it would file a lawsuit against the District of Columbia to overturn the federal regulators' decision,[79] thus becoming the first nonbank to challenge such a decision.[83] Three other nonbank companies have been designated as "systemically important": AIG, General Electric and Prudential.[82][83] MetLife continued to litigate this issue as of mid-2015, with the US Department of Justice asking that their challenge be dismissed.[83]
Fines[edit]
On August 7, 2012, it was announced that MetLife will pay $3.2 million in fines after the Federal Reserve charged it used unsafe and unsound practices in handling its mortgage servicing and foreclosure operations.[84]
In 2014, MetLife paid $23 million to settle multiple lawsuits over junk fax operations used to generate leads for life insurance sales.[85]


"MetLife Bank took advantage of the FHA insurance program by knowingly turning a blind eye to mortgage loans that did not meet basic underwriting requirements, and stuck the FHA and taxpayers with the bill when those mortgages defaulted."

U.S. Attorney John Walsh
In 2015, MetLife Home Loans LLC paid $123.5 million to the United States Department of Justice to resolve allegations it knowingly made mortgages insured by the United States government that didn’t meet federal underwriting requirements.[86]

MetLife Hall of Records, Yonkers, New York.


As of 2010[update], MetLife had a "diverse product mix" which included insurance (home, car and life), variable life annuities and structured settlements, commercial mortgages and securities backed by commercial mortgages, and sovereign debt.[15]
Life insurance[edit]
MetLife’s individual life insurance products and services comprise term life insurance and several types of permanent life insurance, including whole life, universal life, and final expense whole life insurance.[87][88] These services vary in regards to the duration and amount of coverage available and whether a medical exam is required for coverage. The company also offers group life insurance, provided through employers, which consists of term life, permanent life, and accidental death and dismemberment coverage.[89][90] MetLife is the largest life insurer in the United States, based on life insurance in-force.[10][15]
Dental[edit]
MetLife offers group dental benefit plans for individuals, employees, retirees and their families and provides dental plan administration for over 20 million people.[91][92] Plans include MetLife’s Preferred Dentist Program (PPO) and the SafeGuard DHMO (available for both individuals and employees in CA, FL, TX, NJ and NY.). As of May 2010, MetLife’s dental PPO network included over 135,000 participating dentist locations nationwide while the dental HMO network included more than 13,000 participating dentist locations in California, Florida and Texas.[93] MetLife also administers dental continuing education program for dentists and allied health care professionals, which are recognized by the American Dental Association (ADA) and the Academy of General Dentistry (AGD).[94]
Disability[edit]
MetLife provides disability products for individuals as well as employee and association groups who receive them through their employer.[14][95] For individuals, the company’s individual disability income insurance can replace a portion of lost income if an individual is unable to work due to sickness or injury.[96] MetLife offers several individual disability income policies, including MetLife Income Guard, OMNI Advantage, OMNI Essential, Business Overhead Expense, and Buy-Sell.[97] The policy options provided by the company vary in terms of eligibility and the provided coverage. For groups, MetLife offers short term disability insurance and long term disability insurance.[98] Short term disability insurance is structured to replace a portion of an individual’s income during the initial weeks of a disabling illness or accident.[99] Long term disability Insurance serves to replace a portion of an individual’s income during an extended period of a disabling illness or accident.[100][101] The company also maintains an absence management product which allows employers to track and manage both planned and unplanned employee absences. The product, which MetLife calls MetLife Total Absence Management, is structured for businesses with 1,000 or more employees.[102]
Annuities[edit]
MetLife is among the largest providers of annuities in the world, recording $22.4 billion in sales during 2009.[103] MetLife offers annuities which consist of fixed annuities, variable annuities, deferred annuities and immediate annuities.[104] In 1921, MetLife was the first company to issue a group annuity contract.[105] More recently in 2004, it was the first insurer to introduce a longevity insurance product.[106] As of December 31, 2009, MetLife globally managed group annuity assets of $60 billion with $34 billion of transferred pension liabilities and provided benefit payments to over 600,000 annuitants per month.[107]
Auto & Home[edit]
MetLife Auto & Home is the brand name for MetLife’s nine affiliate personal lines insurance companies.[108] Collectively these companies offer personal lines property and casualty insurance policies in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.[109] The flagship company in the MetLife Auto & Home group, Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company, was founded in 1972.[108] MetLife Auto & Home companies presently have over 2.7 million active policies and service 58 of the Fortune 100 companies.[110][111]
MetLife's home insurance solutions include homeowners insurance, condo insurance, renters insurance, insurance for landlords, and mobile home insurance.[112][113] The available policies for MetLife's home insurance provide coverage for possessions, property damage from natural disaster or theft, and various legal expenses incurred resulting from injuries sustained on an individual's property.[114] The companies also sell RV, ATV, boat, mobile home, collectible vehicle, and motorcycle policies[115] and offers flood insurance policies as a participant in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which is managed by the federal government.[116][117] MetLife's various types of coverage for auto insurance include liability protection, collision and comprehensive coverage, personal injury protection, rental car coverage, and uninsured and underinsured motorists coverage.[118][119] Through an arrangement with Hyatt Legal Plans, a subsidiary of MetLife, MetLife Auto & Home underwrites group legal plans in many states.[18]
It was the first national insurer in the United States to offer identity-theft resolution services at no extra premium and as of 2012 continues to do so today in most United States states.[120][121] In 2010, MetLife Auto & Home began offering their GrandProtect plan in most states. This GrandProtect policy simplifies complex insurance needs by combining a client's home, valuable items, autos, RVs, and boats into one comprehensive policy package. The ultimate benefits to the consumer are having one bill, only one deductible, comprehensive coverage, and typically lower rates than trying to get each policy individually.[122]
Other products[edit]
MetLife’s products also include critical illness insurance.[123] Financial services include fee-based financial planning, retirement planning, wealth management, 529 Plans, banking, and commercial and residential mortgages.[124] The company also provides retirement plan and other financial services to healthcare, education, and not-for-profit organizations.[125] The MetLife Center for Special Needs Planning is a group of planners which serve families and individuals with special needs.[126] In 2014, MetLife launched MetLife Defender, a digital identity theft protection product.[127]
International presence[edit]
Outside of the United States, MetLife operates in Latin America, Europe, Asia’s Pacific region, and the Middle East, with leading market positions in Mexico, Japan, South Korea and Chile.[9]
On March 8, 2010, MetLife announced its intent to purchase the international leader life-insurance business, American Life Insurance Company (Alico), from American International Group (AIG). MetLife, which completed the deal on November 1, 2010, paid approximately $7.2 billion in cash and $9.0 billion in MetLife equity and other securities.[128][129] The securities portion of the deal consisted of 78.2 million shares of MetLife common stock, 6.9 million shares of contingent convertible preferred stock and 40 million equity units.[130] The values of the common and preferred stock were based on the closing price of MetLife’s common stock on October 29.[130] Upon completion of the purchase, MetLife became a leading competitor in Japan, the world’s second-largest life insurance market, and moved into a top 5 market position in many high growth emerging markets in Central and Eastern Europe, such as Romania, the Middle East and Latin America.[131] The deal added 20 million customers to MetLife’s 70 million and according to Barron's more than doubled the percentage of operating profits that MetLife gets abroad to 40%.[15]
In India MetLife has an affiliate company India Insurance Company Limited (MetLife) which has operated in India since 2001. This company has its headquarters in Bangalore and Gurgaon and was jointly owned by MetLife and a few local Indian financial companies. In 2012 an agreement was made with local Indian bank, the Punjab National Bank to establish a strategic alliance and for it to take a 30% share in MetLife India.[132] The state owned bank would in return sell MetLife insurance products in its branches
As of 2015, Julio Garcia-Villalon leads the Middle East & Africa regional business, which is headquartered in the Dubai International Financial Centre and has operated in the region since the 1950s.[133]
MetLife Foundation[edit]
MetLife Foundation is MetLife's independent charitable and grant-awarding foundation. It was founded in 1976[134] and had provided over $650 million in grants by January 2015.[134] The foundation has partnered with and donated to a variety of organizations, including Habitat for Humanity since 2010[135] and the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial Project Foundation since 2008.[136][137] In 2013, the MetLife Foundation announced a new focus on financial inclusion,[138] including educational programs on basic financial planning for disadvantaged children[139][140] and financial services aimed at low-income communities.[140][141][142]
Relationship with Peanuts[edit]
MetLife's use of comic strip characters, according to chief marketing officer Esther Lee, was intended "to make our company more friendly and approachable during a time when insurance companies were seen as cold and distant."[143]
MetLife licensed Snoopy and other Peanuts characters for promotional purposes from the Iconix Brand Group, which owns the promotional rights to the works of Charles M. Schulz. In 2010, Iconix formed a joint venture with Schulz’s heirs, buying out E. W. Scripps Co. and United Features Syndicate for $175 million. MetLife is reported to pay $12 million per year to Iconix for licensing rights.[144] Prior to the Iconix deal, MetLife had licensed the characters from other rights-holders.
The Peanuts-based campaign was developed by the advertising agency Young & Rubicam. MetLife also has used Foote Cone & Belding to develop Peanuts-related promotions.[145][146]
MetLife announced the end of its 31-year relationship with Peanuts on October 20, 2016. This decision resulted from the company's sale of its life insurance business to concentrate on corporate clients.[143] MetLife's new blue and green logo was criticized for being a knock-off of comparison website Diffen.[147][148]
Blimp and sports sponsorship[edit]




The Metlife 'Snoopy Two' blimp.


The MetLife blimp program began in 1987 with the “Snoopy 1” airship and, in 1994, expanded to include the “Snoopy 2” airship.[149] The program provides aerial coverage to over 80 major sporting events every year and is currently the official aerial coverage provider of the PGA Tour.[150] “Snoopy 1” and “Snoopy 2” also provide overhead television coverage for the NFL, CBS College Football, the LPGA, the NBA Finals, Copa Chile, the Preakness Stakes, and the Kentucky Derby.[150][151][152][153] On August 23, 2011, MetLife agreed to a 25-year sponsorship deal to rename New Meadowlands Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, home of the NFL's New York Giants and New York Jets to MetLife Stadium.[154]
MetLife and the “Ideal weight”[edit]
In 1959, The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (as it was known at the time) released tables of the best weight for each height for longevity, based on their collected insurance data. These tables showed the “desirable weights”. In 1983, they released tables showing the “ideal” weights for greatest longevity; this information was based on data collected in the Build Study of 1979 collected by the Society of Actuaries. This data followed patients for 18 years (from 1954-1972) and was collected from 25 life insurance companies in Canada and the United States, representing 4.2 million people. These “ideal” weights were higher than the prior “desirable” weights, this was attributed to an increase in muscle mass due to improved fitness levels among the population. This study is still the largest available pool of data for this purpose. It was noticed that the average weights in the population are higher than the ideal weights for survival. The ‘’’Metropolitan Tables’’’ included ‘’small’’, ‘’medium’’ and ‘’large’’ frames, based on elbow-girth measured using calipers, as the elbows do not develop adipose tissue. They presented weight ranges for height, sex and body frame (again associated with the lowest mortality) The mid-point of the ideal weight for the medium frames for each height was selected as the “ideal” weight used for calculations of “excess weight” (initial weight-ideal weight). This led to a formula to calculate the ideal weight used by bariatric surgeons, but it had lost considerable accuracy by 2007, again due to improvements in medical care and in public health.[155]

MetLife, Inc. is the holding corporation for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MLIC),[4] better known as MetLife, and its affiliates. MetLife is among the largest global providers of insurance, annuities, and employee benefit programs, with 90 million customers in over 60 countries.[3][5] The firm was founded on March 24, 1868.[6]
On January 6, 1915, MetLife completed the mutualization process, changing from a stock life insurance company owned by individuals to a mutual company operating without external shareholders and for the benefit of policyholders.[7] The company went public in 2000.[8] Through its subsidiaries and affiliates, MetLife holds leading market positions in the United States, Japan, Latin America, Asia’s Pacific region, Europe, and the Middle East.[9] MetLife serves 90 of the largest Fortune 500 companies.[10] The company’s principal offices are located at 200 Park Avenue, New York City in Midtown Manhattan, New York City, though it retains some executive offices and its boardroom in the MetLife Building, located at 200 Park Avenue, New York City, which it sold in 2005.[11]
In January 2016, the company announced that it would spin off U.S. Retail business, including individual life insurance and annuities for the retail market, in a separate company called Brighthouse Financial.[12] They will maintain the MetLife name on MetLife Stadium.[13] On March 6, 2017, the separated U.S. Retail business launched Brighthouse Financial – an independent company focused on life insurance and annuities.

History[edit]
Early years[edit]




Home office of the New England Mutual Life Insurance Co. one of the predecessor companies of MetLife. see [30]


The predecessor company to MetLife began in 1863 when a group of New York City businessmen raised $100,000 to found the National Union Life and Limb Insurance Company. The company insured Civil War sailors and soldiers against disabilities due to wartime wounds, accidents, and sickness. On March 24, 1868, it became known as Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and shifted its focus to the life insurance business.[31][32]




The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company tower, which previously served as company headquarters, was featured in its advertising for many years.


A severe business depression that began with the Panic of 1873 forced the company to contract, until it reached its lowest point in the late 1870s. After observing the insurance industry in Great Britain in 1879, MetLife President Joseph F. Knapp brought “industrial” or “workingmen’s” insurance programs to the United States – insurance issued in small amounts on which premiums were collected weekly or monthly at the policyholder’s home. By 1880, sales had exceeded a quarter million of such policies, resulting in nearly $1 million in revenue from premiums. In 1909, MetLife had become the nation’s largest life insurer in the United States, as measured by life insurance in force (the total value of life insurance policies issued).[31][33]
In 1907, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company tower was commissioned to serve as MetLife’s 23rd Street headquarters in Lower Manhattan. Completed two years later, the building was the world's tallest until 1913 and remained the company's headquarters until 2005. For many years, an illustration of the building (with light emanating from the tip of its spire and the slogan, "The Light That Never Fails") featured prominently in MetLife’s advertising.[34] By 1930, MetLife insured every fifth man, woman, and child in the United States and Canada.[35] During the 1930s, it also began to diversify its portfolio by reducing the percentage of individual mortgages in favor of public utility bonds, investments in government securities, and loans for commercial real estate.[35] The company financed the construction of the Empire State Building in 1929 as well as provided capital to build Rockefeller Center in 1931. During World War II, MetLife placed more than 51 percent of its total assets in war bonds, and was the largest single private contributor to the Allied cause.[35]
Postwar[edit]

During the postwar era, the company expanded its suburban presence, decentralized operations, and refocused its career agency system to serve all market segments. It also began to market group insurance products to employers and institutions. By 1979, operations were segmented into four primary businesses: group insurance, personal insurance, pensions, and investments.[35] In 1981, MetLife purchased what became known as the MetLife building for $400 million from a group that included Pan American World Airways.[36][37]

De-mutualization and IPO[edit]
In 2000, MetLife converted from a mutual insurance company operated for the benefit of its policyholders to a for-profit public company. The de-mutualization process allowed MetLife to enter unrelated insurance businesses and increase executive compensation.
Policyholders received some stock in the new company in this process.[38] MetLife was accused of breaching federal securities laws by misrepresenting and omitting information in materials given to policyholders during this process, resulting in years of litigation ending with a $50 million settlement in 2009.[39]
Acquisitions, sales, and major deals[edit]

1992 - merged with United Mutual Life Insurance Company, the only African-American life insurer in New York, in 1992.[40]
1992 - [41] acquired Executive Life's single premium deferred annuity business, which was worth approximately $1.2 billion. MetLife also acquired the firm's life insurance business, valued at about $260 million.[42]
1995 - purchased New England Mutual Life Insurance Company.[43]
1997 - acquired Security First Group in 1997 for $377 million.[44][45]
1999 - acquired Lincoln National Corporation's individual disability income unit.[46]
1999 - bought out reinsurance provider GenAmerica Corporation for $1.2 billion, as well as its subsidiaries, Reinsurance Group of America and Conning Corporation.[47][48] That year, the company had grown to serve 7 million policyholders.[49]
2000 - de-mutualization and IPO.[50][51] The initial public offering was valued at $6.5 billion, which was the largest IPO to that date in United States financial history.[50][51] MetLife policyholders were asked to choose a cash or stock stake. This IPO made MetLife the most widely owned stock in the United States, and it raised MetLife's value to over $4 billion.[52][53] By 2000, MetLife's reported number of policyholders had risen to 11 million,[53] and that year it had become the United States' number one life insurer, surpassing Prudential, according to The New York Times.[54]
2000 - $470 million voice and data network management deal with AT&T Solutions.[55]
2001 - acquired Grand Bank of Kingston, New Jersey, which was renamed MetLife Bank.[56][57]
2001 - invested $1 billion in the United States stock market during 2001, immediately after the September 11th terrorist attacks.[58]
2005 - acquired Citigroup’s Travelers Life & Annuity and all of Citigroup’s international insurance businesses for $11.8 billion.[59][60] At the time of the deal, which was completed on July 1, 2005, the Travelers acquisition made MetLife the largest individual life insurer in North America based on sales.[61]
2006 - opened joint-venture insurance company in Shanghai, in May 2006.[62][63]
2006 - sold Peter Cooper Village, or Stuyvesant Town, the largest apartment complexes in New York City at the time, for $5.4 billion.[64][65] MetLife had developed the apartment complexes between 1945 and 1947, to house veterans returning home from serving in World War II.[66]
2010 - bought American Life Insurance Company from AIG for US$15,500,000,000.[59]
2011 - sold MetLife bank to GE Capital, exiting banking business.[67]

Current era[edit]
From 2004 to 2011, MetLife continued to hold its position as the largest life insurer in the United States.[16][68] The company had $2.5 trillion in policies written, $350 billion in assets under management, over 12 million customers in the United States, 8 million customers outside the United States, and a net income in 2003 of $2.2 billion.[68] That year, Barron's reported that 13 million American households owned at least one product from MetLife.[69]
MetLife named Robert H. Benmosche as chairman and CEO in July 1999. Benmosche occupied the position until 2006, when he was replaced by C. Robert Henrikson.[16][70][71]
The company's sales grew 11.5% between 2008 and 2009, despite the national recession.[72] In 2011, CEO Robert Henrikson was replaced by Steven A. Kandarian, who had overseen the company's "US$450,000,000,000 investment portfolio" as chief investment officer.[16] Henrikson remained the company's chairman to the end of 2011, at which point he reached the company's mandatory retirement age.[16]
In 2015, MetLife was ranked as number one on Fortune magazine's list of World's Most Admired Companies in the Insurance: Life and Health category.[73]
In the summer of 2017, MetLife plans to add a third office building of 255,000 square feet at its Cary, North Carolina Global Technology Campus, giving the company a total of 655,000 square feet at a location which has over 1,000 employees in such areas as engineering, software and technology. This plan was the result of North Carolina awarding the company $94 million in incentives in 2013 for creating over 2,600 jobs, half in Cary and half in Charlotte.[74]
"Too big to fail"[edit]
In 2012, MetLife failed the Federal Reserve’s (the Fed's) Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review stress test, intended to predict the potential failure of the company in a recession. The Fed stated that the minimum total risk-based capital ratio should be 8% and it estimated MetLife's ratio at 6%. The company had requested approval for a US$2,000,000,000 share repurchase to prop up the stock price, along with an increased dividend.[75] Because MetLife owned MetLife Bank, it was subject to stricter financial regulation. To escape that level of regulation, MetLife announced the sale of its banking unit to GE Capital.[76][77] On November 2, 2012, MetLife said it was selling its US$70,000,000,000 mortgage servicing business to JPMorgan Chase for an undisclosed amount.[78] Both sales were part of its strategy to focus on the insurance side of its business.
The attempt to escape "too big to fail" regulation was not successful. In September 2014, the United States government observed the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law by proposing the application of an official label to MetLife as "systemically important" to the American economy.[79] If implemented, MetLife would be subject to different sets of rules and regulations, with increased oversight from the Federal Reserve.[79][80] The company appealed this proposal in November 2014.[81] In December 2014, federal regulators decided that MetLife required the special regulations reserved for financial companies and organizations deemed "systemically important," or "too big to fail".[82] MetLife announced in January 2015 that it would file a lawsuit against the District of Columbia to overturn the federal regulators' decision,[79] thus becoming the first nonbank to challenge such a decision.[83] Three other nonbank companies have been designated as "systemically important": AIG, General Electric and Prudential.[82][83] MetLife continued to litigate this issue as of mid-2015, with the US Department of Justice asking that their challenge be dismissed.[83]
Fines[edit]
On August 7, 2012, it was announced that MetLife will pay $3.2 million in fines after the Federal Reserve charged it used unsafe and unsound practices in handling its mortgage servicing and foreclosure operations.[84]
In 2014, MetLife paid $23 million to settle multiple lawsuits over junk fax operations used to generate leads for life insurance sales.[85]


"MetLife Bank took advantage of the FHA insurance program by knowingly turning a blind eye to mortgage loans that did not meet basic underwriting requirements, and stuck the FHA and taxpayers with the bill when those mortgages defaulted."

U.S. Attorney John Walsh
In 2015, MetLife Home Loans LLC paid $123.5 million to the United States Department of Justice to resolve allegations it knowingly made mortgages insured by the United States government that didn’t meet federal underwriting requirements.[86]

MetLife Hall of Records, Yonkers, New York.


As of 2010[update], MetLife had a "diverse product mix" which included insurance (home, car and life), variable life annuities and structured settlements, commercial mortgages and securities backed by commercial mortgages, and sovereign debt.[15]
Life insurance[edit]
MetLife’s individual life insurance products and services comprise term life insurance and several types of permanent life insurance, including whole life, universal life, and final expense whole life insurance.[87][88] These services vary in regards to the duration and amount of coverage available and whether a medical exam is required for coverage. The company also offers group life insurance, provided through employers, which consists of term life, permanent life, and accidental death and dismemberment coverage.[89][90] MetLife is the largest life insurer in the United States, based on life insurance in-force.[10][15]
Dental[edit]
MetLife offers group dental benefit plans for individuals, employees, retirees and their families and provides dental plan administration for over 20 million people.[91][92] Plans include MetLife’s Preferred Dentist Program (PPO) and the SafeGuard DHMO (available for both individuals and employees in CA, FL, TX, NJ and NY.). As of May 2010, MetLife’s dental PPO network included over 135,000 participating dentist locations nationwide while the dental HMO network included more than 13,000 participating dentist locations in California, Florida and Texas.[93] MetLife also administers dental continuing education program for dentists and allied health care professionals, which are recognized by the American Dental Association (ADA) and the Academy of General Dentistry (AGD).[94]
Disability[edit]
MetLife provides disability products for individuals as well as employee and association groups who receive them through their employer.[14][95] For individuals, the company’s individual disability income insurance can replace a portion of lost income if an individual is unable to work due to sickness or injury.[96] MetLife offers several individual disability income policies, including MetLife Income Guard, OMNI Advantage, OMNI Essential, Business Overhead Expense, and Buy-Sell.[97] The policy options provided by the company vary in terms of eligibility and the provided coverage. For groups, MetLife offers short term disability insurance and long term disability insurance.[98] Short term disability insurance is structured to replace a portion of an individual’s income during the initial weeks of a disabling illness or accident.[99] Long term disability Insurance serves to replace a portion of an individual’s income during an extended period of a disabling illness or accident.[100][101] The company also maintains an absence management product which allows employers to track and manage both planned and unplanned employee absences. The product, which MetLife calls MetLife Total Absence Management, is structured for businesses with 1,000 or more employees.[102]
Annuities[edit]
MetLife is among the largest providers of annuities in the world, recording $22.4 billion in sales during 2009.[103] MetLife offers annuities which consist of fixed annuities, variable annuities, deferred annuities and immediate annuities.[104] In 1921, MetLife was the first company to issue a group annuity contract.[105] More recently in 2004, it was the first insurer to introduce a longevity insurance product.[106] As of December 31, 2009, MetLife globally managed group annuity assets of $60 billion with $34 billion of transferred pension liabilities and provided benefit payments to over 600,000 annuitants per month.[107]
Auto & Home[edit]
MetLife Auto & Home is the brand name for MetLife’s nine affiliate personal lines insurance companies.[108] Collectively these companies offer personal lines property and casualty insurance policies in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.[109] The flagship company in the MetLife Auto & Home group, Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company, was founded in 1972.[108] MetLife Auto & Home companies presently have over 2.7 million active policies and service 58 of the Fortune 100 companies.[110][111]
MetLife's home insurance solutions include homeowners insurance, condo insurance, renters insurance, insurance for landlords, and mobile home insurance.[112][113] The available policies for MetLife's home insurance provide coverage for possessions, property damage from natural disaster or theft, and various legal expenses incurred resulting from injuries sustained on an individual's property.[114] The companies also sell RV, ATV, boat, mobile home, collectible vehicle, and motorcycle policies[115] and offers flood insurance policies as a participant in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which is managed by the federal government.[116][117] MetLife's various types of coverage for auto insurance include liability protection, collision and comprehensive coverage, personal injury protection, rental car coverage, and uninsured and underinsured motorists coverage.[118][119] Through an arrangement with Hyatt Legal Plans, a subsidiary of MetLife, MetLife Auto & Home underwrites group legal plans in many states.[18]
It was the first national insurer in the United States to offer identity-theft resolution services at no extra premium and as of 2012 continues to do so today in most United States states.[120][121] In 2010, MetLife Auto & Home began offering their GrandProtect plan in most states. This GrandProtect policy simplifies complex insurance needs by combining a client's home, valuable items, autos, RVs, and boats into one comprehensive policy package. The ultimate benefits to the consumer are having one bill, only one deductible, comprehensive coverage, and typically lower rates than trying to get each policy individually.[122]
Other products[edit]
MetLife’s products also include critical illness insurance.[123] Financial services include fee-based financial planning, retirement planning, wealth management, 529 Plans, banking, and commercial and residential mortgages.[124] The company also provides retirement plan and other financial services to healthcare, education, and not-for-profit organizations.[125] The MetLife Center for Special Needs Planning is a group of planners which serve families and individuals with special needs.[126] In 2014, MetLife launched MetLife Defender, a digital identity theft protection product.[127]
International presence[edit]
Outside of the United States, MetLife operates in Latin America, Europe, Asia’s Pacific region, and the Middle East, with leading market positions in Mexico, Japan, South Korea and Chile.[9]
On March 8, 2010, MetLife announced its intent to purchase the international leader life-insurance business, American Life Insurance Company (Alico), from American International Group (AIG). MetLife, which completed the deal on November 1, 2010, paid approximately $7.2 billion in cash and $9.0 billion in MetLife equity and other securities.[128][129] The securities portion of the deal consisted of 78.2 million shares of MetLife common stock, 6.9 million shares of contingent convertible preferred stock and 40 million equity units.[130] The values of the common and preferred stock were based on the closing price of MetLife’s common stock on October 29.[130] Upon completion of the purchase, MetLife became a leading competitor in Japan, the world’s second-largest life insurance market, and moved into a top 5 market position in many high growth emerging markets in Central and Eastern Europe, such as Romania, the Middle East and Latin America.[131] The deal added 20 million customers to MetLife’s 70 million and according to Barron's more than doubled the percentage of operating profits that MetLife gets abroad to 40%.[15]
In India MetLife has an affiliate company India Insurance Company Limited (MetLife) which has operated in India since 2001. This company has its headquarters in Bangalore and Gurgaon and was jointly owned by MetLife and a few local Indian financial companies. In 2012 an agreement was made with local Indian bank, the Punjab National Bank to establish a strategic alliance and for it to take a 30% share in MetLife India.[132] The state owned bank would in return sell MetLife insurance products in its branches
As of 2015, Julio Garcia-Villalon leads the Middle East & Africa regional business, which is headquartered in the Dubai International Financial Centre and has operated in the region since the 1950s.[133]
MetLife Foundation[edit]
MetLife Foundation is MetLife's independent charitable and grant-awarding foundation. It was founded in 1976[134] and had provided over $650 million in grants by January 2015.[134] The foundation has partnered with and donated to a variety of organizations, including Habitat for Humanity since 2010[135] and the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial Project Foundation since 2008.[136][137] In 2013, the MetLife Foundation announced a new focus on financial inclusion,[138] including educational programs on basic financial planning for disadvantaged children[139][140] and financial services aimed at low-income communities.[140][141][142]
Relationship with Peanuts[edit]
MetLife's use of comic strip characters, according to chief marketing officer Esther Lee, was intended "to make our company more friendly and approachable during a time when insurance companies were seen as cold and distant."[143]
MetLife licensed Snoopy and other Peanuts characters for promotional purposes from the Iconix Brand Group, which owns the promotional rights to the works of Charles M. Schulz. In 2010, Iconix formed a joint venture with Schulz’s heirs, buying out E. W. Scripps Co. and United Features Syndicate for $175 million. MetLife is reported to pay $12 million per year to Iconix for licensing rights.[144] Prior to the Iconix deal, MetLife had licensed the characters from other rights-holders.
The Peanuts-based campaign was developed by the advertising agency Young & Rubicam. MetLife also has used Foote Cone & Belding to develop Peanuts-related promotions.[145][146]
MetLife announced the end of its 31-year relationship with Peanuts on October 20, 2016. This decision resulted from the company's sale of its life insurance business to concentrate on corporate clients.[143] MetLife's new blue and green logo was criticized for being a knock-off of comparison website Diffen.[147][148]
Blimp and sports sponsorship[edit]




The Metlife 'Snoopy Two' blimp.


The MetLife blimp program began in 1987 with the “Snoopy 1” airship and, in 1994, expanded to include the “Snoopy 2” airship.[149] The program provides aerial coverage to over 80 major sporting events every year and is currently the official aerial coverage provider of the PGA Tour.[150] “Snoopy 1” and “Snoopy 2” also provide overhead television coverage for the NFL, CBS College Football, the LPGA, the NBA Finals, Copa Chile, the Preakness Stakes, and the Kentucky Derby.[150][151][152][153] On August 23, 2011, MetLife agreed to a 25-year sponsorship deal to rename New Meadowlands Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, home of the NFL's New York Giants and New York Jets to MetLife Stadium.[154]
MetLife and the “Ideal weight”[edit]
In 1959, The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (as it was known at the time) released tables of the best weight for each height for longevity, based on their collected insurance data. These tables showed the “desirable weights”. In 1983, they released tables showing the “ideal” weights for greatest longevity; this information was based on data collected in the Build Study of 1979 collected by the Society of Actuaries. This data followed patients for 18 years (from 1954-1972) and was collected from 25 life insurance companies in Canada and the United States, representing 4.2 million people. These “ideal” weights were higher than the prior “desirable” weights, this was attributed to an increase in muscle mass due to improved fitness levels among the population. This study is still the largest available pool of data for this purpose. It was noticed that the average weights in the population are higher than the ideal weights for survival. The ‘’’Metropolitan Tables’’’ included ‘’small’’, ‘’medium’’ and ‘’large’’ frames, based on elbow-girth measured using calipers, as the elbows do not develop adipose tissue. They presented weight ranges for height, sex and body frame (again associated with the lowest mortality) The mid-point of the ideal weight for the medium frames for each height was selected as the “ideal” weight used for calculations of “excess weight” (initial weight-ideal weight). This led to a formula to calculate the ideal weight used by bariatric surgeons, but it had lost considerable accuracy by 2007, again due to improvements in medical care and in public health.[155]

History[edit]
Early years[edit]




Home office of the New England Mutual Life Insurance Co. one of the predecessor companies of MetLife. see [30]


The predecessor company to MetLife began in 1863 when a group of New York City businessmen raised $100,000 to found the National Union Life and Limb Insurance Company. The company insured Civil War sailors and soldiers against disabilities due to wartime wounds, accidents, and sickness. On March 24, 1868, it became known as Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and shifted its focus to the life insurance business.[31][32]




The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company tower, which previously served as company headquarters, was featured in its advertising for many years.


A severe business depression that began with the Panic of 1873 forced the company to contract, until it reached its lowest point in the late 1870s. After observing the insurance industry in Great Britain in 1879, MetLife President Joseph F. Knapp brought “industrial” or “workingmen’s” insurance programs to the United States – insurance issued in small amounts on which premiums were collected weekly or monthly at the policyholder’s home. By 1880, sales had exceeded a quarter million of such policies, resulting in nearly $1 million in revenue from premiums. In 1909, MetLife had become the nation’s largest life insurer in the United States, as measured by life insurance in force (the total value of life insurance policies issued).[31][33]
In 1907, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company tower was commissioned to serve as MetLife’s 23rd Street headquarters in Lower Manhattan. Completed two years later, the building was the world's tallest until 1913 and remained the company's headquarters until 2005. For many years, an illustration of the building (with light emanating from the tip of its spire and the slogan, "The Light That Never Fails") featured prominently in MetLife’s advertising.[34] By 1930, MetLife insured every fifth man, woman, and child in the United States and Canada.[35] During the 1930s, it also began to diversify its portfolio by reducing the percentage of individual mortgages in favor of public utility bonds, investments in government securities, and loans for commercial real estate.[35] The company financed the construction of the Empire State Building in 1929 as well as provided capital to build Rockefeller Center in 1931. During World War II, MetLife placed more than 51 percent of its total assets in war bonds, and was the largest single private contributor to the Allied cause.[35]
Postwar[edit]

During the postwar era, the company expanded its suburban presence, decentralized operations, and refocused its career agency system to serve all market segments. It also began to market group insurance products to employers and institutions. By 1979, operations were segmented into four primary businesses: group insurance, personal insurance, pensions, and investments.[35] In 1981, MetLife purchased what became known as the MetLife building for $400 million from a group that included Pan American World Airways.[36][37]

De-mutualization and IPO[edit]
In 2000, MetLife converted from a mutual insurance company operated for the benefit of its policyholders to a for-profit public company. The de-mutualization process allowed MetLife to enter unrelated insurance businesses and increase executive compensation.
Policyholders received some stock in the new company in this process.[38] MetLife was accused of breaching federal securities laws by misrepresenting and omitting information in materials given to policyholders during this process, resulting in years of litigation ending with a $50 million settlement in 2009.[39]
Acquisitions, sales, and major deals[edit]

1992 - merged with United Mutual Life Insurance Company, the only African-American life insurer in New York, in 1992.[40]
1992 - [41] acquired Executive Life's single premium deferred annuity business, which was worth approximately $1.2 billion. MetLife also acquired the firm's life insurance business, valued at about $260 million.[42]
1995 - purchased New England Mutual Life Insurance Company.[43]
1997 - acquired Security First Group in 1997 for $377 million.[44][45]
1999 - acquired Lincoln National Corporation's individual disability income unit.[46]
1999 - bought out reinsurance provider GenAmerica Corporation for $1.2 billion, as well as its subsidiaries, Reinsurance Group of America and Conning Corporation.[47][48] That year, the company had grown to serve 7 million policyholders.[49]
2000 - de-mutualization and IPO.[50][51] The initial public offering was valued at $6.5 billion, which was the largest IPO to that date in United States financial history.[50][51] MetLife policyholders were asked to choose a cash or stock stake. This IPO made MetLife the most widely owned stock in the United States, and it raised MetLife's value to over $4 billion.[52][53] By 2000, MetLife's reported number of policyholders had risen to 11 million,[53] and that year it had become the United States' number one life insurer, surpassing Prudential, according to The New York Times.[54]
2000 - $470 million voice and data network management deal with AT&T Solutions.[55]
2001 - acquired Grand Bank of Kingston, New Jersey, which was renamed MetLife Bank.[56][57]
2001 - invested $1 billion in the United States stock market during 2001, immediately after the September 11th terrorist attacks.[58]
2005 - acquired Citigroup’s Travelers Life & Annuity and all of Citigroup’s international insurance businesses for $11.8 billion.[59][60] At the time of the deal, which was completed on July 1, 2005, the Travelers acquisition made MetLife the largest individual life insurer in North America based on sales.[61]
2006 - opened joint-venture insurance company in Shanghai, in May 2006.[62][63]
2006 - sold Peter Cooper Village, or Stuyvesant Town, the largest apartment complexes in New York City at the time, for $5.4 billion.[64][65] MetLife had developed the apartment complexes between 1945 and 1947, to house veterans returning home from serving in World War II.[66]
2010 - bought American Life Insurance Company from AIG for US$15,500,000,000.[59]
2011 - sold MetLife bank to GE Capital, exiting banking business.[67]

Current era[edit]
From 2004 to 2011, MetLife continued to hold its position as the largest life insurer in the United States.[16][68] The company had $2.5 trillion in policies written, $350 billion in assets under management, over 12 million customers in the United States, 8 million customers outside the United States, and a net income in 2003 of $2.2 billion.[68] That year, Barron's reported that 13 million American households owned at least one product from MetLife.[69]
MetLife named Robert H. Benmosche as chairman and CEO in July 1999. Benmosche occupied the position until 2006, when he was replaced by C. Robert Henrikson.[16][70][71]
The company's sales grew 11.5% between 2008 and 2009, despite the national recession.[72] In 2011, CEO Robert Henrikson was replaced by Steven A. Kandarian, who had overseen the company's "US$450,000,000,000 investment portfolio" as chief investment officer.[16] Henrikson remained the company's chairman to the end of 2011, at which point he reached the company's mandatory retirement age.[16]
In 2015, MetLife was ranked as number one on Fortune magazine's list of World's Most Admired Companies in the Insurance: Life and Health category.[73]
In the summer of 2017, MetLife plans to add a third office building of 255,000 square feet at its Cary, North Carolina Global Technology Campus, giving the company a total of 655,000 square feet at a location which has over 1,000 employees in such areas as engineering, software and technology. This plan was the result of North Carolina awarding the company $94 million in incentives in 2013 for creating over 2,600 jobs, half in Cary and half in Charlotte.[74]
"Too big to fail"[edit]
In 2012, MetLife failed the Federal Reserve’s (the Fed's) Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review stress test, intended to predict the potential failure of the company in a recession. The Fed stated that the minimum total risk-based capital ratio should be 8% and it estimated MetLife's ratio at 6%. The company had requested approval for a US$2,000,000,000 share repurchase to prop up the stock price, along with an increased dividend.[75] Because MetLife owned MetLife Bank, it was subject to stricter financial regulation. To escape that level of regulation, MetLife announced the sale of its banking unit to GE Capital.[76][77] On November 2, 2012, MetLife said it was selling its US$70,000,000,000 mortgage servicing business to JPMorgan Chase for an undisclosed amount.[78] Both sales were part of its strategy to focus on the insurance side of its business.
The attempt to escape "too big to fail" regulation was not successful. In September 2014, the United States government observed the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law by proposing the application of an official label to MetLife as "systemically important" to the American economy.[79] If implemented, MetLife would be subject to different sets of rules and regulations, with increased oversight from the Federal Reserve.[79][80] The company appealed this proposal in November 2014.[81] In December 2014, federal regulators decided that MetLife required the special regulations reserved for financial companies and organizations deemed "systemically important," or "too big to fail".[82] MetLife announced in January 2015 that it would file a lawsuit against the District of Columbia to overturn the federal regulators' decision,[79] thus becoming the first nonbank to challenge such a decision.[83] Three other nonbank companies have been designated as "systemically important": AIG, General Electric and Prudential.[82][83] MetLife continued to litigate this issue as of mid-2015, with the US Department of Justice asking that their challenge be dismissed.[83]
Fines[edit]
On August 7, 2012, it was announced that MetLife will pay $3.2 million in fines after the Federal Reserve charged it used unsafe and unsound practices in handling its mortgage servicing and foreclosure operations.[84]
In 2014, MetLife paid $23 million to settle multiple lawsuits over junk fax operations used to generate leads for life insurance sales.[85]


"MetLife Bank took advantage of the FHA insurance program by knowingly turning a blind eye to mortgage loans that did not meet basic underwriting requirements, and stuck the FHA and taxpayers with the bill when those mortgages defaulted."

U.S. Attorney John Walsh
In 2015, MetLife Home Loans LLC paid $123.5 million to the United States Department of Justice to resolve allegations it knowingly made mortgages insured by the United States government that didn’t meet federal underwriting requirements.[86]

MetLife Hall of Records, Yonkers, New York.


As of 2010[update], MetLife had a "diverse product mix" which included insurance (home, car and life), variable life annuities and structured settlements, commercial mortgages and securities backed by commercial mortgages, and sovereign debt.[15]
Life insurance[edit]
MetLife’s individual life insurance products and services comprise term life insurance and several types of permanent life insurance, including whole life, universal life, and final expense whole life insurance.[87][88] These services vary in regards to the duration and amount of coverage available and whether a medical exam is required for coverage. The company also offers group life insurance, provided through employers, which consists of term life, permanent life, and accidental death and dismemberment coverage.[89][90] MetLife is the largest life insurer in the United States, based on life insurance in-force.[10][15]
Dental[edit]
MetLife offers group dental benefit plans for individuals, employees, retirees and their families and provides dental plan administration for over 20 million people.[91][92] Plans include MetLife’s Preferred Dentist Program (PPO) and the SafeGuard DHMO (available for both individuals and employees in CA, FL, TX, NJ and NY.). As of May 2010, MetLife’s dental PPO network included over 135,000 participating dentist locations nationwide while the dental HMO network included more than 13,000 participating dentist locations in California, Florida and Texas.[93] MetLife also administers dental continuing education program for dentists and allied health care professionals, which are recognized by the American Dental Association (ADA) and the Academy of General Dentistry (AGD).[94]
Disability[edit]
MetLife provides disability products for individuals as well as employee and association groups who receive them through their employer.[14][95] For individuals, the company’s individual disability income insurance can replace a portion of lost income if an individual is unable to work due to sickness or injury.[96] MetLife offers several individual disability income policies, including MetLife Income Guard, OMNI Advantage, OMNI Essential, Business Overhead Expense, and Buy-Sell.[97] The policy options provided by the company vary in terms of eligibility and the provided coverage. For groups, MetLife offers short term disability insurance and long term disability insurance.[98] Short term disability insurance is structured to replace a portion of an individual’s income during the initial weeks of a disabling illness or accident.[99] Long term disability Insurance serves to replace a portion of an individual’s income during an extended period of a disabling illness or accident.[100][101] The company also maintains an absence management product which allows employers to track and manage both planned and unplanned employee absences. The product, which MetLife calls MetLife Total Absence Management, is structured for businesses with 1,000 or more employees.[102]
Annuities[edit]
MetLife is among the largest providers of annuities in the world, recording $22.4 billion in sales during 2009.[103] MetLife offers annuities which consist of fixed annuities, variable annuities, deferred annuities and immediate annuities.[104] In 1921, MetLife was the first company to issue a group annuity contract.[105] More recently in 2004, it was the first insurer to introduce a longevity insurance product.[106] As of December 31, 2009, MetLife globally managed group annuity assets of $60 billion with $34 billion of transferred pension liabilities and provided benefit payments to over 600,000 annuitants per month.[107]
Auto & Home[edit]
MetLife Auto & Home is the brand name for MetLife’s nine affiliate personal lines insurance companies.[108] Collectively these companies offer personal lines property and casualty insurance policies in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.[109] The flagship company in the MetLife Auto & Home group, Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company, was founded in 1972.[108] MetLife Auto & Home companies presently have over 2.7 million active policies and service 58 of the Fortune 100 companies.[110][111]
MetLife's home insurance solutions include homeowners insurance, condo insurance, renters insurance, insurance for landlords, and mobile home insurance.[112][113] The available policies for MetLife's home insurance provide coverage for possessions, property damage from natural disaster or theft, and various legal expenses incurred resulting from injuries sustained on an individual's property.[114] The companies also sell RV, ATV, boat, mobile home, collectible vehicle, and motorcycle policies[115] and offers flood insurance policies as a participant in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which is managed by the federal government.[116][117] MetLife's various types of coverage for auto insurance include liability protection, collision and comprehensive coverage, personal injury protection, rental car coverage, and uninsured and underinsured motorists coverage.[118][119] Through an arrangement with Hyatt Legal Plans, a subsidiary of MetLife, MetLife Auto & Home underwrites group legal plans in many states.[18]
It was the first national insurer in the United States to offer identity-theft resolution services at no extra premium and as of 2012 continues to do so today in most United States states.[120][121] In 2010, MetLife Auto & Home began offering their GrandProtect plan in most states. This GrandProtect policy simplifies complex insurance needs by combining a client's home, valuable items, autos, RVs, and boats into one comprehensive policy package. The ultimate benefits to the consumer are having one bill, only one deductible, comprehensive coverage, and typically lower rates than trying to get each policy individually.[122]
Other products[edit]
MetLife’s products also include critical illness insurance.[123] Financial services include fee-based financial planning, retirement planning, wealth management, 529 Plans, banking, and commercial and residential mortgages.[124] The company also provides retirement plan and other financial services to healthcare, education, and not-for-profit organizations.[125] The MetLife Center for Special Needs Planning is a group of planners which serve families and individuals with special needs.[126] In 2014, MetLife launched MetLife Defender, a digital identity theft protection product.[127]
International presence[edit]
Outside of the United States, MetLife operates in Latin America, Europe, Asia’s Pacific region, and the Middle East, with leading market positions in Mexico, Japan, South Korea and Chile.[9]
On March 8, 2010, MetLife announced its intent to purchase the international leader life-insurance business, American Life Insurance Company (Alico), from American International Group (AIG). MetLife, which completed the deal on November 1, 2010, paid approximately $7.2 billion in cash and $9.0 billion in MetLife equity and other securities.[128][129] The securities portion of the deal consisted of 78.2 million shares of MetLife common stock, 6.9 million shares of contingent convertible preferred stock and 40 million equity units.[130] The values of the common and preferred stock were based on the closing price of MetLife’s common stock on October 29.[130] Upon completion of the purchase, MetLife became a leading competitor in Japan, the world’s second-largest life insurance market, and moved into a top 5 market position in many high growth emerging markets in Central and Eastern Europe, such as Romania, the Middle East and Latin America.[131] The deal added 20 million customers to MetLife’s 70 million and according to Barron's more than doubled the percentage of operating profits that MetLife gets abroad to 40%.[15]
In India MetLife has an affiliate company India Insurance Company Limited (MetLife) which has operated in India since 2001. This company has its headquarters in Bangalore and Gurgaon and was jointly owned by MetLife and a few local Indian financial companies. In 2012 an agreement was made with local Indian bank, the Punjab National Bank to establish a strategic alliance and for it to take a 30% share in MetLife India.[132] The state owned bank would in return sell MetLife insurance products in its branches
As of 2015, Julio Garcia-Villalon leads the Middle East & Africa regional business, which is headquartered in the Dubai International Financial Centre and has operated in the region since the 1950s.[133]
MetLife Foundation[edit]
MetLife Foundation is MetLife's independent charitable and grant-awarding foundation. It was founded in 1976[134] and had provided over $650 million in grants by January 2015.[134] The foundation has partnered with and donated to a variety of organizations, including Habitat for Humanity since 2010[135] and the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial Project Foundation since 2008.[136][137] In 2013, the MetLife Foundation announced a new focus on financial inclusion,[138] including educational programs on basic financial planning for disadvantaged children[139][140] and financial services aimed at low-income communities.[140][141][142]
Relationship with Peanuts[edit]
MetLife's use of comic strip characters, according to chief marketing officer Esther Lee, was intended "to make our company more friendly and approachable during a time when insurance companies were seen as cold and distant."[143]
MetLife licensed Snoopy and other Peanuts characters for promotional purposes from the Iconix Brand Group, which owns the promotional rights to the works of Charles M. Schulz. In 2010, Iconix formed a joint venture with Schulz’s heirs, buying out E. W. Scripps Co. and United Features Syndicate for $175 million. MetLife is reported to pay $12 million per year to Iconix for licensing rights.[144] Prior to the Iconix deal, MetLife had licensed the characters from other rights-holders.
The Peanuts-based campaign was developed by the advertising agency Young & Rubicam. MetLife also has used Foote Cone & Belding to develop Peanuts-related promotions.[145][146]
MetLife announced the end of its 31-year relationship with Peanuts on October 20, 2016. This decision resulted from the company's sale of its life insurance business to concentrate on corporate clients.[143] MetLife's new blue and green logo was criticized for being a knock-off of comparison website Diffen.[147][148]
Blimp and sports sponsorship[edit]




The Metlife 'Snoopy Two' blimp.


The MetLife blimp program began in 1987 with the “Snoopy 1” airship and, in 1994, expanded to include the “Snoopy 2” airship.[149] The program provides aerial coverage to over 80 major sporting events every year and is currently the official aerial coverage provider of the PGA Tour.[150] “Snoopy 1” and “Snoopy 2” also provide overhead television coverage for the NFL, CBS College Football, the LPGA, the NBA Finals, Copa Chile, the Preakness Stakes, and the Kentucky Derby.[150][151][152][153] On August 23, 2011, MetLife agreed to a 25-year sponsorship deal to rename New Meadowlands Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, home of the NFL's New York Giants and New York Jets to MetLife Stadium.[154]
MetLife and the “Ideal weight”[edit]
In 1959, The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (as it was known at the time) released tables of the best weight for each height for longevity, based on their collected insurance data. These tables showed the “desirable weights”. In 1983, they released tables showing the “ideal” weights for greatest longevity; this information was based on data collected in the Build Study of 1979 collected by the Society of Actuaries. This data followed patients for 18 years (from 1954-1972) and was collected from 25 life insurance companies in Canada and the United States, representing 4.2 million people. These “ideal” weights were higher than the prior “desirable” weights, this was attributed to an increase in muscle mass due to improved fitness levels among the population. This study is still the largest available pool of data for this purpose. It was noticed that the average weights in the population are higher than the ideal weights for survival. The ‘’’Metropolitan Tables’’’ included ‘’small’’, ‘’medium’’ and ‘’large’’ frames, based on elbow-girth measured using calipers, as the elbows do not develop adipose tissue. They presented weight ranges for height, sex and body frame (again associated with the lowest mortality) The mid-point of the ideal weight for the medium frames for each height was selected as the “ideal” weight used for calculations of “excess weight” (initial weight-ideal weight). This led to a formula to calculate the ideal weight used by bariatric surgeons, but it had lost considerable accuracy by 2007, again due to improvements in medical care and in public health.[155]

MetLife, Inc. is the holding corporation for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MLIC),[4] better known as MetLife, and its affiliates. MetLife is among the largest global providers of insurance, annuities, and employee benefit programs, with 90 million customers in over 60 countries.[3][5] The firm was founded on March 24, 1868.[6]
On January 6, 1915, MetLife completed the mutualization process, changing from a stock life insurance company owned by individuals to a mutual company operating without external shareholders and for the benefit of policyholders.[7] The company went public in 2000.[8] Through its subsidiaries and affiliates, MetLife holds leading market positions in the United States, Japan, Latin America, Asia’s Pacific region, Europe, and the Middle East.[9] MetLife serves 90 of the largest Fortune 500 companies.[10] The company’s principal offices are located at 200 Park Avenue, New York City in Midtown Manhattan, New York City, though it retains some executive offices and its boardroom in the MetLife Building, located at 200 Park Avenue, New York City, which it sold in 2005.[11]
In January 2016, the company announced that it would spin off U.S. Retail business, including individual life insurance and annuities for the retail market, in a separate company called Brighthouse Financial.[12] They will maintain the MetLife name on MetLife Stadium.[13] On March 6, 2017, the separated U.S. Retail business launched Brighthouse Financial – an independent company focused on life insurance and annuities.

History[edit]
Early years[edit]




Home office of the New England Mutual Life Insurance Co. one of the predecessor companies of MetLife. see [30]


The predecessor company to MetLife began in 1863 when a group of New York City businessmen raised $100,000 to found the National Union Life and Limb Insurance Company. The company insured Civil War sailors and soldiers against disabilities due to wartime wounds, accidents, and sickness. On March 24, 1868, it became known as Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and shifted its focus to the life insurance business.[31][32]




The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company tower, which previously served as company headquarters, was featured in its advertising for many years.


A severe business depression that began with the Panic of 1873 forced the company to contract, until it reached its lowest point in the late 1870s. After observing the insurance industry in Great Britain in 1879, MetLife President Joseph F. Knapp brought “industrial” or “workingmen’s” insurance programs to the United States – insurance issued in small amounts on which premiums were collected weekly or monthly at the policyholder’s home. By 1880, sales had exceeded a quarter million of such policies, resulting in nearly $1 million in revenue from premiums. In 1909, MetLife had become the nation’s largest life insurer in the United States, as measured by life insurance in force (the total value of life insurance policies issued).[31][33]
In 1907, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company tower was commissioned to serve as MetLife’s 23rd Street headquarters in Lower Manhattan. Completed two years later, the building was the world's tallest until 1913 and remained the company's headquarters until 2005. For many years, an illustration of the building (with light emanating from the tip of its spire and the slogan, "The Light That Never Fails") featured prominently in MetLife’s advertising.[34] By 1930, MetLife insured every fifth man, woman, and child in the United States and Canada.[35] During the 1930s, it also began to diversify its portfolio by reducing the percentage of individual mortgages in favor of public utility bonds, investments in government securities, and loans for commercial real estate.[35] The company financed the construction of the Empire State Building in 1929 as well as provided capital to build Rockefeller Center in 1931. During World War II, MetLife placed more than 51 percent of its total assets in war bonds, and was the largest single private contributor to the Allied cause.[35]
Postwar[edit]

During the postwar era, the company expanded its suburban presence, decentralized operations, and refocused its career agency system to serve all market segments. It also began to market group insurance products to employers and institutions. By 1979, operations were segmented into four primary businesses: group insurance, personal insurance, pensions, and investments.[35] In 1981, MetLife purchased what became known as the MetLife building for $400 million from a group that included Pan American World Airways.[36][37]

De-mutualization and IPO[edit]
In 2000, MetLife converted from a mutual insurance company operated for the benefit of its policyholders to a for-profit public company. The de-mutualization process allowed MetLife to enter unrelated insurance businesses and increase executive compensation.
Policyholders received some stock in the new company in this process.[38] MetLife was accused of breaching federal securities laws by misrepresenting and omitting information in materials given to policyholders during this process, resulting in years of litigation ending with a $50 million settlement in 2009.[39]
Acquisitions, sales, and major deals[edit]

1992 - merged with United Mutual Life Insurance Company, the only African-American life insurer in New York, in 1992.[40]
1992 - [41] acquired Executive Life's single premium deferred annuity business, which was worth approximately $1.2 billion. MetLife also acquired the firm's life insurance business, valued at about $260 million.[42]
1995 - purchased New England Mutual Life Insurance Company.[43]
1997 - acquired Security First Group in 1997 for $377 million.[44][45]
1999 - acquired Lincoln National Corporation's individual disability income unit.[46]
1999 - bought out reinsurance provider GenAmerica Corporation for $1.2 billion, as well as its subsidiaries, Reinsurance Group of America and Conning Corporation.[47][48] That year, the company had grown to serve 7 million policyholders.[49]
2000 - de-mutualization and IPO.[50][51] The initial public offering was valued at $6.5 billion, which was the largest IPO to that date in United States financial history.[50][51] MetLife policyholders were asked to choose a cash or stock stake. This IPO made MetLife the most widely owned stock in the United States, and it raised MetLife's value to over $4 billion.[52][53] By 2000, MetLife's reported number of policyholders had risen to 11 million,[53] and that year it had become the United States' number one life insurer, surpassing Prudential, according to The New York Times.[54]
2000 - $470 million voice and data network management deal with AT&T Solutions.[55]
2001 - acquired Grand Bank of Kingston, New Jersey, which was renamed MetLife Bank.[56][57]
2001 - invested $1 billion in the United States stock market during 2001, immediately after the September 11th terrorist attacks.[58]
2005 - acquired Citigroup’s Travelers Life & Annuity and all of Citigroup’s international insurance businesses for $11.8 billion.[59][60] At the time of the deal, which was completed on July 1, 2005, the Travelers acquisition made MetLife the largest individual life insurer in North America based on sales.[61]
2006 - opened joint-venture insurance company in Shanghai, in May 2006.[62][63]
2006 - sold Peter Cooper Village, or Stuyvesant Town, the largest apartment complexes in New York City at the time, for $5.4 billion.[64][65] MetLife had developed the apartment complexes between 1945 and 1947, to house veterans returning home from serving in World War II.[66]
2010 - bought American Life Insurance Company from AIG for US$15,500,000,000.[59]
2011 - sold MetLife bank to GE Capital, exiting banking business.[67]

Current era[edit]
From 2004 to 2011, MetLife continued to hold its position as the largest life insurer in the United States.[16][68] The company had $2.5 trillion in policies written, $350 billion in assets under management, over 12 million customers in the United States, 8 million customers outside the United States, and a net income in 2003 of $2.2 billion.[68] That year, Barron's reported that 13 million American households owned at least one product from MetLife.[69]
MetLife named Robert H. Benmosche as chairman and CEO in July 1999. Benmosche occupied the position until 2006, when he was replaced by C. Robert Henrikson.[16][70][71]
The company's sales grew 11.5% between 2008 and 2009, despite the national recession.[72] In 2011, CEO Robert Henrikson was replaced by Steven A. Kandarian, who had overseen the company's "US$450,000,000,000 investment portfolio" as chief investment officer.[16] Henrikson remained the company's chairman to the end of 2011, at which point he reached the company's mandatory retirement age.[16]
In 2015, MetLife was ranked as number one on Fortune magazine's list of World's Most Admired Companies in the Insurance: Life and Health category.[73]
In the summer of 2017, MetLife plans to add a third office building of 255,000 square feet at its Cary, North Carolina Global Technology Campus, giving the company a total of 655,000 square feet at a location which has over 1,000 employees in such areas as engineering, software and technology. This plan was the result of North Carolina awarding the company $94 million in incentives in 2013 for creating over 2,600 jobs, half in Cary and half in Charlotte.[74]
"Too big to fail"[edit]
In 2012, MetLife failed the Federal Reserve’s (the Fed's) Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review stress test, intended to predict the potential failure of the company in a recession. The Fed stated that the minimum total risk-based capital ratio should be 8% and it estimated MetLife's ratio at 6%. The company had requested approval for a US$2,000,000,000 share repurchase to prop up the stock price, along with an increased dividend.[75] Because MetLife owned MetLife Bank, it was subject to stricter financial regulation. To escape that level of regulation, MetLife announced the sale of its banking unit to GE Capital.[76][77] On November 2, 2012, MetLife said it was selling its US$70,000,000,000 mortgage servicing business to JPMorgan Chase for an undisclosed amount.[78] Both sales were part of its strategy to focus on the insurance side of its business.
The attempt to escape "too big to fail" regulation was not successful. In September 2014, the United States government observed the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law by proposing the application of an official label to MetLife as "systemically important" to the American economy.[79] If implemented, MetLife would be subject to different sets of rules and regulations, with increased oversight from the Federal Reserve.[79][80] The company appealed this proposal in November 2014.[81] In December 2014, federal regulators decided that MetLife required the special regulations reserved for financial companies and organizations deemed "systemically important," or "too big to fail".[82] MetLife announced in January 2015 that it would file a lawsuit against the District of Columbia to overturn the federal regulators' decision,[79] thus becoming the first nonbank to challenge such a decision.[83] Three other nonbank companies have been designated as "systemically important": AIG, General Electric and Prudential.[82][83] MetLife continued to litigate this issue as of mid-2015, with the US Department of Justice asking that their challenge be dismissed.[83]
Fines[edit]
On August 7, 2012, it was announced that MetLife will pay $3.2 million in fines after the Federal Reserve charged it used unsafe and unsound practices in handling its mortgage servicing and foreclosure operations.[84]
In 2014, MetLife paid $23 million to settle multiple lawsuits over junk fax operations used to generate leads for life insurance sales.[85]


"MetLife Bank took advantage of the FHA insurance program by knowingly turning a blind eye to mortgage loans that did not meet basic underwriting requirements, and stuck the FHA and taxpayers with the bill when those mortgages defaulted."

U.S. Attorney John Walsh
In 2015, MetLife Home Loans LLC paid $123.5 million to the United States Department of Justice to resolve allegations it knowingly made mortgages insured by the United States government that didn’t meet federal underwriting requirements.[86]

MetLife Hall of Records, Yonkers, New York.


As of 2010[update], MetLife had a "diverse product mix" which included insurance (home, car and life), variable life annuities and structured settlements, commercial mortgages and securities backed by commercial mortgages, and sovereign debt.[15]
Life insurance[edit]
MetLife’s individual life insurance products and services comprise term life insurance and several types of permanent life insurance, including whole life, universal life, and final expense whole life insurance.[87][88] These services vary in regards to the duration and amount of coverage available and whether a medical exam is required for coverage. The company also offers group life insurance, provided through employers, which consists of term life, permanent life, and accidental death and dismemberment coverage.[89][90] MetLife is the largest life insurer in the United States, based on life insurance in-force.[10][15]
Dental[edit]
MetLife offers group dental benefit plans for individuals, employees, retirees and their families and provides dental plan administration for over 20 million people.[91][92] Plans include MetLife’s Preferred Dentist Program (PPO) and the SafeGuard DHMO (available for both individuals and employees in CA, FL, TX, NJ and NY.). As of May 2010, MetLife’s dental PPO network included over 135,000 participating dentist locations nationwide while the dental HMO network included more than 13,000 participating dentist locations in California, Florida and Texas.[93] MetLife also administers dental continuing education program for dentists and allied health care professionals, which are recognized by the American Dental Association (ADA) and the Academy of General Dentistry (AGD).[94]
Disability[edit]
MetLife provides disability products for individuals as well as employee and association groups who receive them through their employer.[14][95] For individuals, the company’s individual disability income insurance can replace a portion of lost income if an individual is unable to work due to sickness or injury.[96] MetLife offers several individual disability income policies, including MetLife Income Guard, OMNI Advantage, OMNI Essential, Business Overhead Expense, and Buy-Sell.[97] The policy options provided by the company vary in terms of eligibility and the provided coverage. For groups, MetLife offers short term disability insurance and long term disability insurance.[98] Short term disability insurance is structured to replace a portion of an individual’s income during the initial weeks of a disabling illness or accident.[99] Long term disability Insurance serves to replace a portion of an individual’s income during an extended period of a disabling illness or accident.[100][101] The company also maintains an absence management product which allows employers to track and manage both planned and unplanned employee absences. The product, which MetLife calls MetLife Total Absence Management, is structured for businesses with 1,000 or more employees.[102]
Annuities[edit]
MetLife is among the largest providers of annuities in the world, recording $22.4 billion in sales during 2009.[103] MetLife offers annuities which consist of fixed annuities, variable annuities, deferred annuities and immediate annuities.[104] In 1921, MetLife was the first company to issue a group annuity contract.[105] More recently in 2004, it was the first insurer to introduce a longevity insurance product.[106] As of December 31, 2009, MetLife globally managed group annuity assets of $60 billion with $34 billion of transferred pension liabilities and provided benefit payments to over 600,000 annuitants per month.[107]
Auto & Home[edit]
MetLife Auto & Home is the brand name for MetLife’s nine affiliate personal lines insurance companies.[108] Collectively these companies offer personal lines property and casualty insurance policies in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.[109] The flagship company in the MetLife Auto & Home group, Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company, was founded in 1972.[108] MetLife Auto & Home companies presently have over 2.7 million active policies and service 58 of the Fortune 100 companies.[110][111]
MetLife's home insurance solutions include homeowners insurance, condo insurance, renters insurance, insurance for landlords, and mobile home insurance.[112][113] The available policies for MetLife's home insurance provide coverage for possessions, property damage from natural disaster or theft, and various legal expenses incurred resulting from injuries sustained on an individual's property.[114] The companies also sell RV, ATV, boat, mobile home, collectible vehicle, and motorcycle policies[115] and offers flood insurance policies as a participant in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which is managed by the federal government.[116][117] MetLife's various types of coverage for auto insurance include liability protection, collision and comprehensive coverage, personal injury protection, rental car coverage, and uninsured and underinsured motorists coverage.[118][119] Through an arrangement with Hyatt Legal Plans, a subsidiary of MetLife, MetLife Auto & Home underwrites group legal plans in many states.[18]
It was the first national insurer in the United States to offer identity-theft resolution services at no extra premium and as of 2012 continues to do so today in most United States states.[120][121] In 2010, MetLife Auto & Home began offering their GrandProtect plan in most states. This GrandProtect policy simplifies complex insurance needs by combining a client's home, valuable items, autos, RVs, and boats into one comprehensive policy package. The ultimate benefits to the consumer are having one bill, only one deductible, comprehensive coverage, and typically lower rates than trying to get each policy individually.[122]
Other products[edit]
MetLife’s products also include critical illness insurance.[123] Financial services include fee-based financial planning, retirement planning, wealth management, 529 Plans, banking, and commercial and residential mortgages.[124] The company also provides retirement plan and other financial services to healthcare, education, and not-for-profit organizations.[125] The MetLife Center for Special Needs Planning is a group of planners which serve families and individuals with special needs.[126] In 2014, MetLife launched MetLife Defender, a digital identity theft protection product.[127]
International presence[edit]
Outside of the United States, MetLife operates in Latin America, Europe, Asia’s Pacific region, and the Middle East, with leading market positions in Mexico, Japan, South Korea and Chile.[9]
On March 8, 2010, MetLife announced its intent to purchase the international leader life-insurance business, American Life Insurance Company (Alico), from American International Group (AIG). MetLife, which completed the deal on November 1, 2010, paid approximately $7.2 billion in cash and $9.0 billion in MetLife equity and other securities.[128][129] The securities portion of the deal consisted of 78.2 million shares of MetLife common stock, 6.9 million shares of contingent convertible preferred stock and 40 million equity units.[130] The values of the common and preferred stock were based on the closing price of MetLife’s common stock on October 29.[130] Upon completion of the purchase, MetLife became a leading competitor in Japan, the world’s second-largest life insurance market, and moved into a top 5 market position in many high growth emerging markets in Central and Eastern Europe, such as Romania, the Middle East and Latin America.[131] The deal added 20 million customers to MetLife’s 70 million and according to Barron's more than doubled the percentage of operating profits that MetLife gets abroad to 40%.[15]
In India MetLife has an affiliate company India Insurance Company Limited (MetLife) which has operated in India since 2001. This company has its headquarters in Bangalore and Gurgaon and was jointly owned by MetLife and a few local Indian financial companies. In 2012 an agreement was made with local Indian bank, the Punjab National Bank to establish a strategic alliance and for it to take a 30% share in MetLife India.[132] The state owned bank would in return sell MetLife insurance products in its branches
As of 2015, Julio Garcia-Villalon leads the Middle East & Africa regional business, which is headquartered in the Dubai International Financial Centre and has operated in the region since the 1950s.[133]
MetLife Foundation[edit]
MetLife Foundation is MetLife's independent charitable and grant-awarding foundation. It was founded in 1976[134] and had provided over $650 million in grants by January 2015.[134] The foundation has partnered with and donated to a variety of organizations, including Habitat for Humanity since 2010[135] and the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial Project Foundation since 2008.[136][137] In 2013, the MetLife Foundation announced a new focus on financial inclusion,[138] including educational programs on basic financial planning for disadvantaged children[139][140] and financial services aimed at low-income communities.[140][141][142]
Relationship with Peanuts[edit]
MetLife's use of comic strip characters, according to chief marketing officer Esther Lee, was intended "to make our company more friendly and approachable during a time when insurance companies were seen as cold and distant."[143]
MetLife licensed Snoopy and other Peanuts characters for promotional purposes from the Iconix Brand Group, which owns the promotional rights to the works of Charles M. Schulz. In 2010, Iconix formed a joint venture with Schulz’s heirs, buying out E. W. Scripps Co. and United Features Syndicate for $175 million. MetLife is reported to pay $12 million per year to Iconix for licensing rights.[144] Prior to the Iconix deal, MetLife had licensed the characters from other rights-holders.
The Peanuts-based campaign was developed by the advertising agency Young & Rubicam. MetLife also has used Foote Cone & Belding to develop Peanuts-related promotions.[145][146]
MetLife announced the end of its 31-year relationship with Peanuts on October 20, 2016. This decision resulted from the company's sale of its life insurance business to concentrate on corporate clients.[143] MetLife's new blue and green logo was criticized for being a knock-off of comparison website Diffen.[147][148]
Blimp and sports sponsorship[edit]




The Metlife 'Snoopy Two' blimp.


The MetLife blimp program began in 1987 with the “Snoopy 1” airship and, in 1994, expanded to include the “Snoopy 2” airship.[149] The program provides aerial coverage to over 80 major sporting events every year and is currently the official aerial coverage provider of the PGA Tour.[150] “Snoopy 1” and “Snoopy 2” also provide overhead television coverage for the NFL, CBS College Football, the LPGA, the NBA Finals, Copa Chile, the Preakness Stakes, and the Kentucky Derby.[150][151][152][153] On August 23, 2011, MetLife agreed to a 25-year sponsorship deal to rename New Meadowlands Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, home of the NFL's New York Giants and New York Jets to MetLife Stadium.[154]
MetLife and the “Ideal weight”[edit]
In 1959, The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (as it was known at the time) released tables of the best weight for each height for longevity, based on their collected insurance data. These tables showed the “desirable weights”. In 1983, they released tables showing the “ideal” weights for greatest longevity; this information was based on data collected in the Build Study of 1979 collected by the Society of Actuaries. This data followed patients for 18 years (from 1954-1972) and was collected from 25 life insurance companies in Canada and the United States, representing 4.2 million people. These “ideal” weights were higher than the prior “desirable” weights, this was attributed to an increase in muscle mass due to improved fitness levels among the population. This study is still the largest available pool of data for this purpose. It was noticed that the average weights in the population are higher than the ideal weights for survival. The ‘’’Metropolitan Tables’’’ included ‘’small’’, ‘’medium’’ and ‘’large’’ frames, based on elbow-girth measured using calipers, as the elbows do not develop adipose tissue. They presented weight ranges for height, sex and body frame (again associated with the lowest mortality) The mid-point of the ideal weight for the medium frames for each height was selected as the “ideal” weight used for calculations of “excess weight” (initial weight-ideal weight). This led to a formula to calculate the ideal weight used by bariatric surgeons, but it had lost considerable accuracy by 2007, again due to improvements in medical care and in public health.[155]

MetLife, Inc. is the holding corporation for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MLIC),[4] better known as MetLife, and its affiliates. MetLife is among the largest global providers of insurance, annuities, and employee benefit programs, with 90 million customers in over 60 countries.[3][5] The firm was founded on March 24, 1868.[6]
On January 6, 1915, MetLife completed the mutualization process, changing from a stock life insurance company owned by individuals to a mutual company operating without external shareholders and for the benefit of policyholders.[7] The company went public in 2000.[8] Through its subsidiaries and affiliates, MetLife holds leading market positions in the United States, Japan, Latin America, Asia’s Pacific region, Europe, and the Middle East.[9] MetLife serves 90 of the largest Fortune 500 companies.[10] The company’s principal offices are located at 200 Park Avenue, New York City in Midtown Manhattan, New York City, though it retains some executive offices and its boardroom in the MetLife Building, located at 200 Park Avenue, New York City, which it sold in 2005.[11]
In January 2016, the company announced that it would spin off U.S. Retail business, including individual life insurance and annuities for the retail market, in a separate company called Brighthouse Financial.[12] They will maintain the MetLife name on MetLife Stadium.[13] On March 6, 2017, the separated U.S. Retail business launched Brighthouse Financial – an independent company focused on life insurance and annuities.

History[edit]
Early years[edit]




Home office of the New England Mutual Life Insurance Co. one of the predecessor companies of MetLife. see [30]


The predecessor company to MetLife began in 1863 when a group of New York City businessmen raised $100,000 to found the National Union Life and Limb Insurance Company. The company insured Civil War sailors and soldiers against disabilities due to wartime wounds, accidents, and sickness. On March 24, 1868, it became known as Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and shifted its focus to the life insurance business.[31][32]




The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company tower, which previously served as company headquarters, was featured in its advertising for many years.


A severe business depression that began with the Panic of 1873 forced the company to contract, until it reached its lowest point in the late 1870s. After observing the insurance industry in Great Britain in 1879, MetLife President Joseph F. Knapp brought “industrial” or “workingmen’s” insurance programs to the United States – insurance issued in small amounts on which premiums were collected weekly or monthly at the policyholder’s home. By 1880, sales had exceeded a quarter million of such policies, resulting in nearly $1 million in revenue from premiums. In 1909, MetLife had become the nation’s largest life insurer in the United States, as measured by life insurance in force (the total value of life insurance policies issued).[31][33]
In 1907, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company tower was commissioned to serve as MetLife’s 23rd Street headquarters in Lower Manhattan. Completed two years later, the building was the world's tallest until 1913 and remained the company's headquarters until 2005. For many years, an illustration of the building (with light emanating from the tip of its spire and the slogan, "The Light That Never Fails") featured prominently in MetLife’s advertising.[34] By 1930, MetLife insured every fifth man, woman, and child in the United States and Canada.[35] During the 1930s, it also began to diversify its portfolio by reducing the percentage of individual mortgages in favor of public utility bonds, investments in government securities, and loans for commercial real estate.[35] The company financed the construction of the Empire State Building in 1929 as well as provided capital to build Rockefeller Center in 1931. During World War II, MetLife placed more than 51 percent of its total assets in war bonds, and was the largest single private contributor to the Allied cause.[35]
Postwar[edit]

During the postwar era, the company expanded its suburban presence, decentralized operations, and refocused its career agency system to serve all market segments. It also began to market group insurance products to employers and institutions. By 1979, operations were segmented into four primary businesses: group insurance, personal insurance, pensions, and investments.[35] In 1981, MetLife purchased what became known as the MetLife building for $400 million from a group that included Pan American World Airways.[36][37]

De-mutualization and IPO[edit]
In 2000, MetLife converted from a mutual insurance company operated for the benefit of its policyholders to a for-profit public company. The de-mutualization process allowed MetLife to enter unrelated insurance businesses and increase executive compensation.
Policyholders received some stock in the new company in this process.[38] MetLife was accused of breaching federal securities laws by misrepresenting and omitting information in materials given to policyholders during this process, resulting in years of litigation ending with a $50 million settlement in 2009.[39]
Acquisitions, sales, and major deals[edit]

1992 - merged with United Mutual Life Insurance Company, the only African-American life insurer in New York, in 1992.[40]
1992 - [41] acquired Executive Life's single premium deferred annuity business, which was worth approximately $1.2 billion. MetLife also acquired the firm's life insurance business, valued at about $260 million.[42]
1995 - purchased New England Mutual Life Insurance Company.[43]
1997 - acquired Security First Group in 1997 for $377 million.[44][45]
1999 - acquired Lincoln National Corporation's individual disability income unit.[46]
1999 - bought out reinsurance provider GenAmerica Corporation for $1.2 billion, as well as its subsidiaries, Reinsurance Group of America and Conning Corporation.[47][48] That year, the company had grown to serve 7 million policyholders.[49]
2000 - de-mutualization and IPO.[50][51] The initial public offering was valued at $6.5 billion, which was the largest IPO to that date in United States financial history.[50][51] MetLife policyholders were asked to choose a cash or stock stake. This IPO made MetLife the most widely owned stock in the United States, and it raised MetLife's value to over $4 billion.[52][53] By 2000, MetLife's reported number of policyholders had risen to 11 million,[53] and that year it had become the United States' number one life insurer, surpassing Prudential, according to The New York Times.[54]
2000 - $470 million voice and data network management deal with AT&T Solutions.[55]
2001 - acquired Grand Bank of Kingston, New Jersey, which was renamed MetLife Bank.[56][57]
2001 - invested $1 billion in the United States stock market during 2001, immediately after the September 11th terrorist attacks.[58]
2005 - acquired Citigroup’s Travelers Life & Annuity and all of Citigroup’s international insurance businesses for $11.8 billion.[59][60] At the time of the deal, which was completed on July 1, 2005, the Travelers acquisition made MetLife the largest individual life insurer in North America based on sales.[61]
2006 - opened joint-venture insurance company in Shanghai, in May 2006.[62][63]
2006 - sold Peter Cooper Village, or Stuyvesant Town, the largest apartment complexes in New York City at the time, for $5.4 billion.[64][65] MetLife had developed the apartment complexes between 1945 and 1947, to house veterans returning home from serving in World War II.[66]
2010 - bought American Life Insurance Company from AIG for US$15,500,000,000.[59]
2011 - sold MetLife bank to GE Capital, exiting banking business.[67]

Current era[edit]
From 2004 to 2011, MetLife continued to hold its position as the largest life insurer in the United States.[16][68] The company had $2.5 trillion in policies written, $350 billion in assets under management, over 12 million customers in the United States, 8 million customers outside the United States, and a net income in 2003 of $2.2 billion.[68] That year, Barron's reported that 13 million American households owned at least one product from MetLife.[69]
MetLife named Robert H. Benmosche as chairman and CEO in July 1999. Benmosche occupied the position until 2006, when he was replaced by C. Robert Henrikson.[16][70][71]
The company's sales grew 11.5% between 2008 and 2009, despite the national recession.[72] In 2011, CEO Robert Henrikson was replaced by Steven A. Kandarian, who had overseen the company's "US$450,000,000,000 investment portfolio" as chief investment officer.[16] Henrikson remained the company's chairman to the end of 2011, at which point he reached the company's mandatory retirement age.[16]
In 2015, MetLife was ranked as number one on Fortune magazine's list of World's Most Admired Companies in the Insurance: Life and Health category.[73]
In the summer of 2017, MetLife plans to add a third office building of 255,000 square feet at its Cary, North Carolina Global Technology Campus, giving the company a total of 655,000 square feet at a location which has over 1,000 employees in such areas as engineering, software and technology. This plan was the result of North Carolina awarding the company $94 million in incentives in 2013 for creating over 2,600 jobs, half in Cary and half in Charlotte.[74]
"Too big to fail"[edit]
In 2012, MetLife failed the Federal Reserve’s (the Fed's) Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review stress test, intended to predict the potential failure of the company in a recession. The Fed stated that the minimum total risk-based capital ratio should be 8% and it estimated MetLife's ratio at 6%. The company had requested approval for a US$2,000,000,000 share repurchase to prop up the stock price, along with an increased dividend.[75] Because MetLife owned MetLife Bank, it was subject to stricter financial regulation. To escape that level of regulation, MetLife announced the sale of its banking unit to GE Capital.[76][77] On November 2, 2012, MetLife said it was selling its US$70,000,000,000 mortgage servicing business to JPMorgan Chase for an undisclosed amount.[78] Both sales were part of its strategy to focus on the insurance side of its business.
The attempt to escape "too big to fail" regulation was not successful. In September 2014, the United States government observed the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law by proposing the application of an official label to MetLife as "systemically important" to the American economy.[79] If implemented, MetLife would be subject to different sets of rules and regulations, with increased oversight from the Federal Reserve.[79][80] The company appealed this proposal in November 2014.[81] In December 2014, federal regulators decided that MetLife required the special regulations reserved for financial companies and organizations deemed "systemically important," or "too big to fail".[82] MetLife announced in January 2015 that it would file a lawsuit against the District of Columbia to overturn the federal regulators' decision,[79] thus becoming the first nonbank to challenge such a decision.[83] Three other nonbank companies have been designated as "systemically important": AIG, General Electric and Prudential.[82][83] MetLife continued to litigate this issue as of mid-2015, with the US Department of Justice asking that their challenge be dismissed.[83]
Fines[edit]
On August 7, 2012, it was announced that MetLife will pay $3.2 million in fines after the Federal Reserve charged it used unsafe and unsound practices in handling its mortgage servicing and foreclosure operations.[84]
In 2014, MetLife paid $23 million to settle multiple lawsuits over junk fax operations used to generate leads for life insurance sales.[85]


"MetLife Bank took advantage of the FHA insurance program by knowingly turning a blind eye to mortgage loans that did not meet basic underwriting requirements, and stuck the FHA and taxpayers with the bill when those mortgages defaulted."

U.S. Attorney John Walsh
In 2015, MetLife Home Loans LLC paid $123.5 million to the United States Department of Justice to resolve allegations it knowingly made mortgages insured by the United States government that didn’t meet federal underwriting requirements.[86]

MetLife Hall of Records, Yonkers, New York.


As of 2010[update], MetLife had a "diverse product mix" which included insurance (home, car and life), variable life annuities and structured settlements, commercial mortgages and securities backed by commercial mortgages, and sovereign debt.[15]
Life insurance[edit]
MetLife’s individual life insurance products and services comprise term life insurance and several types of permanent life insurance, including whole life, universal life, and final expense whole life insurance.[87][88] These services vary in regards to the duration and amount of coverage available and whether a medical exam is required for coverage. The company also offers group life insurance, provided through employers, which consists of term life, permanent life, and accidental death and dismemberment coverage.[89][90] MetLife is the largest life insurer in the United States, based on life insurance in-force.[10][15]
Dental[edit]
MetLife offers group dental benefit plans for individuals, employees, retirees and their families and provides dental plan administration for over 20 million people.[91][92] Plans include MetLife’s Preferred Dentist Program (PPO) and the SafeGuard DHMO (available for both individuals and employees in CA, FL, TX, NJ and NY.). As of May 2010, MetLife’s dental PPO network included over 135,000 participating dentist locations nationwide while the dental HMO network included more than 13,000 participating dentist locations in California, Florida and Texas.[93] MetLife also administers dental continuing education program for dentists and allied health care professionals, which are recognized by the American Dental Association (ADA) and the Academy of General Dentistry (AGD).[94]
Disability[edit]
MetLife provides disability products for individuals as well as employee and association groups who receive them through their employer.[14][95] For individuals, the company’s individual disability income insurance can replace a portion of lost income if an individual is unable to work due to sickness or injury.[96] MetLife offers several individual disability income policies, including MetLife Income Guard, OMNI Advantage, OMNI Essential, Business Overhead Expense, and Buy-Sell.[97] The policy options provided by the company vary in terms of eligibility and the provided coverage. For groups, MetLife offers short term disability insurance and long term disability insurance.[98] Short term disability insurance is structured to replace a portion of an individual’s income during the initial weeks of a disabling illness or accident.[99] Long term disability Insurance serves to replace a portion of an individual’s income during an extended period of a disabling illness or accident.[100][101] The company also maintains an absence management product which allows employers to track and manage both planned and unplanned employee absences. The product, which MetLife calls MetLife Total Absence Management, is structured for businesses with 1,000 or more employees.[102]
Annuities[edit]
MetLife is among the largest providers of annuities in the world, recording $22.4 billion in sales during 2009.[103] MetLife offers annuities which consist of fixed annuities, variable annuities, deferred annuities and immediate annuities.[104] In 1921, MetLife was the first company to issue a group annuity contract.[105] More recently in 2004, it was the first insurer to introduce a longevity insurance product.[106] As of December 31, 2009, MetLife globally managed group annuity assets of $60 billion with $34 billion of transferred pension liabilities and provided benefit payments to over 600,000 annuitants per month.[107]
Auto & Home[edit]
MetLife Auto & Home is the brand name for MetLife’s nine affiliate personal lines insurance companies.[108] Collectively these companies offer personal lines property and casualty insurance policies in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.[109] The flagship company in the MetLife Auto & Home group, Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company, was founded in 1972.[108] MetLife Auto & Home companies presently have over 2.7 million active policies and service 58 of the Fortune 100 companies.[110][111]
MetLife's home insurance solutions include homeowners insurance, condo insurance, renters insurance, insurance for landlords, and mobile home insurance.[112][113] The available policies for MetLife's home insurance provide coverage for possessions, property damage from natural disaster or theft, and various legal expenses incurred resulting from injuries sustained on an individual's property.[114] The companies also sell RV, ATV, boat, mobile home, collectible vehicle, and motorcycle policies[115] and offers flood insurance policies as a participant in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which is managed by the federal government.[116][117] MetLife's various types of coverage for auto insurance include liability protection, collision and comprehensive coverage, personal injury protection, rental car coverage, and uninsured and underinsured motorists coverage.[118][119] Through an arrangement with Hyatt Legal Plans, a subsidiary of MetLife, MetLife Auto & Home underwrites group legal plans in many states.[18]
It was the first national insurer in the United States to offer identity-theft resolution services at no extra premium and as of 2012 continues to do so today in most United States states.[120][121] In 2010, MetLife Auto & Home began offering their GrandProtect plan in most states. This GrandProtect policy simplifies complex insurance needs by combining a client's home, valuable items, autos, RVs, and boats into one comprehensive policy package. The ultimate benefits to the consumer are having one bill, only one deductible, comprehensive coverage, and typically lower rates than trying to get each policy individually.[122]
Other products[edit]
MetLife’s products also include critical illness insurance.[123] Financial services include fee-based financial planning, retirement planning, wealth management, 529 Plans, banking, and commercial and residential mortgages.[124] The company also provides retirement plan and other financial services to healthcare, education, and not-for-profit organizations.[125] The MetLife Center for Special Needs Planning is a group of planners which serve families and individuals with special needs.[126] In 2014, MetLife launched MetLife Defender, a digital identity theft protection product.[127]
International presence[edit]
Outside of the United States, MetLife operates in Latin America, Europe, Asia’s Pacific region, and the Middle East, with leading market positions in Mexico, Japan, South Korea and Chile.[9]
On March 8, 2010, MetLife announced its intent to purchase the international leader life-insurance business, American Life Insurance Company (Alico), from American International Group (AIG). MetLife, which completed the deal on November 1, 2010, paid approximately $7.2 billion in cash and $9.0 billion in MetLife equity and other securities.[128][129] The securities portion of the deal consisted of 78.2 million shares of MetLife common stock, 6.9 million shares of contingent convertible preferred stock and 40 million equity units.[130] The values of the common and preferred stock were based on the closing price of MetLife’s common stock on October 29.[130] Upon completion of the purchase, MetLife became a leading competitor in Japan, the world’s second-largest life insurance market, and moved into a top 5 market position in many high growth emerging markets in Central and Eastern Europe, such as Romania, the Middle East and Latin America.[131] The deal added 20 million customers to MetLife’s 70 million and according to Barron's more than doubled the percentage of operating profits that MetLife gets abroad to 40%.[15]
In India MetLife has an affiliate company India Insurance Company Limited (MetLife) which has operated in India since 2001. This company has its headquarters in Bangalore and Gurgaon and was jointly owned by MetLife and a few local Indian financial companies. In 2012 an agreement was made with local Indian bank, the Punjab National Bank to establish a strategic alliance and for it to take a 30% share in MetLife India.[132] The state owned bank would in return sell MetLife insurance products in its branches
As of 2015, Julio Garcia-Villalon leads the Middle East & Africa regional business, which is headquartered in the Dubai International Financial Centre and has operated in the region since the 1950s.[133]
MetLife Foundation[edit]
MetLife Foundation is MetLife's independent charitable and grant-awarding foundation. It was founded in 1976[134] and had provided over $650 million in grants by January 2015.[134] The foundation has partnered with and donated to a variety of organizations, including Habitat for Humanity since 2010[135] and the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial Project Foundation since 2008.[136][137] In 2013, the MetLife Foundation announced a new focus on financial inclusion,[138] including educational programs on basic financial planning for disadvantaged children[139][140] and financial services aimed at low-income communities.[140][141][142]
Relationship with Peanuts[edit]
MetLife's use of comic strip characters, according to chief marketing officer Esther Lee, was intended "to make our company more friendly and approachable during a time when insurance companies were seen as cold and distant."[143]
MetLife licensed Snoopy and other Peanuts characters for promotional purposes from the Iconix Brand Group, which owns the promotional rights to the works of Charles M. Schulz. In 2010, Iconix formed a joint venture with Schulz’s heirs, buying out E. W. Scripps Co. and United Features Syndicate for $175 million. MetLife is reported to pay $12 million per year to Iconix for licensing rights.[144] Prior to the Iconix deal, MetLife had licensed the characters from other rights-holders.
The Peanuts-based campaign was developed by the advertising agency Young & Rubicam. MetLife also has used Foote Cone & Belding to develop Peanuts-related promotions.[145][146]
MetLife announced the end of its 31-year relationship with Peanuts on October 20, 2016. This decision resulted from the company's sale of its life insurance business to concentrate on corporate clients.[143] MetLife's new blue and green logo was criticized for being a knock-off of comparison website Diffen.[147][148]
Blimp and sports sponsorship[edit]




The Metlife 'Snoopy Two' blimp.


The MetLife blimp program began in 1987 with the “Snoopy 1” airship and, in 1994, expanded to include the “Snoopy 2” airship.[149] The program provides aerial coverage to over 80 major sporting events every year and is currently the official aerial coverage provider of the PGA Tour.[150] “Snoopy 1” and “Snoopy 2” also provide overhead television coverage for the NFL, CBS College Football, the LPGA, the NBA Finals, Copa Chile, the Preakness Stakes, and the Kentucky Derby.[150][151][152][153] On August 23, 2011, MetLife agreed to a 25-year sponsorship deal to rename New Meadowlands Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, home of the NFL's New York Giants and New York Jets to MetLife Stadium.[154]
MetLife and the “Ideal weight”[edit]
In 1959, The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (as it was known at the time) released tables of the best weight for each height for longevity, based on their collected insurance data. These tables showed the “desirable weights”. In 1983, they released tables showing the “ideal” weights for greatest longevity; this information was based on data collected in the Build Study of 1979 collected by the Society of Actuaries. This data followed patients for 18 years (from 1954-1972) and was collected from 25 life insurance companies in Canada and the United States, representing 4.2 million people. These “ideal” weights were higher than the prior “desirable” weights, this was attributed to an increase in muscle mass due to improved fitness levels among the population. This study is still the largest available pool of data for this purpose. It was noticed that the average weights in the population are higher than the ideal weights for survival. The ‘’’Metropolitan Tables’’’ included ‘’small’’, ‘’medium’’ and ‘’large’’ frames, based on elbow-girth measured using calipers, as the elbows do not develop adipose tissue. They presented weight ranges for height, sex and body frame (again associated with the lowest mortality) The mid-point of the ideal weight for the medium frames for each height was selected as the “ideal” weight used for calculations of “excess weight” (initial weight-ideal weight). This led to a formula to calculate the ideal weight used by bariatric surgeons, but it had lost considerable accuracy by 2007, again due to improvements in medical care and in public health.[155]

About METROPOLITAN LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY (INC)

   While its name evolved from "metropolitan," MetLife's policies are found in villages, towns, and huge cities around the world. Operating through its Metropolitan Life Insurance subsidiary, MetLife is the largest life insurer in the US. Its Insurance Products segment includes all of its group and individual life insurance and non-medical health insurance products (dental, disability, illness). Its Retirement Products segment includes annuity products. MetLife's Auto & Home segment works through subsidiary Metropolitan Property and Casualty. MetLife is a big player in Japan, and growing in more than 50 other countries, especially in Latin America. MetLife plans to split off much of its US life business.
  
Operations

   MetLife is organized into six segments: Retail; Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits; Corporate Benefit Funding; Latin America (the Americas); Asia; and Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA). Certain results are also reported in the operations of the Corporate & Other segment, including MetLife Home Loans.
  

   In the US, MetLife provides a range of insurance and financial services offerings including life, property/casualty, disability, dental, guaranteed interest, and annuities. These are distributed through both in-house and independent retail channels and in the workplace. Internationally, the company provides life, accident, medical, dental, and other insurance, as well as annuities and other retirement and savings products to individuals and groups.
  

   The company's Retail segment is organized into two businesses: life and other (variable life products, universal life products, term life products, whole life products, disability products, property & casualty); and annuities (variable annuities and fixed annuities). In 2015 retail sales accounted for 30% of total revenue.
  

   The Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits segment is organized into Group and Voluntary and Worksite. Group insurance products and services include life, dental, group short- and long-term disability and accidental death and dismemberment coverages. That segment accounted for 28% of revenue in 2015.
  

   The Corporate Benefit Funding segment handles investment management for large employers that offer retirement benefits, including pension closeouts and specialized life insurance products used to fund such benefit plans. Corporate Benefit Funding accounted for 13% of revenue in 2015.
  

   The company also services a number of long-term care insurance policies.
  
Geographic Reach

   The company operates in the Americas and Asia, and in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA). In Latin America it operates in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, and Uruguay (with the bulk of regional revenues coming from Mexico, Chile, and Argentina).
  

   The company operates in 10 countries in Asia, with its largest operations in Japan and Korea. It also does business in Australia, Bangladesh, Hong Kong, and Nepal, and through a joint venture in China, Malaysia, and Vietnam.
  

   MetLife operates in 26 countries across EMEA. The segment's biggest operations are in Poland, the Persian Gulf, and Russia.
  

   While the US remains its largest overall market, international sales accounted for about 30% of MetLife's revenues.
  
Sales and Marketing

   Policies and other products are sold to some 100 million customers through a vast network of targeted marketing and sales forces, financial advisors, consultants, agency distribution groups, captive agents, independent agents, affiliated broker-dealers, and direct marketing (including direct response television, web-based lead generation, telemarketing, as well as through third parties and e-commerce). In addition, MetLife sells some products through affinity groups and through employers.
  
Financial Performance

   Revenue, which has been fluctuating over the past few years, fell 5% to $70 billion in 2015. This was due to negative impacts of foreign currency exchange rates and a decline in investment earnings. However, this was partially offset by growth in the US market and in corporate benefit funding.
  

   Net income has been even more unsteady, taking a huge dip in 2012, recovering for the next two years, and then dropping 16% to $5.3 billion in 2015. That latest decline was caused by the lower revenue but was offset by lower operating expenses including policyholder benefits. Following suit, cash flow from operations fell 14% to $14.1 billion that year.
  
Strategy

   In 2016, MetLife announced plans to spin off much of its US retail operations into a new company named Brighthouse Financial. Its MetLife Insurance Company USA, General American Life Insurance Company, Metropolitan Tower Life Insurance Company, and several other units will be included in the transaction, whether that be in the form of an initial public offering or a spin-off. Together, those units have represented about 20% of MetLife's total earnings.
  

   In mid-2016 MassMutual bought MetLife's US retail captive agency distribution channel MetLife Premier Client Group and broker dealer MetLife Securities. (US retail businesses that
   
    were not
   
   divested include the closed-block life insurance, property/casualty, and Metropolitan Life Insurance Company's life and annuity operations.)
  

   The move to divest part of its core operations comes in the wake of the financial crisis and subsequent changes in the regulatory landscape. US regulators had designated MetLife one of four non-bank systemically important financial institutions (meaning it would pose a risk to the economy if it should collapse), but MetLife fought the designation, winning its case in a federal court in 2016. Regardless, the pending separation of its US life insurance business should calm any unrest over the group's size. The newly created company will also benefit from having a lower capital and compliance burden.
  

   This is not the first major shuffling of MetLife's operations in recent years. It is exiting the bulk of its banking operations to avoid the increased scrutiny of banks under Dodd-Frank financial regulations. The company is working to surrender its status as a bank holding company. It has already sold its MetLife Bank depository operations and has stopped writing new residential mortgages and reverse mortgages.
  

   Going forward, MetLife plans to focus on pension and retirement products, insurance sold to employers, and non-US life insurance. The company has pinned much of its growth efforts on emerging markets by increasing its already strong presence in the Asia/Pacific region and in Latin America through acquisitions and new product introductions. To support this growth, the company has organized its operations along geographic lines: The Americas; Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA); and Asia.
  

   Some of the individual and group products MetLife sells overseas include life insurance, accident and health insurance, credit insurance, and annuities and retirement products. It has also created a global employee benefits business to reach into new markets. To focus on
   
    core
   
   international businesses Metlife has been selling off select foreign assets. In 2014 it sold its UK annuity business to Goldman Sachs Group company Rothesay Life Ltd. for $5 billion.
  

   MetLife is focused on growing its annuity business through a range of products. One example is its new guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit VA, FlexChoice.
  

   In 2014 the company launched its MetLife SecureFlex Universal Life product.
  

   Additionally, MetLife has been working to cuts its expenses, and is on track to meet its goal of achieving $1 billion in gross expense savings.
  
Mergers and Acquisitions

   The company has been diversifying its real estate equity holdings. In 2014 it acquired the Fairmont Hotel in Washington, DC, for $180 million. It also acquired a couple of retail centers that year.

No matter when you start, you always want to start off on the right foot.
And with a term life insurance policy from New York Life Insurance Company you’re starting off on the best foot possible.

Term life is simple and affordable and you pay a low monthly premium based on the term length and the amount of coverage you need. At the end of your term, you may be able to renew your coverage, often at a higher premium without having to provide evidence of good health. Buying term life insurance can be a wise decision while you are young and healthy, since premiums tend to be much lower. So why wait? Protect the ones you love and keep good going in your life.

The many benefits of a term life insurance policy include:


Affordable premiums: cover yourself, spouse, family or business without breaking the bank
Guaranteed death benefit paid out to a beneficiary or beneficiaries you select
Guaranteed coverage for the duration of the term selected (example: 5, 10, 20 years)
Conversion privilege at the end of the term to a permanent policy (certain limitations apply)


To get started, fill out the form above and a local, professionally-trained agent will get back to you with a no-cost, no-obligation consultation.

In Oregon, the policy form numbers are as follows: Family Protection - 206-110.27; Level Premium Convertible Term - 210-60.27; One-Year Non Renewable Term - 209-125.27; and Yearly Convertible Term - 210-135-27.

Consumer Tip: Lifely Term is a term life insurance product issued with limited underwriting and limited medical evidence of insurability. You may be able to purchase other life insurance products (including our other term life products) for substantially less cost if you apply for a life insurance product with full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability. However, if you submit to full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability, you may be required to pay more for a fully underwritten product that if you purchased a Lifely Term policy.

FAQ
These FAQs provide some information about Lifely Term and about life insurance generally. Only a policy will have complete details on how the policy works, how to qualify for benefits, what restrictions or limitations apply, and terms for keeping the policy in effect. 
What else should I know about life insurance?


What is term insurance?

Term insurance is a type of life insurance that provides protection for a set period of time. If you (the insured person) die during this period, the policy will pay a death benefit to the person or people you designate; these are called your beneficiaries. 
With Lifely Term, you can choose a term period of 10, 15, or 20 years. The policy and death benefit coverage end when the term period expires. The policy is not convertible to another policy, it does not have cash value and it does not have a return of premium feature.


What is a premium?

Premiums are the amounts you pay to begin your policy and keep it in effect. 
For Lifely Term, your premium is automatically deducted each month from the bank account you choose.

What happens if I miss a payment?

Your policy will enter a grace period. If you do not pay your premium by the end of the grace period shown in your policy, your policy will end without value and you will no longer be covered.

How do I know which term period to select?

Think about the reasons you’re purchasing the policy. Consider not only the expenses you want to help ensure your family will be able to pay without your income but also for how long they will still rely on your financial support.
Also consider that life insurance generally becomes more expensive as one gets older.  Once your policy ends, if you want to buy another policy, you typically will need to qualify again. In the time between policies, your health may change, perhaps causing you to pay a higher premium or even be denied coverage later on.

How do I know which death benefit payment period to choose?

For how many years after your death will your family need the financial support of this policy’s death benefit? The answer to this question will guide you.

How does the death benefit get paid to my beneficiaries?

The death benefit will be paid to your beneficiaries in monthly payments. These payments will be for the benefit amount you choose and for the number of years you select.
With Lifely Term, you can choose the benefit payment period—the number of years that you’d like your beneficiaries to receive payments from this policy if you pass away. You can choose benefit payment periods of 10, 15, 20, or 30 years. Please note that you cannot change the payment period after the policy is issued.

Will the monthly death benefit be taxed?

Yes. Although the death benefit of most other life insurance policies is paid out generally free of federal income tax, a portion of Lifely Term's benefit, which is paid out monthly as chosen when you apply, will be considered income to your beneficiary for income tax purposes. Please keep this in mind when considering Lifely Term.

Are death benefits paid out as the result of a suicide?

In general, if the insured person dies by suicide in the first two years from when the policy is issued, the policy will end and all premiums will be returned. A new suicide exclusion period may begin if we agree to reinstate a policy that ends because of a missed premium payment.

Why are you asking about my health and lifestyle?

We use information about your health and habits to determine your eligibility for the policy.

What if I want to change or add beneficiaries later?

As a policyholder, you can change your beneficiary designation at any time and as often as you’d like by contacting Customer Service at 844-499-0771.

If I die, when will my beneficiaries receive the money?

Monthly payment of benefits will begin after we receive proof of death and the forms we require.

When does my coverage start?

Assuming your policy is approved, coverage begins immediately once we have received your first payment and your signed acceptance of your policy.

Can I cancel my policy at any time?

Yes. Please refer to your policy for cancellation details or call Customer Service at 844-499-0771.

Where does the information come from?

We are able to search public records, such as county or city records.  We do not access or affect your credit file.

How can you check my identity online?

We are able to search public records, such as county or city records.  We do not access or affect your credit file.

What do you do with the answers?

The information you provide is used only to verify your identity.  We do not maintain a record of the information reviewed while verifying your identity.

How does Prudential protect my personal information?

Prudential respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. Please select the Customer Privacy Notice button that appears on the bottom of this website's pages to view our privacy statement.

How can I be sure my privacy is protected?

Prudential respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. Please select the Customer Privacy Notice button that appears on the bottom of this website's pages to view our privacy statement.

What is an eSignature?

Whenever you apply for a life insurance policy, you need to sign a few documents during the process. Since this process is over the Internet and you cannot physically sign the documents, we use electronic signature, or eSignature, to get your signature.

Lifely Term (PCT-2016) is issued in California by Pruco Life Insurance Company, Newark, NJ.

What else should i know about life insurance?


THE BENEFITS OF LIFE INSURANCE
If you're like most people, you don't want to think about the possibility of dying. You expect to live for a long time and purchasing life insurance is not your first priority. But, have you considered the consequences of not having life insurance?   Because of the many different types of life insurance products available, making the right choice appears to be complicated, but it needn't be so. 


WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF INSURANCE?
There are two basic types of life insurance: term life insurance and permanent life insurance.  Term Life Insurance is an attractive solution to help protect you and your family with affordable and flexible policy options.
Term insurance can provide inexpensive coverage to meet specific needs.  It provides a stated benefit when you pass away, provided your death occurs within a specified time period. Term life insurance does not provide any benefits in case of disability or accidental injury.  In general, term products do not have cash values available for loan or withdrawal. Term life insurance premiums are generally lower for a period of time. After this period, some term policies end while others may be renewed, but with dramatically higher premiums. Purchasing a new policy after the end of your term period can be very expensive and you may have to have a medical exam to prove insurability.
Term is often considered appropriate when coverage is only required for a specific period of time; for instance, until your children graduate from college. The benefits can be used to replace income you would have earned to help pay off a mortgage or help maintain your family's lifestyle, for example. In addition, benefits can help cover funeral expenses.
Return of premium term is a slightly different type of term insurance. Premiums tend to be higher with the benefit being that the premiums paid are returned to you at the end of the level term period, provided you meet the conditions set by the insurance company.
Some term insurance policies include a conversion privilege. This benefit gives you the option to convert your term policy to a permanent policy before the end of the conversion period without having to take another medical exam to be approved for coverage. However, in most cases, premiums for the permanent policy will be higher than the premiums you've been paying for the term policy.
Permanent insurance can cover you for as long as you live (as long as you pay sufficient premiums and there are no substantial loans or withdrawals). The premiums are generally higher than term insurance during the term period. After this period, however, premiums for a permanent policy may be less than term policy premiums. 
Permanent insurance combines the security of insurance protection with the ability to accumulate some cash values inside the policy. These funds are generally allowed to grow within the policy on a tax-deferred basis and may be used to supplement income, or meet emergency or other financial needs in the future. These values may be accessed through policy loans or withdrawals during the insured's lifetime.  Please note that, although you can use the cash value of your whole life insurance for these purposes, the primary reason for purchasing life insurance should be for the death benefit it provides.
Also keep in mind that unpaid loans and withdrawals will reduce future cash value, policy benefits and guarantees. Under certain circumstances withdrawals may be taxable; loans are generally not taxable. Any loans that are outstanding when a policy lapses or is surrendered will cause immediate taxation on the amount loaned in excess of the premium paid¹.  Any outstanding loans at the time of death will be deducted from the proceeds of the death benefit along with any accrued interest on the loan.
There are three types of permanent life insurance: 1) traditional (or "classic" ); 2) universal (also called "flexible premium" or "adjustable" ); 3) variable.  All types offer cash values and guaranteed death benefits. Traditional and universal life policies offer cash values that are a combination of guaranteed and non-guaranteed elements. The non-guaranteed elements usually include any dividends earned (traditional) or earnings in excess of the contractually guaranteed cash values (universal).
While most variable life policies also provide a guaranteed death benefit, the cash value of a variable life insurance policy is not guaranteed and fluctuates based on the performance of the underlying investment options that you choose. Because you bear the investment risk as opposed to the insurance company, variable life is considered a "security," subject to federal securities laws and protections, and is sold by prospectus. With a variable life insurance policy, the guarantees are based on the claims-paying ability of the applicable issuing company and they do not apply to the investment performance or safety of the underlying subaccounts in the particular policy.


CONSIDERATIONS
There are some risks you should consider when purchasing life insurance.  These are:

Insurability Risk
Inadequate Coverage Risk
Premium Risk
Cash Value Accumulation Risk

Most people have a certain risk threshold - a comfort zone.  To manage your zone, it is helpful to understand the risks present in each situation and how they may apply to you.

Insurability Risk
Life insurance premiums are based on age and health.  The younger and healthier you are, the more inexpensive it is.  As you age, life insurance becomes more costly.  Typically you become less healthy over time; in addition, serious illnesses can strike at any time.  This could affect your ability to purchase life insurance in the future, or the premiums you pay.  This is called "insurability risk". 
Permanent insurance has a lower degree of insurability risk because coverage lasts throughout your lifetime without having to reapply, as long as you pay premiums when due and there are no substantial loans or withdrawals (though some variable life policies provide no guaranteed coverage). Buying permanent insurance when you are young and healthy can lock in lower premiums for life.
Some term insurance, with no conversion privilege, has a higher degree of insurability risk because your insurance coverage lasts for only a specified period of time (such as ten years). 

Inadequate Coverage Risk
Unfortunately death is a certainty.  Life insurance provides your beneficiaries with money to help meet their current and future financial obligations.  They may use the funds to pay off debts, cover college costs, continue your business or manage other financial obligations.  Without sufficient money to meet these obligations, your beneficiaries may be left with credit card bills or outstanding loans, or may be forced to alter their lifestyles significantly.
You have taken an important first step by considering the purchase of insurance at this time.  We encourage you to regularly and carefully evaluate whether your insurance portfolio is right for you given your financial status, objectives, obligations, and risk tolerance at any point in time.  It's no secret that as your life changes, your needs change too. 

Premium Risk
The two questions most people ask when considering the purchase of life insurance are: "How will I pay for this now?" and "Will I be able to afford this in the future?"
When considering which type of insurance is right for you, there are two risks associated with premium payments that you should think about: one, premiums may increase in the future; and two, premiums may need to be paid longer than you expected. These risks are called "premium risk".
From the perspective of being able to cover current premium payments, term insurance has a lower degree of premium risk because its initial cost is generally lower than of permanent insurance.  From the perspective of affording premium payments in the future, particularly if you need coverage longer than you initially thought, term insurance has a higher degree of premium risk.  The reason for this is that if you purchase new coverage in the future, as discussed earlier, premium costs become higher the older you become.  Health impairments may also increase the cost of new coverage.  And if you choose to keep your original term product, the premiums may increase sharply after the initial level term period.

Cash Value Accumulation Risk
If you are like most people, you have two distinct needs-one for a death benefit and the other to accumulate funds to meet life's expenses as they arise. A life insurance policy definitely meets the first need.  Although the primary reason to purchase life insurance is for the death benefit protection, some types of life insurance may also provide you the opportunity to accumulate accessible cash value within the policy itself. 
Permanent life insurance is the type of product that can accumulate cash values. These cash values may be accessed via loans and/or withdrawals to help in any number of ways, including paying off your mortgage early, supplementing your retirement income, or taking advantage of potential business opportunities. (Remember that withdrawals and loans will reduce policy cash values and the death benefit and may have tax consequences.)  However, you need to be aware of the costs and expenses that are associated with the policy that you purchase, and how these may impact the growth of your cash value.
Some types of permanent insurance actually allow you to pay more premiums than required to help give a boost to your cash values.  However , there is a limit on just how much you can pay into the policy; if you put in too much money, it becomes more expensive to access the cash values.  Your policy has now become a Modified Endowment Contract (MEC).  Instead of being able to withdraw up to basis (the amount equal to the premiums you have paid) and then borrow the balance of your accumulated cash values, all value you access will be taxable to the extent of income in the policy and there may be an additional 10% federal income tax on distributions prior to age 59½. 
One way that many people use to meet both their need of death benefit protection and their need for additional cash is to buy a lower cost term insurance product and then save or invest the difference between the term insurance cost and the permanent insurance cost.  The earlier you are able to put aside some funds the better as you may receive the positive affects of compound interest growth on your money.  The longer you delay, the greater your risk becomes in not being able to accumulate the funds you need.  This approach requires a commitment to regularly set money aside for savings.  This commitment may be difficult to meet when unexpected expenses arise and may not be for everyone.


MAKING YOUR DECISION
Now that you are a little more knowledgeable, take a look at your personal situation, consider the types of insurance available to you and make the decision that works for you and your family. 
Everyone has their own goals for personal financial security and the important thing is that you progress towards achieving your goals. You may wish to maximize your insurance coverage today or you may wish to purchase a policy you can "personalize" to meet your needs by adding riders that provide you with additional insurance coverage. You may wish to purchase a permanent life insurance policy and supplement it with term insurance for additional coverage during a particular period of time. For example, you may want extra protection during certain years such as coverage to help cover payments on a mortgage, or added protection for your children or spouse.
Look at your options and determine what works for you.  We're here to help.

How Lifely Term can help 
With Lifely Term, Alex can provide $4k a month for 20 years, to help support his family during what would have been his working years.

Consumer Tip: Lifely Term is a term life insurance product issued with limited underwriting and limited medical evidence of insurability. You may be able to purchase other life insurance products (including our other term life products) for substantially less cost if you apply for a life insurance product with full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability. However, if you submit to full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability, you may be required to pay more for a fully underwritten product that if you purchased a Lifely Term policy.

Hi. Welcome to Lifely by Prudential! Thanks for stopping by.You may be wondering what Lifely is — and that's a good question. Lifely by Prudential is a program aimed to make purchasing life insurance easier.  We are trying to think differently about life insurance for today's consumer. To that end, we introduce Lifely Term, a policy offered by Pruco Life Insurance Company, a Prudential Financial company.  
 
When You Take Care of the Ones You Love, You Take Care of the World. 
 
There's an old adage in the insurance world that "Life insurance is sold, not bought." But we think that times are changing, and people today are more informed and more in control of their financial future. You know you need life insurance, right? So, we set out to design a way for you to be able to access, learn about, and purchase life insurance that makes it easy. We know that life insurance can be difficult to understand, can make you feel like you don't know where to start, and sometimes can turn people away (We have to mention "death." That’s uncomfortable.) 
So we're trying to change all of that. 
You are thinking big about your impact on the world and constantly looking for small ways to improve the world we live in. We want to help you understand that, by protecting the ones you love with life insurance, you can free them to go on to do great things for this world after you’re gone. Maybe even make all of humanity a little better. The way we see it, when you take care of the ones you love, you take care of the world. It's just that simple. 
 
Quick. Click. Insure our Humanity. 

Lifely Term is a practical life insurance policy designed with you in mind. The process is easy (online) and easy to understand (Just answer a few simple questions), and a policy is easy to purchase (Get it done today!). 
Right now, Lifely Term is available only in the state of California. (Sorry, remaining 49 states! We hope to be available to you soon!)
Thanks for coming by. We hope you stick around and maybe even help insure our humanity.
Lifely is a brand name of The Prudential Insurance Company of America and its subsidiaries.
Lifely Term (PCT-2016) is issued in California by the Pruco Life Insurance Company, located in Newark, NJ. The Pruco Life Insurance Company and The Prudential Insurance Company of America are Prudential Financial companies and each is solely responsible for its own financial condition and contractual obligations.

Life Insurance




There’s more to life insurance than taking care of loved ones if you pass away. 

Life insurance can also be an essential part of a financial plan. In addition to helping to protect loved ones financially with a death benefit, some products can grow money on a tax-advantaged basis that can be used during one’s lifetime. The ability to meet more than one need makes life insurance a product that adds valuable flexibility to any portfolio.

Talk to your financial professional if you think life insurance might be right for you.















                                Our easy-to-use tool can help guide you to start the conversation around life insurance with your financial professional. 
 

















Types of Life Insurance





Permanent Life Insurance
Provides coverage that lasts a lifetime and can build cash value that can be used while living. 



Term Life Insurance
Provides coverage for a specific length of time and provides the most payout for the money, but does not build cash value.

















Permanent Life Insurance
Permanent life insurance is designed to provide coverage for life. Many permanent life insurance products also have a feature called cash value. This cash value can grow over time through interest credits, market returns, or dividends, providing money that can be used for a variety of needs.  

Permanent life insurance products include: Universal Life, Indexed Universal Life, Whole Life, and Variable Universal Life.







Premier Accumulator Universal Life
Can grow cash value quickly and allows faster access to your money when you need it.
Learn More 
.


















Term Life Insurance
Term life insurance covers you for a fixed number of years, such as 1, 5, 10, 20, or 30 and pays a death benefit if you pass away during the covered time period. Most term insurance policies offer a level premium, death benefit, and the ability to convert to a permanent policy if your needs change. You can also choose coverage for current needs and add optional riders for future needs.







Guaranteed Level Term
Available in coverage amounts of $1 million or more, with premiums guaranteed to stay the same throughout the level premium period.

In addition to protecting your family if anything happens to you, we can also help lessen the financial burden on them if you develop a chronic illness.

Keep reading. Then let’s talk about ways to protect what matters most to you.

Inflation is assumed to be 3% and life insurance proceeds are invested to earn 4.5% after tax. The rates reflect the national average for each service provided based on information provided by the National Labor Board. The earnings on the life insurance proceeds plus spending down the life insurance proceeds will be used to cover these expenses over the expected period. The return is purely hypothetical and is used for illustrative purposes only. Performance results are not indicative of any particular investment. Actual results and investment risks will vary. Life insurance is issued by The Prudential Insurance Company of America, Newark, NJ, and its affiliates, all Prudential Financial companies. Our life insurance policies contain exclusions, limitations, reductions in benefits and terms for keeping them in force. Your licensed financial professional can provide you with costs and complete details.

DISCOVERING HIDDEN VALUE

Life settlements have changed the way we think about life insurance. For consumers, life settlements have unlocked the market value of life insurance, transforming unneeded policies into assets with significant value. For advisors, life settlements open a host of new strategies for strengthening portfolios and building client relationships.
One Transaction. Multiple Applications.
There are a variety of situations which may lead someone to reevaluate their life insurance needs, including:

Long term care funding – a policyowner who needs assistance funding long term care can sell their life insurance and use the proceeds to help offset the cost.
Recouping term premiums – a policyowner who no longer needs their convertible term policy can use a life settlement to eliminate future premiums and recoup a portion of their overall premium outlay.
Restructuring cash flow – a policyowner with limited cash flow can use the proceeds from a life settlement to fund a reduced policy with lower premiums.
A need to eliminate premiums and retain a portion of coverage – a policyowner may find they need to retain a certain level of coverage. Through a life settlement, a policyowner can keep a portion of their coverage while eliminating future premium obligations, in lieu of a cash payment.

We make the process simple. Basic information about the policy and the insured’s health is submitted to Coventry. Upon review, the policyowner will receive an offer from Coventry First either in the form of a cash payment or the amount of death benefit they can retain with no future premium obligations.
To learn more about life settlements call 877.836.8300.



 Submit a Policy
Case Studies A 79 year-old male owned a universal life policy with a face amount of $1.5 million. Originally purchased for estate preservation, the policyowner could no longer afford premium payments on the policy. Rather than allowing the policy to lapse, his advisor suggested a policy valuation. Coventry First provided the policyowner with $196,000 for a policy that otherwise had no cash surrender value, which he used for immediate retirement expenses and supplementary income.The 73 year-old policyowner and his spouse originally purchased a $3 million survivorship universal life policy 14 years prior for estate preservation. A couple of years after his wife passed away, he approached his advisor because he no longer needed the coverage and could not afford premium payments. Rather than allowing the policy to lapse – since it had no cash value – his advisor suggested a policy valuation. Coventry First provided the policyowner with $270,000, which he used for supplementary retirement income.Thirteen years earlier, a businessman purchased three policies with a total face value of $12 million for estate planning purposes. With total annual premium payments projected at over $206,000, he arranged for his business to fund the premiums for two of the policies as part of a split dollar agreement. Now, facing a downturn in his business, along with current total annual premiums of more than $290,000, the policyowner decided he no longer wanted to keep the policies in force. He needed to repay his business just over $1 million for accumulated annual premium payments, while the policies' cash surrender value was $962,400. He contacted his advisor who suggested a policy valuation. Coventry First paid the policyowner $1,271,000 for the three policies, which was more than enough to repay the accumulated annual premiums owed.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
