Purchase InformationBuying and Selling ETFs
ETFs are flexible and easy to trade. Investors buy and sell them like stocks, typically through a brokerage account. Investors can also employ traditional stock trading techniques; including stop orders, limit orders, margin purchases, and short sales using ETFs. They are listed on major US Stock Exchanges.
ETFs are subject to risk similar to those of stocks including those regarding short-selling and margin account maintenance.
Ordinary brokerage commissions apply.

Performance Disclosure
Performance quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate, so you may have a gain or loss when shares are sold. Current performance may be higher or lower than that quoted. Performance of an index is not illustrative of any particular investment.  It is not possible to invest directly in an index.The market price used to calculate the Market Value return is the midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest offer on the exchange on which the shares of the Fund are listed for trading, as of the time that the Fund's NAV is calculated. If you trade your shares at another time, your return may differ.

After Tax Returns
After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal
              marginal income tax rates, and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes.
              Actual after tax returns depend on the investor's tax situation and may differ from
              those shown, and the after-tax returns shown are not relevant to investors who hold
              their fund shres through tad deferred arrangements such as 401(k) plans or individual
              retiredment accounts. After tax returns may not take into account year end tax
              adjustments, which are calculated only at the end of each tax year. The after tax
              returns could differ after year end tax adjustments are accounted for.





MSCI EAFE Factor Mix A-Series Index
            The MSCI EAFE (Europe, Australasia, Far East) Factor Mix A-Series Index captures large- and mid-cap representation across 22 developed market Europe, Australasia, and Far East countries and aims to represent the performance of value, low volatility, and quality factor strategies. The Index is an equal weighted combination of the following three MSCI Factor Indices in a single composite index: the MSCI EAFE Value Weighted Index, the MSCI EAFE Minimum Volatility Index, and the MSCI EAFE Quality Index (each, a "Component Index").



















Important Risk InformationIn general, ETFs can be expected to move up or down in value with the value of the applicable index. Although ETF shares may be bought and sold on the exchange through any brokerage account, ETF shares are not individually redeemable from the Fund. Investors may acquire ETFs and tender them for redemption through the Fund in Creation Unit Aggregations only. Please see the prospectus for more details.
The Fund invests by sampling the Index, holding a range of securities that, in the aggregate, approximates the full Index in terms of key risk factors and other characteristics. This may cause the fund to experience tracking errors relative to performance.
Risk associated with equity investing include stock values which may fluctuate in response to the activities of individual companies and general market and economic conditions.
A "value" style of investing emphasizes undervalued companies with characteristics for improved valuations. This style of investing is subject to the risk that the valuations never improve or that the returns on "value" equity securities are less than returns on other styles of investing or the overall stock market.
Although subject to the risks of common stocks, low volatility stocks are seen as having a lower risk profile than the overall markets. However, a fund that invests in low volatility stocks may not produce investment exposure that has lower variability to changes in such stocks' price levels.
A "quality" style of investing emphasizes companies with high returns, stable earnings, and low financial leverage. This style of investing is subject to the risk that the past performance of these companies does not continue or that the returns on "quality" equity securities are less than returns on other styles of investing or the overall stock market.
Foreign investments involve greater risks than U.S. investments, including political and economic risks and the risk of currency fluctuations, all of which may be magnified in emerging markets.
Derivative investments may involve risks such as potential illiquidity of the markets and additional risk of loss of principal.
Non-diversified funds that focus on a relatively small number of securities tend to be more volatile than diversified funds and the market as a whole.

Current performance may be higher or lower than that quoted. Performance of an index is not illustrative of any particular investment.  It is not possible to invest directly in an index.The market price used to calculate the Market Value return is the midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest offer on the exchange on which the shares of the Fund are listed for trading, as of the time that the Fund's NAV is calculated. If you trade your shares at another time, your return may differ.

After Tax Returns
After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal
              marginal income tax rates, and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes.
              Actual after tax returns depend on the investor's tax situation and may differ from
              those shown, and the after-tax returns shown are not relevant to investors who hold
              their fund shres through tad deferred arrangements such as 401(k) plans or individual
              retiredment accounts. After tax returns may not take into account year end tax
              adjustments, which are calculated only at the end of each tax year. The after tax
              returns could differ after year end tax adjustments are accounted for.





MSCI EAFE Factor Mix A-Series Index
            The MSCI EAFE (Europe, Australasia, Far East) Factor Mix A-Series Index captures large- and mid-cap representation across 22 developed market Europe, Australasia, and Far East countries and aims to represent the performance of value, low volatility, and quality factor strategies. The Index is an equal weighted combination of the following three MSCI Factor Indices in a single composite index: the MSCI EAFE Value Weighted Index, the MSCI EAFE Minimum Volatility Index, and the MSCI EAFE Quality Index (each, a "Component Index").



















Important Risk InformationIn general, ETFs can be expected to move up or down in value with the value of the applicable index. Although ETF shares may be bought and sold on the exchange through any brokerage account, ETF shares are not individually redeemable from the Fund. Investors may acquire ETFs and tender them for redemption through the Fund in Creation Unit Aggregations only. Please see the prospectus for more details.
The Fund invests by sampling the Index, holding a range of securities that, in the aggregate, approximates the full Index in terms of key risk factors and other characteristics. This may cause the fund to experience tracking errors relative to performance.
Risk associated with equity investing include stock values which may fluctuate in response to the activities of individual companies and general market and economic conditions.
A "value" style of investing emphasizes undervalued companies with characteristics for improved valuations. This style of investing is subject to the risk that the valuations never improve or that the returns on "value" equity securities are less than returns on other styles of investing or the overall stock market.
Although subject to the risks of common stocks, low volatility stocks are seen as having a lower risk profile than the overall markets. However, a fund that invests in low volatility stocks may not produce investment exposure that has lower variability to changes in such stocks' price levels.
A "quality" style of investing emphasizes companies with high returns, stable earnings, and low financial leverage. This style of investing is subject to the risk that the past performance of these companies does not continue or that the returns on "quality" equity securities are less than returns on other styles of investing or the overall stock market.
Foreign investments involve greater risks than U.S. investments, including political and economic risks and the risk of currency fluctuations, all of which may be magnified in emerging markets.
Derivative investments may involve risks such as potential illiquidity of the markets and additional risk of loss of principal.
Non-diversified funds that focus on a relatively small number of securities tend to be more volatile than diversified funds and the market as a whole.

Performance Disclosure
Performance quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate, so you may have a gain or loss when shares are sold. Current performance may be higher or lower than that quoted. Performance of an index is not illustrative of any particular investment.  It is not possible to invest directly in an index.The market price used to calculate the Market Value return is the midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest offer on the exchange on which the shares of the Fund are listed for trading, as of the time that the Fund's NAV is calculated. If you trade your shares at another time, your return may differ.

			Fund Quality Breakdown
			
				

Quality BreakdownBloomberg Barclays uses the "middle rating" of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch to determine a security's index classification. If only two of the agencies rate a security, then the most conservative (lowest) rating will be used. If only one rating agency rates a security, that one rating will be used. Where there are no security level ratings, an issuer rating may be used to determine index classification.  Bloomberg Barclays Index breakdowns are grouped into larger categories.  For example, AAA+ and AAA are listed as Aaa; AA1, AA2, and AA3 are listed as Aa, etc.

After Tax Returns
After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal
              marginal income tax rates, and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes.
              Actual after tax returns depend on the investor's tax situation and may differ from
              those shown, and the after-tax returns shown are not relevant to investors who hold
              their fund shres through tad deferred arrangements such as 401(k) plans or individual
              retiredment accounts. After tax returns may not take into account year end tax
              adjustments, which are calculated only at the end of each tax year. The after tax
              returns could differ after year end tax adjustments are accounted for.





Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index
            The Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index provides a measure of the performance of the U.S. dollar denominated investment grade bond market, which includes investment grade (must be Baa3/BBB- or higher using the middle rating of Moody's Investor Service, Inc., Standard \& Poor's, and Fitch Inc.) government bonds, investment grade corporate bonds, mortgage pass through securities, commercial mortgage backed securities and asset backed securities that are publicly for sale in the United States. The securities in the U.S. Aggregate Index must have at least 1 year remaining to maturity and must have $250 million or more of outstanding face value. Asset backed securities must have a minimum deal size of $500 million and a minimum tranche size of $25 million. For commercial mortgage backed securities, the original aggregate transaction must have a minimum deal size of $500 million, and a minimum tranche size of $25 million; the aggregate outstanding transaction sizes must be at least $300 million to remain in the index. In addition, the securities must be U.S. dollar denominated, fixed rate, non convertible, and taxable. Certain types of securities, such as flower bonds, TINs, and state and local government series bonds are excluded from the U.S. Aggregate Index. Also excluded from the U.S. Aggregate Index are structured notes with embedded swaps or other special features, private placements, floating rate securities and Eurobonds. The U.S. Aggregate Index is market capitalization weighted and the securities in the Index are updated on the last business day of each month.



















Important Risk InformationETFs trade like stocks, are subject to investment risk, fluctuate in market value and may trade at prices above or below the ETFs net asset value.  Brokerage commissions and ETF expenses will reduce returns.
Frequent trading of ETFs could significantly increase commissions and other costs such that they may offset any savings from low fees or costs.
The values of debt securities may decrease as a result of many factors, including, by way of example, general market fluctuations; increases in interest rates; actual or perceived inability or unwillingness of issuers, guarantors or liquidity providers to make scheduled principal or interest payments; illiquidity in debt securities markets; and prepayments of principal, which often must be reinvested in obligations paying interest at lower rates.
Investing in high yield fixed income securities, otherwise known as "junk bonds", is considered speculative and involves greater risk of loss of principal and interest than investing in investment grade fixed income securities. These Lower-quality debt securities involve greater risk of default or price changes due to potential changes in the credit quality of the issuer.
Increase in real interest rates can cause the price of inflation-protected debt securities to decrease.  Interest payments on inflation-protected debt securities can be unpredictable.
Investments in asset backed and mortgage backed securities are subject to prepayment risk which can limit the potential for gain during a declining interest rate environment and increases the potential for loss in a rising interest rate environment.
Government bonds and corporate bonds generally have more moderate short-term price fluctuations than stocks, but provide lower potential long-term returns.
Foreign investments involve greater risks than U.S. investments, including political and economic risks and the risk of currency fluctuations, all of which may be magnified in emerging markets.
Actively managed funds do not seek to replicate the performance of a specified index. An actively managed fund may underperform its benchmark. An investment in the fund is not appropriate for all investors and is not intended to be a complete investment program. Investing in the fund involves risks, including the risk that investors may receive little or no return on the investment or that investors may lose part or even all of the investment.
Non-diversified funds that focus on a relatively small number of issuers tend to be more volatile than diversified funds and the market as a whole.

Performance Disclosure
Performance quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate, so you may have a gain or loss when shares are sold. Current performance may be higher or lower than that quoted. Performance of an index is not illustrative of any particular investment.  It is not possible to invest directly in an index.The market price used to calculate the Market Value return is the midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest offer on the exchange on which the shares of the Fund are listed for trading, as of the time that the Fund's NAV is calculated. If you trade your shares at another time, your return may differ.

			Fund Quality Breakdown
			
				

Quality BreakdownBloomberg Barclays uses the "middle rating" of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch to determine a security's index classification. If only two of the agencies rate a security, then the most conservative (lowest) rating will be used. If only one rating agency rates a security, that one rating will be used. Where there are no security level ratings, an issuer rating may be used to determine index classification.  Bloomberg Barclays Index breakdowns are grouped into larger categories.  For example, AAA+ and AAA are listed as Aaa; AA1, AA2, and AA3 are listed as Aa, etc.

After Tax Returns
After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal
              marginal income tax rates, and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes.
              Actual after tax returns depend on the investor's tax situation and may differ from
              those shown, and the after-tax returns shown are not relevant to investors who hold
              their fund shres through tad deferred arrangements such as 401(k) plans or individual
              retiredment accounts. After tax returns may not take into account year end tax
              adjustments, which are calculated only at the end of each tax year. The after tax
              returns could differ after year end tax adjustments are accounted for.

For commercial mortgage backed securities, the original aggregate transaction must have a minimum deal size of $500 million, and a minimum tranche size of $25 million; the aggregate outstanding transaction sizes must be at least $300 million to remain in the index. In addition, the securities must be U.S. dollar denominated, fixed rate, non convertible, and taxable. Certain types of securities, such as flower bonds, TINs, and state and local government series bonds are excluded from the U.S. Aggregate Index. Also excluded from the U.S. Aggregate Index are structured notes with embedded swaps or other special features, private placements, floating rate securities and Eurobonds. The U.S. Aggregate Index is market capitalization weighted and the securities in the Index are updated on the last business day of each month.



















Important Risk InformationETFs trade like stocks, are subject to investment risk, fluctuate in market value and may trade at prices above or below the ETFs net asset value.  Brokerage commissions and ETF expenses will reduce returns.
Frequent trading of ETFs could significantly increase commissions and other costs such that they may offset any savings from low fees or costs.
The values of debt securities may decrease as a result of many factors, including, by way of example, general market fluctuations; increases in interest rates; actual or perceived inability or unwillingness of issuers, guarantors or liquidity providers to make scheduled principal or interest payments; illiquidity in debt securities markets; and prepayments of principal, which often must be reinvested in obligations paying interest at lower rates.
Investing in high yield fixed income securities, otherwise known as "junk bonds", is considered speculative and involves greater risk of loss of principal and interest than investing in investment grade fixed income securities. These Lower-quality debt securities involve greater risk of default or price changes due to potential changes in the credit quality of the issuer.
Increase in real interest rates can cause the price of inflation-protected debt securities to decrease.  Interest payments on inflation-protected debt securities can be unpredictable.
Investments in asset backed and mortgage backed securities are subject to prepayment risk which can limit the potential for gain during a declining interest rate environment and increases the potential for loss in a rising interest rate environment.
Government bonds and corporate bonds generally have more moderate short-term price fluctuations than stocks, but provide lower potential long-term returns.
Foreign investments involve greater risks than U.S. investments, including political and economic risks and the risk of currency fluctuations, all of which may be magnified in emerging markets.
Actively managed funds do not seek to replicate the performance of a specified index. An actively managed fund may underperform its benchmark. An investment in the fund is not appropriate for all investors and is not intended to be a complete investment program. Investing in the fund involves risks, including the risk that investors may receive little or no return on the investment or that investors may lose part or even all of the investment.
Non-diversified funds that focus on a relatively small number of issuers tend to be more volatile than diversified funds and the market as a whole.

Key Features
The SPDR Blackstone / GSO Senior Loan ETF (the "Fund") seeks to provide current income consistent with the preservation of capital.  The Fund invests substantially all of its assets in the Blackstone / GSO Senior Loan Portfolio, a separate series of the SSGA Master Trust with an identical investment objective as the Fund.  As a result, the Fund invests indirectly through the Portfolio. In pursuing its investment objective, the Portfolio seeks to outperform the Markit iBoxx USD Liquid Leveraged Loan Index (the "Primary Index") and the S&P/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan 100 Index (the "Secondary Index") by normally investing at least 80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in Senior Loans. For purposes of this 80% test, "Senior Loans" are first lien senior secured floating rate bank loans.Access the investment management experience of GSO / BlackstoneSeeks to provide access to active management in the highly inefficient loan marketA Senior Loan is senior to all unsecured claims against the borrower and senior or equal to all other secured claims, meaning that, in the event of a bankruptcy, the Senior Loan, together with other first lien claims, is entitled to be the first to be repaid out of proceeds of the assets securing the loans, before other existing claims or interests receive repayment

Current performance may be higher or lower than that quoted. Performance of an index is not illustrative of any particular investment.  It is not possible to invest directly in an index.The market price used to calculate the Market Value return is the midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest offer on the exchange on which the shares of the Fund are listed for trading, as of the time that the Fund's NAV is calculated. If you trade your shares at another time, your return may differ.

			S&P Fund Quality Breakdown
			
				

S&P Fund Quality BreakdownStandard & Poor's credit ratings express the agency's opinion about the ability and willingness of an issuer, such as a corporation or state or city government, to meet its financial obligations in full and on time.  Credit ratings can also speak to the credit quality of an individual debt issue, such as a corporate note, a municipal bond or a mortgage-backed security, and the relative likelihood that the issue may default. Standard & Poor's ratings from A to CCC may be modified by a plus (+) or minus (-) sign to show relative standing within the rating categories.

			Moody's Fund Quality Breakdown
			
				

Moody's Fund Quality BreakdownMoody's long-term obligation ratings are opinions of the relative credit risk of fixed-income obligations with an original maturity of one year or more. They address the possibility that a financial obligation will not be honored as promised. Gradations of creditworthiness are indicated by rating symbols, with each symbol representing a group in which the credit characteristics are broadly the same. There are nine symbols, from which are used to designate least credit risk to that denoting greatest credit risk. Moody's appends numerical modifiers 1, 2, and 3 to each generic rating classification from Aa through Caa.

Investors may acquire ETFs and tender them for redemption through the Fund in Creation Unit Aggregations only. Please see the prospectus for more details.All information herein is provided as of the date(s) listed above.  Calculations are performed on a trade date basis and are intended to include both settled and unsettled positions.  The only exception to this is the calculation of Weighted Average Days to Reset which is performed on a settlement date basis and is intended to include information for settled positions only.After-tax returns are calculated based on NAV using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on the investor's tax situation and may differ from those shown. The after-tax returns shown are not relevant to investors who hold their fund shares through tax-deferred arrangements such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts.Performance of an index is not illustrative of any particular investment.

After Tax Returns
After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal
              marginal income tax rates, and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes.
              Actual after tax returns depend on the investor's tax situation and may differ from
              those shown, and the after-tax returns shown are not relevant to investors who hold
              their fund shres through tad deferred arrangements such as 401(k) plans or individual
              retiredment accounts. After tax returns may not take into account year end tax
              adjustments, which are calculated only at the end of each tax year. The after tax
              returns could differ after year end tax adjustments are accounted for.

It mirrors the market-weighted performance of the largest institutional leveraged loans based upon market weightings, spreads, and interest payments. The index consists of 100 loan facilities drawn from a larger benchmark, the S&P/LSTA (Loan Syndications and Trading Association) Leveraged Loan Index (LLI).












Important Risk InformationIn general, ETFs can be expected to move up or down in value with the value of the applicable index. Although ETF shares may be bought and sold on the exchange through any brokerage account, ETF shares are not individually redeemable from the Fund. Investors may acquire ETFs and tender them for redemption through the Fund in Creation Unit Aggregations only. Please see the prospectus for more details.
ETFs trade like stocks, are subject to investment risk, fluctuate in market value and may trade at prices above or below the ETF's net asset value. Brokerage commissions and ETF expenses will reduce returns.
Investments in Senior Loans are subject to credit risk and general investment risk. Credit risk refers to the possibility that the borrower of a Senior Loan will be unable and/or unwilling to make timely interest payments and/or repay the principal on its obligation. Default in the payment of interest or principal on a Senior Loan will result in a reduction in the value of the Senior Loan and consequently a reduction in the value of the Portfolio's investments and a potential decrease in the net asset value ("NAV") of the Portfolio.
Investing in high yield securities, otherwise known as "junk bonds", is considered speculative and involves greater risk of loss of principal and interest than investing in investment grade fixed income securities. These lower-quality debt securities involve greater risk of default or price changes due to potential changes in the credit quality of the issuer.
Actively managed ETFs do not seek to replicate the performance of a specified index.
These investments may have difficulty in liquidating an investment position without taking a significant discount from current market value, which can be a significant problem with certain lightly traded securities.
The Fund is actively managed and may underperform its benchmarks. An investment in the fund is not appropriate for all investors and is not intended to be a complete investment program. Investing in the fund involves risks, including the risk that investors may receive little or no return on the investment or that investors may lose part or even all of the investment.
Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. To obtain a prospectus or summary prospectus which contains this and other information, call 1-866-787-2257, visit www.spdrs.com. Read it carefully.

Key Features
The SPDR Blackstone / GSO Senior Loan ETF (the "Fund") seeks to provide current income consistent with the preservation of capital.  The Fund invests substantially all of its assets in the Blackstone / GSO Senior Loan Portfolio, a separate series of the SSGA Master Trust with an identical investment objective as the Fund.  As a result, the Fund invests indirectly through the Portfolio. In pursuing its investment objective, the Portfolio seeks to outperform the Markit iBoxx USD Liquid Leveraged Loan Index (the "Primary Index") and the S&P/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan 100 Index (the "Secondary Index") by normally investing at least 80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in Senior Loans. For purposes of this 80% test, "Senior Loans" are first lien senior secured floating rate bank loans.Access the investment management experience of GSO / BlackstoneSeeks to provide access to active management in the highly inefficient loan marketA Senior Loan is senior to all unsecured claims against the borrower and senior or equal to all other secured claims, meaning that, in the event of a bankruptcy, the Senior Loan, together with other first lien claims, is entitled to be the first to be repaid out of proceeds of the assets securing the loans, before other existing claims or interests receive repayment

Performance Disclosure
Performance quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate, so you may have a gain or loss when shares are sold. Current performance may be higher or lower than that quoted. Performance of an index is not illustrative of any particular investment.  It is not possible to invest directly in an index.The market price used to calculate the Market Value return is the midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest offer on the exchange on which the shares of the Fund are listed for trading, as of the time that the Fund's NAV is calculated. If you trade your shares at another time, your return may differ.

			S&P Fund Quality Breakdown
			
				

S&P Fund Quality BreakdownStandard & Poor's credit ratings express the agency's opinion about the ability and willingness of an issuer, such as a corporation or state or city government, to meet its financial obligations in full and on time.  Credit ratings can also speak to the credit quality of an individual debt issue, such as a corporate note, a municipal bond or a mortgage-backed security, and the relative likelihood that the issue may default. Standard & Poor's ratings from A to CCC may be modified by a plus (+) or minus (-) sign to show relative standing within the rating categories.

			Moody's Fund Quality Breakdown
			
				

Moody's Fund Quality BreakdownMoody's long-term obligation ratings are opinions of the relative credit risk of fixed-income obligations with an original maturity of one year or more. They address the possibility that a financial obligation will not be honored as promised. Gradations of creditworthiness are indicated by rating symbols, with each symbol representing a group in which the credit characteristics are broadly the same. There are nine symbols, from which are used to designate least credit risk to that denoting greatest credit risk. Moody's appends numerical modifiers 1, 2, and 3 to each generic rating classification from Aa through Caa.

In general, ETFs can be expected to move up or down in value with the value of the applicable index. Although ETF shares may be bought and sold on the exchange through any brokerage account, ETF shares are not individually redeemable from the Fund. Investors may acquire ETFs and tender them for redemption through the Fund in Creation Unit Aggregations only. Please see the prospectus for more details.All information herein is provided as of the date(s) listed above.  Calculations are performed on a trade date basis and are intended to include both settled and unsettled positions.  The only exception to this is the calculation of Weighted Average Days to Reset which is performed on a settlement date basis and is intended to include information for settled positions only.After-tax returns are calculated based on NAV using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on the investor's tax situation and may differ from those shown. The after-tax returns shown are not relevant to investors who hold their fund shares through tax-deferred arrangements such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts.Performance of an index is not illustrative of any particular investment. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.As with all stocks, you may be required to deposit more money or securities into your margin account if the equity, including the amount attributable to your ETF shares, declines.Unless otherwise noted all information contained is that of the SPDR GSO / Blackstone Senior Loan ETF.





No Team Members exists.





After Tax Returns
After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal
              marginal income tax rates, and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes.
              Actual after tax returns depend on the investor's tax situation and may differ from
              those shown, and the after-tax returns shown are not relevant to investors who hold
              their fund shres through tad deferred arrangements such as 401(k) plans or individual
              retiredment accounts. After tax returns may not take into account year end tax
              adjustments, which are calculated only at the end of each tax year. The after tax
              returns could differ after year end tax adjustments are accounted for.





Markit iBoxx USD Liquid Leveraged Loan Index
            The Markit iBoxx USD Liquid Leveraged Loan Index is comprised of about 100 of the most liquid, tradable leveraged loans, as identified by Markit's Loans Liquidity service. Markit is a premier provider of independent, transparent, and objective indices for trading, product structuring, and benchmarking to bring transparency and liquidity to the financial markets.





S&P/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan 100 Index
            The S&P/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan 100 Index is designed to reflect the largest facilities in the leveraged loan market. It mirrors the market-weighted performance of the largest institutional leveraged loans based upon market weightings, spreads, and interest payments. The index consists of 100 loan facilities drawn from a larger benchmark, the S&P/LSTA (Loan Syndications and Trading Association) Leveraged Loan Index (LLI).












Important Risk InformationIn general, ETFs can be expected to move up or down in value with the value of the applicable index. Although ETF shares may be bought and sold on the exchange through any brokerage account, ETF shares are not individually redeemable from the Fund. Investors may acquire ETFs and tender them for redemption through the Fund in Creation Unit Aggregations only. Please see the prospectus for more details.
ETFs trade like stocks, are subject to investment risk, fluctuate in market value and may trade at prices above or below the ETF's net asset value. Brokerage commissions and ETF expenses will reduce returns.
Investments in Senior Loans are subject to credit risk and general investment risk. Credit risk refers to the possibility that the borrower of a Senior Loan will be unable and/or unwilling to make timely interest payments and/or repay the principal on its obligation. Default in the payment of interest or principal on a Senior Loan will result in a reduction in the value of the Senior Loan and consequently a reduction in the value of the Portfolio's investments and a potential decrease in the net asset value ("NAV") of the Portfolio.
Investing in high yield securities, otherwise known as "junk bonds", is considered speculative and involves greater risk of loss of principal and interest than investing in investment grade fixed income securities. These lower-quality debt securities involve greater risk of default or price changes due to potential changes in the credit quality of the issuer.
Actively managed ETFs do not seek to replicate the performance of a specified index.
These investments may have difficulty in liquidating an investment position without taking a significant discount from current market value, which can be a significant problem with certain lightly traded securities.
The Fund is actively managed and may underperform its benchmarks. An investment in the fund is not appropriate for all investors and is not intended to be a complete investment program. Investing in the fund involves risks, including the risk that investors may receive little or no return on the investment or that investors may lose part or even all of the investment.
Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. To obtain a prospectus or summary prospectus which contains this and other information, call 1-866-787-2257, visit www.spdrs.com. Read it carefully.

The Consumer Services Select Sector SPDR Fund changed its name to the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund. The Cyclical/Transportation Select Sector SPDR Fund changed its name to the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund.
Select Sector SPDR shareholders are subject to risks similar to those of holders of other sector stock portfolios. One primary consideration is that the general level of stock prices may decline, and thus the value of Select Sector SPDRs may decline. A Select Sector SPDR also may be adversely affected by the performance of the specific sector or group of industries upon which it is based. You can expect that shares in a Select Sector SPDR will move up or down in value with the value of its related Select Sector Index. In addition, the overall depth and liquidity of the secondary market in these shares may fluctuate.
Although Select Sector SPDRs are designed to provide investment results that, before expenses, generally correspond to the price and yield performance of their related Select Sector Indexes, the Funds of The Select Sector SPDR Trust may not be able to exactly replicate the performance of the Select Sector Indexes because of expenses and other factors.
Over time, the stock holdings of each Select Sector SPDR may be rebalanced to reflect changes in the composition of its related index. A Select Sector SPDR would incur transaction costs and other expenses as a result of rebalancing. Furthermore, a Select Sector SPDR would realize capital gains or losses from the sale of securities in a rebalancing.
Net long-term capital gains, if any, will be distributed to shareholders as capital gains distributions at least annually.
From a tax standpoint, you should be aware that the Select Sector SPDR Trust is structured as a regulated investment company, and that dividend distributions may not be characterized entirely as ordinary income. You may wish to consult your tax advisor in this regard.
