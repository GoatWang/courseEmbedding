We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the common stock offered
through this prospectus by the selling shareholders. We have agreed to bear the
expenses (other than any underwriting discounts or commissions or broker’s
commissions) in connection with the registration of the common stock being
offered hereby by the selling shareholders.


The markets for natural biotechnology products are and will continue to be
highly competitive. The Company will face significant competition from other
companies who are developing, commercializing and marketing competitive
products, as well as those who may elect to do so in the future. Some of these
competitors or potential competitors have greater experience, more extensive
industry contacts and greater financial resources than the Company. There can be
no assurance that the Company can effectively compete.


Company Description
Health-Right is a natural biotech company that combines science and nutrition to
develop branded ingredients, formulations and products that seek to provide a
better quality of life for consumers who primarily suffer from stress-induced
viruses and diseases. These formulations and products are


 developed naturally,
by utilizing and scientifically combining various ingredients to help positively
influence the interrelationship between stress and the immune system. In
addition, the Company is planning to expand the application of its formulation
platform to include cannabidiol (“CBD”) derived from industrial hemp. CBD, which
is a cannabis-derived compound that may offer some of the benefits of medical
marijuana without the side effects (i.e. the feeling of being “high” that comes
from other cannabis compounds such as THC). Unlike CBD derived from medical
marijuana, CBD derived from industrial hemp is a legal dietary supplement and
approved for use in all fifty states.

The Company believes the formulation platform it has developed in order to help
address the negative nutritional interrelationship between stress, a weakened
immune system and certain conditions and diseases is now in place. At the end of
2014, Health-Right completed initial test-marketing of Advanced H-Plex Defense
Formula 11, its first product (“H-Plex Defense”), an all-natural dietary
supplement whose formulation seeks to address less than optimal nutrition and
nutritional deficiencies to aid persons afflicted with Herpes Simplex Virus
(“HSV”). Based on the market results of that trial, HRD now believes it has
created an alternative approach to help counteract and improve the
causes/triggers of HSV, a virus that affects over an estimated 100 million
people in the U.S. alone with symptoms including tingling, itching, blisters,
sores and rashes with an estimated $5 billion marketplace for treatments by
2017, according to Global Industry Analysts, Inc.

We believe that Health-Right is uniquely positioned because its approach of not
just responding to stress induced conditions and diseases, but proactively
addressing stress-induced problems before they wreak havoc on multiple body
systems. The Company’s research, formulation and nutritional theories offer wide
ranging potential because we believe that our formulation platform has the
potential to be successfully applied In the prescription nutritional/medical
foods, OTC monographed drug and all-natural dietary supplement/nutraceutical
arenas. HRD anticipates that it will be able to leverage the results of clinical
trials in order to market ingredients, branded ingredients, private label
ingredients and finished products. We also believe that we will be positioned to
license our formulations to strategic partners in order to expedite and achieve
product commercialization and cross-promotion.

The Company is currently focused in areas where we believe that it can conduct
clinical trials and commercialize and market products on an expedited basis. As
a result of our initial success with the trial marketing of H-Plex Defense, we
are in the process of moving forward with clinical trials to further
substantiate our trial results.

In addition to HSV, there are other potential applications for our formulations
that we have in the pipeline, including all-natural products designed to relieve
symptoms associated with:

. compromised immune systems and related muscle and joint pain;

. the common cold and flu viruses; and

. constipation resulting from prescription medications.

The Company believes that by adapting its formulation platform to applications
such as these, it will be able to generate revenues in the short term in the
following markets:

. the Over-the-Counter (“OTC”) monographed drug industry;

. the prescription nutritional marketplace; and

. the natural products space.

The Company intends to use its contacts in the healthcare, medical foods and
natural products industries to market and sell its proposed products either
directly or through strategic partners and licensees.

To date, the Company has generated limited revenues and has operated with
limited capital. The Company will require significant capital to implement its
business plan. There can be no assurance that the Company can raise the
necessary funds, on favorable terms or otherwise. Failure to obtain sufficient
capital will substantially harm the Company’s prospects.

the name “Four Plex Partners, Inc.” and changed its name to “Health-Right
Discoveries, Inc.” on March 22, 2012.

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the common stock offered
through this prospectus by the selling shareholders. We have agreed to bear the
expenses (other than any underwriting discounts or commissions or broker’s
commissions) in connection with the registration of the common stock being
offered hereby by the selling shareholders.


The markets for natural biotechnology products are and will continue to be
highly competitive. The Company will face significant competition from other
companies who are developing, commercializing and marketing competitive
products, as well as those who may elect to do so in the future. Some of these
competitors or potential competitors have greater experience, more extensive
industry contacts and greater financial resources than the Company. There can be
no assurance that the Company can effectively compete.


Company Description
Health-Right is a natural biotech company that combines science and nutrition to
develop branded ingredients, formulations and products that seek to provide a
better quality of life for consumers who primarily suffer from stress-induced
viruses and diseases. These formulations and products are


 developed naturally,
by utilizing and scientifically combining various ingredients to help positively
influence the interrelationship between stress and the immune system. In
addition, the Company is planning to expand the application of its formulation
platform to include cannabidiol (“CBD”) derived from industrial hemp. CBD, which
is a cannabis-derived compound that may offer some of the benefits of medical
marijuana without the side effects (i.e. the feeling of being “high” that comes
from other cannabis compounds such as THC). Unlike CBD derived from medical
marijuana, CBD derived from industrial hemp is a legal dietary supplement and
approved for use in all fifty states.

The Company believes the formulation platform it has developed in order to help
address the negative nutritional interrelationship between stress, a weakened
immune system and certain conditions and diseases is now in place. At the end of
2014, Health-Right completed initial test-marketing of Advanced H-Plex Defense
Formula 11, its first product (“H-Plex Defense”), an all-natural dietary
supplement whose formulation seeks to address less than optimal nutrition and
nutritional deficiencies to aid persons afflicted with Herpes Simplex Virus
(“HSV”). Based on the market results of that trial, HRD now believes it has
created an alternative approach to help counteract and improve the
causes/triggers of HSV, a virus that affects over an estimated 100 million
people in the U.S. alone with symptoms including tingling, itching, blisters,
sores and rashes with an estimated $5 billion marketplace for treatments by
2017, according to Global Industry Analysts, Inc.

We believe that Health-Right is uniquely positioned because its approach of not
just responding to stress induced conditions and diseases, but proactively
addressing stress-induced problems before they wreak havoc on multiple body
systems. The Company’s research, formulation and nutritional theories offer wide
ranging potential because we believe that our formulation platform has the
potential to be successfully applied In the prescription nutritional/medical
foods, OTC monographed drug and all-natural dietary supplement/nutraceutical
arenas. HRD anticipates that it will be able to leverage the results of clinical
trials in order to market ingredients, branded ingredients, private label
ingredients and finished products. We also believe that we will be positioned to
license our formulations to strategic partners in order to expedite and achieve
product commercialization and cross-promotion.

The Company is currently focused in areas where we believe that it can conduct
clinical trials and commercialize and market products on an expedited basis. As
a result of our initial success with the trial marketing of H-Plex Defense, we
are in the process of moving forward with clinical trials to further
substantiate our trial results.

In addition to HSV, there are other potential applications for our formulations
that we have in the pipeline, including all-natural products designed to relieve
symptoms associated with:

. compromised immune systems and related muscle and joint pain;

. the common cold and flu viruses; and

. constipation resulting from prescription medications.

The Company believes that by adapting its formulation platform to applications
such as these, it will be able to generate revenues in the short term in the
following markets:

. the Over-the-Counter (“OTC”) monographed drug industry;

. the prescription nutritional marketplace; and

. the natural products space.

The Company intends to use its contacts in the healthcare, medical foods and
natural products industries to market and sell its proposed products either
directly or through strategic partners and licensees.

To date, the Company has generated limited revenues and has operated with
limited capital. The Company will require significant capital to implement its
business plan. There can be no assurance that the Company can raise the
necessary funds, on favorable terms or otherwise. Failure to obtain sufficient
capital will substantially harm the Company’s prospects.

The Company was incorporated in the state of Florida on October 11, 2011 under
the name “Four Plex Partners, Inc.” and changed its name to “Health-Right
Discoveries, Inc.” on March 22, 2012.

DISCOVERIES, INC. 

Notes to
Financial Statements

September
30, 2016

(Unaudited)

 

NOTE 1
– Business and Basis of Presentation

 

Health-Right
Discoveries, Inc. (the “ Company ”) was formed
under the laws of the State of Florida on October 12, 2011 under
the name Four Plex Partners, Inc. The company changed its name to
Health-Right Discoveries, Inc. on March 22, 2012. The
Company’s business is to develop and market an innovative
portfolio of both prescription nutritional, OTC monograph and
natural products that primarily focus on factors relating to
stress-induced conditions and diseases.

 

The
accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America for interim financial statements and with
the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X of
the United States Securities and Exchange Commission
(“SEC”). Accordingly, they do not contain all
information and footnotes required by accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America for annual
financial statements. In the opinion of the Company’s
management, the accompanying unaudited financial statements contain
all the adjustments necessary (consisting only of normal recurring
accruals) to present the financial position of the Company as
September 30, 2016 and the results of operations and cash flows for
the periods presented. The results of operations for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative
of the operating results for the full fiscal year or any future
period. These unaudited consolidated financial statements should be
read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes
thereto included in the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2015 filed with the SEC on April 13, 2016.

 

NOTE 2 -
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

 

Use of
Estimates

 

The
preparation of the financial statements in conformity with
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”)
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. Certain of the Company’s estimates could be
affected by external conditions, including those unique to its
industry, and general economic conditions. It is possible that
these external factors could have an effect on the Company’s
estimates that could cause actual results to differ from its
estimates. The Company re-evaluates all of its accounting estimates
at least quarterly based on these conditions and record adjustments
when necessary.

 

 

 




 



6



 




  

 

Cash

 

The
Company considers all short-term highly liquid investments with an
original maturity at the date of purchase of three months or less
to be cash equivalents.

 

Revenue
Recognition

 

The
Company follows the guidance of the Accounting Standards
Codification (“ASC”) Topic 605, “Revenue
Recognition”. We record revenue when persuasive evidence of
an arrangement exists, product delivery has occurred, the selling
price to the customer is fixed or determinable and collectability
of the revenue is reasonably assured. The Company has not
experienced any significant returns from customers and accordingly,
in management’s opinion, no reserve for returns has been
provided.

 

Inventories

 

Inventories,
which consist of the Company’s product held for resale, are
stated at the lower of cost, determined using the first-in,
first-out, and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the
estimated selling price, in the ordinary course of business, less
estimated costs to complete and dispose of the product.

 

If the
Company identifies excess, obsolete or unsalable items, its
inventories are written down to their realizable value in the
period in which the impairment is first
identified.  Shipping and handling costs incurred for
inventory purchases and product shipments are recorded in cost of
sales in the Company's statements of operations.

 

Fair
Value Measurements

 

The
Company adopted the provisions of ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value
Measurements and Disclosures”, which defines fair value as
used in numerous accounting pronouncements, establishes a framework
for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value
measurements.

 

The
estimated fair value of certain financial instruments, including
cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable
and accrued expenses are carried at historical cost basis, which
approximates their fair values because of the short-term nature of
these instruments. The carrying amounts of our short and long term
credit obligations approximate fair value because the effective
yields on these obligations, which include contractual interest
rates are comparable to rates of returns for instruments of similar
credit risk.

 

ASC 820
defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for
an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the
principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in
an orderly transaction between market participants on the
measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy,
which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs
and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair
value. ASC 820 describes three levels of inputs that may be used to
measure fair value:

 

Level 1
— quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities

Level 2
— quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active
markets or inputs that are observable

Level 3
— inputs that are unobservable (for example cash flow
modeling inputs based on assumptions)

The
Company does not have any assets or liabilities measured at fair
value on a recurring basis.

 

Stock-based
compensation

 

The
Company recognizes compensation expense for stock-based
compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718. For employee
stock-based awards, the fair value of the award is calculated on
the date of grant using the Black-Scholes method for stock options
and the quoted price of our common stock for common shares; the
expense is recognized over the service period for awards expected
to vest. For non-employee stock-based awards, the fair value of the
award on the date of grant is calculated in the same manner as
employee awards. However, the awards are revalued at the end of
each reporting period and the pro rata compensation expense is
adjusted accordingly until such time the nonemployee award is fully
vested, at which time the total compensation recognized to date
equals the fair value of the stock-based award as calculated on the
measurement date, which is the date at which the award
recipient’s performance is complete. The estimation of
stock-based awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and
to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from
original estimates, such amounts are recorded as a cumulative
adjustment in the period estimates are revised.

 

Advertising

 

Advertising
and marketing expenses are charged to operations as
incurred.

 

Income
Taxes

 

The
company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for
income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, “Income
Taxes.” Under this method, income tax expense is recognized
for the amount of: (i) taxes payable or refundable for the current
year and (ii) deferred tax consequences of temporary differences
resulting from matters that have been recognized in an
entity’s financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The
effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax
rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that
includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided to
reduce the deferred tax assets reported if based on the weight of
the available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely
than not some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
realized.

  

ASC Topic
740.10.30 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes
recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements and
prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for
the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax
position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. ASC Topic
740.10.40 provides guidance on de-recognition, classification,
interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure,
and transition. The Company has no material uncertain tax positions
for any of the reporting periods presented.

 

NOTE 3
– Going Concern

 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going
concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the
satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The
Company has generated minimal revenues since inception. The Company
has sustained losses since inception, and has a stockholders’
deficiency of $358,746 at September 30, 2016. These factors among
others raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to
continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of
time.  

 

 

 




 



8



 




  

 

The
continuing operations of the Company are dependent upon its ability
to continue to raise adequate financing and to commence profitable
operations in the future and repay its liabilities arising from
normal business operations as they become due. The accompanying
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

 

NOTE 4
– Stockholders’ Equity

 

The
Company has authorized 100,000,000 shares of common stock $.001 par
value and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock $.001 par
value.

 

During the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 the Company issued 400,000
shares of common stock for services rendered which were valued at
$40,000. The Company valued these shares based on the per share
price in which unaffiliated investors purchased shares of common
stock in a private placement.

 

During the
period ended September 30, 2015, the Company issued 10,000 shares
of common stock for services rendered which were valued at $1,000.
The Company valued these shares based on the per share price in
which unaffiliated investors purchased shares of common stock in a
private placement.

 

NOTE 5
– Related Party

 

The
Company has a secured promissory note with a founder and director
(“director”) of the Company. During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 there were no advances on this note. These
borrowing bear interest at 3% per annum with no maturity date. As
of September 30, 2016 the principle balance due on this note was
$45,000.

 

Effective
July 30, 2015 the Company entered into a secured future advance
promissory note with the director referred to above for a total
amount of $75,000. During the nine months ended September, 2016 the
Company borrowed $25,000 in regards to this note. The note bears
interest at 7.5% per annum and matures on July 31, 2016. As of
September 30, 2016 the principal balance due on this note was
$106,845.

 

On April
13, 2016 a director of the Company provided a short term loan of
$2,500 with an interest rate of 3% and is payable on
demand.

 

On July
22, 2016 the President of the Company provided a short term loan of
$2,000 with an interest rate of 3% and is payable on
demand.

 

The
Company’s President has made loans the Company through direct
charges on his credit card to pay for working capital purposes. The
balance of this loan at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015
was $0 and $1,009 respectively.

 

The
Company’s board of directors approved a salary to the
Company’s president in the amount of $52,000 per annum plus a
car allowance of $600 per month. As of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015 the amount unpaid and accrued amount is $156,000
and $130,000 respectively. Effective in August 2013, the president
waived his car allowance which amount has not been accrued since
that date. The president resumed his car allowance in July of 2015.
Effective January 1, 2016, the president has begun being paid a
salary of $1,000 per week. Due to lack of funding for the period
ended September 30, 2016 the president has continued to accrue
salary. The Company has also accrued his car allowance for the
perio
