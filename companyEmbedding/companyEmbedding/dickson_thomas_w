W.K.L 
                    (William Kennedy Laurie) Dickson was born in 1860 in Minihic-sur-Ranse, 
                    France to an English father and a mother from Scottish descent. 
                  
In February 1879 the Dickson family, William, 
                    his widowed mother and two sisters left France and moved to 
                    England. Once settled in England the nineteen year old Dickson 
                    wrote to Thomas Edison who, at that time, was working in Menlo 
                    Park in America. In his letter Dickson presented himself as, 
                    �...a friendless and fatherless boy� with �patience, perseverance, 
                    an ardent love of science and above all a firm reliance on 
                    God�. Dickson concluded his letter by asking for employment. 
                    Dickson received a brief refusal. 
Three months later, the Dickson�s were on the 
                    move again, this time to the United States and four years 
                    after settling there William was finally given a job at the 
                    Edison Laboratories and quickly proved himself to be a valuable 
                    assistant.
In 1887, when Thomas Edison initially started 
                    thinking about moving pictures, Dickson was occupied with 
                    experimentation on a costly ore extraction process. The following 
                    year Edison set Dickson to work developing his ideas. Edison�s 
                    idea was centred around his sound capture device - the phonograph. 
                  
Initially Edison described a series of microphotographs 
                    arranged in a spiral formation around the exterior surface 
                    of a cylinder - in the same way as recorded sound tracks were 
                    etched onto the surface of the tinfoil cylinders in the phonograph. 
                    In addition Edison described the illumination of these microphotographs 
                    from inside the cylinder using electric sparks.
The early experimentations carried out in Edison�s 
                    laboratories show a determined effort to make this cylinder 
                    method succeed. Dickson placed orders for many interesting 
                    supplies - Magic Lantern plates, and plates from Eadweard 
                    Muybridge�s Animal Locomotion Experiments. In September of 
                    1888 Dickson ordered a quantity of microphotographic lenses 
                    - clearly for use in his motion picture experiments.
Other ideas put forward by Edison to Dickson 
                    included the coating of the cylinder with emulsion but this 
                    proved difficult and Dickson sought other alternatives, travelling 
                    to New York to obtain some �daguerreotype experiment� supplies.

In November 1888 John Carbutt announced to colleagues 
                    in the field of photography announced his successful production 
                    of photographic quality celluloid, available in 20 x 50 inch 
                    sheets. The decision by Edison�s laboratory to order a dozen 
                    Carbutt film sheets the following June seemed to signify an 
                    end to the cylinder experiments but the Summer of 1889 saw 
                    serious experimentation on what was now being called the Kinetoscope. 
                  
On August 2nd 1889, Edison left Dickson to continue 
                    with the cylindrical moving picture machine and sailed to 
                    Europe where he met Jules Marey. 
Returning to his laboratories on October 6th 
                    he found an addition to his premises - a new �Photographic 
                    Building� had been erected to accommodate Dickson�s experiments. 
                  
Despite stimulus from two events - the introduction 
                    to Marey�s roll film Chronophotographe and apparent competition 
                    from William Friese-Greene (who had described a machine camera 
                    for taking 10 photographs a second) no real attempt was made 
                    to prioritise the Kinetoscope experiments and much of the 
                    Summer of 1890 was spent by Dickson and Edison experimenting 
                    with the Ore Extraction process.
Despite the Friese-Greene threat and the new 
                    possibilities opened up by flexible film, cylinder experiments 
                    continued on to the bitter end. In Late October of 1890, Dickson�s 
                    hard work produced its first successful results. He was able 
                    to show his first motion pictures produced by the cylinder 
                    Kinetoscope. The viewed scenes, the so called �Monkeyshines� 
                    starred one of the laboratory workers dressing up and fooling 
                    around for the camera. 
Results were clearly achieved by the cylinder 
                    machine as evidence still exists pertaining to the fact, but 
                    it was clearly a dead end. The moving pictures produced were 
                    only viewable using huge monocular magnification - under which 
                    the microscopic images would almost certainly appear grainy. 
                  
Work on the cylinder device ended late in 1890 
                    and work began on a moving picture Kinetoscope using roll 
                    film. By May of 1891 Dickson had produced a working prototype, 
                    this followed with a camera and patent specifications for 
                    the Kinetograph camera and Kinetoscope viewer were filed on 
                    24th August 1891. 
Edison�s announcement that he would show films 
                    on his new Kinetoscope at Chicago�s World Columbian Exposition 
                    meant that a great deal of work was needed to fulfil the expected 
                    twenty five machines. Dickson identified the need for films 
                    to show in these machines and when Dickson perfected the Kinetograph 
                    Camera in October 1892, he set to work designing a studio 
                    to make these films.

Building work began on the studio in December 
                    in the grounds of Edison�s West Orange Laboratory. The studio 
                    was constructed of wood and tar paper with a removable roof 
                    and sat on circular tracks enabling rotation to trap the maximum 
                    amount of sunlight. The studio became known as the �Black 
                    Maria� due to its supposed similarities to the police wagons 
                    of the period. 
Regrettably the twenty five Kinetoscopes promised 
                    for the Chicago Fair weren�t ready by its opening in May 1893.
Edison�s reputation as an inventor and businessman 
                    meant that Dickson was able to persuade major showbusiness 
                    figures to travel from New York to the Black Maria Studio 
                    to star in Edison films. Many vaudeville acts travelled to 
                    New Jersey, often waiving their fee including Eugene Sandlow 
                    - �The Strongest Man in the World�, and Ruth Dennis - �High 
                    Kicker�. 
In the two years that followed, Dickson�s Kinetoscope 
                    attracted performances from Barnum and Bailey�s Circus and 
                    Buffalo Bill�s Wild West Show - featuring Annie Oakley and 
                    Buffalo Bill Cody. 
April the first 1894 saw the appointment of 
                    a new general manager of Edison�s Enterprises - William E. 
                    Glimore. Friction was soon generated between Dickson and Gilmore, 
                    Gilmore insisting that all copyrights held in Dickson�s name 
                    be changed to Edison. 
The growing differences between Dickson and 
                    his employer was aggravated further when Edison put Dickson�s 
                    colleague, Charles Kayser, to work developing a projection 
                    apparatus for motion pictures. Edison had previously stated 
                    categorically that he had no interest in projecting moving 
                    pictures in favour of the current peephole method. 
Outside of work, Dickson spent time with the 
                    Latham�s (Gray and Otway) as well as with engineer friend 
                    Henry Norton Marvin and his partner Herman Casler. With Marvin 
                    and Casler, Dickson discussed the idea of a simple alternative 
                    to the Kinetoscope.

Retaining the peepshow format Dickson�s idea 
                    involved an elaboration on the flick-book principle and on 
                    November 21 1894 Casler filed a patent application for this 
                    device under the name Mutoscope. The following March Casler 
                    demonstrated a camera - the Biograph to take �views� for the 
                    Mutoscope. 
Around this time is recorded a confrontation 
                    between Dickson and William Gilmore, little is known about 
                    what exactly was said but it is believed Gilmore accused Dickson 
                    of being disloyal to Edison. Dickson, upset and angry that, 
                    after all his hard work his loyalty was called into question 
                    resigned from Edison�s Company on April 2nd 1895. 
By early June in 1895, Casler�s camera was
                    in operation and Dickson appears to have spent that summer
                    at
                    Canastota, New York, with Marvin and Casler and probably
                    made some of the first mutoscope films. 
Dickson was now firmly committed to the development 
                    of the Mutoscope, November 5th 1895 saw its patent issued 
                    and nine days later a application for a patent was made for 
                    a handheld mutoscope. November also saw a mutoscope adapted 
                    with a mirror device to project motion pictures and soon after 
                    the group perfected a through the film projector which they 
                    called the Biograph. 
The American Mutoscope company was established 
                    on December 27th 1895 - the partners listed as Dickson, Marvin, 
                    Casler and Elias Hoopman. They set up premises at 841 Broadway, 
                    in New York. 
Dickson�s knowledge of the European marketplace 
                    made him an ideal candidate for manager of the Mutoscope and 
                    Biograph Syndicate�s London Office, which he became as the 
                    century drew to a close.
