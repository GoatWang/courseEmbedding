How the BuildZoom Score works








Follow this contractor

















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Michigan:













Does Sharp Douglas E carry a valid contracting license?



Michigan requires contractors performing any work on residential properties to be licensed with the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs. 
Sharp Douglas E currently holds license 2101166428 (Builder Individual), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Michigan?



Contractors in Michigan must complete a 60 hour approved prelicensure education class prior to taking a buisness and law exam. Contractors are required to take continuing education upon renewal of an active license. 











Your liability risk when hiring Sharp Douglas E



Michigan requires licensed contractors to carry an active workers' compensation policy. Although general liability insurance is not required under Michigan state law, it is always advisable to hire contractors who carry it. Request copies of the certificates for both forms of insurance for your records. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Michigan, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

5.0 out of 5 starsI really enjoyed the world of magic presented by the authorByAmazon Customeron June 8, 2016I really enjoyed the world of magic presented by the author.. The main character's refusal to use magic violently or to hurt others and the consternation which this causes among the other characters creates good and believable tension. A thoughtful look at the pros and cons of violence and how our culture influences our view of reality and good and bad. This new world with its many characters is Harry Potteresque. I can't wait for the next volume.

3.0 out of 5 starsThis is a great first bookByMelon January 23, 2016This is a great first book; I liked it. I WANT more people to read it! Why? Because I know the author will improve in his future novels and go on to become a great and talented novelist. This is just the beginning for him, so I will read the sequel and whatever other books that he produces because he shows promise. The author was masterfully creative in coming up with new species and cultures. I am a fantasy junkie and hadn't heard of some of the races he used so, kudos my good man! Great storyline too; It was classic.  I did not enjoy the redundancy of many scenes and/or dialogue that had to be repeated. The book is an alternating third person perspective and so I understand much of the overlap; I just did not like it. The main characters were strong and I enjoyed their conflict and developement. That being said, I sometimes felt that their reactions to things were forced by the author in order to make more conflict. I also felt that the flow of information was inconsistent.

The author has done a wonderful job of creating a new reality that was not overly used, even characters that were commonly used where used in a new way. Wonderful character development I couldn't help but feel connected to Rebeca immediately, as well as Lyre as the book went on. They're all so easy to fall in love with. I loved it so much!! Can't wait for the next book, I'm so excited.0Comment|

Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsGreat book with a unique story.ByAmazon Customeron October 21, 2014Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseI really enjoyed this book.  It is fantasy, but doesn't follow a typical fantasy storyline.  It has a great mix of fantasy, some sci-fi elements as well as an interesting conflict between modern day elements and those that are more ancient and magical.  The result is a great story that doesn't bog down when there is a lull in the action.  I definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes to escape reality every so often and delve into a good story.0Comment|

Gallery Wrapped Canvas
Ready To Hang On Your Customers Wall
Structure
The frame is usually 1.25″ (approx. 4cms) thick. As a result, the hardware (staples or tacks) used to secure the canvas are not visible. The sides of the canvas are prepared and primed in the same manner as the face or front. They may then be painted a solid color (usually white) or painted to continue the image appearing on the face. This method of stretching and preparing a canvas allows for a frameless presentation of the finished painting or photograph. In some competitions it is considered “framed” and ready to hang.
Terminology
In canvas printing, the term “gallery wrap” refers to an image that appears on the sides of the frame as well as the front. The image on the sides is either a continuation or a reflection of the main image, or an otherwise fabricated element such as a solid color or colors derived from the adjacent image.
Gallery wrap is a very popular way to display art. However, because the edges of the canvas are wrapped over the thick bars, approximately two inches of the image (top, bottom, and sides) are not visible from the front. If the subject of an image or painting is sized and positioned correctly, the image will not be negatively affected. However, in some situations photo editing techniques are employed to fabricate additional image/material or to mirror existing content on the wrapped edges. Solid colours can also be used on the wrapped edges.
Gallery wrap vs. non gallery wrap
Gallery wrap is a method of displaying art wrapped over thick wooden bars so that there are no visible fasteners (e.g., staples or tacks). This method of stretching and preparing a canvas allows for a frame-less presentation of the finished painting.
In contrast, a non gallery wrap canvas is usually intended to be framed before presentation. The stretcher bars are often thinner, and the canvas can be secured at the sides with staples or tacks as the frame will hide them. However, thin stretcher bars can be found “gallery wrapped” as a hangable work without a frame.
 


Product Description

Port Douglas clean sharp
Port Douglas clean sharp
Four Mile Beach (Port Douglas) is one of the best known and most popular beaches of northern Australia. What was a sleepy coastal town in the 1970’s became an international tourist destination by the late 1980’s. Three major resorts back the beach, together with golf courses and a marina in the town. The beach runs due south for 4 km and is also known as Four Mile Beach. It begins at the base of prominent, 70 m high Island Point and ends amongst the rocks, reefs and mangroves of the Mowbray River mouth. For the most part the beach is very low, flat, and at low tide up to 200 m wide. The sand flats widen toward the river mouth. The northern end of the beach, just 1 km from the town centre, is the most accessible and most popular. It is also the site of the Port Douglas Surf Life Saving Club, founded in 1984, that patrols the beach as well as maintaining a stinger enclosure. Down the beach is the large Mirage Resort which provides three beach access tracks. Further access tracks are available through the residential development along the southern half of the beach, including one at the sailing club. A popular tourist destination and well worth a visit. There is plenty of space and the added safety of a patrolled beach and stinger enclosure. A beach accessible wheelchair is available for use on Four Mile Beach from Macrossan House, 19 Macrossan St Port Douglas. Please contact Trevor and Phillipa at Macrossan House for Beach Chair usage. They are more than happy to deliver the chair to your hotel for you. You will need to sign the indemnity form that comes with the chair. It is flat off the beach and most fishers use the northern headland, the town jetties or head offshore in a boat.

Sharp Corporation (シャープ株式会社, Shāpu Kabushiki-gaisha) is a Japanese multinational corporation that designs and manufactures electronic products, headquartered in Sakai-ku, Sakai. Since 2016 it has been an integral part of Taiwan-based Foxconn Group. Sharp employs more than 50,000 people worldwide. The company was founded in September 1912 in Tokyo and takes its name from one of its founder’s first inventions, the Ever-Sharp mechanical pencil, which was invented by Tokuji Hayakawa in 1915.
As of 2013, Sharp Corporation is the tenth-largest, by market share, television manufacturer in the world.[4] In Japan it has been a long-time leader.[5] Sharp has at times also been the most popular mobile phone brand in the Japanese market, but is currently third biggest.[6][7]

History[edit]




Sharp portable TV






Sharp MD-MS701H






Sharp’s former headquarters complex in Abeno-ku, Osaka


In 1912, Tokuji Hayakawa founded a metal workshop in Tokyo. The first of his many inventions was a snap buckle named ‘Tokubijo’. Another of his inventions was the Ever-Sharp mechanical pencil in 1915, from which the Sharp Corporation derived its name.[8] After the pencil business was destroyed by the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, the company relocated to Osaka and began designing the first generation of Japanese radio sets. These went on sale in 1925. In 1953, Sharp started producing TV sets.
In 1964, Sharp developed the world’s first transistor calculator, which was priced at JP¥535,000 (US$1,400). It took Sharp several years to develop the product as they had no experience in making computing devices at the time. Two years later, in 1966, Sharp introduced its first IC calculator using 145 Mitsubishi-made bipolar ICs, priced at JP¥350,000 (about US$1000). Its first LSI calculator was introduced in 1969. This was the first pocketable calculator priced at less than JP¥100,000 (less than US$300), and turned out to be a popular item.[9]
The company produced the first LCD calculator in 1973. Sharp had a working relationship with Nintendo during the 1980s, and was granted licensing rights for the manufacture and development of the C1 NES TV (1983, later released in North America as the Sharp Nintendo Television), the Twin Famicom (1986), the Sharp Famicom Titler (1989), and the SF-1 SNES TV (1990). All of these units are considered collectors items on the secondary market. One of the company’s main inventors of LCD calculators was Tadashi Sasaki.[10]
The company ventured into the high end stereo market in 1976 with the introduction of high end receivers, amplifiers, speakers, turntables and cassette players. The Optonica line as it was called, consisted of high quality and technically advanced components, that was expanded in 1979, to cover a broader selection of high end equipment. During this run, Sharp introduced digital technology to some of the Optonica products, along with the traditional analogue products, and offered a complete selection of models ranging from low power high end receivers to very powerful models. The line was again changed, in 1981, and moved mainly into digital high end, complete stereo systems with advanced technological features setting the trend towards the digital age. The line was discontinued after 1981, but the Optonica line was again re-introduced in the late 1980s for a high end line of television receivers and higher quality mass market audio products such as VCR's, surround sound receivers, CD cassette boom boxes, and portable cassette players.
Sharp’s Mobile Communications Division created the world’s first commercial camera phone, the J-SH04, in Japan in 2000.
Since 2000, Sharp has heavily invested in LCD panel manufacturing plants: Kameyama in 2004, Sakai in 2009. The Sakai plant is still the only 10th generation LCD manufacturing plant on the globe and best fit for production of 60 inch or larger panels. However, the 2008 financial crisis and strong Yen (especially against Won) significantly lowered world demand for Japanese LCD panels. Furthermore, the switch to digital TV broadcasting was virtually completed in Japan by the middle of 2011. Via Japanese government issued coupons for digital TV sets, consumers were encouraged to purchase digital TV sets until March 2011. This hit the Japanese LCD TV market, reducing it almost by half from 2010. All of those events strongly hit Sharp's LCD business. As the result, the Sakai LCD plant suffered a reduced operating rate until Q3 2012.
In June 2005 Sharp produced the largest LCD television at the time, with a display of 65 inches. It went on sale in August 2005 in Japan.[11]
From 2005 to 2010 Sharp was the biggest mobile phone brand in Japan. Since then it has been constantly switching places through financial quarters against rivals Fujitsu, Apple and Sony.
Sharp acquired a controlling stake in Pioneer Corporation in 2007.
At CES 2007, Sharp introduced a prototype largest LCD TV, with a screen size of 108 inches.[12] In July 2008 Sharp announced that the model will go into production for the Japanese market.[13]
In 2008, Sharp collaborated with Emblaze Mobile on the Monolith, “…an ambitious project to design the ultimate holistic mobile device”.[14] The project was never brought to market. Key software developers were later picked up by other companies.
On 25 June 2009, Sharp and Pioneer agreed to form a joint venture comprising their optical businesses, called “Pioneer Digital Design and Manufacturing Corporation”.[15]
In 2012 Sharp unveiled the largest production TV at the time, with a screen size of 80 inches. It is part of the Aquos range and went on sale in Japan at around JP¥950,000.[16]
2012 was the 100th anniversary for Sharp but it announced the worst financial record in its history, with a loss of JP¥376 billion (US$4.7 billion) in April 2012. In September, Sharp announced job cuts.[17] In 2014, Sharp was able to stem losses and deliver a positive net income for its first quarter results.[18]
In March 2012 the Taiwan-based electronics company Hon Hai, trading as Foxconn, agreed to acquire a 10% stake in Sharp Corporation for US$806 million, and to purchase up to 50 percent of the LCD displays produced at Sharp’s plant in Sakai, Japan.[19] In June 2012, Hon Hai chairman Terry Gou paid money for Sakai plant and got 50% ownership of the plant. However, since the announcement in March, Sharp’s share price continued declining and reached JP¥192 on 3 August. Sharp deal’s price was originally JP¥550 per share. Both companies agreed to renegotiate the share price, but they never came to an agreement.[20]
Sharp announced it accepted a US$100 million investment from Samsung in March 2013.[21]
In 2013 Sharp developed the most efficient solar cell, converting a record 44.4% of sunlight into electricity.[22]
After years of huge losses in its overseas TV business, Sharp sold its Mexico TV factory to Chinese electronics manufacturer Hisense for $23.7 million in July 2015. The sale includes rights to use the Sharp brand name and all its channel resources in North and South America, except Brazil. This meant that Sharp has exited the TV market in the Americas (except Brazil).[23] It was a sign showing Sharp's rapid decline in that market, where it once was one of the leading manufacturers for LCD TVs a decade earlier.[24] Sharp's television market share in North America was 4.6% in 2015.[25] However Sharp remains the biggest television brand in the Japanese market.[5]
In October 2015 Sharp announced a smartphone that also works as a robot, called RoboHon. It will be sold in 2016 in Japan.[26]
Sharp began selling the world’s first commercially available TV with a 8K resolution in October 2015.[citation needed] The 85-inch LV-85001 model costs JP¥16 million (US$133,000). Japanese public broadcaster NHK will have test broadcasts at 8K starting 2016, with regular services expected by the time of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.[27][28]
On 25 February 2016, Foxconn announced its intent to acquire a 66% controlling stake in Sharp for 700 billion yen (US$6.24 billion).[29] However, the deal was briefly delayed due to unforeseen financial liabilities; on 30 March 2016, Foxconn announced that it had agreed to pay US$3.5 billion for the stake instead, Foxconn wished to use the purchase to expand into direct-to-consumer product sales rather than serving as a contracted manufacturer.[30]
On 28 April 2017, Sharp turned its first operating profit in three years, citing the restructuring efforts by Foxconn..[31]
In June 2017, Sharp sued its American licensee Hisense for damaging the reputation of its brand, seeking an exit from its licensing agreement. Sharp accused the company of producing "shoddily manufactured" televisions under the Sharp name, including products they believed were in violation of U.S. safety standards for electromagnetic radiation, and the subject of deceptive advertising over their quality. Hisense denied that it engaged in these practices, and stated that it planned to defend itself in court and "will continue to manufacture and sell quality televisions under the Sharp licensed brands."[32][33]

Sharp was among the Top 100 R&D Spenders in a list published by the IEEE Spectrum magazine in 2002.
In September 2014, Sharp announced that Slovakian electronics company UMC was acquiring an exclusive brand licence from Sharp and its European television and audio business UMC will also acquire Sharp’s Polish factory. As part of the deal, Sharp will support the design and development of televisions sold by UMC under the Sharp brand[40]
The same month, Sharp also announced a tie-up with Vestel in Europe for white goods. Vestel will sell Sharp-branded white goods (except air conditioners), such as refrigerators and microwave ovens manufactured by Sharp in Thailand and China. Sharp will also license its brand name to Vestel for volume home appliances such as refrigerators, washing machines and ovens.

Antitrust law violations[edit]
US[edit]
On 8 November 2008, Department of Justice announced that Sharp agreed to pay US$120 million as criminal fine. According to the announcement, Sharp participated in the conspiracies to fix the price of TFT LCD panel for Dell’s computer monitors and laptops (2001 - 2005), Motorola’s Razr phones (2005 - 2006) and Apple’s iPod (2005 -2006).[42]
On 18 December 2008, Japan Fair Trade Commission ordered Sharp to pay JP¥261 million (US$3 million) as criminal fine. According to the order, Sharp and Hitachi Display participated in the conspiracies to keep the price for TFT LCD panels for Nintendo DS and DS-Lite. Fine for Hitachi Displays was waived by JFTC leniency program.[43]
However, Sharp disagreed with the JFTC order and announced to begin appeal procedure against it on 2 February 2009.[44] On 31 July 2013, JFTC dismissed Sharp’s appeal.[45]
Environmental record[edit]




Sharp’s booth at CES 2012 in Los Angeles, CA


In November 2011 Sharp was ranked in 11th place by Greenpeace’s re-launched Guide to Greener Electronics that ranks 15 electronics manufacturers according to their policies and practices to reduce their impact on the climate, produce greener products, and make their operations more sustainable. Greenpeace summarizes the corporation’s environmental record thus: “Sharp supports a new renewable energy law in Japan but scores poor on all sustainable operations criteria.”[46]
Sharp scored 3/10 and received most of its points on the Products criteria where the company was praised for the energy efficiency of its products with all of its TVs meeting the latest Energy Star standard. It also gained some points for having a relative long term target to reduce CO2 emissions by two percent (per production unit) compared to the previous year, yet sets out no clear target for absolute reductions. The company was also praised for its public support for a clean energy policy, after advocating the Japanese Government to increase the use of renewable energy.[46]
Sharp scored least points in the guide in the Sustainable Operations category, scoring no points for chemical management due to not communicating commitments made on phasing out hazardous substances in its supply chain. The guide also notes that Sharp have lacked any initiative to address the issue of conflict minerals and the exclusion of paper sourced from suppliers involved in illegal logging or deforestation.[46]
Sponsorships[edit]
Sharp was the principal sponsor of Manchester United Football Club from 1983 until 2000, in one of the lengthiest and most lucrative sponsorship deals in English football.[47][48] Sharp's logo was on the front of United's shirts over these 17 years, during which the team won seven Premier League titles, five FA Cups, one Football League Cup, one UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and one UEFA Champions League title.
In June 2012, Sharp became name sponsor of a UCI World Tour cycling team, which thereupon became known as Garmin-Sharp.

Sharp Corporation (シャープ株式会社, Shāpu Kabushiki-gaisha) is a Japanese multinational corporation that designs and manufactures electronic products, headquartered in Sakai-ku, Sakai. Since 2016 it has been an integral part of Taiwan-based Foxconn Group. Sharp employs more than 50,000 people worldwide. The company was founded in September 1912 in Tokyo and takes its name from one of its founder’s first inventions, the Ever-Sharp mechanical pencil, which was invented by Tokuji Hayakawa in 1915.
As of 2013, Sharp Corporation is the tenth-largest, by market share, television manufacturer in the world.[4] In Japan it has been a long-time leader.[5] Sharp has at times also been the most popular mobile phone brand in the Japanese market, but is currently third biggest.[6][7]

History[edit]




Sharp portable TV






Sharp MD-MS701H






Sharp’s former headquarters complex in Abeno-ku, Osaka


In 1912, Tokuji Hayakawa founded a metal workshop in Tokyo. The first of his many inventions was a snap buckle named ‘Tokubijo’. Another of his inventions was the Ever-Sharp mechanical pencil in 1915, from which the Sharp Corporation derived its name.[8] After the pencil business was destroyed by the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, the company relocated to Osaka and began designing the first generation of Japanese radio sets. These went on sale in 1925. In 1953, Sharp started producing TV sets.
In 1964, Sharp developed the world’s first transistor calculator, which was priced at JP¥535,000 (US$1,400). It took Sharp several years to develop the product as they had no experience in making computing devices at the time. Two years later, in 1966, Sharp introduced its first IC calculator using 145 Mitsubishi-made bipolar ICs, priced at JP¥350,000 (about US$1000). Its first LSI calculator was introduced in 1969. This was the first pocketable calculator priced at less than JP¥100,000 (less than US$300), and turned out to be a popular item.[9]
The company produced the first LCD calculator in 1973. Sharp had a working relationship with Nintendo during the 1980s, and was granted licensing rights for the manufacture and development of the C1 NES TV (1983, later released in North America as the Sharp Nintendo Television), the Twin Famicom (1986), the Sharp Famicom Titler (1989), and the SF-1 SNES TV (1990). All of these units are considered collectors items on the secondary market. One of the company’s main inventors of LCD calculators was Tadashi Sasaki.[10]
The company ventured into the high end stereo market in 1976 with the introduction of high end receivers, amplifiers, speakers, turntables and cassette players. The Optonica line as it was called, consisted of high quality and technically advanced components, that was expanded in 1979, to cover a broader selection of high end equipment. During this run, Sharp introduced digital technology to some of the Optonica products, along with the traditional analogue products, and offered a complete selection of models ranging from low power high end receivers to very powerful models. The line was again changed, in 1981, and moved mainly into digital high end, complete stereo systems with advanced technological features setting the trend towards the digital age. The line was discontinued after 1981, but the Optonica line was again re-introduced in the late 1980s for a high end line of television receivers and higher quality mass market audio products such as VCR's, surround sound receivers, CD cassette boom boxes, and portable cassette players.
Sharp’s Mobile Communications Division created the world’s first commercial camera phone, the J-SH04, in Japan in 2000.
Since 2000, Sharp has heavily invested in LCD panel manufacturing plants: Kameyama in 2004, Sakai in 2009. The Sakai plant is still the only 10th generation LCD manufacturing plant on the globe and best fit for production of 60 inch or larger panels. However, the 2008 financial crisis and strong Yen (especially against Won) significantly lowered world demand for Japanese LCD panels. Furthermore, the switch to digital TV broadcasting was virtually completed in Japan by the middle of 2011. Via Japanese government issued coupons for digital TV sets, consumers were encouraged to purchase digital TV sets until March 2011. This hit the Japanese LCD TV market, reducing it almost by half from 2010. All of those events strongly hit Sharp's LCD business. As the result, the Sakai LCD plant suffered a reduced operating rate until Q3 2012.
In June 2005 Sharp produced the largest LCD television at the time, with a display of 65 inches. It went on sale in August 2005 in Japan.[11]
From 2005 to 2010 Sharp was the biggest mobile phone brand in Japan. Since then it has been constantly switching places through financial quarters against rivals Fujitsu, Apple and Sony.
Sharp acquired a controlling stake in Pioneer Corporation in 2007.
At CES 2007, Sharp introduced a prototype largest LCD TV, with a screen size of 108 inches.[12] In July 2008 Sharp announced that the model will go into production for the Japanese market.[13]
In 2008, Sharp collaborated with Emblaze Mobile on the Monolith, “…an ambitious project to design the ultimate holistic mobile device”.[14] The project was never brought to market. Key software developers were later picked up by other companies.
On 25 June 2009, Sharp and Pioneer agreed to form a joint venture comprising their optical businesses, called “Pioneer Digital Design and Manufacturing Corporation”.[15]
In 2012 Sharp unveiled the largest production TV at the time, with a screen size of 80 inches. It is part of the Aquos range and went on sale in Japan at around JP¥950,000.[16]
2012 was the 100th anniversary for Sharp but it announced the worst financial record in its history, with a loss of JP¥376 billion (US$4.7 billion) in April 2012. In September, Sharp announced job cuts.[17] In 2014, Sharp was able to stem losses and deliver a positive net income for its first quarter results.[18]
In March 2012 the Taiwan-based electronics company Hon Hai, trading as Foxconn, agreed to acquire a 10% stake in Sharp Corporation for US$806 million, and to purchase up to 50 percent of the LCD displays produced at Sharp’s plant in Sakai, Japan.[19] In June 2012, Hon Hai chairman Terry Gou paid money for Sakai plant and got 50% ownership of the plant. However, since the announcement in March, Sharp’s share price continued declining and reached JP¥192 on 3 August. Sharp deal’s price was originally JP¥550 per share. Both companies agreed to renegotiate the share price, but they never came to an agreement.[20]
Sharp announced it accepted a US$100 million investment from Samsung in March 2013.[21]
In 2013 Sharp developed the most efficient solar cell, converting a record 44.4% of sunlight into electricity.[22]
After years of huge losses in its overseas TV business, Sharp sold its Mexico TV factory to Chinese electronics manufacturer Hisense for $23.7 million in July 2015. The sale includes rights to use the Sharp brand name and all its channel resources in North and South America, except Brazil. This meant that Sharp has exited the TV market in the Americas (except Brazil).[23] It was a sign showing Sharp's rapid decline in that market, where it once was one of the leading manufacturers for LCD TVs a decade earlier.[24] Sharp's television market share in North America was 4.6% in 2015.[25] However Sharp remains the biggest television brand in the Japanese market.[5]
In October 2015 Sharp announced a smartphone that also works as a robot, called RoboHon. It will be sold in 2016 in Japan.[26]
Sharp began selling the world’s first commercially available TV with a 8K resolution in October 2015.[citation needed] The 85-inch LV-85001 model costs JP¥16 million (US$133,000). Japanese public broadcaster NHK will have test broadcasts at 8K starting 2016, with regular services expected by the time of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.[27][28]
On 25 February 2016, Foxconn announced its intent to acquire a 66% controlling stake in Sharp for 700 billion yen (US$6.24 billion).[29] However, the deal was briefly delayed due to unforeseen financial liabilities; on 30 March 2016, Foxconn announced that it had agreed to pay US$3.5 billion for the stake instead, Foxconn wished to use the purchase to expand into direct-to-consumer product sales rather than serving as a contracted manufacturer.[30]
On 28 April 2017, Sharp turned its first operating profit in three years, citing the restructuring efforts by Foxconn..[31]
In June 2017, Sharp sued its American licensee Hisense for damaging the reputation of its brand, seeking an exit from its licensing agreement. Sharp accused the company of producing "shoddily manufactured" televisions under the Sharp name, including products they believed were in violation of U.S. safety standards for electromagnetic radiation, and the subject of deceptive advertising over their quality. Hisense denied that it engaged in these practices, and stated that it planned to defend itself in court and "will continue to manufacture and sell quality televisions under the Sharp licensed brands."[32][33]

As part of the deal, Sharp will support the design and development of televisions sold by UMC under the Sharp brand[40]
The same month, Sharp also announced a tie-up with Vestel in Europe for white goods. Vestel will sell Sharp-branded white goods (except air conditioners), such as refrigerators and microwave ovens manufactured by Sharp in Thailand and China. Sharp will also license its brand name to Vestel for volume home appliances such as refrigerators, washing machines and ovens. Sharp’s remaining European business will then focus on the business-to-business sector including multi-function printers and energy solutions.
Sharp's headquarters are at 1 Takumi-chō, Sakai-ku, Sakai, Japan. Until the relocation to Sakai in 2016, the headquarters were in Abeno-ku, Osaka where Hayakawa restarted the business in 1920s.[41]

Antitrust law violations[edit]
US[edit]
On 8 November 2008, Department of Justice announced that Sharp agreed to pay US$120 million as criminal fine. According to the announcement, Sharp participated in the conspiracies to fix the price of TFT LCD panel for Dell’s computer monitors and laptops (2001 - 2005), Motorola’s Razr phones (2005 - 2006) and Apple’s iPod (2005 -2006).[42]
On 18 December 2008, Japan Fair Trade Commission ordered Sharp to pay JP¥261 million (US$3 million) as criminal fine. According to the order, Sharp and Hitachi Display participated in the conspiracies to keep the price for TFT LCD panels for Nintendo DS and DS-Lite. Fine for Hitachi Displays was waived by JFTC leniency program.[43]
However, Sharp disagreed with the JFTC order and announced to begin appeal procedure against it on 2 February 2009.[44] On 31 July 2013, JFTC dismissed Sharp’s appeal.[45]
Environmental record[edit]

In November 2011 Sharp was ranked in 11th place by Greenpeace’s re-launched Guide to Greener Electronics that ranks 15 electronics manufacturers according to their policies and practices to reduce their impact on the climate, produce greener products, and make their operations more sustainable. Greenpeace summarizes the corporation’s environmental record thus: “Sharp supports a new renewable energy law in Japan but scores poor on all sustainable operations criteria.”[46]
Sharp scored 3/10 and received most of its points on the Products criteria where the company was praised for the energy efficiency of its products with all of its TVs meeting the latest Energy Star standard. It also gained some points for having a relative long term target to reduce CO2 emissions by two percent (per production unit) compared to the previous year, yet sets out no clear target for absolute reductions. The company was also praised for its public support for a clean energy policy, after advocating the Japanese Government to increase the use of renewable energy.[46]
Sharp scored least points in the guide in the Sustainable Operations category, scoring no points for chemical management due to not communicating commitments made on phasing out hazardous substances in its supply chain. The guide also notes that Sharp have lacked any initiative to address the issue of conflict minerals and the exclusion of paper sourced from suppliers involved in illegal logging or deforestation.[46]
Sponsorships[edit]
Sharp was the principal sponsor of Manchester United Football Club from 1983 until 2000, in one of the lengthiest and most lucrative sponsorship deals in English football.[47][48] Sharp's logo was on the front of United's shirts over these 17 years, during which the team won seven Premier League titles, five FA Cups, one Football League Cup, one UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and one UEFA Champions League title.
In June 2012, Sharp became name sponsor of a UCI World Tour cycling team, which thereupon became known as Garmin-Sharp.

Sharp Corporation (シャープ株式会社, Shāpu Kabushiki-gaisha) is a Japanese multinational corporation that designs and manufactures electronic products, headquartered in Sakai-ku, Sakai. Since 2016 it has been an integral part of Taiwan-based Foxconn Group. Sharp employs more than 50,000 people worldwide. The company was founded in September 1912 in Tokyo and takes its name from one of its founder’s first inventions, the Ever-Sharp mechanical pencil, which was invented by Tokuji Hayakawa in 1915.
As of 2013, Sharp Corporation is the tenth-largest, by market share, television manufacturer in the world.[4] In Japan it has been a long-time leader.[5] Sharp has at times also been the most popular mobile phone brand in the Japanese market, but is currently third biggest.[6][7]

History[edit]




Sharp portable TV






Sharp MD-MS701H






Sharp’s former headquarters complex in Abeno-ku, Osaka


In 1912, Tokuji Hayakawa founded a metal workshop in Tokyo. The first of his many inventions was a snap buckle named ‘Tokubijo’. Another of his inventions was the Ever-Sharp mechanical pencil in 1915, from which the Sharp Corporation derived its name.[8] After the pencil business was destroyed by the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, the company relocated to Osaka and began designing the first generation of Japanese radio sets. These went on sale in 1925. In 1953, Sharp started producing TV sets.
In 1964, Sharp developed the world’s first transistor calculator, which was priced at JP¥535,000 (US$1,400). It took Sharp several years to develop the product as they had no experience in making computing devices at the time. Two years later, in 1966, Sharp introduced its first IC calculator using 145 Mitsubishi-made bipolar ICs, priced at JP¥350,000 (about US$1000). Its first LSI calculator was introduced in 1969. This was the first pocketable calculator priced at less than JP¥100,000 (less than US$300), and turned out to be a popular item.[9]
The company produced the first LCD calculator in 1973. Sharp had a working relationship with Nintendo during the 1980s, and was granted licensing rights for the manufacture and development of the C1 NES TV (1983, later released in North America as the Sharp Nintendo Television), the Twin Famicom (1986), the Sharp Famicom Titler (1989), and the SF-1 SNES TV (1990). All of these units are considered collectors items on the secondary market. One of the company’s main inventors of LCD calculators was Tadashi Sasaki.[10]
The company ventured into the high end stereo market in 1976 with the introduction of high end receivers, amplifiers, speakers, turntables and cassette players. The Optonica line as it was called, consisted of high quality and technically advanced components, that was expanded in 1979, to cover a broader selection of high end equipment. During this run, Sharp introduced digital technology to some of the Optonica products, along with the traditional analogue products, and offered a complete selection of models ranging from low power high end receivers to very powerful models. The line was again changed, in 1981, and moved mainly into digital high end, complete stereo systems with advanced technological features setting the trend towards the digital age. The line was discontinued after 1981, but the Optonica line was again re-introduced in the late 1980s for a high end line of television receivers and higher quality mass market audio products such as VCR's, surround sound receivers, CD cassette boom boxes, and portable cassette players.
Sharp’s Mobile Communications Division created the world’s first commercial camera phone, the J-SH04, in Japan in 2000.
Since 2000, Sharp has heavily invested in LCD panel manufacturing plants: Kameyama in 2004, Sakai in 2009. The Sakai plant is still the only 10th generation LCD manufacturing plant on the globe and best fit for production of 60 inch or larger panels. However, the 2008 financial crisis and strong Yen (especially against Won) significantly lowered world demand for Japanese LCD panels. Furthermore, the switch to digital TV broadcasting was virtually completed in Japan by the middle of 2011. Via Japanese government issued coupons for digital TV sets, consumers were encouraged to purchase digital TV sets until March 2011. This hit the Japanese LCD TV market, reducing it almost by half from 2010. All of those events strongly hit Sharp's LCD business. As the result, the Sakai LCD plant suffered a reduced operating rate until Q3 2012.
In June 2005 Sharp produced the largest LCD television at the time, with a display of 65 inches. It went on sale in August 2005 in Japan.[11]
From 2005 to 2010 Sharp was the biggest mobile phone brand in Japan. Since then it has been constantly switching places through financial quarters against rivals Fujitsu, Apple and Sony.
Sharp acquired a controlling stake in Pioneer Corporation in 2007.
At CES 2007, Sharp introduced a prototype largest LCD TV, with a screen size of 108 inches.[12] In July 2008 Sharp announced that the model will go into production for the Japanese market.[13]
In 2008, Sharp collaborated with Emblaze Mobile on the Monolith, “…an ambitious project to design the ultimate holistic mobile device”.[14] The project was never brought to market. Key software developers were later picked up by other companies.
On 25 June 2009, Sharp and Pioneer agreed to form a joint venture comprising their optical businesses, called “Pioneer Digital Design and Manufacturing Corporation”.[15]
In 2012 Sharp unveiled the largest production TV at the time, with a screen size of 80 inches. It is part of the Aquos range and went on sale in Japan at around JP¥950,000.[16]
2012 was the 100th anniversary for Sharp but it announced the worst financial record in its history, with a loss of JP¥376 billion (US$4.7 billion) in April 2012. In September, Sharp announced job cuts.[17] In 2014, Sharp was able to stem losses and deliver a positive net income for its first quarter results.[18]
In March 2012 the Taiwan-based electronics company Hon Hai, trading as Foxconn, agreed to acquire a 10% stake in Sharp Corporation for US$806 million, and to purchase up to 50 percent of the LCD displays produced at Sharp’s plant in Sakai, Japan.[19] In June 2012, Hon Hai chairman Terry Gou paid money for Sakai plant and got 50% ownership of the plant. However, since the announcement in March, Sharp’s share price continued declining and reached JP¥192 on 3 August. Sharp deal’s price was originally JP¥550 per share. Both companies agreed to renegotiate the share price, but they never came to an agreement.[20]
Sharp announced it accepted a US$100 million investment from Samsung in March 2013.[21]
In 2013 Sharp developed the most efficient solar cell, converting a record 44.4% of sunlight into electricity.[22]
After years of huge losses in its overseas TV business, Sharp sold its Mexico TV factory to Chinese electronics manufacturer Hisense for $23.7 million in July 2015. The sale includes rights to use the Sharp brand name and all its channel resources in North and South America, except Brazil. This meant that Sharp has exited the TV market in the Americas (except Brazil).[23] It was a sign showing Sharp's rapid decline in that market, where it once was one of the leading manufacturers for LCD TVs a decade earlier.[24] Sharp's television market share in North America was 4.6% in 2015.[25] However Sharp remains the biggest television brand in the Japanese market.[5]
In October 2015 Sharp announced a smartphone that also works as a robot, called RoboHon. It will be sold in 2016 in Japan.[26]
Sharp began selling the world’s first commercially available TV with a 8K resolution in October 2015.[citation needed] The 85-inch LV-85001 model costs JP¥16 million (US$133,000). Japanese public broadcaster NHK will have test broadcasts at 8K starting 2016, with regular services expected by the time of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.[27][28]
On 25 February 2016, Foxconn announced its intent to acquire a 66% controlling stake in Sharp for 700 billion yen (US$6.24 billion).[29] However, the deal was briefly delayed due to unforeseen financial liabilities; on 30 March 2016, Foxconn announced that it had agreed to pay US$3.5 billion for the stake instead, Foxconn wished to use the purchase to expand into direct-to-consumer product sales rather than serving as a contracted manufacturer.[30]
On 28 April 2017, Sharp turned its first operating profit in three years, citing the restructuring efforts by Foxconn..[31]
In June 2017, Sharp sued its American licensee Hisense for damaging the reputation of its brand, seeking an exit from its licensing agreement. Sharp accused the company of producing "shoddily manufactured" televisions under the Sharp name, including products they believed were in violation of U.S. safety standards for electromagnetic radiation, and the subject of deceptive advertising over their quality. Hisense denied that it engaged in these practices, and stated that it planned to defend itself in court and "will continue to manufacture and sell quality televisions under the Sharp licensed brands."[32][33]

Antitrust law violations[edit]
US[edit]
On 8 November 2008, Department of Justice announced that Sharp agreed to pay US$120 million as criminal fine. According to the announcement, Sharp participated in the conspiracies to fix the price of TFT LCD panel for Dell’s computer monitors and laptops (2001 - 2005), Motorola’s Razr phones (2005 - 2006) and Apple’s iPod (2005 -2006).[42]
On 18 December 2008, Japan Fair Trade Commission ordered Sharp to pay JP¥261 million (US$3 million) as criminal fine. According to the order, Sharp and Hitachi Display participated in the conspiracies to keep the price for TFT LCD panels for Nintendo DS and DS-Lite. Fine for Hitachi Displays was waived by JFTC leniency program.[43]
However, Sharp disagreed with the JFTC order and announced to begin appeal procedure against it on 2 February 2009.[44] On 31 July 2013, JFTC dismissed Sharp’s appeal.[45]
Environmental record[edit]




Sharp’s booth at CES 2012 in Los Angeles, CA


In November 2011 Sharp was ranked in 11th place by Greenpeace’s re-launched Guide to Greener Electronics that ranks 15 electronics manufacturers according to their policies and practices to reduce their impact on the climate, produce greener products, and make their operations more sustainable. Greenpeace summarizes the corporation’s environmental record thus: “Sharp supports a new renewable energy law in Japan but scores poor on all sustainable operations criteria.”[46]
Sharp scored 3/10 and received most of its points on the Products criteria where the company was praised for the energy efficiency of its products with all of its TVs meeting the latest Energy Star standard. It also gained some points for having a relative long term target to reduce CO2 emissions by two percent (per production unit) compared to the previous year, yet sets out no clear target for absolute reductions. The company was also praised for its public support for a clean energy policy, after advocating the Japanese Government to increase the use of renewable energy.[46]
Sharp scored least points in the guide in the Sustainable Operations category, scoring no points for chemical management due to not communicating commitments made on phasing out hazardous substances in its supply chain. The guide also notes that Sharp have lacked any initiative to address the issue of conflict minerals and the exclusion of paper sourced from suppliers involved in illegal logging or deforestation.[46]
Sponsorships[edit]
Sharp was the principal sponsor of Manchester United Football Club from 1983 until 2000, in one of the lengthiest and most lucrative sponsorship deals in English football.[47][48] Sharp's logo was on the front of United's shirts over these 17 years, during which the team won seven Premier League titles, five FA Cups, one Football League Cup, one UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and one UEFA Champions League title.
In June 2012, Sharp became name sponsor of a UCI World Tour cycling team, which thereupon became known as Garmin-Sharp.

Sharp Corporation (シャープ株式会社, Shāpu Kabushiki-gaisha) is a Japanese multinational corporation that designs and manufactures electronic products, headquartered in Sakai-ku, Sakai. Since 2016 it has been an integral part of Taiwan-based Foxconn Group. Sharp employs more than 50,000 people worldwide. The company was founded in September 1912 in Tokyo and takes its name from one of its founder’s first inventions, the Ever-Sharp mechanical pencil, which was invented by Tokuji Hayakawa in 1915.
As of 2013, Sharp Corporation is the tenth-largest, by market share, television manufacturer in the world.[4] In Japan it has been a long-time leader.[5] Sharp has at times also been the most popular mobile phone brand in the Japanese market, but is currently third biggest.[6][7]

History[edit]




Sharp portable TV






Sharp MD-MS701H






Sharp’s former headquarters complex in Abeno-ku, Osaka


In 1912, Tokuji Hayakawa founded a metal workshop in Tokyo. The first of his many inventions was a snap buckle named ‘Tokubijo’. Another of his inventions was the Ever-Sharp mechanical pencil in 1915, from which the Sharp Corporation derived its name.[8] After the pencil business was destroyed by the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, the company relocated to Osaka and began designing the first generation of Japanese radio sets. These went on sale in 1925. In 1953, Sharp started producing TV sets.
In 1964, Sharp developed the world’s first transistor calculator, which was priced at JP¥535,000 (US$1,400). It took Sharp several years to develop the product as they had no experience in making computing devices at the time. Two years later, in 1966, Sharp introduced its first IC calculator using 145 Mitsubishi-made bipolar ICs, priced at JP¥350,000 (about US$1000). Its first LSI calculator was introduced in 1969. This was the first pocketable calculator priced at less than JP¥100,000 (less than US$300), and turned out to be a popular item.[9]
The company produced the first LCD calculator in 1973. Sharp had a working relationship with Nintendo during the 1980s, and was granted licensing rights for the manufacture and development of the C1 NES TV (1983, later released in North America as the Sharp Nintendo Television), the Twin Famicom (1986), the Sharp Famicom Titler (1989), and the SF-1 SNES TV (1990). All of these units are considered collectors items on the secondary market. One of the company’s main inventors of LCD calculators was Tadashi Sasaki.[10]
The company ventured into the high end stereo market in 1976 with the introduction of high end receivers, amplifiers, speakers, turntables and cassette players. The Optonica line as it was called, consisted of high quality and technically advanced components, that was expanded in 1979, to cover a broader selection of high end equipment. During this run, Sharp introduced digital technology to some of the Optonica products, along with the traditional analogue products, and offered a complete selection of models ranging from low power high end receivers to very powerful models. The line was again changed, in 1981, and moved mainly into digital high end, complete stereo systems with advanced technological features setting the trend towards the digital age. The line was discontinued after 1981, but the Optonica line was again re-introduced in the late 1980s for a high end line of television receivers and higher quality mass market audio products such as VCR's, surround sound receivers, CD cassette boom boxes, and portable cassette players.
Sharp’s Mobile Communications Division created the world’s first commercial camera phone, the J-SH04, in Japan in 2000.
Since 2000, Sharp has heavily invested in LCD panel manufacturing plants: Kameyama in 2004, Sakai in 2009. The Sakai plant is still the only 10th generation LCD manufacturing plant on the globe and best fit for production of 60 inch or larger panels. However, the 2008 financial crisis and strong Yen (especially against Won) significantly lowered world demand for Japanese LCD panels. Furthermore, the switch to digital TV broadcasting was virtually completed in Japan by the middle of 2011. Via Japanese government issued coupons for digital TV sets, consumers were encouraged to purchase digital TV sets until March 2011. This hit the Japanese LCD TV market, reducing it almost by half from 2010. All of those events strongly hit Sharp's LCD business. As the result, the Sakai LCD plant suffered a reduced operating rate until Q3 2012.
In June 2005 Sharp produced the largest LCD television at the time, with a display of 65 inches. It went on sale in August 2005 in Japan.[11]
From 2005 to 2010 Sharp was the biggest mobile phone brand in Japan. Since then it has been constantly switching places through financial quarters against rivals Fujitsu, Apple and Sony.
Sharp acquired a controlling stake in Pioneer Corporation in 2007.
At CES 2007, Sharp introduced a prototype largest LCD TV, with a screen size of 108 inches.[12] In July 2008 Sharp announced that the model will go into production for the Japanese market.[13]
In 2008, Sharp collaborated with Emblaze Mobile on the Monolith, “…an ambitious project to design the ultimate holistic mobile device”.[14] The project was never brought to market. Key software developers were later picked up by other companies.
On 25 June 2009, Sharp and Pioneer agreed to form a joint venture comprising their optical businesses, called “Pioneer Digital Design and Manufacturing Corporation”.[15]
In 2012 Sharp unveiled the largest production TV at the time, with a screen size of 80 inches. It is part of the Aquos range and went on sale in Japan at around JP¥950,000.[16]
2012 was the 100th anniversary for Sharp but it announced the worst financial record in its history, with a loss of JP¥376 billion (US$4.7 billion) in April 2012. In September, Sharp announced job cuts.[17] In 2014, Sharp was able to stem losses and deliver a positive net income for its first quarter results.[18]
In March 2012 the Taiwan-based electronics company Hon Hai, trading as Foxconn, agreed to acquire a 10% stake in Sharp Corporation for US$806 million, and to purchase up to 50 percent of the LCD displays produced at Sharp’s plant in Sakai, Japan.[19] In June 2012, Hon Hai chairman Terry Gou paid money for Sakai plant and got 50% ownership of the plant. However, since the announcement in March, Sharp’s share price continued declining and reached JP¥192 on 3 August. Sharp deal’s price was originally JP¥550 per share. Both companies agreed to renegotiate the share price, but they never came to an agreement.[20]
Sharp announced it accepted a US$100 million investment from Samsung in March 2013.[21]
In 2013 Sharp developed the most efficient solar cell, converting a record 44.4% of sunlight into electricity.[22]
After years of huge losses in its overseas TV business, Sharp sold its Mexico TV factory to Chinese electronics manufacturer Hisense for $23.7 million in July 2015. The sale includes rights to use the Sharp brand name and all its channel resources in North and South America, except Brazil. This meant that Sharp has exited the TV market in the Americas (except Brazil).[23] It was a sign showing Sharp's rapid decline in that market, where it once was one of the leading manufacturers for LCD TVs a decade earlier.[24] Sharp's television market share in North America was 4.6% in 2015.[25] However Sharp remains the biggest television brand in the Japanese market.[5]
In October 2015 Sharp announced a smartphone that also works as a robot, called RoboHon. It will be sold in 2016 in Japan.[26]
Sharp began selling the world’s first commercially available TV with a 8K resolution in October 2015.[citation needed] The 85-inch LV-85001 model costs JP¥16 million (US$133,000). Japanese public broadcaster NHK will have test broadcasts at 8K starting 2016, with regular services expected by the time of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.[27][28]
On 25 February 2016, Foxconn announced its intent to acquire a 66% controlling stake in Sharp for 700 billion yen (US$6.24 billion).[29] However, the deal was briefly delayed due to unforeseen financial liabilities; on 30 March 2016, Foxconn announced that it had agreed to pay US$3.5 billion for the stake instead, Foxconn wished to use the purchase to expand into direct-to-consumer product sales rather than serving as a contracted manufacturer.[30]
On 28 April 2017, Sharp turned its first operating profit in three years, citing the restructuring efforts by Foxconn..[31]
In June 2017, Sharp sued its American licensee Hisense for damaging the reputation of its brand, seeking an exit from its licensing agreement. Sharp accused the company of producing "shoddily manufactured" televisions under the Sharp name, including products they believed were in violation of U.S. safety standards for electromagnetic radiation, and the subject of deceptive advertising over their quality. Hisense denied that it engaged in these practices, and stated that it planned to defend itself in court and "will continue to manufacture and sell quality televisions under the Sharp licensed brands."[32][33]

Antitrust law violations[edit]
US[edit]
On 8 November 2008, Department of Justice announced that Sharp agreed to pay US$120 million as criminal fine. According to the announcement, Sharp participated in the conspiracies to fix the price of TFT LCD panel for Dell’s computer monitors and laptops (2001 - 2005), Motorola’s Razr phones (2005 - 2006) and Apple’s iPod (2005 -2006).[42]
On 18 December 2008, Japan Fair Trade Commission ordered Sharp to pay JP¥261 million (US$3 million) as criminal fine. According to the order, Sharp and Hitachi Display participated in the conspiracies to keep the price for TFT LCD panels for Nintendo DS and DS-Lite. Fine for Hitachi Displays was waived by JFTC leniency program.[43]
However, Sharp disagreed with the JFTC order and announced to begin appeal procedure against it on 2 February 2009.[44] On 31 July 2013, JFTC dismissed Sharp’s appeal.[45]
Environmental record[edit]




Sharp’s booth at CES 2012 in Los Angeles, CA


In November 2011 Sharp was ranked in 11th place by Greenpeace’s re-launched Guide to Greener Electronics that ranks 15 electronics manufacturers according to their policies and practices to reduce their impact on the climate, produce greener products, and make their operations more sustainable. Greenpeace summarizes the corporation’s environmental record thus: “Sharp supports a new renewable energy law in Japan but scores poor on all sustainable operations criteria.”[46]
Sharp scored 3/10 and received most of its points on the Products criteria where the company was praised for the energy efficiency of its products with all of its TVs meeting the latest Energy Star standard. It also gained some points for having a relative long term target to reduce CO2 emissions by two percent (per production unit) compared to the previous year, yet sets out no clear target for absolute reductions. The company was also praised for its public support for a clean energy policy, after advocating the Japanese Government to increase the use of renewable energy.[46]
Sharp scored least points in the guide in the Sustainable Operations category, scoring no points for chemical management due to not communicating commitments made on phasing out hazardous substances in its supply chain. The guide also notes that Sharp have lacked any initiative to address the issue of conflict minerals and the exclusion of paper sourced from suppliers involved in illegal logging or deforestation.[46]
Sponsorships[edit]
Sharp was the principal sponsor of Manchester United Football Club from 1983 until 2000, in one of the lengthiest and most lucrative sponsorship deals in English football.[47][48] Sharp's logo was on the front of United's shirts over these 17 years, during which the team won seven Premier League titles, five FA Cups, one Football League Cup, one UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and one UEFA Champions League title.
In June 2012, Sharp became name sponsor of a UCI World Tour cycling team, which thereupon became known as Garmin-Sharp.

Sharp Corporation (シャープ株式会社, Shāpu Kabushiki-gaisha) is a Japanese multinational corporation that designs and manufactures electronic products, headquartered in Sakai-ku, Sakai. Since 2016 it has been an integral part of Taiwan-based Foxconn Group. Sharp employs more than 50,000 people worldwide. The company was founded in September 1912 in Tokyo and takes its name from one of its founder’s first inventions, the Ever-Sharp mechanical pencil, which was invented by Tokuji Hayakawa in 1915.
As of 2013, Sharp Corporation is the tenth-largest, by market share, television manufacturer in the world.[4] In Japan it has been a long-time leader.[5] Sharp has at times also been the most popular mobile phone brand in the Japanese market, but is currently third biggest.[6][7]

History[edit]




Sharp portable TV






Sharp MD-MS701H






Sharp’s former headquarters complex in Abeno-ku, Osaka


In 1912, Tokuji Hayakawa founded a metal workshop in Tokyo. The first of his many inventions was a snap buckle named ‘Tokubijo’. Another of his inventions was the Ever-Sharp mechanical pencil in 1915, from which the Sharp Corporation derived its name.[8] After the pencil business was destroyed by the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, the company relocated to Osaka and began designing the first generation of Japanese radio sets. These went on sale in 1925. In 1953, Sharp started producing TV sets.
In 1964, Sharp developed the world’s first transistor calculator, which was priced at JP¥535,000 (US$1,400). It took Sharp several years to develop the product as they had no experience in making computing devices at the time. Two years later, in 1966, Sharp introduced its first IC calculator using 145 Mitsubishi-made bipolar ICs, priced at JP¥350,000 (about US$1000). Its first LSI calculator was introduced in 1969. This was the first pocketable calculator priced at less than JP¥100,000 (less than US$300), and turned out to be a popular item.[9]
The company produced the first LCD calculator in 1973. Sharp had a working relationship with Nintendo during the 1980s, and was granted licensing rights for the manufacture and development of the C1 NES TV (1983, later released in North America as the Sharp Nintendo Television), the Twin Famicom (1986), the Sharp Famicom Titler (1989), and the SF-1 SNES TV (1990). All of these units are considered collectors items on the secondary market. One of the company’s main inventors of LCD calculators was Tadashi Sasaki.[10]
The company ventured into the high end stereo market in 1976 with the introduction of high end receivers, amplifiers, speakers, turntables and cassette players. The Optonica line as it was called, consisted of high quality and technically advanced components, that was expanded in 1979, to cover a broader selection of high end equipment. During this run, Sharp introduced digital technology to some of the Optonica products, along with the traditional analogue products, and offered a complete selection of models ranging from low power high end receivers to very powerful models. The line was again changed, in 1981, and moved mainly into digital high end, complete stereo systems with advanced technological features setting the trend towards the digital age. The line was discontinued after 1981, but the Optonica line was again re-introduced in the late 1980s for a high end line of television receivers and higher quality mass market audio products such as VCR's, surround sound receivers, CD cassette boom boxes, and portable cassette players.
Sharp’s Mobile Communications Division created the world’s first commercial camera phone, the J-SH04, in Japan in 2000.
Since 2000, Sharp has heavily invested in LCD panel manufacturing plants: Kameyama in 2004, Sakai in 2009. The Sakai plant is still the only 10th generation LCD manufacturing plant on the globe and best fit for production of 60 inch or larger panels. However, the 2008 financial crisis and strong Yen (especially against Won) significantly lowered world demand for Japanese LCD panels. Furthermore, the switch to digital TV broadcasting was virtually completed in Japan by the middle of 2011. Via Japanese government issued coupons for digital TV sets, consumers were encouraged to purchase digital TV sets until March 2011. This hit the Japanese LCD TV market, reducing it almost by half from 2010. All of those events strongly hit Sharp's LCD business. As the result, the Sakai LCD plant suffered a reduced operating rate until Q3 2012.
In June 2005 Sharp produced the largest LCD television at the time, with a display of 65 inches. It went on sale in August 2005 in Japan.[11]
From 2005 to 2010 Sharp was the biggest mobile phone brand in Japan. Since then it has been constantly switching places through financial quarters against rivals Fujitsu, Apple and Sony.
Sharp acquired a controlling stake in Pioneer Corporation in 2007.
At CES 2007, Sharp introduced a prototype largest LCD TV, with a screen size of 108 inches.[12] In July 2008 Sharp announced that the model will go into production for the Japanese market.[13]
In 2008, Sharp collaborated with Emblaze Mobile on the Monolith, “…an ambitious project to design the ultimate holistic mobile device”.[14] The project was never brought to market. Key software developers were later picked up by other companies.
On 25 June 2009, Sharp and Pioneer agreed to form a joint venture comprising their optical businesses, called “Pioneer Digital Design and Manufacturing Corporation”.[15]
In 2012 Sharp unveiled the largest production TV at the time, with a screen size of 80 inches. It is part of the Aquos range and went on sale in Japan at around JP¥950,000.[16]
2012 was the 100th anniversary for Sharp but it announced the worst financial record in its history, with a loss of JP¥376 billion (US$4.7 billion) in April 2012. In September, Sharp announced job cuts.[17] In 2014, Sharp was able to stem losses and deliver a positive net income for its first quarter results.[18]
In March 2012 the Taiwan-based electronics company Hon Hai, trading as Foxconn, agreed to acquire a 10% stake in Sharp Corporation for US$806 million, and to purchase up to 50 percent of the LCD displays produced at Sharp’s plant in Sakai, Japan.[19] In June 2012, Hon Hai chairman Terry Gou paid money for Sakai plant and got 50% ownership of the plant. However, since the announcement in March, Sharp’s share price continued declining and reached JP¥192 on 3 August. Sharp deal’s price was originally JP¥550 per share. Both companies agreed to renegotiate the share price, but they never came to an agreement.[20]
Sharp announced it accepted a US$100 million investment from Samsung in March 2013.[21]
In 2013 Sharp developed the most efficient solar cell, converting a record 44.4% of sunlight into electricity.[22]
After years of huge losses in its overseas TV business, Sharp sold its Mexico TV factory to Chinese electronics manufacturer Hisense for $23.7 million in July 2015. The sale includes rights to use the Sharp brand name and all its channel resources in North and South America, except Brazil. This meant that Sharp has exited the TV market in the Americas (except Brazil).[23] It was a sign showing Sharp's rapid decline in that market, where it once was one of the leading manufacturers for LCD TVs a decade earlier.[24] Sharp's television market share in North America was 4.6% in 2015.[25] However Sharp remains the biggest television brand in the Japanese market.[5]
In October 2015 Sharp announced a smartphone that also works as a robot, called RoboHon. It will be sold in 2016 in Japan.[26]
Sharp began selling the world’s first commercially available TV with a 8K resolution in October 2015.[citation needed] The 85-inch LV-85001 model costs JP¥16 million (US$133,000). Japanese public broadcaster NHK will have test broadcasts at 8K starting 2016, with regular services expected by the time of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.[27][28]
On 25 February 2016, Foxconn announced its intent to acquire a 66% controlling stake in Sharp for 700 billion yen (US$6.24 billion).[29] However, the deal was briefly delayed due to unforeseen financial liabilities; on 30 March 2016, Foxconn announced that it had agreed to pay US$3.5 billion for the stake instead, Foxconn wished to use the purchase to expand into direct-to-consumer product sales rather than serving as a contracted manufacturer.[30]
On 28 April 2017, Sharp turned its first operating profit in three years, citing the restructuring efforts by Foxconn..[31]
In June 2017, Sharp sued its American licensee Hisense for damaging the reputation of its brand, seeking an exit from its licensing agreement. Sharp accused the company of producing "shoddily manufactured" televisions under the Sharp name, including products they believed were in violation of U.S. safety standards for electromagnetic radiation, and the subject of deceptive advertising over their quality. Hisense denied that it engaged in these practices, and stated that it planned to defend itself in court and "will continue to manufacture and sell quality televisions under the Sharp licensed brands."[32][33]

It operates from 64 bases in 30 countries and its products are distributed in 164 countries worldwide. Many of its regional subsidiaries trade under the name “Sharp Electronics”.
Sharp was among the Top 100 R&D Spenders in a list published by the IEEE Spectrum magazine in 2002.
In September 2014, Sharp announced that Slovakian electronics company UMC was acquiring an exclusive brand licence from Sharp and its European television and audio business UMC will also acquire Sharp’s Polish factory. As part of the deal, Sharp will support the design and development of televisions sold by UMC under the Sharp brand[40]
The same month, Sharp also announced a tie-up with Vestel in Europe for white goods. Vestel will sell Sharp-branded white goods (except air conditioners), such as refrigerators and microwave ovens manufactured by Sharp in Thailand and China. Sharp will also license its brand name to Vestel for volume home appliances such as refrigerators, washing machines and ovens. Sharp’s remaining European business will then focus on the business-to-business sector including multi-function printers and energy solutions.
Sharp's headquarters are at 1 Takumi-chō, Sakai-ku, Sakai, Japan. Until the relocation to Sakai in 2016, the headquarters were in Abeno-ku, Osaka where Hayakawa restarted the business in 1920s.[41]

Antitrust law violations[edit]
US[edit]
On 8 November 2008, Department of Justice announced that Sharp agreed to pay US$120 million as criminal fine. According to the announcement, Sharp participated in the conspiracies to fix the price of TFT LCD panel for Dell’s computer monitors and laptops (2001 - 2005), Motorola’s Razr phones (2005 - 2006) and Apple’s iPod (2005 -2006).[42]
On 18 December 2008, Japan Fair Trade Commission ordered Sharp to pay JP¥261 million (US$3 million) as criminal fine. According to the order, Sharp and Hitachi Display participated in the conspiracies to keep the price for TFT LCD panels for Nintendo DS and DS-Lite. Fine for Hitachi Displays was waived by JFTC leniency program.[43]
However, Sharp disagreed with the JFTC order and announced to begin appeal procedure against it on 2 February 2009.[44] On 31 July 2013, JFTC dismissed Sharp’s appeal.[45]
Environmental record[edit]




Sharp’s booth at CES 2012 in Los Angeles, CA


In November 2011 Sharp was ranked in 11th place by Greenpeace’s re-launched Guide to Greener Electronics that ranks 15 electronics manufacturers according to their policies and practices to reduce their impact on the climate, produce greener products, and make their operations more sustainable. Greenpeace summarizes the corporation’s environmental record thus: “Sharp supports a new renewable energy law in Japan but scores poor on all sustainable operations criteria.”[46]
Sharp scored 3/10 and received most of its points on the Products criteria where the company was praised for the energy efficiency of its products with all of its TVs meeting the latest Energy Star standard. It also gained some points for having a relative long term target to reduce CO2 emissions by two percent (per production unit) compared to the previous year, yet sets out no clear target for absolute reductions. The company was also praised for its public support for a clean energy policy, after advocating the Japanese Government to increase the use of renewable energy.[46]
Sharp scored least points in the guide in the Sustainable Operations category, scoring no points for chemical management due to not communicating commitments made on phasing out hazardous substances in its supply chain. The guide also notes that Sharp have lacked any initiative to address the issue of conflict minerals and the exclusion of paper sourced from suppliers involved in illegal logging or deforestation.[46]
Sponsorships[edit]
Sharp was the principal sponsor of Manchester United Football Club from 1983 until 2000, in one of the lengthiest and most lucrative sponsorship deals in English football.[47][48] Sharp's logo was on the front of United's shirts over these 17 years, during which the team won seven Premier League titles, five FA Cups, one Football League Cup, one UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and one UEFA Champions League title.
In June 2012, Sharp became name sponsor of a UCI World Tour cycling team, which thereupon became known as Garmin-Sharp.

Sharp Corporation (シャープ株式会社, Shāpu Kabushiki-gaisha) is a Japanese multinational corporation that designs and manufactures electronic products, headquartered in Sakai-ku, Sakai. Since 2016 it has been an integral part of Taiwan-based Foxconn Group. Sharp employs more than 50,000 people worldwide. The company was founded in September 1912 in Tokyo and takes its name from one of its founder’s first inventions, the Ever-Sharp mechanical pencil, which was invented by Tokuji Hayakawa in 1915.
As of 2013, Sharp Corporation is the tenth-largest, by market share, television manufacturer in the world.[4] In Japan it has been a long-time leader.[5] Sharp has at times also been the most popular mobile phone brand in the Japanese market, but is currently third biggest.[6][7]

History[edit]




Sharp portable TV






Sharp MD-MS701H






Sharp’s former headquarters complex in Abeno-ku, Osaka


In 1912, Tokuji Hayakawa founded a metal workshop in Tokyo. The first of his many inventions was a snap buckle named ‘Tokubijo’. Another of his inventions was the Ever-Sharp mechanical pencil in 1915, from which the Sharp Corporation derived its name.[8] After the pencil business was destroyed by the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, the company relocated to Osaka and began designing the first generation of Japanese radio sets. These went on sale in 1925. In 1953, Sharp started producing TV sets.
In 1964, Sharp developed the world’s first transistor calculator, which was priced at JP¥535,000 (US$1,400). It took Sharp several years to develop the product as they had no experience in making computing devices at the time. Two years later, in 1966, Sharp introduced its first IC calculator using 145 Mitsubishi-made bipolar ICs, priced at JP¥350,000 (about US$1000). Its first LSI calculator was introduced in 1969. This was the first pocketable calculator priced at less than JP¥100,000 (less than US$300), and turned out to be a popular item.[9]
The company produced the first LCD calculator in 1973. Sharp had a working relationship with Nintendo during the 1980s, and was granted licensing rights for the manufacture and development of the C1 NES TV (1983, later released in North America as the Sharp Nintendo Television), the Twin Famicom (1986), the Sharp Famicom Titler (1989), and the SF-1 SNES TV (1990). All of these units are considered collectors items on the secondary market. One of the company’s main inventors of LCD calculators was Tadashi Sasaki.[10]
The company ventured into the high end stereo market in 1976 with the introduction of high end receivers, amplifiers, speakers, turntables and cassette players. The Optonica line as it was called, consisted of high quality and technically advanced components, that was expanded in 1979, to cover a broader selection of high end equipment. During this run, Sharp introduced digital technology to some of the Optonica products, along with the traditional analogue products, and offered a complete selection of models ranging from low power high end receivers to very powerful models. The line was again changed, in 1981, and moved mainly into digital high end, complete stereo systems with advanced technological features setting the trend towards the digital age. The line was discontinued after 1981, but the Optonica line was again re-introduced in the late 1980s for a high end line of television receivers and higher quality mass market audio products such as VCR's, surround sound receivers, CD cassette boom boxes, and portable cassette players.
Sharp’s Mobile Communications Division created the world’s first commercial camera phone, the J-SH04, in Japan in 2000.
Since 2000, Sharp has heavily invested in LCD panel manufacturing plants: Kameyama in 2004, Sakai in 2009. The Sakai plant is still the only 10th generation LCD manufacturing plant on the globe and best fit for production of 60 inch or larger panels. However, the 2008 financial crisis and strong Yen (especially against Won) significantly lowered world demand for Japanese LCD panels. Furthermore, the switch to digital TV broadcasting was virtually completed in Japan by the middle of 2011. Via Japanese government issued coupons for digital TV sets, consumers were encouraged to purchase digital TV sets until March 2011. This hit the Japanese LCD TV market, reducing it almost by half from 2010. All of those events strongly hit Sharp's LCD business. As the result, the Sakai LCD plant suffered a reduced operating rate until Q3 2012.
In June 2005 Sharp produced the largest LCD television at the time, with a display of 65 inches. It went on sale in August 2005 in Japan.[11]
From 2005 to 2010 Sharp was the biggest mobile phone brand in Japan. Since then it has been constantly switching places through financial quarters against rivals Fujitsu, Apple and Sony.
Sharp acquired a controlling stake in Pioneer Corporation in 2007.
At CES 2007, Sharp introduced a prototype largest LCD TV, with a screen size of 108 inches.[12] In July 2008 Sharp announced that the model will go into production for the Japanese market.[13]
In 2008, Sharp collaborated with Emblaze Mobile on the Monolith, “…an ambitious project to design the ultimate holistic mobile device”.[14] The project was never brought to market. Key software developers were later picked up by other companies.
On 25 June 2009, Sharp and Pioneer agreed to form a joint venture comprising their optical businesses, called “Pioneer Digital Design and Manufacturing Corporation”.[15]
In 2012 Sharp unveiled the largest production TV at the time, with a screen size of 80 inches. It is part of the Aquos range and went on sale in Japan at around JP¥950,000.[16]
2012 was the 100th anniversary for Sharp but it announced the worst financial record in its history, with a loss of JP¥376 billion (US$4.7 billion) in April 2012. In September, Sharp announced job cuts.[17] In 2014, Sharp was able to stem losses and deliver a positive net income for its first quarter results.[18]
In March 2012 the Taiwan-based electronics company Hon Hai, trading as Foxconn, agreed to acquire a 10% stake in Sharp Corporation for US$806 million, and to purchase up to 50 percent of the LCD displays produced at Sharp’s plant in Sakai, Japan.[19] In June 2012, Hon Hai chairman Terry Gou paid money for Sakai plant and got 50% ownership of the plant. However, since the announcement in March, Sharp’s share price continued declining and reached JP¥192 on 3 August. Sharp deal’s price was originally JP¥550 per share. Both companies agreed to renegotiate the share price, but they never came to an agreement.[20]
Sharp announced it accepted a US$100 million investment from Samsung in March 2013.[21]
In 2013 Sharp developed the most efficient solar cell, converting a record 44.4% of sunlight into electricity.[22]
After years of huge losses in its overseas TV business, Sharp sold its Mexico TV factory to Chinese electronics manufacturer Hisense for $23.7 million in July 2015. The sale includes rights to use the Sharp brand name and all its channel resources in North and South America, except Brazil. This meant that Sharp has exited the TV market in the Americas (except Brazil).[23] It was a sign showing Sharp's rapid decline in that market, where it once was one of the leading manufacturers for LCD TVs a decade earlier.[24] Sharp's television market share in North America was 4.6% in 2015.[25] However Sharp remains the biggest television brand in the Japanese market.[5]
In October 2015 Sharp announced a smartphone that also works as a robot, called RoboHon. It will be sold in 2016 in Japan.[26]
Sharp began selling the world’s first commercially available TV with a 8K resolution in October 2015.[citation needed] The 85-inch LV-85001 model costs JP¥16 million (US$133,000). Japanese public broadcaster NHK will have test broadcasts at 8K starting 2016, with regular services expected by the time of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.[27][28]
On 25 February 2016, Foxconn announced its intent to acquire a 66% controlling stake in Sharp for 700 billion yen (US$6.24 billion).[29] However, the deal was briefly delayed due to unforeseen financial liabilities; on 30 March 2016, Foxconn announced that it had agreed to pay US$3.5 billion for the stake instead, Foxconn wished to use the purchase to expand into direct-to-consumer product sales rather than serving as a contracted manufacturer.[30]
On 28 April 2017, Sharp turned its first operating profit in three years, citing the restructuring efforts by Foxconn..[31]
In June 2017, Sharp sued its American licensee Hisense for damaging the reputation of its brand, seeking an exit from its licensing agreement. Sharp accused the company of producing "shoddily manufactured" televisions under the Sharp name, including products they believed were in violation of U.S. safety standards for electromagnetic radiation, and the subject of deceptive advertising over their quality. Hisense denied that it engaged in these practices, and stated that it planned to defend itself in court and "will continue to manufacture and sell quality televisions under the Sharp licensed brands."[32][33]

The Sharp factory in Kameyama, Mie, Japan.






The Sharp factory in Taki, Mie, Japan.


Net sales for the year 2003 were $16.8 billion. The Corporation employs 46,600 staff, of which around half live outside Japan. It operates from 64 bases in 30 countries and its products are distributed in 164 countries worldwide. Many of its regional subsidiaries trade under the name “Sharp Electronics”.
Sharp was among the Top 100 R&D Spenders in a list published by the IEEE Spectrum magazine in 2002.
In September 2014, Sharp announced that Slovakian electronics company UMC was acquiring an exclusive brand licence from Sharp and its European television and audio business UMC will also acquire Sharp’s Polish factory. As part of the deal, Sharp will support the design and development of televisions sold by UMC under the Sharp brand[40]
The same month, Sharp also announced a tie-up with Vestel in Europe for white goods. Vestel will sell Sharp-branded white goods (except air conditioners), such as refrigerators and microwave ovens manufactured by Sharp in Thailand and China. Sharp will also license its brand name to Vestel for volume home appliances such as refrigerators, washing machines and ovens. Sharp’s remaining European business will then focus on the business-to-business sector including multi-function printers and energy solutions.
Sharp's headquarters are at 1 Takumi-chō, Sakai-ku, Sakai, Japan. Until the relocation to Sakai in 2016, the headquarters were in Abeno-ku, Osaka where Hayakawa restarted the business in 1920s.[41]

Antitrust law violations[edit]
US[edit]
On 8 November 2008, Department of Justice announced that Sharp agreed to pay US$120 million as criminal fine. According to the announcement, Sharp participated in the conspiracies to fix the price of TFT LCD panel for Dell’s computer monitors and laptops (2001 - 2005), Motorola’s Razr phones (2005 - 2006) and Apple’s iPod (2005 -2006).[42]
On 18 December 2008, Japan Fair Trade Commission ordered Sharp to pay JP¥261 million (US$3 million) as criminal fine. According to the order, Sharp and Hitachi Display participated in the conspiracies to keep the price for TFT LCD panels for Nintendo DS and DS-Lite. Fine for Hitachi Displays was waived by JFTC leniency program.[43]
However, Sharp disagreed with the JFTC order and announced to begin appeal procedure against it on 2 February 2009.[44] On 31 July 2013, JFTC dismissed Sharp’s appeal.[45]
Environmental record[edit]




Sharp’s booth at CES 2012 in Los Angeles, CA


In November 2011 Sharp was ranked in 11th place by Greenpeace’s re-launched Guide to Greener Electronics that ranks 15 electronics manufacturers according to their policies and practices to reduce their impact on the climate, produce greener products, and make their operations more sustainable. Greenpeace summarizes the corporation’s environmental record thus: “Sharp supports a new renewable energy law in Japan but scores poor on all sustainable operations criteria.”[46]
Sharp scored 3/10 and received most of its points on the Products criteria where the company was praised for the energy efficiency of its products with all of its TVs meeting the latest Energy Star standard. It also gained some points for having a relative long term target to reduce CO2 emissions by two percent (per production unit) compared to the previous year, yet sets out no clear target for absolute reductions. The company was also praised for its public support for a clean energy policy, after advocating the Japanese Government to increase the use of renewable energy.[46]
Sharp scored least points in the guide in the Sustainable Operations category, scoring no points for chemical management due to not communicating commitments made on phasing out hazardous substances in its supply chain. The guide also notes that Sharp have lacked any initiative to address the issue of conflict minerals and the exclusion of paper sourced from suppliers involved in illegal logging or deforestation.[46]
Sponsorships[edit]
Sharp was the principal sponsor of Manchester United Football Club from 1983 until 2000, in one of the lengthiest and most lucrative sponsorship deals in English football.[47][48] Sharp's logo was on the front of United's shirts over these 17 years, during which the team won seven Premier League titles, five FA Cups, one Football League Cup, one UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and one UEFA Champions League title.
In June 2012, Sharp became name sponsor of a UCI World Tour cycling team, which thereupon became known as Garmin-Sharp.

						Microwave Ovens for Your Kitchen
					





				
				 A microwave is an essential appliance in the modern kitchen. From handy countertop microwaves to convenient over-the-range models, there’s a style for every space. Types of Microwave Ovens Microwave ovens range from basic models that heat dinner quickly to stylish stainless steel microwaves that offer multiple cooking settings. Countertop microwaves can rest on any surface in your kitchen, offering basic settings such as heat, defrost and keep warm. They’re budget-friendly, and also offer a wide variety of capacity and power range options. Over-the-range microwaves are installed above your cooktop and function just like countertop microwaves. They can also eliminate smoke, steam and cooking odors through built-in ventilation systems. Built-in microwaves can be installed into a wall or cabinet for more convenient operation. This allows every member of the household to access it regardless of mobility or reach. Microwave Benefits Microwave ovens now come equipped with a full range of capabilities you may not have even considered. Automatic defrost is a setting that can detect the optimum power level and cook time for your food. Sensor cooking assesses the moisture levels in food as it cooks to adjust power levels and remaining cook time for even heating. Better still, some microwave ovens have child lock settings, ensuring younger kids don’t try to grab hot plates or heat unsafe items. To learn more about the different microwaves available, check out our microwaves buying guide.
