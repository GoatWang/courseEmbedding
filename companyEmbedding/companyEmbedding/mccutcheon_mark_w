Delicious McCutcheon’s Recipes
Bringing the family together one meal at a time. 


Fig, Mustard, and Champagne Vinaigrette Roast Chicken
This roast chicken is by far one of the more shocking, but surprisingly rewarding, combinations I have ventured to try.only  

Apricot-Mustard Pork Tenderloin
Pork and apricot? Could the combination work. I was assured it did work, and work very well. So, I took the dive and tried Apricot Preserves.only  

Apricot Sauce Grilled Chicken Sandwiches
They are savory, hearty, and a great way to close a busy day without investing a ton of effort. And let me tell you, these are delicious, and easy, and I promise that they will become a family favorite.only  

Fig and Goat Cheese Grilled Sandwiches
My personal favorite of the three is the fig. It is sweet with just a touch of cinnamon. And with the crunch of the seeds it is just irresistible.only  

Eggplant Parmesan
This recipe came from one of those familiar faces that wandered into our shop. only  

Pretzel Mustard Chicken
Healthier than deep fried, tastier than the old classic oven-fried chicken, this recipe is quick, easy, and delicious!only
