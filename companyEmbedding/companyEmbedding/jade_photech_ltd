Jade Photech Announce Joint Venture with LINDAR to Deliver New 3D Optical Material for Lithographic and Flexographic Printing
Sep 30 16
Jade Photech and LINDAR announced a joint venture with a new, specifically designed extrusion line for Optica material as its focus. Operating under the brand name Optica, the joint venture produces micro-optical material in a way not previously available. The process sets the standard to which all other lenticular material will be compared. Optica combines the resources and expertise of Jade Photech's 3D technology using its new, proprietary micro-optical material solutions in tandem with LINDAR's advanced, plastics-manufacturing knowledge in the industries of paint products, food packaging, and original equipment manufacturing (OEM) parts. The result is consistent micro-optical material and the most sustainable lenticular material produced. The design and building of the multi-million-dollar machine was completed through a collaboration of Jade Photech and SML, which is a builder of precision manufacturing equipment located in Lenzing, Austria. The machine is located at LINDAR's Baxter facility and is ready for production. It delivers the greenest (recycled) plastic to comply with eco-friendly initiatives for a variety of 3D applications allowing multiple messages or motion on one single label or panel. Applications include packaging, point-of-purchase displays, 3D labels, counterfeit-proof ID cards for events, concert admissions, government use, and more. Once the lenses have been extruded, either into roll stock or sheets that are cut to size, the images are printed directly onto the OPTICA material. This causes the image to pop with 3D graphics, morphing graphics, flip graphics, and up to 24 frames of motion graphics being viewed through the lenticules The joint venture provides a complete package of lenticular printing services, which allows LINDAR and Jade Photech to complete the entire process in making a product that has been created with lenticular extrusion, including support for 3D graphics interlacing, prepress, and printing.

NORCROSS, Ga. and BAXTER, Minn., Sept. 30, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Jade Photech and LINDAR announce a joint venture with a new, specifically designed extrusion line for Optica material as its focus. Operating under the brand name Optica, the joint venture produces micro-optical material in a way not previously available. The process sets the standard to which all other lenticular material will be compared.

Optica combines the resources and expertise of Jade Photech's 3D technology using its new, proprietary micro-optical material solutions in tandem with LINDAR's advanced, plastics-manufacturing knowledge in the industries of paint products, food packaging, and original equipment manufacturing (OEM) parts. The result is consistent micro-optical material and the most sustainable lenticular material produced.
"Our team has taken on the process of developing the game-changing Optica material," said Tom Haglin, LINDAR president. "We are very excited to add lenticular extrusion to our manufacturing processes and to redefine the lenticular marketplace. Our partnership with Jade Photech has pushed our manufacturing goals."
The design and building of the multi-million-dollar machine was completed through a collaboration of Jade Photech and SML, which is a builder of precision manufacturing equipment located in Lenzing, Austria. The machine is located at LINDAR's Baxter facility and is ready for production. It delivers the greenest (recycled) plastic to comply with eco-friendly initiatives for a variety of 3D applications allowing multiple messages or motion on one single label or panel. Applications include packaging, point-of-purchase displays, 3D labels, counterfeit-proof ID cards for events, concert admissions, government use, and more.
"The unequaled consistency of our OPTICA material makes flexographic printing for 3D motion graphics available," said Dan Fosse, LINDAR director of sales. "This provides very high-resolution print quality and guaranteed consistency across the entire width of the plastic sheet—from 8 to 33 mil thickness. This is a game changer in the motion graphic market."
Once the lenses have been extruded, either into roll stock or sheets that are cut to size, the images are printed directly onto the OPTICA material. This causes the image to pop with 3D graphics, morphing graphics, flip graphics, and up to 24 frames of motion graphics being viewed through the lenticules.
"Jade Photech has taken a systems approach to producing more cost-effective and attractive 3D images," said Dr. Bill Karszes, Jade Photech CEO and the machine's lead designer. "We have designed and built a process to produce the most uniformly consistent micro optical material available in the market. Now our partnership with LINDAR has furthered our goals by utilizing their manufacturing expertise and experience. The material has been successfully printed and has proven to be cost effective."
"Often in production, volume impacts quality, and vice versa," said Bruce Hinkel, Jade Photech president. "But we can consistently deliver both for a variety of different industries using our breakthrough 3D technology with the new machine. We believe the joint venture with LINDAR is a good starting point."
The new 3D images are a result of Jade Photech's arrangement with its affiliated company Photon3D Ltd. of Hong Kong, using its 3D operating system and platform for both 3D digital and print applications.
"Our new technology allows us to deliver superior 3D images that match the human visual system without the need for 3D glasses," said Dr. Jerry Nims, Photon3D chairman. 
The joint venture provides a complete package of lenticular printing services, which allows LINDAR and Jade Photech to complete the entire process in making a product that has been created with lenticular extrusion, including support for 3D graphics interlacing, prepress, and printing.

Jade Photech and LINDAR Announce Joint Venture With New State of the Art Machinery Delivering New 3D Optical Material for Lithographic and Flexographic Printing.






Sep 30, 2016, 2:35pm EDT














NORCROSS, Ga. and BAXTER, Minn., Sept. 30, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Jade Photech and LINDAR announce a joint venture with a new, specifically designed extrusion line for Optica material as its focus. Operating under the brand name Optica, the joint venture produces micro-optical material in a way not previously available. The process sets the standard to which all other lenticular material will be compared.

Optica combines the resources and expertise of Jade Photech's 3D technology using its new, proprietary micro-optical material solutions in tandem with LINDAR's advanced, plastics-manufacturing knowledge in the industries of paint products, food packaging, and original equipment manufacturing (OEM) parts. The result is consistent micro-optical material and the most sustainable lenticular material produced.
"Our team has taken on the process of developing the game-changing Optica material," said Tom Haglin, LINDAR president. "We are very excited to add lenticular extrusion to our manufacturing processes and to redefine the lenticular marketplace. Our partnership with Jade Photech has pushed our manufacturing goals."
The design and building of the multi-million-dollar machine was completed through a collaboration of Jade Photech and SML, which is a builder of precision manufacturing equipment located in Lenzing, Austria. The machine is located at LINDAR's Baxter facility and is ready for production. It delivers the greenest (recycled) plastic to comply with eco-friendly initiatives for a variety of 3D applications allowing multiple messages or motion on one single label or panel. Applications include packaging, point-of-purchase displays, 3D labels, counterfeit-proof ID cards for events, concert admissions, government use, and more.
"The unequaled consistency of our OPTICA material makes flexographic printing for 3D motion graphics available," said Dan Fosse, LINDAR director of sales. "This provides very high-resolution print quality and guaranteed consistency across the entire width of the plastic sheet—from 8 to 33 mil thickness. This is a game changer in the motion graphic market."
Once the lenses have been extruded, either into roll stock or sheets that are cut to size, the images are printed directly onto the OPTICA material. This causes the image to pop with 3D graphics, morphing graphics, flip graphics, and up to 24 frames of motion graphics being viewed through the lenticules.
"Jade Photech has taken a systems approach to producing more cost-effective and attractive 3D images," said Dr. Bill Karszes, Jade Photech CEO and the machine's lead designer. "We have designed and built a process to produce the most uniformly consistent micro optical material available in the market. Now our partnership with LINDAR has furthered our goals by utilizing their manufacturing expertise and experience. The material has been successfully printed and has proven to be cost effective."
"Often in production, volume impacts quality, and vice versa," said Bruce Hinkel, Jade Photech president. "But we can consistently deliver both for a variety of different industries using our breakthrough 3D technology with the new machine. We believe the joint venture with LINDAR is a good starting point."
The new 3D images are a result of Jade Photech's arrangement with its affiliated company Photon3D Ltd. of Hong Kong, using its 3D operating system and platform for both 3D digital and print applications.
"Our new technology allows us to deliver superior 3D images that match the human visual system without the need for 3D glasses," said Dr. Jerry Nims, Photon3D chairman. 
The joint venture provides a complete package of lenticular printing services, which allows LINDAR and Jade Photech to complete the entire process in making a product that has been created with lenticular extrusion, including support for 3D graphics interlacing, prepress, and printing.

		About Us

History
Jade Photech’s technical team is led by Jerry Nims, LL.D. and Bill Karszes, Ph.D. Nims and Karszes developed/patented the 3D depth of field and control of the parallax, which was the basis for analog 3D images without glasses in 1980 - 2005.
This photographic system was named as “one of the ten outstanding engineering achievements in the United States” in 1983 by the National Society of Professional Engineers. The system delivered millions of 3D amateur, professional and portrait prints using specially designed 3D analog cameras during the 80's and 90's. In medicine, 3D transparencies used to diagnose glaucoma were delivered weekly to ophthalmologists and hospitals.
New Scientific Approach and Applications
Jade Photech uses its sister company Photon3D’s new P3D operating system / platform to produce digital 3D images for printing. The new P3D operating system / platform controls the position and path of light from the original object to the human visual system resulting in focused 3D motion graphics with no glasses required. Print applications include lithographic, flexographic, direct digital and large format printing presses, including software/algorithms to deliver optically tuned 3D/Motion images that are part of this new technology.
New Optica Lens Material
On the materials side, new lens engraving cylinders were designed and cut in the U.S. The new Optica lens material has many optical Microcells™ that control the Photons. These lens designs, backed with extensive research, result in a unique 3D/Motion lens system featuring Microcell™ technology that offers the printer consistent optical profiles from batch to batch. No glasses required. Visit Optica3d.com for more information.
Supporting Green Manufacturing
A new petroleum based process was developed for “green” plastic manufacturing that features a high level of sustainability. This new high precision lens manufacturing machine has been built by our European partner. The machinery is designed to run 24/7, set new cost standards and deliver the “greenest” plastic lens material globally.
Jade Photech Partners
LINDAR
Jade Photech entered into a joint venture with LINDAR (www.lindarcorp.com).  LINDAR has been in the thermoforming plastics business since 1993 with Toro, Sherwin Williams and Wal-Mart among their customers.
Jade Photech has supplied to LINDAR state of the art plastics manufacturing equipment delivering world class sustainability metrics for our Optica lens material. The raw material is produced using the lowest carbon footprint currently available. The custom machine design, built by our European partner, is capable of up to 80% post industrial regrind allowing the greenest plastic on the market for 2D & 3D graphics applications.
