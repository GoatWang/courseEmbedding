Surface Preparation


     Surfaces must  be sound, dry and clean. Remove previous  
			coatings that have poor adhesion. Wash areas where  mold and mildew are present. Remove all dirt, oil,  grease, 
			wax and/or other contaminant.  Repair cracks and fill voids. De-gloss  shiny surfaces by lightly sanding. Clean and prime 
			all bare metal  surfaces with an appropriate  primer. Test for adhesion and compatibility with existing finishes.



Disposal


Never pour leftover coating 
      down any sink or drainuse up material on the job or seal can and store safely for future use. Do 
			not incinerate closed containers. For  specific disposal guidelines or recycling  opportunities for leftover product and packaging, contact 
			your local waste management agency or district.  Always attempt to recycle whenever possible.

Splendid Is The View! A spacious Lake Gage home on the northeast side of the lake. The sandy beach is exceptional! This year round home has 4 bedrooms and 2 full bathrooms. The kitchen has a built in breakfast table. All kitchen appliances plus the washer and dryer are included. A freestanding wood burning stove heats up a chilly night. From the living room there are french doors to a den, french doors to the lakeside sun-room and french doors to the enclosed porch. There is a main level master bedroom with walk-in closet. Upstairs you'll find three large bedrooms and a full bathroom with double vanities. The basement has a large storage room and a utility room. Two super sized detached garages allows plenty of storage for water toys and a workshop. There are poles and hardware for the dock in the garage and the dock top needs some TLC.

                    We are so lucky to have Pokagon State Park here in Angola, Indiana at the edge of Fremont, Indiana. The park is amazing with beautiful hiking trails, horses, the ever famous toboggan slides, beaches, camping.  There is also a beautiful Inn and various cabins to rent.  The park was originally called Lake James State Park, but they changed the name in 1925 to Pokagon State Park to honor the rich native American heritage of the state and the region.  From the Indiana State website it adds, "Leopold and Simon Pokagon were father and son and the last two most notable leaders of the Potawatomi. The park's Potawatomi Inn takes its name from these Native Americans, who made their home in the area. The inn, with its up-north fishing-lodge theme, is one of the Midwest's most popular resorts and conference centers." 

Come and enjoy the natural beauty. I promise you will be absolutely delighted with all it has to offer.
