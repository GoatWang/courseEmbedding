 Arbutus Biopharma Corporation is a publicly-traded (NASDAQ: ABUS) biopharmaceutical company dedicated to discovering, developing and commercializing a cure for patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B infection, a disease of the liver caused by hepatitis B virus (HBV). We believe that Arbutus' comprehensive HBV pipeline of drugs and drug candidates optimally positions us to transform the HBV treatment landscape and to capitalize on the HBV global market opportunity. We are developing a portfolio of drug candidates with multiple mechanisms of action that we believe will result in a combination therapy to cure HBV.
 
In addition to our HBV pipeline, we are actively licensing our Lipid Nanoparticle (LNP) technology to our industry partners. Our LNP technology represents a proven delivery technology in RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutic development, which has enabled several clinical trials and has been administered to hundreds of human subjects. We continue to explore opportunities to generate value from our LNP platform technology, which is well suited to deliver therapies based on RNAi, mRNA, and gene editing constructs. We see significant value in the collaborations Arbutus has established to date, and will continue to work closely with, and support, our partners using our LNP technology.
 
Our management team has significant experience in discovering and developing drug candidates targeting infectious liver diseases, including HCV. We are applying to our HBV programs, the same innovative thinking that members of our management team have successfully applied to developing a cure for HCV. We are dedicated to discovering, developing and commercializing a cure for patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B infection, and to maximizing the value of our LNP technology.

Arbutus Biopharma Corporation is a publicly traded (NASDAQ: ABUS) biopharmaceutical company with an expertise in liposomal drug delivery and RNA interference, and is developing drugs for hepatitis B infection. It is headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia and has research facilities in Warminster, Pennsylvania.[1] The company was formerly known as Tekmira, which was spun out of Inex Pharmaceuticals in 2007.
History[edit]
Tekmira, as the company was formerly called, was formed as a wholly owned subsidiary of Inex Pharmaceuticals in 2005 after that company began collapsing after its regulatory and partnering strategy failed in 2004.[2][3][4] Tekmira was fully spun out in 2007 and Tekmira absorbed the assets of Inex, which had been founded in 1992.[4][5][6]
Inex had been developing liposomal formulations of off-patent cancer drugs, and licensed them to Talon Pharmaceuticals in 2005; Talon was acquired by Spectrum Pharmaceuticals in 2013, and three former Inex/Tekmira products reached the market and began generating royalties for Tekmira: Marqibo (liposomal vincristine), Alocrest (liposomal vinorelbine) and Brakiva (liposomal topotecan).[7]
Inex had also acquired licenses to intellectual property, as well as staff and manufacturing facilities, concerning RNAi technology from Lynx Therapeutics in 1998;[3]:10[8] this set of technologies became the focus for Tekmira and it initially sought to develop liposomally encapsulated RNAi drugs for a broad range of indications.[4]
Tekmira also worked on providing liposomal delivery technology to other companies. In 2007 it signed a license agreement with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals so that Alynylam could use it to deliver its own RNAi drugs; that deal was expanded into a manufacturing agreement in 2009.[9]
Most of those products not focused on viral diseases faltered,[10] and Tekmira had only $6.3 million in cash when it filed suit against Alnylam in 2011 for breaching its contract and stealing trade secrets.[9] The suit was settled in 2012, with Alylylam agreeing to pay Tekmira $65 million in termination fees, and the companies negotiated a new license agreement with lower milestones and royalties, which covers Alynylam's product patisiran.[9][11]
Tekmira caught the world's attention and its stock rose dramatically during the 2013 West African Ebola virus epidemic due to its drug candidate for Ebola fever, TKM-Ebola.[10] Tekmira was developing it under a $140 million US Department of Defense contract.[12] While its stock was trading high in January 2015, it acquired OnCore BioPharma, a company focused on hepatitis B.[13][14]
Development of TKM-Ebola was terminated in mid June 2015 during a Phase II trial, for lack of efficacy.[15][16]
The next month, Tekmira changed its name to Arbutus Biopharma and said that it would focus on drugs to treat hepatitis B.[10][17]
In March 2017 Arbitus signed another license for its liposome delivery technology, this time with Alexion Pharmaceuticals, for delivery of an mRNA drug candidates.[11]

Risk-Adjusted Net Present Value For Arbutus Biopharma - Arbutus Biopharma Corp (NASDAQ:ABUS) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Risk-Adjusted Net Present Value For Arbutus BiopharmaJul.19.17 | About: Arbutus Biopharma (ABUS) Oscar Carrascosa Long/short equity, value, special situations, momentumLinkedIn ProfileSummaryrNPV is a method that materializes the value of a Biopharma when it lies in its R&D projects.Summing up the rNPV and cash, ABUS is undervalued.The stock is highly volatile and still far from a stable investing perspective.About The rNPV Model The value of a biotech can be laid on two main factors: current marketed products and its pipeline. The former can be easily measured in terms of cash generation capacity and valuated using simple ratios, such as EV-to-EBITDA ratios or market cap over annual peak sales. For the latter, you only need market projections, that may be made following a bottom-up approach (treatable population x estimated market penetration x annual cost per patient) or top down (total current market x estimated market penetration). But what happens when there are no drugs currently sold in the market and all company’s value (if any) is obtained from its R&D assets? We need a model to assess clinical-trial-stage projects that considers not only the projected market, but also success rates of clinical trials, cost and time to market, among others. But, why is this method superior than a traditional discounted cash flow? Because picking a discount rate when the risk drivers are not correctly identified makes it unreliable. Introducing clinical-trial success rates as a pay-off probability incorporates the main risk driver, which enhances the valuation. For further explanation of this methodology, Biotech Valuations for the 21st Century and Putting a price to biotechnology from Jeffrey J. Stewart is encouraged. In this article, I will be introducing and explaining the four general parameters that must be known to value clinical stage biotech stocks: clinical success rates, projected costs, projected market and discount rate applying them to the concrete case of Arbutus Biopharma Corp. Quick Overview Of Arbutus Biopharma Corp. And Its Pipeline ABUS is dedicated to discover, develop and commercialize a cure for patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B infection globally. For achieving that, it is developing a pipeline of drugs, licensing its LNP technology and creating partnerships.
 The company is using multiple HBV-specific technologies to cure the HB and targeting three pillars: uncontrolled HBV replication within the body, suppression of the host immune response and the inhibition of viral cccDNA formation and elimination of the stable reservoir of viral ccDNA. Its drug discovery and development plan is focused in RNA interference (RNAi), a mechanism that reduces the over-production of specific proteins. In order for RNAi drugs to be applicable in the body, they need to be delivered to the appropriate target cells. ABUS has developed a proprietary delivery platform called Lipid Nanoparticle or LNP, which is licensing to other companies. Partner Programs, Alliances, Licensing Agreements And Research Collaborations Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Alnylam, has a license to use LNP technology to develop and commercialize products. Arbutus is entitled to low-to-mid single-digit royalty based on sales performance. Top line data from the APOLLO clinical trial are expected in mid-2017. Assuming a positive outcome, new drug application (NDA) filing for this program and marketing authorization application (MAA) are expected by the end of 2017. Marqibo, from Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, is another partnered program that is giving ABUS mid single-digit royalty payments. Alexion Pharma signed an agreement in which it would pay $7.5 million upfront and payments of up to $75M for an achievement of development, as well as single-digit royalties for using LNP technology. 

 Nowadays, the main value of Arbutus biopharma lies in its pipeline (shown above). Moreover, its three main clinical agents: ARB-1467, ARB-1740 andAB-423. Arbutus has been suffering a termination in many of its partnered programs, as shown in its decline in revenue from $14M in 2012 to $1,4M in 2016.
 Pipeline ARB-1467 comprises three RNAi triggers that target all four HBV transcripts and has been shown in preclinical studies to reduce all viral antigen levels as well as ccDNA and HBV DNA. ARB-1467 is currently in Phase II. Management said that patients showed a consistent reduction in the hepatitis B surface antigen HBsAg. The multiple dose results from Cohort 2 showed a significant reduction in HBsAg. In both Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, an additive reduction in HBsAg was observed. In each dose after 3 monthly doses of 0.4mg/kg in Cohort 2 was greater than that seen at 0.2 mg/kg in Cohort 1, demonstrating a dose-response seen with repeat dosing. The company is planning a fourth dose cohort for the year. Phase II is expected to be finished by April 2018. ARB-1740 employs the same LNP formulation as ARB-1467 with a different set of three RNAi triggers that target all four HBV transcripts. The ARB-1740 Phase II multi-dosing study began dosing HBV patients early this year and data will be available in the second half of 2017. It was significantly more potent than ARB-1467 in preclinical studies and has the potential to be more effective at lower clinical doses than ARB-1467, suppressing multiple elements of HBV including HBsAg, HBeAg, DNA, core antigen, and all RNAs including the HBx transcript Management said in the earnings call that after the multi-dose study, they will be informed to choose between these two candidates for further clinical development. For the evidence shown, I am only including ARB-1740 in the model. As background, Arbutus titled an oral presentation “Exploring Combination Therapy for Curing HBV: Preclinical Studies with Capsid Inhibitor AB-423 and a siRNA Agent, ARB-1740.” Finally, AB-423 is a capsid inhibitor that blocks viral replication in the liver. AB-423 began a single and multiple- dose study in healthy volunteers with single ascending dose cohorts followed by multiple ascending dose cohorts in the first quarter of this year. It is expected to be included in studies with RNAi in 2018.
 As described in the last 10-Q, “our product pipeline, like our business, is focused on finding a cure for chronic HBV infection, with the objective of developing a combination of products that intervene at different points in the viral life cycle, and reactivating the host immune system. Initially, these combinations will include a single product from our pipeline combined with approved agents.” Therefore, in our model, we are assuming that only one final product is developed as a combination of AB-1740 and AB-423. Payoff Probabilities For the readers that are following the formula shown in any of the two reports mentioned above, is this: 

 Ci is the cash flow at time i, R0 is the current likelihood of reaching the final cash flow, Ri is the likelihood at time i of reaching the final cash flow, R0/R1 is the current likelihood (i.e., at time 0) of realizing the cash flow of time i, and WACC is the discount rate. When the author says, “clinical drug development should be regarded as a series of high-risk wagers where success in the first wager (e.g. a phase 1 trial) allows a company to make additional wagers (e.g. a phase 1 trial) allows a company to make additional wagers (e.g., phase 2 and 3 trials) before reaching the ultimate payoff,” it seems clear that each payoff of each trial should be preceded by the previous probability of success in the previous trial. Nonetheless, the author uses a fraction to describe that probability. Why is that? Because he is using compound probabilities: average success rates of reaching the market in every phase. Therefore, the probability of passing every trial with the numbers provided (assuming independence) is obtained through these equations:
 

 For example, if we are currently in Phase II, the likelihood of having a cash flow in Phase III is: 

 If it’s preferred to use probabilities of success in every phase instead of the numbers provided by Jeffrey J. Stewart, you can go to the data from Clinical Development Success Rates 2006-2015. The dataset includes probabilities classified by type of drugs. Other biologics, such as RNAi, have these probabilities: Phase I to Phase II, 66%; Phase II to Phase III, 34%; Phase III to BLA, 57%; BLA to Approval, 88%. Costs Jeffrey J. Stewart provides in his papers some inputs to deal with costs, such as supporting animal studies, number of clinical trial subjects, per subject cost and filing costs in the FDA. He argues that “the cost of drug development can be estimated using industry standards, and any deviations from these standards must be justified.” However, since ABUS is using its LNP technology, costs are not easily comparable. Therefore, the approach that I have followed selects from the total operating expenses the research, development, collaborations and contract expenses. They “consist primarily of clinical and pre-clinical trial expenses, personnel expenses, consulting and third party expenses, consumables and materials, as well as a portion of stock-based compensation and general overhead costs,” discarding the G&A, Depreciation, Acquisition costs, impairment of intangible assets and goodwill that I don’t think are incremental flows.
 I believe this data is stable, as the management says: “setting aside intangible asset and goodwill impairment charges in Q3 2015, Q2 2016, and Q4 2016 and acquisition costs in Q1 2015, there has been a steady underlying increase in our expenses for the past eight quarters.” Finally, I will interpolate a function using Excel for the periods remaining. I have assumed that ARB-1740 will finish Phase II this year, AB-423 in the first half of 2018, two and a half years of the recombined product, and filing with the FDA in 2022. Once the model gets the approval of the FDA, I will assume a 60% margin until the end of the patent (eight years after 2021).  

Projected Market  Since there is an unmet medical need for HBV, there are several companies focusing on delivering therapeutics for treating this disease. The company includes: Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Assembly Biosciences (NASDAQ:ASMB), Roche (OTCQX:RHHBY), Replicor, Spring Bank (NASDAQ:SBPH), Alnylam (NASDAQ:ALNY), Arrowhead (NASDAQ:ARWR), ContraVir (NASDAQ:CTRV), Dicerna (NASDAQ:DRNA), Intellia (NASDAQ:NTLA), Cocrystal (OTCQB:COCP), and Enanta (NASDAQ:ENTA). Here there is a complete list from Hepatitis B foundation The most advanced phase for all of them is Phase II, the same as Arbutus. In Phase II, and pointed out by the above list of Arbutus, we find: ContraVir, Replicor, Gilead, Roche and Spring Bank. Since we don’t have an extensive study available about safety, effectiveness, ease with which the products can be administered and so on and so forth, I will assume a 16% market penetration each. WHO estimates that in 2015 there were 257 million people living with chronic HBV infection. According to GBI Research, the market value for HBV will be 3.5 billion by 2021. Using our rough estimates, the slice corresponding to Arbutus would be 560 million.
 Chardan Capital Markets, in a note to clients in April 2017, estimated peak, risk-adjusted 2030 sales at $580 million because “no other HBV drug class has demonstrated 1-log HBsAg suppression across multiple assets,” while in July 2016 estimated $356 million due to “New clinical competition from Alnylam.” Peak Risk-adjusted sales are calculated by multiplying the market value times the final market share times the likelihood of having the drug marketed. Potential revenue numbers are usually provided by specialist biotech market intelligence companies, whose reports are not usually affordable for the individual investor. Even a company with resources that can access a high-quality information can suffer a great variability on its estimates (62% in the above numbers) given the changes in the competitive landscape. If we use $560 million and multiply by the pay-off probability 0.34%, we get 190.4 million, which are far below the previous analysis. Guessing that I don’t have the best information, I will use a middle range number, $468 million. Cost of Capital In “Putting a price to technology,” Jeffrey J. Stewart assesses that “we assume here that the discount rate is equivalent to the 20% internal rate of return generally expected by the primary sources of capital available to biotechnology companies—venture capitalists and large pharmaceuticals companies.” I am using this discount rate. If the readers are interested in a further explanation, I recommend reading this article. Complete Evaluation 




 

 The rNPV is somewhat above its current market cap ($213.25 MM). If we add its cash, short-term investments, restricted investments, and the royalty for a possible approval for Partisan, we get to a market cap of $401.09, representing a 59% potential return. Arbutus gross burn rate from the three months ending in 2016 vs. three months ending in 2017 has been 9.576 $/month. At March 31, 2017, the company had an aggregate of $123.0 million in cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted investments as compared to an aggregate of $143.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted investments at December 31, 2016 . After receiving the payment of 7.5 million from Alexion and progress from the existing LNP license orders from Alnylam and Alexion, it’s feasible that the company will extend its runway cash almost for a year and a half. The Downside Although from a risk-neutral perspective it seems to be a rational investment, we need to remember that the rNPV model relies on uncertainty and subjective assumptions. Thus, the procedure may become really arbitrary and consequently, lead to totally wrong valuations. Moreover, this is not the only possible valuation; there are many others, like real options. The ultimate success of Arbutus Biopharma depends on taking its pipeline into the market, rather than other licensing activities, and Arbutus has a bad track of failed assets (the company used to trade at $30). Finally, many of its competitors have much greater financial, technical and human resources than Arbutus has at every stage of the discovery, development, manufacture and commercialization process. Independently of the success of Arbutus, I hope that at least one of these companies should be able to market a product that could improve the life of these 257 million people living with HBV.

HBV Pipeline




Four HBV Product Candidates Advancing In Human Clinical Trials in 1H16

Three IND Filings in 2016 for Oral HBV Drug Candidates Targeting cccDNA, S-Antigen, and Core Protein

New Business Unit Established to Maximize Value of Tekmira's Non-HBV Assets

	VANCOUVER, British Columbia and DOYLESTOWN, Pa., July 20, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corporation (Nasdaq:TKMR) today announced plans to change its corporate name to Arbutus Biopharma Corporation ("Arbutus", ticker symbol "ABUS"), an industry-leading therapeutic solutions company focused on developing a cure for chronic hepatitis B virus infection (HBV), to be effective on or before August 3, 2015. The name change affirms the successful integration of OnCore BioPharma and Tekmira Pharmaceuticals into a combined company with the singular goal of delivering a cure for chronic HBV. The combined entity currently fields the largest portfolio of HBV product candidates in the industry and is led by an experienced and proven leadership team shown below with notable prior experience.


		Mark J. Murray, Ph.D., President and CEO; formerly of Protiva, Zymogentics, and Xcyte Therapeutics

		Patrick T. Higgins, Chief Business Officer; co-founder of OnCore BioPharma; formerly of Pharmasset and Roche

		Bruce Cousins, Chief Financial Officer; formerly of Aspreva and Johnson & Johnson

		Michael J. Sofia, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer; co-founder of OnCore BioPharma; formerly of Pharmasset (inventor of sofosbuvir for hepatitis C), Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Eli Lilly

		William T. Symonds, Pharm.D., Chief Development Officer; formerly of Gilead Sciences, Pharmasset (clinical development of sofosbuvir for hepatitis C), and GlaxoSmithKline

		Mark Kowalski, MD, Chief Medical Officer; formerly of Gilead Sciences, YM BioSciences, and Viventia Biotechnologies

		Peter Lutwyche Ph.D., Chief Technology Officer, formerly of Protiva, QLT, and Inex Pharmaceuticals


	"We are very excited about the prospects for our integrated new company, which has undergone a transformation to a complete HBV solutions company. The company possesses exceptionally strong and proven clinical development, scientific, and commercial leadership teams and is very well resourced to execute against our goal of delivering a cure for chronic HBV. We believe that the market opportunity for a curative regimen for HBV is very significant, likely eclipsing the HCV market, and presents a meaningful opportunity for shareholders," said Dr. Mark J. Murray, President and CEO of Tekmira. "We remain very confident in our potential to create value from our industry-leading strategy, team, and pipeline dedicated to developing therapeutic solutions to cure HBV."

Strategy for HBV Development

	We believe the solution to HBV lies in combination therapies. The development strategy of Tekmira is to first establish safety and activity of individual product candidates, followed by rapid progression to small cohort combination studies (with multiple products) to identify the most promising regimens. A key feature of this strategy is the planned speed of evaluation of different combinations, doses, and treatment durations – a strategy previously used by this leadership team at Pharmasset in developing sofosbuvir for HCV. Tekmira's broad pipeline of HBV product candidates, which will be further expanded through business development activity, will enable the company to rapidly advance the best product candidates and combination regimens and discontinue product development investment where it is no longer justified. Unique to our company is a commitment to a broad strategy and not to any individual product candidates. Our HBV pipeline currently consists of the product candidates shown in the chart that can be viewed by clicking the following link:

Emerging Science and Advancing Pipeline 

	Tekmira maintains a high level of activity in business development to evaluate additional assets that could be added to the Company's pipeline. As the understanding of chronic HBV evolves, new targets and technologies are emerging as potentially promising approaches to treating HBV. One example of this dynamic is a hypothesis that inhibition of PLK1 could have utility in treating HBV. As a result, Tekmira is planning to modify the clinical program for TKM-PLK1 to study the effect of PLK1 on viral parameters in chronic HBV patients enrolled in the HCC trial. Tekmira is committed to having at least four HBV product candidates advancing in clinical development in 1H16. Tekmira expects to file INDs for three additional HBV product candidates in 2016: a cccDNA formation inhibitor, a core protein inhibitor (also known as capsid assembly inhibitor), and a surface antigen secretion inhibitor.

New Business Unit for Non-HBV Assets and Technology

	Tekmira is also announcing the formation of a discrete business unit to manage, develop and maximize the value of Tekmira's non-HBV assets. The division includes preclinical RNAi product candidates, IP and related know how of the lipid nanoparticle (LNP) delivery technology platform, and multiple strategic partnerships exploiting the LNP technology. The business unit will be independently financed and has a dedicated management team led by Dr. Michael Abrams, Managing Director, who was formerly CEO of AnorMed. The development activities related to TKM-Ebola will be suspended and a joint re-evaluation of the development contract with the US Department of Defense is underway. The management team of the new business unit will evaluate strategic alternatives for this asset.

NASDAQ Bell Ringing and 2Q Financial Results

	Arbutus management will be ringing the opening bell at the NASDAQ Marketsite on Monday August 3, 2015. Tekmira plans to announce 2Q financial results after the market close on Wednesday August 5, 2015. Tekmira will not be hosting a conference call in conjunction with 2Q financial results.

About Tekmira 

	Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corporation is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to discovering, developing and commercializing a cure for patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B infection (HBV). Our strategy is to target the three pillars necessary to develop a curative regimen for HBV: suppressing HBV replication within liver cells, stimulating and reactivating the body's immune system so that it can mount an effective defense against the virus, and eliminating the reservoir of viral genomic material known as covalently closed circular DNA, or cccDNA that is the source of HBV persistence. Our portfolio of assets includes a broad pipeline of drug candidates for use in combination to develop a cure for HBV. To support continuous discovery of potential novel drug candidates and technologies, Tekmira has a research collaboration agreement with the Baruch S. Blumberg Institute that provides exclusive rights to in-license any intellectual property generated through the relationship. The Baruch S. Blumberg Institute was established in 2003 by the Hepatitis B Foundation.

	Tekmira is headquartered in Vancouver, BC, Canada with offices in Doylestown, PA, USA. For more information, visit www.tekmira.com.

Forward-Looking Statements

	This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and forward looking information within the meaning of Canadian securities laws (collectively, "forward looking statements").

	Arbutus Presents HBV Drug Combination Studies at ICAR








	Combinations of Arbutus’ RNAi or Capsid Assets with Approved Drugs Demonstrate Complementary Activity



	Dr. Michael J. Sofia, Arbutus’ Chief Scientific Officer, Awarded International Society of Antiviral Research Gertrude Elion Award



	VANCOUVER, British Columbia and WARMINSTER, Pa., May 22, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Arbutus Biopharma Corporation (Nasdaq:ABUS), an industry-leading Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) therapeutic solutions company, today presented results from preclinical studies of HBV drugs in three presentations at the 30th International Conference on Antiviral Research (ICAR) held on May 21-25, 2017 in Atlanta, GA. These presentations feature preclinical data from multiple Arbutus pipeline programs that highlight the potential of Arbutus' therapeutic candidates to impair HBV viral functions and demonstrate additive to synergistic activity when combining Arbutus assets with approved HBV therapies.




	Arbutus ICAR Presentations




	“Systematic In Vitro Evaluation of Current and Experimental Hepatitis B Therapeutics:



	Potential Utility for Combinations Exploiting Multiple and Diverse Mechanisms of Action” by Andrea Cuconati, Director of Virology



	In preclinical studies, multiple clinical and preclinical Arbutus direct acting antiviral agents tested in combination with nucleoside/nucleotide analogues (NAs) or interferon α-2a (IFN) standard of care therapeutics resulted in either additive or synergistic effects, suppressing multiple elements of HBV including HBsAg, HBeAg and HBV DNA. The results confirm the utility of Arbutus’ agents in clinical combinations with standard of care.  Arbutus RNAi agents ARB-1467 and ARB-1740 are currently in Phase II clinical testing in chronic HBV patients and AB-423, a capsid assembly inhibitor, is in Phase I.



	“Activation of STING Mediates Antiviral Effects in a Mouse Model of Chronic Hepatitis B” by Emily Thi, Principal Scientist, In Vivo Pharmacology and Macro-Molecular Discovery 



	In preclinical studies, STING activation results in control of HBV. Repeated STING activation yielded cumulative reductions in HBV DNA and HBcAg across a 7-day course of study. Type I IFN and cytokine induction may activate innate immune cells and T cell priming to potentially break HBV immune tolerance. These findings provide proof of concept that targeting STING in chronic HBV infection may contribute to viral control and complement the immune modulatory programs underway at Arbutus.



	“Viral Hepatitis – The Search for a Cure” by Dr. Mike Sofia, Chief Scientific Officer

	             


	An introduction to the HBV landscape and an overview of the potential new therapies that may overcome the challenge of persistent chronic HBV infection and achieve a functional cure.



	Highlights from the Studies Presented:




	Our clinical assets ARB-1740, AB-423 and preclinical assets ARB-880, ARB-1820 and ARB-168786, when used in combination with the 'NA and IFN’ standard of care, demonstrate at least additive, and in some cases synergistic, anti-HBV activity.


	Preclinical capsid assembly inhibitors ARB-880, ARB-1820 and ARB-168786 show potent and highly selective inhibition of HBV replication. Arbutus expects to nominate a 2nd generation capsid assembly development candidate this year. 


	These results continue to support Arbutus' combination strategy to develop an HBV cure.            

	 




	These presentations can be accessed by visiting the Investor section of www.arbutusbio.com and selecting Events and Presentations.


	In conjunction with ICAR, Dr. Michael J. Sofia, Arbutus’ Chief Scientific Officer has been awarded the International Society of Antiviral Research (ISAR) Gertrude Elion Award for his outstanding contributions to the antiviral field through his development of a landmark hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment.


	“It is a great honor to receive the ISAR Gertrude Elion Award for my work that led to the discovery of sofosbuvir, which is the backbone of the curative standard of care for HCV. Arbutus is following a similar pathway by developing multiple therapeutic agents to achieve a cure for chronic HBV,” said Dr. Sofia. “We are pleased to be presenting more encouraging data from our preclinical drug combination studies that support the utility of our proprietary HBV candidates in combination with the current standard of care. We continue to employ a range of HBV models to examine the potential use and mechanistic complementarity of our HBV agents in these combination regimens. Arbutus has built a robust pipeline of HBV product candidates to support this strategy.”

Risk-Adjusted Net Present Value For Arbutus Biopharma - Arbutus Biopharma Corp (NASDAQ:ABUS) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Risk-Adjusted Net Present Value For Arbutus BiopharmaJul.19.17 | About: Arbutus Biopharma (ABUS) Oscar Carrascosa Long/short equity, value, special situations, momentumLinkedIn ProfileSummaryrNPV is a method that materializes the value of a Biopharma when it lies in its R&D projects.Summing up the rNPV and cash, ABUS is undervalued.The stock is highly volatile and still far from a stable investing perspective.About The rNPV Model The value of a biotech can be laid on two main factors: current marketed products and its pipeline. The former can be easily measured in terms of cash generation capacity and valuated using simple ratios, such as EV-to-EBITDA ratios or market cap over annual peak sales. For the latter, you only need market projections, that may be made following a bottom-up approach (treatable population x estimated market penetration x annual cost per patient) or top down (total current market x estimated market penetration). But what happens when there are no drugs currently sold in the market and all company’s value (if any) is obtained from its R&D assets? We need a model to assess clinical-trial-stage projects that considers not only the projected market, but also success rates of clinical trials, cost and time to market, among others. But, why is this method superior than a traditional discounted cash flow? Because picking a discount rate when the risk drivers are not correctly identified makes it unreliable. Introducing clinical-trial success rates as a pay-off probability incorporates the main risk driver, which enhances the valuation. For further explanation of this methodology, Biotech Valuations for the 21st Century and Putting a price to biotechnology from Jeffrey J. Stewart is encouraged. In this article, I will be introducing and explaining the four general parameters that must be known to value clinical stage biotech stocks: clinical success rates, projected costs, projected market and discount rate applying them to the concrete case of Arbutus Biopharma Corp. Quick Overview Of Arbutus Biopharma Corp. And Its Pipeline ABUS is dedicated to discover, develop and commercialize a cure for patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B infection globally. For achieving that, it is developing a pipeline of drugs, licensing its LNP technology and creating partnerships.
 The company is using multiple HBV-specific technologies to cure the HB and targeting three pillars: uncontrolled HBV replication within the body, suppression of the host immune response and the inhibition of viral cccDNA formation and elimination of the stable reservoir of viral ccDNA. Its drug discovery and development plan is focused in RNA interference (RNAi), a mechanism that reduces the over-production of specific proteins. In order for RNAi drugs to be applicable in the body, they need to be delivered to the appropriate target cells. ABUS has developed a proprietary delivery platform called Lipid Nanoparticle or LNP, which is licensing to other companies. Partner Programs, Alliances, Licensing Agreements And Research Collaborations Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Alnylam, has a license to use LNP technology to develop and commercialize products. Arbutus is entitled to low-to-mid single-digit royalty based on sales performance. Top line data from the APOLLO clinical trial are expected in mid-2017. Assuming a positive outcome, new drug application (NDA) filing for this program and marketing authorization application (MAA) are expected by the end of 2017. Marqibo, from Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, is another partnered program that is giving ABUS mid single-digit royalty payments. Alexion Pharma signed an agreement in which it would pay $7.5 million upfront and payments of up to $75M for an achievement of development, as well as single-digit royalties for using LNP technology. 

 Nowadays, the main value of Arbutus biopharma lies in its pipeline (shown above). Moreover, its three main clinical agents: ARB-1467, ARB-1740 andAB-423. Arbutus has been suffering a termination in many of its partnered programs, as shown in its decline in revenue from $14M in 2012 to $1,4M in 2016.
 Pipeline ARB-1467 comprises three RNAi triggers that target all four HBV transcripts and has been shown in preclinical studies to reduce all viral antigen levels as well as ccDNA and HBV DNA. ARB-1467 is currently in Phase II. Management said that patients showed a consistent reduction in the hepatitis B surface antigen HBsAg. The multiple dose results from Cohort 2 showed a significant reduction in HBsAg. In both Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, an additive reduction in HBsAg was observed. In each dose after 3 monthly doses of 0.4mg/kg in Cohort 2 was greater than that seen at 0.2 mg/kg in Cohort 1, demonstrating a dose-response seen with repeat dosing. The company is planning a fourth dose cohort for the year. Phase II is expected to be finished by April 2018. ARB-1740 employs the same LNP formulation as ARB-1467 with a different set of three RNAi triggers that target all four HBV transcripts. The ARB-1740 Phase II multi-dosing study began dosing HBV patients early this year and data will be available in the second half of 2017. It was significantly more potent than ARB-1467 in preclinical studies and has the potential to be more effective at lower clinical doses than ARB-1467, suppressing multiple elements of HBV including HBsAg, HBeAg, DNA, core antigen, and all RNAs including the HBx transcript Management said in the earnings call that after the multi-dose study, they will be informed to choose between these two candidates for further clinical development. For the evidence shown, I am only including ARB-1740 in the model. As background, Arbutus titled an oral presentation “Exploring Combination Therapy for Curing HBV: Preclinical Studies with Capsid Inhibitor AB-423 and a siRNA Agent, ARB-1740.” Finally, AB-423 is a capsid inhibitor that blocks viral replication in the liver. AB-423 began a single and multiple- dose study in healthy volunteers with single ascending dose cohorts followed by multiple ascending dose cohorts in the first quarter of this year. It is expected to be included in studies with RNAi in 2018.
 As described in the last 10-Q, “our product pipeline, like our business, is focused on finding a cure for chronic HBV infection, with the objective of developing a combination of products that intervene at different points in the viral life cycle, and reactivating the host immune system. Initially, these combinations will include a single product from our pipeline combined with approved agents.” Therefore, in our model, we are assuming that only one final product is developed as a combination of AB-1740 and AB-423. Payoff Probabilities For the readers that are following the formula shown in any of the two reports mentioned above, is this: 

 Ci is the cash flow at time i, R0 is the current likelihood of reaching the final cash flow, Ri is the likelihood at time i of reaching the final cash flow, R0/R1 is the current likelihood (i.e., at time 0) of realizing the cash flow of time i, and WACC is the discount rate. When the author says, “clinical drug development should be regarded as a series of high-risk wagers where success in the first wager (e.g. a phase 1 trial) allows a company to make additional wagers (e.g. a phase 1 trial) allows a company to make additional wagers (e.g., phase 2 and 3 trials) before reaching the ultimate payoff,” it seems clear that each payoff of each trial should be preceded by the previous probability of success in the previous trial. Nonetheless, the author uses a fraction to describe that probability. Why is that? Because he is using compound probabilities: average success rates of reaching the market in every phase. Therefore, the probability of passing every trial with the numbers provided (assuming independence) is obtained through these equations:
 

 For example, if we are currently in Phase II, the likelihood of having a cash flow in Phase III is: 

 If it’s preferred to use probabilities of success in every phase instead of the numbers provided by Jeffrey J. Stewart, you can go to the data from Clinical Development Success Rates 2006-2015. The dataset includes probabilities classified by type of drugs. Other biologics, such as RNAi, have these probabilities: Phase I to Phase II, 66%; Phase II to Phase III, 34%; Phase III to BLA, 57%; BLA to Approval, 88%. Costs Jeffrey J. Stewart provides in his papers some inputs to deal with costs, such as supporting animal studies, number of clinical trial subjects, per subject cost and filing costs in the FDA. He argues that “the cost of drug development can be estimated using industry standards, and any deviations from these standards must be justified.” However, since ABUS is using its LNP technology, costs are not easily comparable. Therefore, the approach that I have followed selects from the total operating expenses the research, development, collaborations and contract expenses. They “consist primarily of clinical and pre-clinical trial expenses, personnel expenses, consulting and third party expenses, consumables and materials, as well as a portion of stock-based compensation and general overhead costs,” discarding the G&A, Depreciation, Acquisition costs, impairment of intangible assets and goodwill that I don’t think are incremental flows.
 I believe this data is stable, as the management says: “setting aside intangible asset and goodwill impairment charges in Q3 2015, Q2 2016, and Q4 2016 and acquisition costs in Q1 2015, there has been a steady underlying increase in our expenses for the past eight quarters.” Finally, I will interpolate a function using Excel for the periods remaining. I have assumed that ARB-1740 will finish Phase II this year, AB-423 in the first half of 2018, two and a half years of the recombined product, and filing with the FDA in 2022. Once the model gets the approval of the FDA, I will assume a 60% margin until the end of the patent (eight years after 2021).  

Projected Market  Since there is an unmet medical need for HBV, there are several companies focusing on delivering therapeutics for treating this disease. The company includes: Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Assembly Biosciences (NASDAQ:ASMB), Roche (OTCQX:RHHBY), Replicor, Spring Bank (NASDAQ:SBPH), Alnylam (NASDAQ:ALNY), Arrowhead (NASDAQ:ARWR), ContraVir (NASDAQ:CTRV), Dicerna (NASDAQ:DRNA), Intellia (NASDAQ:NTLA), Cocrystal (OTCQB:COCP), and Enanta (NASDAQ:ENTA). Here there is a complete list from Hepatitis B foundation The most advanced phase for all of them is Phase II, the same as Arbutus. In Phase II, and pointed out by the above list of Arbutus, we find: ContraVir, Replicor, Gilead, Roche and Spring Bank. Since we don’t have an extensive study available about safety, effectiveness, ease with which the products can be administered and so on and so forth, I will assume a 16% market penetration each. WHO estimates that in 2015 there were 257 million people living with chronic HBV infection. According to GBI Research, the market value for HBV will be 3.5 billion by 2021. Using our rough estimates, the slice corresponding to Arbutus would be 560 million.
 Chardan Capital Markets, in a note to clients in April 2017, estimated peak, risk-adjusted 2030 sales at $580 million because “no other HBV drug class has demonstrated 1-log HBsAg suppression across multiple assets,” while in July 2016 estimated $356 million due to “New clinical competition from Alnylam.” Peak Risk-adjusted sales are calculated by multiplying the market value times the final market share times the likelihood of having the drug marketed. Potential revenue numbers are usually provided by specialist biotech market intelligence companies, whose reports are not usually affordable for the individual investor. Even a company with resources that can access a high-quality information can suffer a great variability on its estimates (62% in the above numbers) given the changes in the competitive landscape. If we use $560 million and multiply by the pay-off probability 0.34%, we get 190.4 million, which are far below the previous analysis. Guessing that I don’t have the best information, I will use a middle range number, $468 million. Cost of Capital In “Putting a price to technology,” Jeffrey J. Stewart assesses that “we assume here that the discount rate is equivalent to the 20% internal rate of return generally expected by the primary sources of capital available to biotechnology companies—venture capitalists and large pharmaceuticals companies.” I am using this discount rate. If the readers are interested in a further explanation, I recommend reading this article. Complete Evaluation 




 

 The rNPV is somewhat above its current market cap ($213.25 MM). If we add its cash, short-term investments, restricted investments, and the royalty for a possible approval for Partisan, we get to a market cap of $401.09, representing a 59% potential return. Arbutus gross burn rate from the three months ending in 2016 vs. three months ending in 2017 has been 9.576 $/month. At March 31, 2017, the company had an aggregate of $123.0 million in cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted investments as compared to an aggregate of $143.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted investments at December 31, 2016 . After receiving the payment of 7.5 million from Alexion and progress from the existing LNP license orders from Alnylam and Alexion, it’s feasible that the company will extend its runway cash almost for a year and a half. The Downside Although from a risk-neutral perspective it seems to be a rational investment, we need to remember that the rNPV model relies on uncertainty and subjective assumptions. Thus, the procedure may become really arbitrary and consequently, lead to totally wrong valuations. Moreover, this is not the only possible valuation; there are many others, like real options. The ultimate success of Arbutus Biopharma depends on taking its pipeline into the market, rather than other licensing activities, and Arbutus has a bad track of failed assets (the company used to trade at $30). Finally, many of its competitors have much greater financial, technical and human resources than Arbutus has at every stage of the discovery, development, manufacture and commercialization process. Independently of the success of Arbutus, I hope that at least one of these companies should be able to market a product that could improve the life of these 257 million people living with HBV.

Arbutus Biopharma Corporation is a publicly traded (NASDAQ: ABUS) biopharmaceutical company with an expertise in liposomal drug delivery and RNA interference, and is developing drugs for hepatitis B infection. It is headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia and has research facilities in Warminster, Pennsylvania.[1] The company was formerly known as Tekmira, which was spun out of Inex Pharmaceuticals in 2007.
History[edit]
Tekmira, as the company was formerly called, was formed as a wholly owned subsidiary of Inex Pharmaceuticals in 2005 after that company began collapsing after its regulatory and partnering strategy failed in 2004.[2][3][4] Tekmira was fully spun out in 2007 and Tekmira absorbed the assets of Inex, which had been founded in 1992.[4][5][6]
Inex had been developing liposomal formulations of off-patent cancer drugs, and licensed them to Talon Pharmaceuticals in 2005; Talon was acquired by Spectrum Pharmaceuticals in 2013, and three former Inex/Tekmira products reached the market and began generating royalties for Tekmira: Marqibo (liposomal vincristine), Alocrest (liposomal vinorelbine) and Brakiva (liposomal topotecan).[7]
Inex had also acquired licenses to intellectual property, as well as staff and manufacturing facilities, concerning RNAi technology from Lynx Therapeutics in 1998;[3]:10[8] this set of technologies became the focus for Tekmira and it initially sought to develop liposomally encapsulated RNAi drugs for a broad range of indications.[4]
Tekmira also worked on providing liposomal delivery technology to other companies. In 2007 it signed a license agreement with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals so that Alynylam could use it to deliver its own RNAi drugs; that deal was expanded into a manufacturing agreement in 2009.[9]
Most of those products not focused on viral diseases faltered,[10] and Tekmira had only $6.3 million in cash when it filed suit against Alnylam in 2011 for breaching its contract and stealing trade secrets.[9] The suit was settled in 2012, with Alylylam agreeing to pay Tekmira $65 million in termination fees, and the companies negotiated a new license agreement with lower milestones and royalties, which covers Alynylam's product patisiran.[9][11]
Tekmira caught the world's attention and its stock rose dramatically during the 2013 West African Ebola virus epidemic due to its drug candidate for Ebola fever, TKM-Ebola.[10] Tekmira was developing it under a $140 million US Department of Defense contract.[12] While its stock was trading high in January 2015, it acquired OnCore BioPharma, a company focused on hepatitis B.[13][14]
Development of TKM-Ebola was terminated in mid June 2015 during a Phase II trial, for lack of efficacy.[15][16]
The next month, Tekmira changed its name to Arbutus Biopharma and said that it would focus on drugs to treat hepatitis B.[10][17]
In March 2017 Arbitus signed another license for its liposome delivery technology, this time with Alexion Pharmaceuticals, for delivery of an mRNA drug candidates.[11]

Arbutus Biopharma Corporation is a publicly traded (NASDAQ: ABUS) biopharmaceutical company with an expertise in liposomal drug delivery and RNA interference, and is developing drugs for hepatitis B infection. It is headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia and has research facilities in Warminster, Pennsylvania.[1] The company was formerly known as Tekmira, which was spun out of Inex Pharmaceuticals in 2007.
History[edit]
Tekmira, as the company was formerly called, was formed as a wholly owned subsidiary of Inex Pharmaceuticals in 2005 after that company began collapsing after its regulatory and partnering strategy failed in 2004.[2][3][4] Tekmira was fully spun out in 2007 and Tekmira absorbed the assets of Inex, which had been founded in 1992.[4][5][6]
Inex had been developing liposomal formulations of off-patent cancer drugs, and licensed them to Talon Pharmaceuticals in 2005; Talon was acquired by Spectrum Pharmaceuticals in 2013, and three former Inex/Tekmira products reached the market and began generating royalties for Tekmira: Marqibo (liposomal vincristine), Alocrest (liposomal vinorelbine) and Brakiva (liposomal topotecan).[7]
Inex had also acquired licenses to intellectual property, as well as staff and manufacturing facilities, concerning RNAi technology from Lynx Therapeutics in 1998;[3]:10[8] this set of technologies became the focus for Tekmira and it initially sought to develop liposomally encapsulated RNAi drugs for a broad range of indications.[4]
Tekmira also worked on providing liposomal delivery technology to other companies. In 2007 it signed a license agreement with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals so that Alynylam could use it to deliver its own RNAi drugs; that deal was expanded into a manufacturing agreement in 2009.[9]
Most of those products not focused on viral diseases faltered,[10] and Tekmira had only $6.3 million in cash when it filed suit against Alnylam in 2011 for breaching its contract and stealing trade secrets.[9] The suit was settled in 2012, with Alylylam agreeing to pay Tekmira $65 million in termination fees, and the companies negotiated a new license agreement with lower milestones and royalties, which covers Alynylam's product patisiran.[9][11]
Tekmira caught the world's attention and its stock rose dramatically during the 2013 West African Ebola virus epidemic due to its drug candidate for Ebola fever, TKM-Ebola.[10] Tekmira was developing it under a $140 million US Department of Defense contract.[12] While its stock was trading high in January 2015, it acquired OnCore BioPharma, a company focused on hepatitis B.[13][14]
Development of TKM-Ebola was terminated in mid June 2015 during a Phase II trial, for lack of efficacy.[15][16]
The next month, Tekmira changed its name to Arbutus Biopharma and said that it would focus on drugs to treat hepatitis B.[10][17]
In March 2017 Arbitus signed another license for its liposome delivery technology, this time with Alexion Pharmaceuticals, for delivery of an mRNA drug candidates.[11]
