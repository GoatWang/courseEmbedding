Separate account assets and liabilities arise from the sale of variable life insurance and annuity products. The separate account represents funds segregated for the benefit of certain policyholders who bear the investment risk. The assets are legally segregated and are not subject to claims which may arise from any other business of the Company. The separate account assets and liabilities, which are
            equal, are recorded at fair value. Policyholder account deposits and withdrawals, investment income and realized investment gains and losses are excluded from the amounts reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Revenues to the Company from separate accounts consist principally of contract charges, which include maintenance charges, administrative fees and mortality and risk charges.
 
The total separate account assets were $229.9 million as of March 31, 2009. Variable life and variable annuity assets comprised 29% and 71% of this amount, respectively. Guarantees are offered under variable life and variable annuity contracts: a guaranteed minimum death benefit rider is available on certain variable universal life contracts and guaranteed minimum death benefits are provided on variable
            annuities. The guaranteed minimum death benefit rider for variable universal life contracts guarantees the death benefit for specified periods of time, regardless of investment performance, provided cumulative premium requirements are met. The Company

Kansas City Life Insurance Company
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)-Continued
 


 
introduced a guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit (GMWB) rider in 2007 that can be added to new or existing variable annuity contracts. The rider provides a minimum guarantee that the owner can make annual withdrawals equal to 5% of the initial annuity deposit for twenty years, or for life if withdrawals were started at age 65 or later, regardless of market returns. The current value of variable
            annuity separate accounts with the GMWB rider was $32.6 million and the liability for the GMWB rider was $0.4 million at March 31, 2009. The value of the GMWB rider is recorded at fair value. The change in this liability is included in policyholder benefits in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
 
These excerpts taken from the KCLI 10-K filed Feb 27, 2009.Separate Accounts

At December 31, 2008, the Company had $258.6 million in separate account assets. This was a decrease of $161.8 million from $420.4 million at December 31, 2007. The significant decline in the market directly contributed to the decrease in these assets. This decline affected both the investment performance of existing contract holders but also contributed to a decline
            in new sales. Nearly 19% of the policyholder withdrawals were transferred to the general account, which credits interest on the balance invested. Negative investment performance decreased separate accounts by $135.3 million in 2008 versus an increase of $33.8 million in 2007. Deposits in separate accounts decreased in 2008 to $49.0 million versus $57.8 million in 2007. Policyholder withdrawals also contributed to the decline in assets, increasing to $61.3 million in 2008 from $57.1
            million in 2007. In addition, contract charges were $14.2 million and $14.8 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively.

The total separate account assets were $315.4 million as of September 30, 2008. Variable life and variable annuity assets comprised 30% and 70% of this amount, respectively. Two guarantees are offered under variable life and variable annuity contracts: a guaranteed minimum death benefit rider is available on certain variable universal life contracts and guaranteed minimum death benefits are provided
            on variable annuities. The guaranteed minimum death benefit rider for variable universal life contracts guarantees the death benefit for specified periods of time, regardless of investment performance, provided cumulative premium requirements are met. The Company introduced a guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit (GMWB) rider in 2007 that can be added to new or existing variable annuity contracts. The rider provides a minimum guarantee that the owner can make annual withdrawals
            equal to 5% of the initial annuity deposit for twenty years, or for life if withdrawals are started at age 65 or later, regardless of market returns. The value of variable annuity separate accounts with the GMWB rider was $28.1 million and the liability was $32.2 million at September 30, 2008. The value of the GMWB rider is recorded at fair value. The change in this liability is included in policyholder benefits in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

About[edit]
Kansas City Life Insurance Company was established in 1895 in Kansas City, Mo. with agency force of more than 2,500 and more than 150 general agencies serves 48 states and the District of Columbia. We insure more than half a million policyholders from coast to coast. Our Home Office is located in Kansas City, Mo.
Company markets individual life, annuity and group products through general agencies located throughout the United States. Variable life and variable annuity options are distributed through Sunset Financial Services Inc. Kansas City Life's wholly owned broker/dealer subsidiary.
History[edit]
Originally chartered as Bankers Life Association on May 1, 1895, the Company was founded by Major William Warner, President; J.H. North, Vice President; and S.E. Rumble, Secretary. Rumble conceived the idea of forming a life insurance company in the "heart of America." At the time, Kansas City was known as the Athens of the West and was the second largest city in the western half of the United States; only San Francisco was larger.
The Kansas City Life Insurance Company name was adopted in 1900. The Company began issuing policies in small amounts from an office in the Scheidley Building, located at Ninth and Main Streets in Kansas City, Mo.
In 1897, the Company moved to the Navajo Building, then the Rialto Building, where it remained until 1924 when the Company moved to its present location. The Home Office sits on approximately five acres of land purchased for $200,000. Built for $1 million, the building was dedicated on Aug. 1, 1924.
Company rating[edit]
According to A.M. Best, "A (Excellent) is assigned to companies which, in our opinion, have demonstrated excellent overall performance when compared to the standards established by A.M. Best Company. A (Excellent) companies have a strong ability to meet their obligations to policyowners over a long period of time." A.M. Best also assigned the Company's outlook as stable.

Term Life Insurance

Term life insurance provides the most coverage for the least cost initially, but expires over time and does not accrue cash value.  Read More






Return of Premium Life Insurance

Return of premium life offers consistent premiums, a guaranteed death benefit and 100 percent return of eligible premiums paid at the end of the policy’s term period.  Read More






Universal Life Insurance

A universal life policy offers you premium and death benefit flexibility along with a tax advantaged savings element that includes a guaranteed minimum interest rate.  Read More






Indexed Universal Life Insurance

A flexible premium universal life product with an indexed feature. An Indexed Universal Life policy (IUL) functions similarly to universal life; however, the client can choose to allocate their policy’s values into a Fixed Account or an Indexed Account. An IUL also supplies a floor that ensures your cash value will not decrease because you are not directly invested in the market.  Read More






Variable Universal Life Insurance*

Variable universal life insurance combines valuable life insurance protection with a variety of investment options to fit your individual financial needs. Read More

*Variable products offered through Sunset Financial Services, Inc., 3520 Broadway, Kansas City, MO 64111, 
                800-821-5529 (Home Office). 
                Sunset Financial Services is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kansas City Life Insurance Company.







Whole Life Insurance

Fixed Annuities

A Fixed Annuity may be right for you if you are seeking a long-term investment that can provide guaranteed income payments in the future that cannot be outlived.







Key benefits

Why is this important?


SafetyFixed Annuities are a safe and guaranteed way to provide retirement income.


Tax deferralAnnuities allow your investment to grow on a tax-deferred basis. Pay no taxes until you withdraw money.

Competitive interest ratesFixed Annuities offer safe, competitive interest rates so that your money is constantly growing.

No up-front costsAll of the money you deposit into a Fixed Annuity begins earning interest immediately.

Ability to customizeAnnuities offer many options for income payouts that allow the product to fit your needs.


How does a Fixed Annuity work?



A Fixed Annuity contract guarantees a minimum rate of interest; however, Kansas City Life Insurance Company can, and often does, credit a rate that is higher than the guarantee.

Many annuities offer the ability to make on-going premium deposits. These payments can be increased, decreased or stopped all together.

Annuity contracts also offer a variety of payout options that can be chosen when you are ready to begin receiving these payments.  Moreover, a Fixed Annuity allows you the option to receive a lifetime income stream. Currently, this is the only financial product offered in a retail setting that can guarantee income payments you cannot outlive.

An annuity also offers beneficiary options so you can determine who will receive your funds upon your death.

Kansas City Life Insurance Company also has many policy riders available that would allow you to design a life insurance policy that fits your particular needs and budget. For more information, please contact a licensed Kansas City Life Insurance Company agent near you.



 

Variable Annuities*

A Variable Annuity may be right for you if you are seeking a long-term investment that can provide guaranteed income payments in the future that cannot be outlived. Variable Annuities allow you to choose from a diverse group of investment options which offer the potential for higher returns.






Key benefits

Why is this important?


Growth potentialVariable Annuities offer higher growth potential than fixed annuities, however these higher returns carry risk.                                                                           


Tax deferralAnnuities allow your investment to grow on a tax deferred basis. Pay no taxes until you withdraw money.

No up- front costsAll of the money that you deposit into a Variable Annuity goes to work for you immediately.

Ability to customizeVariable Annuities offer many investment options for growth and many choices for income payout.                                                                                                                                



How does a Variable Annuity work? 
 

A Variable Annuity is a savings vehicle that helps you accumulate assets for your future needs. A Variable Annuity allows you to decide how to invest your money by allowing you to choose from a variety of investments within the annuity contract. Most Variable Annuities also offer a fixed account. The returns that you experience will be based upon the subaccounts you choose within the annuity.

Many annuities offer the ability to make on-going premium deposits. These payments can be increased, decreased or stopped all together.

Variable Annuity contracts also offer a variety of payout options that can be chosen when you are ready to begin receiving these payments.  Moreover, a Variable Annuity allows you the option to receive a lifetime income stream.  Currently, annuities are the only financial product offered in a retail setting that can guarantee income payments you cannot outlive.

Variable Annuities also offer protection to your heirs in the form of guaranteed minimum death benefits. Most annuities provide at least a return of principal invested, and many provided an enhanced guarantee.

Kansas City Life Insurance Company also has many optional riders to enhance your contract such as a Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit.

Kansas City Life by the Numbers



 









 




Kansas City Life Insurance Company
A promise of financial strength is only as good as the company that makes it. When Kansas City Life makes a promise, we stand behind it. Since 1895, we have assisted policyholders through world wars, the Great Depression and various periods of recession and inflation.

Kansas City Life’s reputation is built on integrity, sound investment strategies and honest business practices. To us, integrity is not an outdated notion in today’s fast-paced world. It is the guiding force behind every decision we make. Every product we sell is backed by more than a century of quality service and financial security.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

The supplement provides information about the current charge for an optional benefit, the FIVE Plus SM Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit when issued on or after January 1, If you need an additional copy of the Prospectus, please call us toll free at If you purchase a Contract and the Contract is issued on or after January 1, 2009 and you elect the optional FIVE Plus SM Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit ( GMWB ), the current monthly charge for the GMWB is 0.079% (multiplied by the Guaranteed Withdrawal Balance). If you purchased your Contract before January 1, 2009 and you elected the GMWB, the monthly charge for the benefit will continue to be 0.05% as described in the Prospectus, but we reserve the right to increase the charge on the effective date of a Step-Up to the charge currently being assessed at that time for newly-issued Contracts. Accordingly, if your Contract was issued before January 1, 2009 and your monthly GMWB charge is 0.05%, upon a Step-Up your monthly charge could increase to 0.079%. However, the monthly charge for the GMWB is guaranteed not to exceed 0.10%. To reflect this change, the following sections of the Prospectus for the Contract are updated as follows: The following sections are amended as follows: In the section of the Prospectus entitled Highlights Charges and Deductions FIVE Plus SM Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit : Replace the second sentence with the following: The current monthly charge is 0.079% multiplied by the Guaranteed Withdrawal Balance.
