                        Does my computer need protection from viruses?                      


Long story short, yes. You may not know it, but the web is full of harmful threats that can really cause significant damage to your personal life. Imagine checking your bank balance and it saying zero? Imagine all your friends on Facebook are sent a harmful link by someone who has hacked your account? How about logging onto your computer and seeing that your most important documents are being held for ransom? Pretty scary stuff. Here’s why and how you can protect yourself…
A virus is only one type of malware. Malware is Malicious Software designed to get unauthorised access into your system. Protecting yourself again

Choosing to protect yourself against viruses can be such a crucial decision. Especially when it comes to safeguarding personal details online.  But choosing which anti-virus software to go for can be a tricky decision. With so many to choose from all different types of developers small and large, make sure you make the right decision and go for anti-virus software that packs these features…

New types of viruses are being created every single day. Anti-virus software dating a few years or even a few months back will be outdated by the new catalogue of harmful viruses. Viruses are constantly e

Who Needs Antivirus Software?These days, everybody needs antivirus software.Computer viruses don’t just come from streaming or downloading movies. Many people think that they can avoid potential threats by making sure they don’t visit certain websites or download certain files.The truth is computer viruses can make their way onto your computer or any other device in a number of ways. You can pick up viruses and malware simply by checking your email, browsing the web or from putting a USB memory stick into your laptop.Virus protection is a requisite of having your own personal computer. Luckily for you, there are hundreds of choices of antivirus software – each with its pros and cons. Making a choice between internet security software can be difficult, but that’s what we’re here for!How Antivirus WorksMost antivirus software works on a signature database, monitoring the internet 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Every time a new virus is reported – it’s indexed, catalogued and added to the software’s database. Once your antivirus software is up-to-date it is equipped to tackle the new virus should it ever reach your device.How to Handle VirusesYou often have three options when faced with a threat on your computer: delete the threat, quarantine it or ignore it.Deleting is almost always the best option, but some viruses make themselves "un-deletable" and quarantining becomes your only option. Your quarantine folder will keep the virus isolated and prevent it from spreading or causing damage to other files. Antivirus can be passive or active – passive requires you to make scheduled or manual virus scans, while active runs in the background; detecting and fighting threats in real-time.Free vs Paid Antivirus SoftwareIf you are deciding on a new antivirus software and may want to try a free version, keep in mind that there are pros and cons for both paid and free versions. Using a free antivirus software can cost you more in the long run and most experts suggest that it’s better to use a paid version. Free versions can be great to try a new software or set of features, but will never provide the same level of protection - and your service most certainly won’t include internet security software.Paid versions of an antivirus software will cover both online and offline activities, permanently delete sensitive digital files and provide extra encryption to protect your most private files from malware like Trojans, worms and ransomware.A paid antivirus software is especially helpful if you have a PC or device that has already been infected. Many paid versions offer virus removal and cleanup tools, in addition to the highest-quality prevention and detection rates.Extra FeaturesThere are a few key features that you should look out for when looking for antivirus software, and it will vary depending on your needs.Online Protection - If you’re online, then you probably want an internet security software with a built-in firewall.Email Protection - If you’re a heavy email user then you’ll want be on the lookout for anti-spam, spyware and phishing.Parental Controls - Parents need to look for software with easy-to-use parental controls and restrictions.Gaming Protection - Gamers can look forward to a "gaming mode," which prompts the internet security software to use less resources.Compatibility - You will want to check the compatibility of your chosen software with your operating system, whether that be Windows protection, Mac OS antivirus and everything in between.How We Review & ScoreChoosing the best antivirus software should be much easier with our expert reviews. Our experts have analyzed some of the best choices on the market, and each review covers a wide range of topics, including:PricingFeaturesEase of useOverall value for moneyCustomer supportUser experienceIndependent testingBut it’s up to you to decide which is the most applicable for your needs. If you need more help, checkout all of our in-depth, expert reviews. These will help you understand what you should look out for and how to find the perfect antivirus solution.Copyright © 2009-2017 Natural Intelligence Ltd. All Rights Reserved.

McAfee Review
By: Craig Chamberlin Best ForHome and business solutions of any sizeMultiple devices - licenses include protection for unlimited devicesPC Optimization - free tools include email spam blocking and parental controlProsEasy to use, install and manageAbove average detection rates and protection100% guaranteed virus removalConsAbove average price to its counterpartsUses more system resources than other antivirus packages Bottom LineMcAfee delivers a well priced package with above average detection rates. McAfee's packages include options for built in PC optimization tools, parental controls, email spam blocking, hacker and thief firewall protection and social media link protection for unlimited devices. Don't like reading? Watch our video review instead! Visit McAfeeWhy Choose McAfee?McAfee is one of the most well-known antivirus providers, and for good reason. Whether you need virus protection for home or for your business, there are several options available. Although the real time protection and performance come in at an average rating, many users may find the easy to use interface, excellent customer support and money back guarantee enough to curb those concerns.What McAfee Offers: Password managerEmail spam blockerEncryption softwareParental controlsComplete online protectionFree coverage for smartphones and tabletsPackage Features and Highlights:Features: Full Featured Protection Ease of Use: Easiest for Users Reliability: Above Average Value: Average  Money Back Guarantee: 30-Day McAfee AntiVirus - Includes full antivirus protection with free 24/7 support and built in PC optimization tools for a single device.McAfee Internet Security - Includes full antivirus protection with free 24/7 support, built in PC optimization tools, parental controls and e-mail and spam blocking for unlimited devices.McAfee Total Protection - Includes full antivirus protection with free 24/7 support, built in PC optimization tools, parental controls, email spam blocking, hacker and thief firewall protection and social media link protection for unlimited devices. Protect private files with encryption software and safely store your passwords with the True Key app.Ease of UseMcAfee Antivirus software is probably the easiest antivirus packages in the market to use. The simplicity of the primary dashboard ensures users know the current state of its operating system protection. Performing both quick and full scans is only a few clicks away, and it’s easy to set up auto scans.   This antivirus has all features enabled and pre-configured instantly after installation, without the need for a reboot. Although many antivirus products have a somewhat sketchy past, the current generation of software delivers.Users can also easily configure parental controls, firewall, anti-spam settings, scheduled virus scans and update settings directly from the user interface. All navigation is laid out in a very intuitive way that walks users through configuring what settings best fits their needs. Detection Rates and ReliabilityWhen comparing reliability, most antivirus packages need to hold their own in two primary areas of antivirus protection: virus detection through traditional virus scanning and real-time protection as files are saved to the system.According to AV-Comparatives, a prominent 3rd-party virus testing company, all McAfee antivirus packages are in the top tier for traditional virus file detection. And while not as strong  for real-time scanning protection, McAfee still came back with an average score.  Value for MoneyOverall and compared to its competitors, McAfee offers great packages at a reasonable price. Its antivirus definitely offers a lot in the way of file detection, and there are plenty of extra features even with the most basic packages.When determining value, it is important to weigh the benefits of ease of use against the costs of performance and detection rates. A great value added is that beyond the basic service, this package includes licenses for unlimited devices.Help & SupportMcAfee provides customers with extensive support options, including their Antivirus support website completely dedicated to frequently asked questions and an online knowledge base. Depending on their comfort level, users can use the online chat system, make a phone call or even purchase various support packages.User ExperienceIt's important to note that McAfee products tend to use more resources than other antivirus products, which can result in some performance loss on the system. Many users will find that most antivirus software packages that are simple to use tend to use more resources than others.If you are worried about a slow device, changing the settings in your antivirus package can help, as well a free virus scans that are offered on the McAfee website.Review in Short McAfee is one of the biggest and most trusted names in antivirus software. McAfee provides secure total protection for your computer and devices. No matter which package you choose you will have access to free 24/7 support, parental controls and a 30-day money-back guarantee.When you spend a little more for the internet security and total protection packages, you get anti-malware, anti-theft and file protection for any Mac, Windows or Android device. You can also opt for parental controls, anti-spam to block dangerous emails and the True Key app to store your passwords and usernames.About McAfeeSince 1987, McAfee has been creating antivirus and computer security products. As one of the original pioneers of the antivirus market, antivirus packages such as McAfee Antivirus Plus, McAfee Internet Security and McAfee Total Protection are often packaged with pre-built computer systems from companies such as Dell, Acer and Lenovo.  Today, McAfee Corporation is owned by Intel Corporation and updates their security software packages at their security center in Santa Clara, California.    Visit McAfee    About Craig Chamberlin    Craig the Tech Teacher is your source for common sense 			  advice for the tech in your life.  For over 10 years I've worked with technology, so let me work with   			  you.  Follow Craig on Google+  Last Updated: April, 2017

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Avast Closes Acquisition of AVG Technologies
Prague, Czech Republic / Amsterdam, The Netherlands, September 30, 2016  - Avast Software, the leader in digital security products for consumers and businesses, today announced it has acquired a majority stake in AVG Technologies after completing the initial offering period of its tender offer for all of the outstanding ordinary shares of AVG Technologies N.V. (NYSE: AVG). Therefore, they will operate as a single company as of Monday, October 3, 2016.
Vince Steckler is named the chief executive officer of the new Avast, overseeing more than $700M in revenue for 2016 for the newly-combined entity. Avast has transformed into a full service security company with the largest Consumer installed base in the world, and with significant Mobile, SMB and Mobile Enterprise businesses. As of the completion of the initial offering period of the tender offer, AVG's CEO Gary Kovacs will be departing, but will be available on a consulting basis throughout the transition.
“The combined company now has over 400 million users, more than 40% of the world's consumer PCs outside of China and the largest consumer security installed base in the world. If they were a country, we would have the 3rd largest population in the world,” said Vince Steckler, chief executive officer. “The US is now our number one market with 58 million users. We truly have global reach and are proud to be the most popular choice for security in the world.”
“We now have the technical breadth to provide superior protection for our customers. For example, our combined threat labs will have teams dedicated to emerging threats affecting consumers. These include social engineering threats, which are commonly used to target IoT devices, and ransomware, which we are fighting with machine learning technology. We believe we are now better equipped than ever to outsmart those who want to do harm to people online.”
By acquiring AVG, the new Avast has stronger protection for its customers. Avast now:

Has the largest threat detection network in the world with more than 400 million endpoints that act as sensors, providing information about malware to help detect and neutralize new threats as soon as they appear
Has what is probably the world's largest security-focused cloud and machine learning network comprising over 9,000 servers and supporting 50 million simultaneous connections to provide instantaneous protection to its users
Prevents around 1 billion malware attacks per month
Blocks more than 500 million malicious URLs per month
Blocks around 50 million phishing attacks per month
Processes 9 million new executable files every month, 25% of which are malicious, giving Avast even faster and deeper insights in the threat landscape

With the acquisition, Avast expands its SMB business and adds AVG's strong reseller base, enabling Avast to support more and larger organizations. Avast is also gaining Location Labs and its carrier business, which Avast plans to invest in and expand overseas. Due to the closed infrastructure of mobile operating systems, mobile security and privacy protection technology is stronger when embedded in the carrier infrastructure. The Location Labs technology essentially provides a cloud-based solution to customers, bypassing the inefficiencies and insecurities of running within the mobile operating system. 
Avast plans to create more and better products that will defend against the growing number of threats in the market. The company will continue to offer both the AVG and Avast branded products for the foreseeable future and to support all customers and partners for both product lines.
“We want our customers to be reassured that whether you use an AVG product or an Avast product, we will continue to support you. We are nothing without our customers and partners who have helped us get to where we are today,” said Vince Steckler. 
As a result of the acquisition, Avast holds approximately 87.3% of AVG's outstanding shares acquired upon the closing of the initial offering period for the tender offer. Avast also announced that it has commenced a subsequent offering period to provide AVG shareholders who have not yet tendered their shares the opportunity to do so. The subsequent offering period is scheduled to expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on October 14, 2016, unless extended. As described below, Avast plans to voluntarily delist AVG's shares from the New York Stock Exchange promptly following the subsequent offering period.
The Transaction
On July 29, 2016, Avast Software B.V. and its parent company, Avast Holding B.V., commenced a tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding ordinary shares of AVG Technologies N.V. at a purchase price of $25.00 per share in cash, without interest and less applicable withholding taxes or other taxes.  The initial offering period for the tender offer and withdrawal rights expired at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on September 29, 2016. Based on information provided by the depositary for the offer, a total of 44,543,555 shares, representing approximately 87.3% of the aggregate number of shares outstanding, had been validly tendered and had not been properly withdrawn as of the initial expiration of the offer (excluding 2,809,498 shares, representing approximately 5.5% of the aggregate number of shares outstanding, tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been delivered in settlement or satisfaction of such guarantee).  Avast Software B.V. and Avast Holding B.V. have accepted for payment all shares that were validly tendered and were not properly withdrawn from the offer, and payment for such shares will be made promptly in accordance with the terms of the offer.  
Avast Software B.V. and Avast Holding B.V. also announced today the commencement of a subsequent offering period scheduled to expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on October 14, 2016. Avast may extend the subsequent offering period to provide for a minority exit offering period of up to 10 business days to provide AVG shareholders who have not yet tendered their shares the opportunity to do so. All shares validly tendered during the subsequent offering period will be immediately accepted for payment, and tendering holders will thereafter promptly be paid the same form and amount of offer consideration as in the initial offering period.  The procedures for tendering shares during the subsequent offering period are the same as those applicable to the initial offering period, except that (i) the guaranteed delivery procedures may not be used during the subsequent offering period and (ii) no withdrawal rights will apply to shares tendered during the subsequent offering period. 
As more fully described in the offer to purchase, if the number of shares purchased during the subsequent offering period (including, if applicable, the minority exit offering period), together with the shares purchased during the initial offering period, is equal to at least 95% of the outstanding ordinary shares of AVG, Avast expects to acquire the ordinary shares of AVG that were not tendered into the tender offer through the compulsory share acquisition process under Section 2:92a/2:201a of the Dutch Civil Code.  If the number of shares purchased during the subsequent offering period (including, if applicable, the minority exit offering period), together with the shares purchased during the initial offering period, is less than 95% of the outstanding ordinary shares of AVG, Avast plans to effect an asset sale pursuant to which Avast will acquire substantially all of the assets, and assume substantially all of the liabilities, of AVG promptly following the tender offer.  Following the completion of the asset sale, AVG will be liquidated and the remaining minority shareholders of AVG will receive cash distributions with respect to each ordinary share owned by them equal to the per share cash consideration paid in the tender offer less any applicable dividend withholding tax or any other taxes.
As soon as practicable following the completion of the subsequent offering period (including, if applicable, the minority exit offering period), AVG intends to voluntarily delist its shares from the New York Stock Exchange.  AVG also intends to deregister its shares under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (as amended, the “Exchange Act”) and to suspend its reporting obligations under the Exchange Act, but will only be  eligible to do so upon satisfaction of the applicable requirements for deregistration.
AVG has submitted written notice to the New York Stock Exchange of its intent to voluntarily delist its shares from the New York Stock Exchange in connection with the tender offer. AVG intends to file a Form 25, Notification of Removal from Listing and/or Registration under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to delist its shares promptly following the subsequent offering period. Delisting from the NYSE is expected to become effective 10 days after the filing date of the Form 25.
The AVG shares will not be listed or registered on another national securities exchange.  Delisting is likely to reduce significantly the liquidity and marketability of any AVG shares that have not been tendered pursuant to the tender offer.
Advisors
Jefferies International Limited is acting as exclusive financial advisor, and White & Case LLP and De Brauw Blackstone Westbroek N.V. are acting as legal advisors to Avast.  Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC is acting as financial advisor to AVG, Bridge Street Securities, LLC is acting as financial advisor to the supervisory board of AVG, and Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP and Allen & Overy LLP are acting as legal advisors to AVG.

Forward-Looking Statements

This press release contains forward-looking information that involves substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. All statements other than statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terms such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “should,” “will,” “expect,” “are confident that,” “objective,” “projection,” “forecast,” “goal,” “guidance,” “outlook,” “effort,” “target,” “would” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terms. There are a number of important factors that could cause actual events to differ materially from those suggested or indicated by such forward-looking statements and you should not place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. These factors include risks and uncertainties related to, among other things: general economic conditions and conditions affecting the industries in which Avast and AVG operate; the uncertainty of regulatory approvals; AVG's delisting from the New York Stock Exchange and suspension of AVG's reporting obligations under the Exchange Act and to consummate the transactions and their plans described in this press release; and AVG's performance and maintenance of important business relationships. Additional information regarding the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements is available in AVG's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including AVG's Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2015. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this release and neither Avast nor AVG assumes any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events and developments or otherwise, except as required by law.
Additional Information and Where to Find It 
This press release does not constitute an offer to purchase or a solicitation of an offer to sell any securities of AVG.  The solicitation and offer to purchase ordinary shares of AVG is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO, including an Offer to Purchase, a related letter of transmittal and certain other tender offer documents, filed by Avast with the SEC on July 29, 2016 (as subsequently amended, the “Tender Offer Statement”).  AVG filed a solicitation/recommendation statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the tender offer with the SEC on July 29, 2016 (as subsequently amended, the “Solicitation/Recommendation Statement”).  AVG shareholders are urged to read the Tender Offer Statement and Solicitation/Recommendation Statement, as they may be amended from time to time, as well as any other relevant documents filed with the SEC, carefully and in their entirety because they will contain important information that AVG shareholders should consider before making any decision regarding tendering their securities.  The Tender Offer Statement and the Solicitation/Recommendation Statement are available for free at the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. Copies of the documents filed with the SEC by AVG will be available free of charge on AVG's website at investors.avg.com.

According the trusty dictionary malware is “software which is specifically designed to disrupt, damage, or gain authorized access to a computer system”. Pretty nasty stuff.

Anti-malware software is something you should seriously consider looking into.

                        Does my computer need protection from viruses?

Imagine checking your bank balance and it saying zero? Imagine all your friends on Facebook are sent a harmful link by someone who has hacked your account? How about logging onto your computer and seeing that your most important documents are being held for ransom? Pretty scary stuff. Here’s why and how you can protect yourself…

Choosing to protect yourself against viruses can be such a crucial decision. Especially when it comes to safeguarding personal details online.  But choosing which anti-virus software to go for can be a tricky decision. With so many to choose from all different types of developers small and large, make sure you make the right decision and go for anti-virus software that packs these features…

Who Needs Antivirus Software?These days, everybody needs antivirus software.Computer viruses don’t just come from streaming or downloading movies. Many people think that they can avoid potential threats by making sure they don’t visit certain websites or download certain files.The truth is computer viruses can make their way onto your computer or any other device in a number of ways. You can pick up viruses and malware simply by checking your email, browsing the web or from putting a USB memory stick into your laptop.Virus protection is a requisite of having your own personal computer. Luckily for you, there are hundreds of choices of antivirus software – each with its pros and cons. Making a choice between internet security software can be difficult, but that’s what we’re here for!How Antivirus WorksMost antivirus software works on a signature database, monitoring the internet 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Every time a new virus is reported – it’s indexed, catalogued and added to the software’s database. Once your antivirus software is up-to-date it is equipped to tackle the new virus should it ever reach your device.How to Handle VirusesYou often have three options when faced with a threat on your computer: delete the threat, quarantine it or ignore it.Deleting is almost always the best option, but some viruses make themselves "un-deletable" and quarantining becomes your only option. Your quarantine folder will keep the virus isolated and prevent it from spreading or causing damage to other files. Antivirus can be passive or active – passive requires you to make scheduled or manual virus scans, while active runs in the background; detecting and fighting threats in real-time.Free vs Paid Antivirus SoftwareIf you are deciding on a new antivirus software and may want to try a free version, keep in mind that there are pros and cons for both paid and free versions. Using a free antivirus software can cost you more in the long run and most experts suggest that it’s better to use a paid version. Free versions can be great to try a new software or set of features, but will never provide the same level of protection - and your service most certainly won’t include internet security software.Paid versions of an antivirus software will cover both online and offline activities, permanently delete sensitive digital files and provide extra encryption to protect your most private files from malware like Trojans, worms and ransomware.A paid antivirus software is especially helpful if you have a PC or device that has already been infected. Many paid versions offer virus removal and cleanup tools, in addition to the highest-quality prevention and detection rates.Extra FeaturesThere are a few key features that you should look out for when looking for antivirus software, and it will vary depending on your needs.Online Protection - If you’re online, then you probably want an internet security software with a built-in firewall.Email Protection - If you’re a heavy email user then you’ll want be on the lookout for anti-spam, spyware and phishing.Parental Controls - Parents need to look for software with easy-to-use parental controls and restrictions.Gaming Protection - Gamers can look forward to a "gaming mode," which prompts the internet security software to use less resources.Compatibility - You will want to check the compatibility of your chosen software with your operating system, whether that be Windows protection, Mac OS antivirus and everything in between.How We Review & ScoreChoosing the best antivirus software should be much easier with our expert reviews. Our experts have analyzed some of the best choices on the market, and each review covers a wide range of topics, including:PricingFeaturesEase of useOverall value for moneyCustomer supportUser experienceIndependent testingBut it’s up to you to decide which is the most applicable for your needs. If you need more help, checkout all of our in-depth, expert reviews. These will help you understand what you should look out for and how to find the perfect antivirus solution.Copyright © 2009-2017 Natural Intelligence Ltd. All Rights Reserved.

McAfee Review
By: Craig Chamberlin Best ForHome and business solutions of any sizeMultiple devices - licenses include protection for unlimited devicesPC Optimization - free tools include email spam blocking and parental controlProsEasy to use, install and manageAbove average detection rates and protection100% guaranteed virus removalConsAbove average price to its counterpartsUses more system resources than other antivirus packages Bottom LineMcAfee delivers a well priced package with above average detection rates. McAfee's packages include options for built in PC optimization tools, parental controls, email spam blocking, hacker and thief firewall protection and social media link protection for unlimited devices. Don't like reading? Watch our video review instead! Visit McAfeeWhy Choose McAfee?McAfee is one of the most well-known antivirus providers, and for good reason. Whether you need virus protection for home or for your business, there are several options available. Although the real time protection and performance come in at an average rating, many users may find the easy to use interface, excellent customer support and money back guarantee enough to curb those concerns.What McAfee Offers: Password managerEmail spam blockerEncryption softwareParental controlsComplete online protectionFree coverage for smartphones and tabletsPackage Features and Highlights:Features: Full Featured Protection Ease of Use: Easiest for Users Reliability: Above Average Value: Average  Money Back Guarantee: 30-Day McAfee AntiVirus - Includes full antivirus protection with free 24/7 support and built in PC optimization tools for a single device.McAfee Internet Security - Includes full antivirus protection with free 24/7 support, built in PC optimization tools, parental controls and e-mail and spam blocking for unlimited devices.McAfee Total Protection - Includes full antivirus protection with free 24/7 support, built in PC optimization tools, parental controls, email spam blocking, hacker and thief firewall protection and social media link protection for unlimited devices. Protect private files with encryption software and safely store your passwords with the True Key app.Ease of UseMcAfee Antivirus software is probably the easiest antivirus packages in the market to use. The simplicity of the primary dashboard ensures users know the current state of its operating system protection. Performing both quick and full scans is only a few clicks away, and it’s easy to set up auto scans.   This antivirus has all features enabled and pre-configured instantly after installation, without the need for a reboot. Although many antivirus products have a somewhat sketchy past, the current generation of software delivers.Users can also easily configure parental controls, firewall, anti-spam settings, scheduled virus scans and update settings directly from the user interface. All navigation is laid out in a very intuitive way that walks users through configuring what settings best fits their needs. Detection Rates and ReliabilityWhen comparing reliability, most antivirus packages need to hold their own in two primary areas of antivirus protection: virus detection through traditional virus scanning and real-time protection as files are saved to the system.According to AV-Comparatives, a prominent 3rd-party virus testing company, all McAfee antivirus packages are in the top tier for traditional virus file detection. And while not as strong  for real-time scanning protection, McAfee still came back with an average score.  Value for MoneyOverall and compared to its competitors, McAfee offers great packages at a reasonable price. Its antivirus definitely offers a lot in the way of file detection, and there are plenty of extra features even with the most basic packages.When determining value, it is important to weigh the benefits of ease of use against the costs of performance and detection rates. A great value added is that beyond the basic service, this package includes licenses for unlimited devices.Help & SupportMcAfee provides customers with extensive support options, including their Antivirus support website completely dedicated to frequently asked questions and an online knowledge base. Depending on their comfort level, users can use the online chat system, make a phone call or even purchase various support packages.User ExperienceIt's important to note that McAfee products tend to use more resources than other antivirus products, which can result in some performance loss on the system. Many users will find that most antivirus software packages that are simple to use tend to use more resources than others.If you are worried about a slow device, changing the settings in your antivirus package can help, as well a free virus scans that are offered on the McAfee website.Review in Short McAfee is one of the biggest and most trusted names in antivirus software. McAfee provides secure total protection for your computer and devices. No matter which package you choose you will have access to free 24/7 support, parental controls and a 30-day money-back guarantee.When you spend a little more for the internet security and total protection packages, you get anti-malware, anti-theft and file protection for any Mac, Windows or Android device. You can also opt for parental controls, anti-spam to block dangerous emails and the True Key app to store your passwords and usernames.About McAfeeSince 1987, McAfee has been creating antivirus and computer security products. As one of the original pioneers of the antivirus market, antivirus packages such as McAfee Antivirus Plus, McAfee Internet Security and McAfee Total Protection are often packaged with pre-built computer systems from companies such as Dell, Acer and Lenovo.  Today, McAfee Corporation is owned by Intel Corporation and updates their security software packages at their security center in Santa Clara, California.    Visit McAfee    About Craig Chamberlin    Craig the Tech Teacher is your source for common sense 			  advice for the tech in your life.  For over 10 years I've worked with technology, so let me work with   			  you.  Follow Craig on Google+  Last Updated: April, 2017

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
