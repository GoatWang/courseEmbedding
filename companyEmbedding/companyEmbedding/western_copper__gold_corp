Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Western Copper and Gold Corp (TSE:WRN) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 3.00)Consensus Price Target: C$2.00

Sustainability









Western Copper and Gold is committed to operating in a way consistent with the goals of Sustainable Development.
The Casino project is being developed in a manner that respects and protects the environment and enhances benefits to nearby communities using sound and proven technologies and industry best practices. We recognize that this is vital to our company’s existence, progress and continued development.
We recognize that Casino will have an effect on communities.  We know that our operations are not only important to our shareholders, but also to the communities in which we operate.  And, we believe that establishing strong collaborative relationships and open and transparent communication will help ensure our projects operate at the highest standards possible.
Environment
Western Copper and Gold in its everyday operation takes positive action to protect the safety of its workers and be conscientious stewards of our natural resources while minimizing the impact on the environment. We are applying appropriate technology and we are conducting ourselves responsibly at all stages of mining: exploration, mine development, mine production and processing, decommissioning and reclamation.
Western Copper and Gold is committed to achieving the following four objectives during construction, operation, reclamation and closure of the mine:

Protect public health and safety
Minimize, mitigate or prevent adverse environmental impacts
Reclaim the site to a land use state consistent with surrounding conditions
Ensure long-term stability of the spent ore and waste rock storage area and site water quality

Social Responsibility
Western Copper and Gold believes we must be good corporate citizens, employ ethical business practices and engage with proximate communities, businesses and governments to be consistent with the goals of social responsibility.
We are working in partnership with Yukon and First Nation governments and local governments, employees, contractors and suppliers, other stakeholders and interest groups, and the public in general with the objective of creating lasting benefits.
We believe that Casino will make a significant and positive contribution to the well being of the people living in the provinces or territories in which we operate.  We are committed to providing opportunities to generate wealth and to establish mutually beneficial partnerships.
Community Engagement
Western Copper and Gold, through Casino Mining Corporation, is committed to respect the people who live near our projects, including their rights, languages, cultures and livelihoods.
The company believes that its future operations can provide opportunities and long-lasting benefits for nearby communities while respecting traditional livelihoods and land use.  This can be achieved by building a relationship based on respect that is open, fair and allows for the mutual exchange of information.
Western Copper and Gold will work with First Nation governments in designing and conducting consultation that meets the needs of their communities and respects the rights and traditions of First Nations.
