Telecom Argentina is the major local telephone company for the northern part of Argentina, including the whole of the city of Buenos Aires. Briefly known as Sociedad Licenciataria Norte S.A., it quickly changed its name, and is usually known as simply Telecom within Argentina.
Telecom Argentina's local telephone market, together with Telefónica de Argentina in the southern part of the country, was part of a duopoly until October 8, 1999. Telecom also operates mobile phone service Personal and Internet service provider Arnet.

History[edit]
In 1990, Argentina started to privatize most of its state-owned utilities: power, water, trains, and telecommunications, just to name a few. The monopoly of state-owned phone service ENTel was split into two territories: France Télécom was given the "upper half" of the country, from the middle to the north, and Telefónica was given the southern part. Each company was given an initial 7 year monopoly beginning on November 8, 1990. Initially, other companies were given exclusive licenses for international long distance, as well as cellular phone service. France Télécom later sold its part of the company to the Argentinian Werthein Group.
Its Puerto Madero headquarters were designed by the American architectural studio of Kohn Pedersen Fox, and inaugurated on February 18, 1998.

Both local phone companies turned their systems into profitable operations in just a few years, despite the terrible conditions they inherited from ENTel. In the worst years of ENTel, a line activation would take several years. The telephone wiring layout across the country was undocumented. At privatization in 1990, the wait was still 4 years to get new service and 40 days for repair.[1]
Starting off with severe downsizings, Telecom Argentina started to invest into the country, but there was little outside capital investment; rather, a small portion of earnings were reinvested. Years later, all of the phone network was upgraded to a state-of-the-art system, from central telephone exchanges up to the wires going into homes; by 2005, 98% of the ENTel network infrastructure had been replaced.
Unlike many other privatized companies, Telecom got an inefficient company and turned it into a working, profitable company. In contrast, the train lines (which cost the state roughly US$1,000,000 per day in losses to operate 30,000 km of railroads), were sold to private corporations, it still cost the state US$1,000,000 per day in subsidies to operate 1,400 km of railroads.
In 2005, the Bank of New York was appointed as trustee, registrar and paying and transfer agent for Telecom Argentina's $1.5 billion debt restructuring, the biggest Argentine debt restructuring to date. The restructure involved the exchange of $2.8 billion in outstanding debt for newly issued exchange notes and cash, and involved consent requests and instructions for over 1100 creditors.[2]
Personal[edit]




Logo of Personal, the mobile-phone division of Telecom Argentina.


Telecom Personal S.A., owned by Telecom Argentina, is one of only 3 mobile phone companies in Argentina. Personal used a similar logo to Telecom itself until November 2011, when they switched into a new handwritten logo combined with nine brand colors.[3][4]
Telecom Personal owns 67.5% of Paraguayan mobile provider Núcleo S.A., which started in 1998 and also does business under the brand name Personal.[5]
Telecom Argentina has agreed with Uruguayan state telcom ANTEL to operate as a reseller of Ancel services in that country. Mexican mobile phone Claro has asked the national telecommunications regulating entity not to allow Personal to arrive to Uruguay.[6]

Criticism[edit]





This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (November 2010) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Critics of Telecom argue that, when it received government subsidies to provide service in remote areas, it either didn't provide the service, or just installed public telephones. Critics also point to the high prices charged by the company, and to the fact that, unlike much of the world, Argentine customers have to pay per minute, rather than a fixed price.
In contrast, defendants of the system point out that the 011 area code (called AMBA, most of Gran Buenos Aires) provides local phone access to five to six million users (15-16% of the total population of the country), making a flat-rate type of service economically impossible.
Due to the lack of long requested flat telephone rates for local calls, specially to connect to Internet, a lot of users installed ADSL services from Arnet, Telecom's Internet service provider. The company was heavily criticised when it decided to limit ADSL users to 4 GB per month and charge for extra traffic, a decision which was promptly reversed.
Other critics to the company are centred on the lack of information on their offers, and obscure contracts with prices not including taxes, and other important information.
Ownership[edit]
As of 2016, current approximate ownership of Telecom Argentina is:[7]

54.74% by Nortel Inversora S.A., controlled by Sofora Telecomunicaciones, a consortium made up of:

Werthein Group (32%)
Fintech Telecom LLC (68%)


45.23% publicly traded
0.03% employee stock ownership program

Years later, all of the phone network was upgraded to a state-of-the-art system, from central telephone exchanges up to the wires going into homes; by 2005, 98% of the ENTel network infrastructure had been replaced.
Unlike many other privatized companies, Telecom got an inefficient company and turned it into a working, profitable company. In contrast, the train lines (which cost the state roughly US$1,000,000 per day in losses to operate 30,000 km of railroads), were sold to private corporations, it still cost the state US$1,000,000 per day in subsidies to operate 1,400 km of railroads.
In 2005, the Bank of New York was appointed as trustee, registrar and paying and transfer agent for Telecom Argentina's $1.5 billion debt restructuring, the biggest Argentine debt restructuring to date. The restructure involved the exchange of $2.8 billion in outstanding debt for newly issued exchange notes and cash, and involved consent requests and instructions for over 1100 creditors.[2]
Personal[edit]

Telecom Personal S.A., owned by Telecom Argentina, is one of only 3 mobile phone companies in Argentina. Personal used a similar logo to Telecom itself until November 2011, when they switched into a new handwritten logo combined with nine brand colors.[3][4]
Telecom Personal owns 67.5% of Paraguayan mobile provider Núcleo S.A., which started in 1998 and also does business under the brand name Personal.[5]
Telecom Argentina has agreed with Uruguayan state telcom ANTEL to operate as a reseller of Ancel services in that country. Mexican mobile phone Claro has asked the national telecommunications regulating entity not to allow Personal to arrive to Uruguay.[6]

Criticism[edit]





This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (November 2010) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Critics of Telecom argue that, when it received government subsidies to provide service in remote areas, it either didn't provide the service, or just installed public telephones. Critics also point to the high prices charged by the company, and to the fact that, unlike much of the world, Argentine customers have to pay per minute, rather than a fixed price.
In contrast, defendants of the system point out that the 011 area code (called AMBA, most of Gran Buenos Aires) provides local phone access to five to six million users (15-16% of the total population of the country), making a flat-rate type of service economically impossible.
Due to the lack of long requested flat telephone rates for local calls, specially to connect to Internet, a lot of users installed ADSL services from Arnet, Telecom's Internet service provider. The company was heavily criticised when it decided to limit ADSL users to 4 GB per month and charge for extra traffic, a decision which was promptly reversed.
Other critics to the company are centred on the lack of information on their offers, and obscure contracts with prices not including taxes, and other important information.
Ownership[edit]
As of 2016, current approximate ownership of Telecom Argentina is:[7]

54.74% by Nortel Inversora S.A., controlled by Sofora Telecomunicaciones, a consortium made up of:

Werthein Group (32%)
Fintech Telecom LLC (68%)


45.23% publicly traded
0.03% employee stock ownership program

Telecom Argentina is the major local telephone company for the northern part of Argentina, including the whole of the city of Buenos Aires. Briefly known as Sociedad Licenciataria Norte S.A., it quickly changed its name, and is usually known as simply Telecom within Argentina.
Telecom Argentina's local telephone market, together with Telefónica de Argentina in the southern part of the country, was part of a duopoly until October 8, 1999. Telecom also operates mobile phone service Personal and Internet service provider Arnet.

History[edit]
In 1990, Argentina started to privatize most of its state-owned utilities: power, water, trains, and telecommunications, just to name a few. The monopoly of state-owned phone service ENTel was split into two territories: France Télécom was given the "upper half" of the country, from the middle to the north, and Telefónica was given the southern part. Each company was given an initial 7 year monopoly beginning on November 8, 1990. Initially, other companies were given exclusive licenses for international long distance, as well as cellular phone service. France Télécom later sold its part of the company to the Argentinian Werthein Group.
Its Puerto Madero headquarters were designed by the American architectural studio of Kohn Pedersen Fox, and inaugurated on February 18, 1998.

Both local phone companies turned their systems into profitable operations in just a few years, despite the terrible conditions they inherited from ENTel. In the worst years of ENTel, a line activation would take several years. The telephone wiring layout across the country was undocumented. At privatization in 1990, the wait was still 4 years to get new service and 40 days for repair.[1]
Starting off with severe downsizings, Telecom Argentina started to invest into the country, but there was little outside capital investment; rather, a small portion of earnings were reinvested. Years later, all of the phone network was upgraded to a state-of-the-art system, from central telephone exchanges up to the wires going into homes; by 2005, 98% of the ENTel network infrastructure had been replaced.

The restructure involved the exchange of $2.8 billion in outstanding debt for newly issued exchange notes and cash, and involved consent requests and instructions for over 1100 creditors.[2]
Personal[edit]




Logo of Personal, the mobile-phone division of Telecom Argentina.


Telecom Personal S.A., owned by Telecom Argentina, is one of only 3 mobile phone companies in Argentina. Personal used a similar logo to Telecom itself until November 2011, when they switched into a new handwritten logo combined with nine brand colors.[3][4]
Telecom Personal owns 67.5% of Paraguayan mobile provider Núcleo S.A., which started in 1998 and also does business under the brand name Personal.[5]
Telecom Argentina has agreed with Uruguayan state telcom ANTEL to operate as a reseller of Ancel services in that country. Mexican mobile phone Claro has asked the national telecommunications regulating entity not to allow Personal to arrive to Uruguay.[6]

Criticism[edit]





This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (November 2010) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Critics of Telecom argue that, when it received government subsidies to provide service in remote areas, it either didn't provide the service, or just installed public telephones. Critics also point to the high prices charged by the company, and to the fact that, unlike much of the world, Argentine customers have to pay per minute, rather than a fixed price.
In contrast, defendants of the system point out that the 011 area code (called AMBA, most of Gran Buenos Aires) provides local phone access to five to six million users (15-16% of the total population of the country), making a flat-rate type of service economically impossible.
Due to the lack of long requested flat telephone rates for local calls, specially to connect to Internet, a lot of users installed ADSL services from Arnet, Telecom's Internet service provider. The company was heavily criticised when it decided to limit ADSL users to 4 GB per month and charge for extra traffic, a decision which was promptly reversed.
Other critics to the company are centred on the lack of information on their offers, and obscure contracts with prices not including taxes, and other important information.
Ownership[edit]
As of 2016, current approximate ownership of Telecom Argentina is:[7]

54.74% by Nortel Inversora S.A., controlled by Sofora Telecomunicaciones, a consortium made up of:

Werthein Group (32%)
Fintech Telecom LLC (68%)


45.23% publicly traded
0.03% employee stock ownership program

                Mercado Libre, YPF to be surpassed by $11.5 billion entity
            



                Billionaire David Martinez to control largest ownership stake
            



Billionaire David Martinez may have a tougher time keeping a low profile now that he’s presiding over a merger that will create Argentina’s biggest public company.Telecom Argentina SA’s combination with Cablevision SA will produce a telecommunications powerhouse with a market value of $11.5 billion, according to brokerage TPCG. The top shareholder of the new company will be Martinez, a native of Monterrey, Mexico, who splits his time between New York and London and rarely grants interviews.







                        Exclusive insights on technology around the world.
                    

                        Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology.

The combined company will be the first in Argentina to be legally permitted to offer packages of wireless, landline, fixed internet and television services to consumers. The deal was a result of President Mauricio Macri’s reform policies and “will trigger service quality and the digitization of the country,” putting pressure on Telefonica SA and America Movil to invest and cut prices, Argentina Communications Minister Oscar Aguad said in a July 4 phone interview.




Martinez, a one-time candidate for priesthood who instead became a distressed-debt wizard, shouldn’t face hurdles in getting regulatory approval for the deal, Aguad said. Telefonica, which provides wireless, landline and internet plans in Argentina but isn’t yet allowed to offer video, has said it’s unfair to let its rival get a head start on selling the full package of services.The valuation TPCG calculated for the combined Telecom-Cablevision assumes its shares will trade in line with the average of Latin American peers, said Florencia Mayorga Torres, an analyst at the brokerage. That would make the company cheaper than well-established providers of multiple telecommunications services, such as Mexico’s America Movil SAB, Chile’s Entel SA and Brazil’s Oi SA, she said.Among Argentine companies, the equity value would slightly surpass Mercado Libre Inc., at $11.4 billion, and state-controlled YPF SA, at $8.7 billion.




Under merger terms announced last weekend, Telecom Argentina will issue 1.19 billion new shares to the owners of Cablevision. After the deal closes, Cablevision’s holders will own 55 percent of Telecom Argentina, with the phone company’s investors holding the rest.Martinez holds stakes in both companies. Including several indirect stakes in Nortel Inversora SA, his ownership of the combined company will be as much as 40.5 percent. The second-largest shareholder will be Argentine media giant Grupo Clarin SA, which will indirectly own 33 percent of the new company.




Martinez’s total fortune is valued at $3.7 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, an estimate that assumes he remains sole owner of Fintech.Representatives from Telefonica and America Movil didn’t reply to requests for comment.— With assistance by Carolina Millan

Where applicable, a project is considered as such until the end of construction and ramp-up to full capacity (with the exception of mining projects, where the date of commissioning signifies the end of the project). Projects must have a:  a) Start date b) Estimate for completion c) Initial investment estimate  Data For state-owned projects, initial information about the start date and estimates for completion and investment are taken from original signed contracts, along with addendums and annexes. If original contracts cannot be obtained, information is taken from public documents, presentations, news articles from BNamericas archives, and external sources. In cases where contracts are subject to approval by legislators, the start date is the date of the law or legislative approval. In the case of private projects, information is taken from public sources, such as stock exchange filings, annual reports, company presentations, third party research and press releases. In judging the timing of investment decisions for private projects, great care was taken to differentiate between large projects receiving environmental approval and proceeding directly to construction, and smaller projects where the investment decision hinges on securing financing. Best care is taken to ensure that recorded data is correct at the time of entry and that each entry is backed with a relevant source. The greatest care possible was taken to ensure consistency of information in order make a like-for-like comparison in project costs. Insofar as the figures rely on disclosure by the organization or company responsible, the figures can be considered to be conservative in nature. No attempt was made to adjust figures for inflation during the course of research or for consideration of the time value of money. Validation In the case of state-owned projects, validation is carried out where possible with either a member of the consortium, EPC contractor, a relevant state agency or advisors to either party. Currency Projects costs are measured in US dollars. Where project costs are measured in a local currency, amounts are converted to US dollars at the date of the relevant announcement, signature or report.  Severity of deviation from original estimates The severity of deviation from original estimates is defined according to set criteria. Timing    Status Condition     Ahead of time 95% of original estimate or below (measured in months)   On time 95% to 105% of original estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original estimate   Medium changes 120% to 160% of original estimate   Major changes Over 160% of original estimate    Budget    Status Condition     Ahead of budget 95% of original budget estimate or below   To budget 95% to 105% of original budget estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original budget estimate   Medium changes 120% to 140% of original budget estimate   Major changes Over 140% of original budget estimate    Changes in Scope Changes in scope beyond the start date are not accounted for. Language definitions Where guidance is non-specific as to dates for completion, the following is used. Project to be completed by 2018 = December 31, 2017 Project to be completed in 2018 = December 31, 2018
