This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

BLOOMINGTON, Minn. (August 22, 2006)   The Toro Company (NYSE: TTC) today announced that Timothy P. Dordell will join the company as vice president and deputy general counsel, effective November 6. Dordell, who joins Toro from Ecolab Inc., is to succeed Larry McIntyre as general counsel upon McIntyre's retirement in the spring of 2007 after 14 years with the company. 
During the transition, McIntyre will continue to serve as vice president, secretary and general counsel, and Dordell will report directly to him as he becomes acquainted with Toro's culture, business strategies, operations and markets.

His responsibilities include managing the law department's corporate group, along with oversight of Sarbanes-Oxley and corporate governance, SEC compliance, and board activities. While at Ecolab, Dordell also served as senior attorney of mergers and acquisitions, and international law.

Attorney of the Month Tim Dordell


 
A Lawyer in the Corporate World
 
By Lesley Boyd
Upon celebrating The Toro Company’s Centennial in 2014 with fellow employees and channel partners, vice president, secretary and general counsel, Tim Dordell, reflected on the path that led him to what he considers “one of the best legal positions in the country.” With its headquarters in Bloomington, Minnesota, The Toro Company is a leading worldwide provider of innovative solutions for the outdoor environment including turf, snow and ground engaging equipment, and irrigation and outdoor lighting solutions. With sales of $2.2 billion in fiscal 2014, Toro’s global presence extends to more than 90 countries.
Citing his father as a main influence, Dordell had early aspirations to become an attorney. A managing partner at a mid-size firm in St. Paul, Dordell’s father made a huge impact on his son’s view of the practice of law.
“My father was a lawyer’s lawyer,” he said. “He practiced corporate and banking law, insurance defense and workers’ comp, tried and appealed cases to the Minnesota Supreme Court and the Eighth Circuit, and did everything in between,” recalled Dordell. “I always admired his love of the law, the intellectual challenge he found in it, the tenacity when representing clients as well as his civility toward colleagues and opposing counsel, and I’ve tried to follow his example.” Dordell’s father passed away in 2011.
A Twin Cities native, Dordell always appreciated the people and civic and business communities in Minnesota. But, he realized that as soon as he graduated from law school, he had some wanderlust and wanted to get out and explore another part of the country, too.
Following law school, Dordell moved to Phoenix to practice corporate securities law with a large law firm. Several years later, he accepted his first in-house position with a local direct marketing and cable television production company, which ended up in bankruptcy. “I learned a lot,” he said, “about the kind of company I wanted to be a part of in the future.” An opportunity then arose to move back to Minnesota to join a large local firm, which he accepted and relocated back to his home state. Several years later, Dordell transitioned back into an in-house counsel position at Ecolab Inc., where he rose through the ranks from a senior attorney to the associate general counsel and assistant secretary over the course of nearly a decade.
“It’s less typical to enter into an in-house corporate law position right out of school, but many attorneys migrate into the corporate setting after receiving excellent training in private practice,” said Dordell. “I encourage new lawyers to follow their interests and passions to find the best fit and use of their law degree. Ultimately, an in-house role is the right fit for me. As general counsel, I have a variety of responsibilities, but for an in-house legal team it’s ultimately about being a critical partner to help drive company-wide business objectives.”
Today, Dordell leads Toro’s legal department which is comprised of 20 employees with nine attorneys and the balance consisting of paralegals, regulatory professionals and support staff. Due to his background as a corporate securities attorney, he has experience in merger and acquisition transactions, fiduciary oversight of the employees’ 401(k) plan, and New York Stock Exchange and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission compliance requirements. Dordell is also part of the CEO’s senior staff.
“I have great respect for a solo practitioner or single in-house general counsel because their job is so broad,” noted Dordell, perhaps thinking about the breadth of his father’s practice. “But here at The Toro Company, I am grateful for our legal team where each member not only has subject matter expertise, but also is connected to business divisions or corporate functions where their roles allow them to offer sound legal advice and counsel to their Toro colleagues. I’m proud of the skill and experience they bring to the job.
“By helping achieve business objectives,” Dordell continued, “we’re valued members of the Toro team – and valued by our Toro teammates.”
Typically, a requirement to join an in-house legal department would be a Juris Doctor degree or paralegal certificate. But, Dordell notes that the Toro legal team has expanded its scope to encompass global product and packaging regulatory compliance – and individuals with plant, operational and other experiences have joined the team. As another example, Heather Hille, whose focus is real estate law, helped lead the recent facility expansion project to grow the company’s product development and testing capacities and secure additional space at Toro’s headquarter campus. In addition, former associate general counsel, Amy Dahl, now focuses on investor relations and leads the corporate communications team. Dordell is proud of the team’s expanded responsibilities and accomplishments, and how others are leveraging their legal background to pursue growth opportunities outside of the department.
Meanwhile, his team stays focused and true to their core mission to help achieve business objectives, keep The Toro Company compliant with the constantly changing global regulations, adhere to an ethical code of conduct, protect intellectual property rights, support strong corporate governance, and resolve disputes.
Product integrity is a hot topic for the company. Dordell’s team focuses on a three-step process to help the company design safe products and, ultimately, mitigate product liability claims that arise. First of all, there is good communication between his team and the engineering and customer care teams to stress proper and safe design and use of the company’s products. Secondly, should an accident occur, the team will intervene quickly and conduct an accident investigation. “The key,” he says, “is to treat the individual as an unhappy customer, not a litigation adversary.” Finally, the team strives for a resolution through negotiation or mediation. He stresses that most people realize that they were using products for inappropriate tasks or otherwise in a way contrary to the intended use and instructions.
While Dordell and his team comprise a fairly large legal department, they recognize the need to focus on specific high-value business priorities while seeking outside counsel for lower priority tasks or items that may not fall under the in-house expertise umbrella. “For example,” he says, “we don’t have in-house attorneys that stand up in the courtroom to argue motions to judges or make closing arguments to juries.” Stressing the necessity to choose the right partner for the right project, the team uses a “convergence model” to describe how they partner with outside counsel.
The team begins by collaborating with key outside counsel partners to create synergies and strengthen long-term relationships built on trust, respect, integrity and teamwork. Through clear communication, they ensure that partners understand The Toro Company’s objectives and that the team understands where their partners’ strengths and weaknesses lay in regard to achieving the goals. Together, they develop strategies and set expectations. Based on these steps, the correct fit for each project with an outside counsel partner is determined. “Pick the right partner for the right project” is Dordell’s mantra.
In addition to his duties as general counsel, Dordell also serves on the board of The Toro Foundation, whose mission is to help enrich the lives, the land, the communities and the industries Toro serves. Outside the office, Dordell currently serves on the board of a local musical theater group, called Theater Latté Da, and previously he served as a member of the board of directors for the Minnesota AIDS Project.
“I received a wise perspective on the job from my former boss at Ecolab,” recalled Dordell, “after accepting the offer to join The Toro Company. He said, a general counsel position is as good as it gets when you are part of a growing and profitable company with a good culture, there’s a collegial and engaged board that provides sound oversight, the CEO drives performance and sets the tone at the top while giving the general counsel a seat at the table, and, most importantly, you are surrounded by a team of strong and valued legal professionals that work together to help the company succeed.”
If those are pillars of a successful position, Dordell admits that he is one lucky guy.

About Profile Visibility
Profile Visibility is based on the total number of weekly profile views. It provides a weekly snapshot of
            which profiles users are viewing on martindale.com in the form of a ranking. We do not differentiate in
            the case of a tie, which may mean a number of attorneys in the same city display the same
            ranking. For example, if three lawyers each received 20 profiles views last week in Atlanta, and 20 is the
            highest number of profile views for that week, all three lawyers would receive a #1 ranking.

About Peer Rating
Martindale-Hubbell® Peer Review Ratings™ are the gold standard in attorney ratings, and have been for more than a century. These ratings indicate attorneys who are widely respected by their peers for their ethical standards and legal expertise in a specific area of practice.


The Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings process is the gold standard due to its objectivity and comprehensiveness. Lawyers solicited for peer reviews include both those selected by the attorney being reviewed and lawyers independently selected by Martindale-Hubbell. All reviewers are verified as attorneys through Martindale-Hubbell's extensive attorney database. Only attorneys practicing at least three years and receiving a sufficient number of reviews from non-affiliated attorneys are eligible to receive a Rating.
What are the different Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings?
AV Preeminent®: The highest peer rating standard. This rating signifies that a large number of the lawyer's peers rank him or her at the highest level of professional excellence for their legal knowledge, communication skills and ethical standards.
Distinguished: An excellent rating for a lawyer with some experience. This rating indicates the attorney is widely respected by their peers for high professional achievement and ethical standards.
Notable: This rating indicates that the lawyer has been recognized by a large number of their peers for strong ethical standards.
Lawyers who have received peer reviews after 2009 will display more detailed information, including practice areas, summary ratings, detailed numeric ratings and written feedback (if available). Details for individual reviews received before 2009 are not displayed.
Attorneys that receive reviews from their peers, but not a sufficient number to establish a Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating, will have those reviews display on our websites.
For more information on Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings™, please visit our Ratings Page on Martindale.com and our Frequently Asked Questions

About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.

Client Reviews 


About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.
