Once hailed as a "miracle" mineral, asbestos has been used since the early 1900s for fireproofing, insulation and sound control. Time, however, has proven asbestos to be a significant health hazard, linked to serious lung disease and certain types of cancer.

Colfax Corporation has the expertise, experience and equipment to protect your employees and the environment from exposure to this hazardous material during the abatement process. Using state-of-the-art equipment, advanced systems and fully trained and certified workers, we can help you meet your legal, health and safety requirements.

We have the facilities for removal and proper disposal of pipe, duct, boiler and other asbestos containing insulations, sprayed-on fire retardant and acoustical wall materials, floor and ceiling tiles, panel boards, and other asbestos-containing products. All work, performed in full accordance with federal, state and local regulations, is carefully designed to minimize disruption to your  building operations.

We offer the following in-house services:
· Fully licensed asbestos removal
· Asbestos inspections, sampling and surveys
· Insulation repair, encapsulation or enclosure
· Re-insulation
· Asbestos awareness training

See our listing and more information about asbestos related diseases on: 
Mesothelioma Cancer Center



















Used indiscriminately in products ranging from paints to motor fuels to piping and solder, lead is an insidious poison. Building up in the body, it can cause anemia and has been proven to damage the kidneys, the digestive system, the reproductive system and other vital organs. Even at low levels, it can impair hearing, learning ability and coordination, particularly in young children.

Colfax Corporation has been able to apply many of the techniques perfected in asbestos abatement to the mitigation of lead based paint. Our certified, experienced personnel use the latest proven systems and technology to assess the extent of your lead problem, devise an effective solution, and execute a program that brings you into conformance with federal and local regulations.

A variety of techniques are available, including abrasion, heat scraping, and chemical and mechanical removal. Each incorporates special controls to guard against the spread of lead dust or fumes during the process. Disposal is accomplished in full accordance with all applicable regulations.

In some cases, containment provides an equally effective and less costly alternative to removal. Encapsulating coatings are available for both exterior and interior surfaces. They provide high resistance to weathering, vapor transmission, abrasion and fire. Other solutions include sealants and total enclosure.
















In residential and commercial buildings upon identification of the mold type and source, Colfax Corporation can provide turnkey remediation, disposal and renovation of the affected area. Our personnel have been trained in the most current techniques of isolation and removal, which allows us to project realistic time frames for remediation and renovation.
















Colfax Corporation has successfully completed many projects that have required design and restoration of building components upon completion of remediation:
· Insulation
· Fireproofing
· Ceiling Systems
· Lighting Systems
· Drywall/Plastering/Painting
· Flooring Systems
· Re-roofing
· Lead and Asbestos Inspection
· General Contracting

For the next remediation project, you can reduce your costs by relying on Colfax Corporation to coordinate the replacement of building systems.

















Colfax Corporation, along with its related company, National Wrecking Company, provides a full range of demolition services including selective demolition, partial/interior demolition, total structural demolition and hauling/disposal. As a result of our relationship with National Wrecking Company, we can control both the environmental remediation and demolition process thereby expediting work which results in a less expensive and more efficient project for our customers.

















No matter how well you maintain your ACM, a boiler breakdown, a leaking pipe, or any number of situations can threaten your operation and productivity. When you need quick response, Colfax Corporation can be there.

Colfax Corporation has the tools, experience and the personnel to provide timely responsiveness and remediation to virtually any emergency situation, offering:
· Prompt arrival at your site to assess the situation and determine the necessary remediation.

· Full compliance with governmental regulations.
· Full documentation and work records.

Colfax Corporation Company Policy



					Date Issued: December 2013



					Revision:

					1





Conflict Minerals Policy



					Form: CM Policy





	 

 Purpose


	This document contains Colfax Corporation's policy regarding the use of conflict minerals in its products.  As used in this policy, "Colfax" includes Colfax Corporation and its subsidiaries.  This policy will be reviewed and updated as needed.


 Regulatory Overview


	There has been increased awareness of violence and human rights violations in connection with the mining of certain minerals from locations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (the "DRC") and its adjoining countries.  In July 2010, President Obama signed into law the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, also known as the Dodd-Frank Act.  On August 22, 2012, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") adopted a conflict minerals rule (the "Conflict Minerals Rule") as mandated by Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act.  The Conflict Minerals Rule is intended to reduce a significant source of funding for armed groups that are committing human rights abuses in the DRC.

	To the extent that "conflict minerals" are necessary to the functionality or production of products that Colfax manufactures or contracts to manufacture, we are required to engage in a reasonable country of origin inquiry to determine whether the conflict minerals originated in the DRC or one of the other covered countries under the Conflict Minerals Rule.  Additional due diligence and disclosure obligations are triggered to the extent that the conflict minerals are from a covered country or we are unable to determine the source of the conflict minerals. 

	"Conflict minerals” are defined in the Conflict Minerals Rule as cassiterite, columbite-tantalite (coltan), gold, wolframite and three specified derivatives: tin; tantalum; and tungsten.  In addition to the DRC, the covered countries contemplated by the Conflict Minerals Rule are:  (1) Angola; (2) Burundi; (3) Central African Republic; (4) the Republic of the Congo; (5) Rwanda; (6) South Sudan; (7) Tanzania; (8) Uganda; and (9) Zambia.

 Colfax's Policy Statement


	Colfax takes its obligations under SEC and other regulations seriously.  Colfax also has adopted this policy as part of our efforts to encourage our suppliers to respect human rights and not contribute to conflict.  Colfax therefore requires the cooperation of its suppliers in the implementation of this policy and in enabling Colfax to meet its SEC compliance obligations on a timely basis.

	Please also see our Code of Conduct for Business Partners, available on the Colfax Corporation website under the Corporate Governance tab.


 Supplier Requirements


	Suppliers who supply or manufacture components, parts or products containing conflict minerals are expected to source those minerals from socially and environmentally responsible sources that do not directly or indirectly contribute to conflict.  Without limiting the foregoing, suppliers are expected to directly and indirectly source conflict minerals only from sources that do not directly or indirectly benefit or finance "armed groups" (as that term is defined in the Conflict Minerals Rule) in the DRC or another covered country.

	In furtherance of this policy, our suppliers are expected to:


		implement and communicate to their personnel and suppliers policies that are consistent with this policy;

		put in place procedures for the traceability of conflict minerals at least to the smelter or refiner level, working with their Tier 1 (direct) and Tier 2 (indirect) suppliers as applicable;

		where possible, source conflict minerals from smelters and refiners validated as being conflict free;

		maintain reviewable business records supporting the source of conflict minerals;

		from time to time, at Colfax's request, provide to Colfax written certifications and other information concerning the origin of conflict minerals included in products and components supplied to Colfax and the supplier's compliance with this policy generally;

		otherwise establish policies, due diligence frameworks and management systems that are consistent with the Conflict Minerals Rule and the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas; and

		require their Tier 1 (direct)  and Tier 2 (indirect) suppliers to adopt policies and procedures that are consistent with those contained herein.



	Suppliers also are encouraged to support industry efforts to enhance traceability and responsible practices in global minerals supply chains.


	Colfax reserves the right to request from any supplier at any time such information, certifications and documentation as it shall deem necessary to monitor or assess compliance with this policy. 


 Assessing and Responding to Identified Risks


	Colfax believes in establishing and maintaining long-term relationships with suppliers whenever possible.  If we determine that a supplier may be violating this policy, we may require them to commit to and implement a corrective action plan within a reasonable timeframe.  Continued failure to adhere to Colfax's policies and refusal to address issues of concern may lead to termination of our business relationship with the supplier.  Nothing contained in this policy shall be interpreted to preclude Colfax from terminating any supplier relationship at any time for any reason.


 Grievance Mechanism and Reporting


	Concerns regarding this policy, or violations, can be reported as follows:

	Via e-mail to:

Conflict.Minerals@colfaxcorp.com

	By mail to the following address:

	Colfax Corporation- Conflict Minerals Program

	Attn: Legal Department

	8170 Maple Lawn Blvd., Suite 180

	Fulton, MD 20759

	Suppliers are encouraged to in the first instance contact their regular sourcing channel if they have any questions concerning this policy.

We look forward to continuing to innovate and grow together."     "We are very pleased to have entered into an agreement with a prestigious strategic purchaser such as Colfax. Colfax, with its subsidiary Howden, is the ideal purchaser to strengthen the business' overall competitive position. The sale enables the business to successfully expand in its core business of compressor production for numerous applications, including small steam turbines and associated services," said Christopher Rossi, 
CEO of the Dresser-Rand business, part of Siemens Power and Gas Division.   Closing of the acquisition is expected in the fourth quarter following completion of carve-out activities and fulfillment of customary closing conditions, including receipt of applicable regulatory approvals.    Allen & Overy served as legal advisor to Colfax.   ABOUT COLFAX CORPORATION — Colfax Corporation is a diversified global manufacturing and engineering company that provides gas- and fluid-handling and fabrication technology products and services to customers around the world under the Howden, Colfax Fluid Handling and ESAB brands.
