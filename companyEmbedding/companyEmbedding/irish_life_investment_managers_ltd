Director

                    2013 - Current                  


Setanta Asset Management Ltd.

                    Setanta AM is an active manager which uses a bottom-up investment approach.They utilize a CFROI quality metric to identify and select companies with a capacity to produce above-average EPS growth over time.For stock purchases, a price target is set by reference to the degree of under-valuation the firm perceives. They sell a stock when the stock has reached its target price, when they conclude that the original proposition they bought into is no longer valid (or something fundamental has changed), when they have identified a more attractive opportunity in the sector, or they choose to explicitly adjust the sector distribution of the fund based on overall macro and market views. As part of their risk management procedure, Setanta AM sets a maximum stock size. They utilize the MSCI World index to determine the weighting on a sector basis.                  




Director

                    1997 - Current                  


Irish Life Investment Managers Ltd.

                    ILIM. is a value-oriented manager which specializes in both active and passive investments. Their index funds are designed to match the total returns of special stock markets, for example, the European Equity Index, by holding securities in the same proportion as they are represented in the relevant index or by using stock sampling techniques to track the market return.For active investments the firm's research analysts use quantitative screens which are applied to thousands of international equities maintained in an information database. The universe is then reduced to the 20% most undervalued companies based on various value criteria. The firm's analysts, who specialize according to sectors rather than countries, undertake fundamental research on the stocks that meet their value criteria and perform company visits. To select stock, ILIM's team of global sector analysts conduct primary research, including meeting company management, financial modeling and creative intelligence gathering.The firm purchases stocks which are identified as value stocks, which have a clearly identified catalyst that will lead to future out performance and which are the best prospect of the alternative value stocks.ILIM has a separate quantitative team, comprised of statisticians and econometricians to perform quantitative analysis. The firm's quantitative screening identifies companies in their universe that are trading at or above fair value. The firm sells value stocks when they have reached fair value.
