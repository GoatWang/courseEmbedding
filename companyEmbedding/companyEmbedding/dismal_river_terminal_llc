(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains certain forward-looking statements of expected future developments, as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. This discussion contains forward-looking statements about our business, operations and industry that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements regarding our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Our future results and financial condition may differ materially from those we currently anticipate as a result of the factors we describe under "Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements." This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") is based on financial data derived from the financial statements prepared in accordance with the United States ("U.S.") generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and certain other financial data that is prepared using non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP components, see "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" at the end of this Item, and Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements. Our MD&A is provided in addition to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes to assist readers in understanding our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. Overview SunCoke Energy, Inc. ("SunCoke Energy," "Company," "we," "our" and "us") is the largest independent producer of high-quality coke in the Americas, as measured by tons of coke produced each year, and has more than 50 years of coke production experience. Coke is a principal raw material in the blast furnace steelmaking process. Coke is generally produced by heating metallurgical coal in a refractory oven, which releases certain volatile components from the coal, thus transforming the coal into coke. We have designed, developed, built, own and operate five cokemaking facilities in the United States ("U.S."), which consist of our Haverhill Coke Company LLC ("Haverhill"), Middletown Coke Company, LLC ("Middletown"), Gateway Energy and Coke Company, LLC ("Granite City"), Jewell Coke Company, L.P. ("Jewell") and Indiana Harbor Coke Company ("Indiana Harbor") cokemaking facilities. These five cokemaking facilities have collective nameplate capacity to produce approximately 4.2 million tons of coke per year. Additionally, we have designed and operate one cokemaking facility in Brazil under licensing and operating agreements on behalf of our customers. All of our U.S. coke sales are made pursuant to long-term, take-or-pay agreements. These coke sales agreements have an average remaining term of approximately seven years and contain pass-through provisions for costs we incur in the cokemaking process, including coal costs (subject to meeting contractual coal-to-coke yields), operating and maintenance expenses, costs related to the transportation of coke to our customers, taxes (other than income taxes) and costs associated with changes in regulation. The coke sales agreement and energy sales agreement with AK Steel Holding Corporation ("AK Steel") at our Haverhill facility are subject to early termination by AK Steel under limited circumstances and provided that AK Steel has given at least two years prior notice of its intention to terminate the agreements and certain other conditions are met. No other coke sales contract has an early termination clause. Our core business model is predicated on providing steelmakers an alternative to investing capital in their own captive coke production facilities. We direct our marketing efforts principally towards steelmaking customers that require coke for use in their blast furnaces. While our steelmaking customers are operating in an environment that is challenged by global overcapacity, our customers have continued to see increases in steel pricing and positive signals on trade and infrastructure during the first half of 2017. Despite the improved market trends over the last year, AK Steel and United States Steel Corporation ("U.S. Steel") have kept portions of their Ashland Kentucky Works facility and Granite City Works facility idled as they await further signs of market stability. While market challenges remain, our customers continue to comply with the terms of their long-term, take-or-pay contracts with us. Our Granite City facility and the first phase of our Haverhill facility, or Haverhill I have steam generation facilities, which use hot flue gas from the cokemaking process to produce steam for sale to customers, pursuant to steam supply and purchase agreements. Granite City sells steam to U.S. Steel and Haverhill I provides steam, at minimal cost, to Altivia Petrochemicals, LLC ("Altivia"). Our Middletown facility and the second phase of our Haverhill facility, or Haverhill II, have cogeneration plants that use the hot flue gas created by the cokemaking process to generate electricity, which either is sold into the regional power market or to AK Steel pursuant to energy sales agreements.  Table of Contents  The following table sets forth information about our cokemaking facilities and our coke and energy sales agreements as of June 30, 2017:   Annual Cokemaking Year of Contract Number of Capacity Facility Location Customer Start Up Expiration Coke Ovens (thousands of tons) Use of Waste Heat Owned and Operated: Jewell Vansant, Virginia ArcelorMittal 1962 2020 142 720 Partially used for thermal coal drying Indiana Harbor East Chicago, Indiana ArcelorMittal 1998 2023 268 1,220 Heat for power generation Haverhill Phase I Franklin Furnace, Ohio ArcelorMittal 2005 2020 100 550 Process steam Haverhill Phase II Franklin Furnace, Ohio AK Steel 2008 2022 100 550 Power generation Granite City Granite City, Illinois U.S. Steel 2009 2025 120 650 Steam for power generation Middletown(1) Middletown, Ohio AK Steel 2011 2032 100 550 Power generation 830 4,240 Operated: Vit�ria Vit�ria, Brazil ArcelorMittal 2007 2023 320 1,700 Steam for power generation 1,150 5,940 Equity Method Investment: VISA SunCoke(2) Odisha, India Various 2007 NA 88 440 Steam for power generation Total 1,238 6,380  (1) Cokemaking capacity represents stated capacity for production of blast furnace coke. The Middletown coke sales agreement provides for coke sales on a "run of oven" basis, which includes both blast furnace coke and small coke. Middletown nameplate capacity on a "run of oven" basis is 578 thousand tons per year.  (2) We hold a 49 percent investment in a cokemaking joint venture with VISA Steel Limited in India ("VISA SunCoke"), which was fully impaired in 2015, and consequently, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015, we no longer included our share of VISA SunCoke in our financial results. Cokemaking capacity represents 100 percent of VISA SunCoke.  The Partnership owns and operates a coal logistics business, which provides coal handling and/or mixing services to third-party customers as well as to our own cokemaking facilities. The Partnership's coal logistics business consists of Convent Marine Terminal ("CMT"), Kanawha River Terminals, LLC ("KRT") and SunCoke Lake Terminal, LLC ("Lake Terminal"). The Partnership's coal logistics business has collective capacity to mix and/or transload approximately 40 million tons of coal annually and store approximately 3 million tons. CMT is one of the largest export terminals on the U.S. gulf coast and has direct rail access and the capability to transload approximately 15 million tons of coal annually through its operations in Convent, Louisiana. The facility is supported by long-term, take-or-pay contracts with volume commitments covering 10 million tons of its current capacity. KRT is a leading metallurgical and thermal coal mixing and handling terminal service provider with collective capacity to mix and transload approximately 25 million tons of coal annually through operations in West Virginia. The Partnership's terminal located in East Chicago, Indiana, Lake Terminal, provides coal handling and mixing services to our Indiana Harbor cokemaking operations. The Company also owns Dismal River Terminal LLC ("DRT"), which is located in Virginia adjacent to our Jewell cokemaking facility and was formed to accommodate Jewell in its direct procurement of third-party coal, beginning in 2016. Coal is transported from the mine site in numerous ways, including rail, truck, barge or ship. The Partnership's coal terminals act as intermediaries between coal producers and coal end users by providing transloading, storage and mixing services. The Partnership does not take possession of coal in its coal logistics business, but instead earns revenue by providing coal handling and/or mixing services to its customers on a fee per ton basis. Mixing and/or handling services are provided to steel, coke (including some of our domestic cokemaking facilities), electric utility and coal producing customers.  Table of Contents  The financial performance of the Partnership's coal logistics business is substantially dependent upon a limited number of customers. The Partnership's CMT customers are impacted by seaborne export market dynamics. Fluctuations in the benchmark price for coal delivery into northwest Europe, as referenced in the Argus/McCloskey's Coal Price Index report ("API2 index price"), contribute to the Partnership's customers' decisions to place tons into the export market and thus impact transloading volumes through the Partnership's terminal facility. The Partnership's KRT terminals are primarily impacted by the domestic coal markets in which its customers operate and generally benefit from extreme weather conditions.  In April 2017, the Company announced the termination of discussions with the Conflicts Committee of the Board of Directors of the Partnership regarding our proposal to acquire all of the Partnership's common units not already owned by the Company ("Simplification Transaction"), announced on October 31, 2016. The Conflicts Committee and its independent advisors reviewed the proposal made by the Company and had several discussions with the Company regarding the potential transaction. At this time, the parties determined that they will not be able to reach an agreement and have therefore terminated discussions regarding the proposed Simplification Transaction.  See "Items Impacting Comparability" below for further details on the Partnership's debt refinancing.

(2) See analysis of changes described in "Liquidity and Capital Resources."  Table of Contents  Items Impacting Comparability Debt Activities. During the second quarter of 2017, the Partnership refinanced its debt obligations. The Partnership received $620.6 million of proceeds, net of an original issue discount of $9.4 million, from the issuance of the 7.5 percent 2025 Partnership Notes and $100.0 million of proceeds from borrowings under the Partnership's amended and restated credit facility. The Partnership used these proceeds to purchase and redeem all of its 7.375 percent 2020 Partnership Notes, including principal of $463.0 million and a premium of $18.7 million, to repay the $50.0 million outstanding on the Partnership Term Loan and to repay $172.0 million on the Partnership Revolver. In connection with the debt issuance, the Company and the Partnership incurred debt issuance costs of $15.9 million, which were included in long-term debt and financing obligation on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2017.  As a result of the debt refinancing, the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 included a loss on extinguishment of debt on the Consolidated Statement of Operations of $20.2 million and $20.3 million, respectively, which consisted primarily of the premium paid of $18.7 million.   IRS Final Regulations on Qualifying Income. In January 2017, the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") announced its decision to exclude cokemaking as a qualifying income generating activity in its final regulations (the "Final Regulations") issued under section 7704(d)(1)(E) of the Internal Revenue Code relating to the qualifying income exception for publicly traded partnerships. However, the Final Regulations include a transition period for activities that were reasonably interpreted to be qualifying income and carried on by publicly traded partnerships prior to the Final Regulations. The Partnership previously received a will-level opinion from its counsel, Vinson & Elkins LLP, that the Partnership's cokemaking operations generated qualifying income prior to the Final Regulations. Therefore, the Partnership believes it had a reasonable basis to conclude its cokemaking operations were considered qualifying income before the issuance of the new regulations and as such expects to maintain its treatment as a partnership through the transition period. Cokemaking entities in the Partnership will become taxable as corporations on January 1, 2028, after the transition period ends.  As a result of the Final Regulations, the Partnership recorded deferred income tax expense of $148.6 million to set up its initial deferred income tax liability during the first quarter of 2017, primarily related to differences in the book and tax basis of fixed assets, which are expected to exist at the end of the 10-year transition period when the cokemaking operations become taxable. As the Company consolidates the Partnership, the entire deferred income tax expense was recognized during the first quarter of 2017. However, the Company had already recorded $84.4 million of the deferred income tax liability in its financial statements related to the Company's share of the deferred tax liability for the book and tax differences in its investment in the Partnership. Therefore, the net impact to the Company's deferred tax expense was $64.2 million during the six months ended June 30, 2017. This incremental tax impact is solely attributable to the Partnership's public unitholders. As such, an equal reduction to noncontrolling interest was recorded. As a result, the Final Regulations have no impact to net income attributable to the Company.  In 2014, we finalized the required permitting and engineering plan for a potential new cokemaking facility to be constructed in Kentucky. However, in June 2017, due to our focus on renewing our existing customer contracts and the lack of any long-term customer commitment for a majority of the facility's capacity, we decided to terminate the project. As a result, during the second quarter of 2017, the Company wrote-off previously capitalized engineering and land deposit costs of $5.3 million. During the second quarter of 2016, the Company  Table of Contents  wrote-off expiring land deposits related to the project of $1.9 million. These costs were included in selling, general and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.   Jewell Coke's Reimbursable Coal Costs. The reimbursable coal component of our Jewell cokemaking facility is fixed annually for each calendar year based on the weighted-average contract price of third-party coal purchases at our Haverhill I cokemaking facility ("HHI Benchmark"). Historically, Jewell's actual coal costs have been higher than the HHI Benchmark, resulting in an under-recovery of coal costs at Jewell. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, we have narrowed the difference between the HHI Benchmark and Jewell's actual coal costs, lessening the under-recovery and improving Adjusted EBITDA by $1.0 million and $3.4 million as compared to the same prior year periods, respectively. Pass Through Coal Cost Under-Recovery. During the fourth quarter of 2016, as part of our ordinary course coal sourcing activities, Haverhill, Middletown and AK Steel each entered into arrangements with a coal supplier for 2017 fulfillment. As a result of unfulfilled coal supply commitments by this coal supplier, substitute coal suppliers are currently meeting the shortfall, resulting in a higher price. Presently, we are aggressively pursuing the coal supplier and sharing a portion of the increased coal cost differential with AK Steel, resulting in a negative impact to revenue and Adjusted EBITDA of $1.4 million and $2.8 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively. We expect this impact to lower revenue and Adjusted EBITDA by approximately $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Coal Mining Business Divestiture and Impairment. In April 2016, the Company successfully disposed of its coal mining business to Revelation Energy, LLC ("Revelation"), who assumed substantially all of our remaining coal mining assets, mineral leases, real estate and a substantial portion of our mining reclamation obligations. Under the terms of the agreement, Revelation received $12.1 million from the Company to take ownership of the assets and liabilities during the second quarter of 2016. The Company paid an additional $0.7 million in the third quarter of 2016 to transfer certain retirement obligations to Revelation. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 the Company recognized total losses associated with this divestiture of $5.1 million and $14.7 million, respectively, which included a $10.7 million asset impairment charge recorded in the first quarter of 2016. Cost savings due to the absence of the coal mining business improved Adjusted EBITDA results by $0.3 million and $3.1 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, as compared to the same prior year periods. Contingent Consideration.

Exhibit 5.1
 
 

July 29, 2016

SunCoke Energy, Inc.
1011 Warrenville Road, Suite 600
Lisle, Illinois 60532

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We have acted as counsel for SunCoke
Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “ Company
”) and certain subsidiaries of the Company listed on
Schedule I hereto (collectively, the “ Subsidiary
Guarantors ” and, individually, a “ Subsidiary
Guarantor ”), in connection with the preparation of a
shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (the “
Registration Statement ”), as amended, filed on the
date hereof with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
“ Commission ”), by the Company under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “ Securities
Act ”), with respect to the offer and sale from time to
time, pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act, of:

(a) the common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Company (the “ Common Stock
”);

(b) the preferred stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Company (the “ Preferred Stock
”);

(c) the senior debt securities (the
“ Senior Debt Securities ”) and subordinated
debt securities (the “ Subordinated Debt Securities
” and, collectively with the Senior Debt Securities, the
“ Debt Securities ”) of the Company;

(d) the guarantees by the Subsidiary
Guarantors of the Debt Securities (the “ Guarantees
”);

(e) the warrants for the purchase of
Common Stock, Preferred Stock and Debt Securities, as described
below (the “ Warrants ”);

(f) the rights to purchase Common
Stock or Preferred Stock or other securities (the “
Rights ”);

(g) the units that represent an
interest in two or more other securities, which may or may not be
separable from one another (the “ Units ” and,
together with the Common Stock, the Preferred Stock, the Debt
Securities, the Guarantees, the Warrants and the Rights, the
“ Securities ”).

The Senior Debt Securities and the
Subordinated Debt Securities will be issued by the Company pursuant
to separate indentures to be entered into among the Company, the
Subsidiary Guarantors (if any) and a trustee to be named (each, an
“ Indenture ”). The Guarantees may be issued by
the Subsidiary Guarantors in connection with the issuance by the
Company of the Debt Securities. Any Warrants will be issued by the
Company pursuant to one or more warrant agreements (each, a “
Warrant Agreement ”) to be entered into between the
Company and a bank or trust company to be named by the Company, as
warrant agent (the “ Warrant Agent
”).

The aggregate initial offering
prices of the Securities to be offered and sold by the Company
pursuant to the Registration Statement will not exceed
$500,000,000. We have participated in the preparation of the
Prospectus (the “ Prospectus ”) contained in the
Registration Statement. Capitalized terms not defined herein shall
have the meanings ascribed to them in the Prospectus.

In connection with this opinion, we
have examined originals or electronic copies, certified or
otherwise identified to our satisfaction the following documents
(together the “ Documents ”): (i) the
Registration Statement, (ii) the Prospectus, (iii) the
forms of the Indentures, (iv) the Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation of the Company dated as of
July 6, 2011, (“ Certificate of Incorporation
”), (v) the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company
dated as of February 1, 2016, (“ Bylaws ”),
(vi) certain resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors of
the Company (the “ Board ”) relating to the
Registration Statement, (vii) the organizational documents of
each Subsidiary Guarantor, and (viii) such other certificates,
statutes, documents and records as we have deemed necessary and
relevant for the purpose of rendering the opinions set forth below.
We have also examined such corporate documents and records of the
Company and other instruments, certificates and documents as we
have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinions
hereinafter expressed. In addition, we have reviewed such questions
of law as we considered necessary or appropriate. As to matters of
fact relevant to the opinions expressed below, and as to factual
matters arising in connection with our examination of corporate
documents, records and other documents and writings, we have relied
upon certificates and other communications of officers and
employees of the Company, without further investigation as to the
facts set forth therein.

In connection with this opinion, we
have assumed that:

(1) all information contained in all
documents reviewed by us is true and correct;


July 29, 2016 Page 3
 
 
 

(2) all signatures on all documents
examined by us are genuine;

(3) all documents submitted to us as
originals are authentic and all documents submitted to us as copies
conform to the originals of those documents;

(4) each certificate from
governmental officials reviewed by us is accurate, complete and
authentic, and all official public records are accurate and
complete;

(5) the Registration Statement, and
any amendments thereto (including post-effective amendments), will
have become effective;

(6) a supplement to the Prospectus
(the “ Prospectus Supplement ”) will have been
prepared and filed with the Commission describing the Securities
offered thereby;

(7) the Securities will be issued
and sold in compliance with applicable federal and state securities
laws and in the manner stated in the Registration Statement and the
appropriate prospectus supplement;

(8) a definitive purchase,
underwriting or similar agreement with respect to any Securities
offered will have been duly authorized and validly executed and
delivered by the Company and the other parties thereto;

(9) any Securities issuable upon
conversion, exchange or exercise of any Security being offered will
be duly authorized, created and, if appropriate, reserved for
issuance upon such conversion, exchange or exercise;

(10) at the time of any offering or
sale of any of the Securities, that the Company shall have such
number of shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock, as set forth
in such offering or sale, authorized or created and available for
issuance;

(11) the Indentures relating to the
Debt Securities, a Warrant Agreement relating to the Warrants and a
Rights Agreement relating to the Rights will each be duly
authorized, executed and delivered by the parties thereto;
and

(12) each person signing the
documents we examined, including the Indentures, the Warrant
Agreement and the Rights Agreement, has the legal capacity and
authority to do so.

Based upon and subject to the
foregoing, and having regard to such other legal considerations
that we deem relevant, we are of the opinion that:

Common Stock offered by the Company, when (a) the board of
directors of the Company has taken all necessary corporate action

of Common Stock have been duly executed, countersigned, registered
and delivered either (i) in accordance with the applicable
definitive purchase, underwriting or similar agreement approved by
the board of directors of the Company, then upon payment of the
consideration therefor (not less than the par value of the Common
Stock) provided for therein; or (ii) upon conversion, exchange
or exercise of any other Security in accordance with the terms of
the Security or the instrument governing the Security providing for
the conversion, exchange or exercise as approved by the board of
directors of the Company, for the consideration approved by the
board of directors of the Company (not less than the par value of
the Common Stock), such shares of Common Stock will be legally
issued, fully paid and non-assessable.

2. With respect to shares of any
series of Preferred Stock, when (a) the Board has taken all
necessary corporate action to approve the issuance and terms of the
shares of the series, the terms of the offering thereof and related
matters, including the adoption of a resolution establishing and
designating the series and fixing and determining the preferences,
limitations and relative rights thereof and the filing of a
statement with respect to the series with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware (the “ Certificate of
Designation ”); and (b) certificates representing
the shares of the series of Preferred Stock have been duly
executed, countersigned, registered and delivered either
(i) in accordance with the applicable definitive purchase,
underwriting or similar agreement approved by the Board, then upon
payment of the consideration therefor (not less than the par value
of the Preferred Stock) provided for therein; or (ii) upon
conversion, exchange or exercise of any other Security in
accordance with the terms of the Security or the instrument
governing the Security providing for the conversion, exchange or
exercise as approved by the Board, for the consideration approved
by the Board (not less than the par value of the Preferred Stock),
the shares of the series of Preferred Stock will be legally issued,
fully paid and non-assessable.

3. With respect to the Debt
Securities, when (i) the applicable Indenture and supplemental
indenture, if any, have been duly qualified under the Trust
Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, (ii) an appropriate
prospectus supplement or term sheet with respect to the Debt
Securities has been prepared, delivered and filed in compliance
with the Securities Act and the applicable rules and regulations
thereunder; (iii) the board of directors of the Company (or a
committee thereof) has taken all necessary corporate action to
approve the issuance and terms of such Debt Securities, the terms
of the offering thereof and related matters; (iv) the
Indenture and any supplemental indenture in
