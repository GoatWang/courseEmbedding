	WESTERN PETROLEUM, INC.








	NOTES
	TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS






	(Unaudited)





	 





	Note
	1 – Organization, Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies





	 




	International
	Western Petroleum, Inc. (“IWP” or the “Company”) was incorporated on February 19, 2014 as a Nevada corporation.
	The Company was formed to conduct operations in the oil and gas industry.




	 




	The
	accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting
	principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and should
	be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company’s Annual
	Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for the year ended February 29, 2016. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting
	of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and the results of operations for
	the interim periods presented have been reflected herein. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative
	of the results to be expected for the full year. Notes to the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements that would substantially
	duplicate the disclosures contained in the audited financial statements for the most recent fiscal year as reported in the Form
	10-K have been omitted.




	 





	Use
	of Estimates





	 




	The
	preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
	requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
	of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expense
	during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.




	 





	Fair
	Value of Financial Instruments





	 




	The
	carrying amount of the Company’s accounts payable and accrued expenses and advances from officer approximates its estimated
	fair value due to the short-term nature of that financial instrument.




	 





	Cash
	and Cash Equivalents





	 




	The
	Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of six months or less to be cash equivalents.
	The Company had $500,947 and $542,228 of cash and cash equivalents at November 30, 2016 and February 29, 2016, respectively.




	 





	Concentrations
	of Credit Risk





	 




	Financial
	instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk include cash deposits placed with financial
	institutions. The Company maintains its cash in bank accounts which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits as guaranteed
	by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). At November 30, 2016, $250,947 of the Company’s cash balances was uninsured.
	The Company has not experienced any losses on such accounts.





	 






	Accounts
	Receivable





	 




	Accounts
	receivable typically consist of oil and gas receivables. The Company has classified these as current assets in the balance
	sheet because the Company expects repayment or recovery within the next 12 months. The Company evaluates these accounts receivable
	for collectability considering the results of operations of these related entities and when necessary records allowances for expected
	unrecoverable amounts. To date, no allowances have been recorded.




	 







	 



	6



	 









	 







	 





	Oil
	and Gas Properties





	 




	The
	Company follows the full cost method of accounting for its investments in oil and gas properties, whereby all costs incurred in
	connection with the acquisition, exploration for and development of petroleum and natural gas reserves, including unproductive
	wells, are capitalized. Such costs include lease acquisition, geological and geophysical activities, rentals on non-producing
	leases, drilling, completing and equipping of oil and gas wells and administrative costs directly attributable to those activities,
	and asset retirement costs. General and administrative costs related to production and general overhead are expensed as incurred.




	 




	Disposition
	of oil and gas properties are accounted for as a reduction of capitalized costs, with no gain or loss recognized unless such adjustment
	would significantly alter the relationship between capital costs and proved reserves of oil, in which case the gain or loss is
	recognized in the statement of operations.




	 




	Future
	development, site restoration, dismantlement and abandonment costs, are estimated property by property, based upon current economic
	conditions and regulatory requirements, and are included in amortization of our oil and natural gas property costs.




	 




	Depletion
	of capitalized oil properties and estimated future development costs, excluding unproved properties, are based on the unit-of-production
	method based on proved reserves.




	 




	At
	the end of each quarter, the unamortized cost of oil and natural gas properties, net of related deferred income taxes, is limited
	to the sum of the estimated future after-tax net revenues from proved properties, after giving effect to cash flow hedge positions,
	discounted at 10%, and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties, adjusted for related income tax effects. This limitation
	is known as the “ceiling test,” and is based on SEC rules for the full cost oil and gas accounting method. There was
	no ceiling test write-down recorded during the three and nine months ended November 30, 2016 and 2015.




	 




	The
	Company assesses the carrying value of its unproved properties for impairment periodically. If the results of an assessment indicate
	that an unproved property is impaired (which was assessed in connection with the Company’s evaluation of goodwill impairment),
	then the carrying value of the unproved properties is added to the proved oil property costs to be amortized and subject to the
	ceiling test.




	 





	Fixed
	Asset





	 




	Fixed
	asset is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the five-year estimated useful life of the asset.




	 





	Asset
	Retirement Obligations





	 




	If
	a reasonable estimate of the fair value of an obligation to perform site reclamation, dismantle facilities or plug and abandon
	wells can be made, the Company will record a liability (an asset retirement obligation or “ARO”) on its balance sheet and capitalize the present value of the asset retirement cost in oil and gas properties in the period in which the
	retirement obligation is incurred. In general, the amount of an ARO and the costs capitalized will be equal to the estimated future
	cost to satisfy the abandonment obligation assuming the normal operation of the asset, using current prices that are escalated
	by an assumed inflation factor up to the estimated settlement date, which is then discounted back to the date that the abandonment
	obligation was incurred using an assumed cost of funds for the Company. After recording these amounts, the ARO will be accreted
	to its future estimated value using the same assumed cost of funds and the capitalized costs are depreciated on a unit-of-production
	basis over the estimated proved developed reserves. Both the accretion and the depreciation will be included in depreciation,
	depletion and amortization expense on our statement of operations.




	 





	Revenue
	Recognition





	 




	All
	revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service or sale is complete, the price is fixed or
	determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Revenue is derived from the sale of crude oil and natural gas. Revenue
	from crude oil and natural gas sales is recognized when the product is delivered to the purchaser and collectability is reasonably
	assured. The Company follows the “sales method” of accounting for oil and natural gas revenue, so it recognizes revenue
	on all natural gas or crude oil sold to purchasers, regardless of whether the sales are proportionate to its ownership in the
	property. A receivable or liability is recognized only to the extent that the Company has an imbalance on a specific property
	greater than its share of the expected remaining proved reserves. If collection is uncertain, revenue is recognized when cash
	is collected.




	 







	 



	7



	 









	 







	 





	Income
	Taxes





	 




	Income
	taxes are accounted for in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic No. 740. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized
	for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets
	and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected
	to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect
	on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment
	date. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.




	 





	Stock-Based
	Compensation





	 




	The
	Company measures stock-based compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize it as expense,
	over the vesting or service period, as applicable, of the stock award.




	 





	Basic
	and Diluted Net Income (Loss) per Common Share





	 




	Basic
	net loss per common share amounts are computed by dividing the net loss available to International Western Petroleum Inc., shareholders
	by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding over the reporting period. In periods in which the Company reports
	a net loss, dilutive securities are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share as the effect would be anti-dilutive.
	For the three and nine months ended November 30, 2016 and 2015, there were no potentially dilutive securities
	outstanding.




	 





	Reclassifications





	 




	Certain
	reclassifications have been made to amounts in prior periods to conform to the current period presentation. All reclassifications
	have been applied consistently to the periods presented.




	 





	Subsequent
	Events





	 




	The
	Company evaluated all transactions from November 30, 2016 through the financial statement issuance date for subsequent event disclosure
	consideration.




	 





	Recent
	Accounting Pronouncements





	 




	The
	Company does not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on its results
	of operations, financial position or cash flows.




	 





	Note
	2 – Going Concern





	 




	As
	reflected in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has generated a net loss of $997,545 and cash flows used
	from operations of $748,896 during the nine months ended November 30, 2016. Revenue is mainly generated from oil and gas
	sales from the Company’s oil and gas properties. 




	 




	Management
	has a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable
	future. The Company will be required to raise additional funds to fully execute its business plan, however, the Company believes
	it has sufficient cash on hand and limited near term obligations to sustain its current operations for the next twelve months.

	Overview





	 




	International
	Western Petroleum, Inc. (“IWP,” “we,” “our,” “us” or the “Company”)
	was incorporated on February 19, 2014 as a Nevada corporation and is based in Irving, Texas. The Company was formed to conduct
	operations in the oil and gas industry. We are an oil and natural gas company that focuses on the acquisition, development, and
	exploration of crude oil and natural gas properties in Texas. On May 4, 2015, the Company acquired significant working interests
	from the Bend Arch Lion 1A Joint Venture and the Bend Arch Lion 1B Joint Venture encompassing a total production of seven (7)
	producing oil and gas wells on a total 380 acres out of 777 acres of the Bend Arch Lion project showing proven recoverable reserves
	of approximately 429.48 Mbbl and 353.78 MMcf. To date, the Company, together with its affiliated operator, International Western
	Oil Corporation (“IWO”), have completed drilling an additional three (3) oil and gas wells, thus totaling ten (10)
	gross wells in production. It is noted that the Bend Arch Lion 1A and 1B Joint Ventures are parts of the total 777-acre leaseholds
	that have not been fully explored. Currently, IWO holds approximately 2,400 acres in leaseholds in the Central West Texas region.
	The Company plans to acquire additional leaseholds from IWO in the future.




	 




	The
	Company is continually seeking strategic investors to help it develop additional exploration projects located within the Bend
	Arch-Fort Worth Basin as well as other prime acquisition targets in the Central West, South and East Texas. As such, the Company
	is working on obtaining enough funding to provide a budget for new acquisitions in the remaining calendar year of 2017 as well
	as new exploration projects in 2017 to meet its financial objectives during the fiscal year ending February 28, 2017.

	Strategy
	and Implementation Summary





	 





	Sales
	Strategy





	 




	Abilene,
	Texas is the closest city with oil handling and sales firms. Our sales strategy in relation to spot pricing will be to produce
	less when the sales price is lower and produce more when the sales price is higher. To maintain the lowest production cost, we
	will aim to have our inventory in tanks be virtually zero. Members of the Ramsey family that are related to our CEO have business
	relationships with BML Crude Oil Marketing, Inc. (BML) and West Texas Gas (WTG Jameson). The Company has started producing oil
	and natural gas, while leveraging Tier 1 business relationships and having entered into material agreements with BML so
	that, as our Tier 1 buyers, BML can handle pick-up and sales of our crude oil stock to refineries and WTG Jameson can collect
	natural gas from our gas lines connecting to WTG pipelines.




	 




	As
	such, crude oil will be picked up from the leases and natural gas can be collected as needed during the calendar month. At the
	end of the month, the hydrocarbon total sales will be tallied by lease and the 30-day average of the daily closing of oil and
	gas will be tabulated. On or about the 25th of the following month the proceed checks from oil and gas sales will be issued to
	the financial parties of record.




	 





	Plan
	of Operations





	 




	During
	fiscal year 2017, the Company is actively looking for large-reserve oil and gas concessions and existing production to acquire
	and continue to raise enough capital via equity and/or debt financing options to meet its operational goal in fiscal year 2017.




	 




	Based
	on Management’s general management and petroleum exploration experience as well as its geology expertise, the Company believes
	in its ability to identify high potential acreages and high production fields.




	 




	Since
	the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, the Company has reviewed several good acquisition candidates in the West, Permian Basin
	and South Texas. After identifying any new prospect, additional research and evaluation was carried out using personal contacts,
	geologists, seismographs, satellite hydrocarbon imaging, production data and every available resource to glean information and
	data in order to make an acquisition decision. Our operational plan after each acquisition is to increase production of the acquired
	oil and gas properties using state-of-the-art production technologies within a designated budget pre-approved by the Company’s
	senior management team.




	 




	The
	Company has plans to design a cost effective operating budget for each exploration project associated with an acquisition project
	and each budget will vary depending on the total depth of drilling and whether it is a new drilling or a re-entry. For each project,
	the Company plans on hiring selected operators to work under the close supervision of a core team of Company geologists, engineers
	and scientists.




	 




	The
	Company also has an immediate operational plan to apply selective leading edge Enhanced Oil Recovery (“EOR”) technologies
	from technology vendors to improve existing production after each future acquisition.




	 







	On May 4, 2015, the Company acquired a 39.5%
	working interest from International Western Oil Corporation (“IWO”) in the Bend Arch Lion 1A Joint Venture (the Pittard
	Bend Arch White property encompassing 160 acres – State ID# 21488) (the “1A Venture”) and a 50% working
	interest in the Bend Arch Lion 1B Joint Venture (the Pittard Bend Arch Red property encompassing 220 acres - State ID# 13121)
	(the “1B Venture”). By acquiring these working interests, the Company will directly receive the share of working interest
	revenue (after accounting for applicable taxes, expenses, and landowner royalties) IWO was receiving prior to the acquisitions.
	It is noted that in March 2016, the Company sold 4% of its working interest of the Bend Arch Lion 1B to a buyer, thus reducing
	the ownership of the working interest down to 46% in the Bend Arch Lion 1B.







	 




	The
	Company has spent over 6 past months to examine a proven state-of-the-art Organic Oil Recovery (OOR) technology proposed by an
	Advanced Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) technology company which has proposed a partnership with the Company in order to identify
	suitable mature oil fields and apply this OOR technology aiming to significantly increase the current production from mature oil
	and gas fields. The Company believes that this technology is one of the most important oil recovery breakthroughs in decades.
	This technology, based on natural ecology of the oil reservoir, has shown high-performance records on 4 continents, onshore and
	offshore, with over 300 applications in over 40 oil fields, resulting with an average increase of 92% in oil production. The technology
	is believed to be pure organic and biodegradable with fast result and cost effectiveness, bringing major economic benefits to
	many oil and gas producers in low oil price environment today.




	 




	As
	65% of oil in the world are being trapped underground today leading to a major opportunity for the Company to gain significant
	growth in revenues, the Company is doing in-depth studying on this technology to see if it is applicable to the Company’s
	newly acquired leases in Kilgore city, East Texas and also aims to obtain an exclusivity from this technology partner in certain
	region of Texas while pursuing certain revenue-sharing model with this technology partner.

	Production
	Improvement Program





	 




	The
	Bend Arch Lion 1A JV is a 160-acre leasehold having 4 producing wells which have been drilled by our Texas-based operating partner
	International Western Oil. The Company plans to apply a suitable EOR technology after further review in in order to increase its
	production. Based on our recent studies, there are the necessary inclusionary and sedimentary formations for hydrocarbon generation
	and deposits and geology studies have concluded that there are significant hydrocarbon reserves present on this property. With
	additional geology studies, we have also identified additional drilling locations on this concession.




	 




	The
	Bend Arch Lion 1B JV is a 220-acre leasehold having 6 new producing wells which have been drilled by our Texas-based operating
	partner International Western Oil. The Company plans to apply a suitable EOR technology on the Ellenburger formation to significantly
	increase its production in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. Based on our recent studies, there are the necessary inclusionary
	and sedimentary formations for hydrocarbon generation and deposits and geology studies have concluded that there are significant
	hydrocarbon reserves present on this property. With additional geology studies, we have also identified additional drilling locations
	on this concession.

	Texas the Fannie Marshall Lease (RRC Lease No. 07413) and the Ida Walden Lease (RRC Lease No. 07419). The Company owns ten percent
	(10%) of the working interest of the Marshall Walden Joint Venture which was formed by the Company and its acquisition partner
	Odyssey Enterprises, LLC. This Marshal Walden Joint Venture was formed for the purpose of acquiring the two (2) above-mentioned
	leases.





	 





	On
	November 9, 2016, the Company acquired 3D Seismic 350-acre leasehold in King County, Texas. This acquisition primarily includes
	350-acre leasehold in King County, Texas with additional options to lease up to 800 acres of adjoining acreage with complete 3D
	seismic data. The 350-acre leasehold comes with an existing tank facility for the production of oil, natural gas, and water. There
	is also a full injection wellbore set in place that is fully equipped. There have been five (5) wellbores drilled on this lease

	Item
	4. Controls and Procedures.





	 





	(a)




	Disclosure of Controls and Procedures





	 




	We
	maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports,
	filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
	in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
	chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
	In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no
	matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance of achieving the desired control
	objectives. In reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating
	the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. In addition, the design of any system of controls also is based
	in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed
	in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, a control may become inadequate because of changes
	in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in
	a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.




	 







	Pursuant to SEC Rule 13a-15(b), the Company
	carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive
	officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
	as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on that evaluation, the Company’s principal
	executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that due to the material weakness discussed below, the Company’s
	disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, as of the end of the month ended November 30, 2016, to provide reasonable
	assurance that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is
	recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s
	rules and forms.







	 




	A
	material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there
	is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements will not
	be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control our financial reporting
	as of November 30, 2016, the Company determined that the following items constituted material weaknesses:




	 






	 




	●




	The
	Company does not have policies and procedures in place to ensure the timely review, disclosure and accurate financial reporting
	for significant agreements and transactions.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	The
	Company does not have an independent audit committee in place, which would provide oversight of the Company’s officers,
	operations and financial reporting function.






	 





	(b)




	Changes in Internal Controls





	 




	There
	have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter covered by this Quarterly
	Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial

	PART
	II - OTHER INFORMATION





	 









	Item
	1. Legal Proceedings.





	 




	There
	are no other actions, suits, proceedings, inquiries or investigation before or by any court, public board, government agency,
	self-regulatory organization or body pending or, to the knowledge of the executive officers of our Company or any of our subsidiaries,
	threatened against or affecting our company, our common stock, any of our subsidiaries or of our companies or our subsidiaries’






	 










	Item
	1A. Risk Factors.





	 




	We
	believe there are no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
	ended February 29, 2016, filed with the SEC on June 27, 2016.





	 









	Item
	2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.





	 





	In November 2016, the Company sold 3,067,282
	shares of common stock for cash proceeds of $613,700.


	 



	In
	November 2016, the Company issued 33,500 shares of common stock to a consultant in exchange for services rendered.




	 




	The
	above shares were issued in reliance on the exemption under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. These shares of our common stock
	qualified for exemption under Section 4(2) since the issuance shares by us did not involve a public offering. The offering was
	not a “public offering” as defined in Section 4(2) due to the insubstantial number of persons involved in the deal,
	manner of the issuance and number of shares issued. We did not undertake an offering in which we sold a high number of shares
	to a high number of investors. In addition, the investors had the necessary investment intent as required by Section 4(2) since
	they agreed to and received share certificates bearing a legend stating that such shares are restricted pursuant to Rule 144 of
	the Act. This restriction ensures that these shares would not be immediately redistributed into the market and therefore not be
	part of a “public offering.” Based on an analysis of the above factors, we have met the requirements to qualify for
	exemption under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act for this transaction.





	 









	Item
	3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities.





	 




	There
	were no defaults upon senior securities during the quarter ended November 30, 2016.





	 









	Item
	4. Mine Safety Disclosures.





	 




	Not
	applicable.





	 









	Item
	5. Other Information.






	 





	On
	November 9, 2016, the Company acquired 3D Seismic 350-acre leasehold in King County, Texas. This acquisition primarily includes 350-acre leasehold in King County, Texas with additional options to lease up to 800
	acres of adjoining acreage with complete 3D seismic data. The 350-acre leasehold comes with an existing tank facility for the
	production of oil, natural gas, and water. There is also a full injection wellbore set in place that is fully equipped. There
	have been five (5) wellbores drilled on this lease dating back to the 1970s, and these previous wellbores ranged from 4800ft –
	6200ft in total depth, with three (3) different prolific hydrocarbon formations.

	1.




	I
	have reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of International Western Petroleum, Inc.;

	Based

	to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect
	to the period covered by this report;






	 




	 






	3.

	The
	registrant’s other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls
	and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as
	defined in Exchange Act Rules 13-a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:






	 




	 






	 




	(a)




	Designed
	such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision,
	to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to
	us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;






	 




	 




	 






	 




	(b)




	Designed

	(c)




	Evaluated
	the effectiveness of the registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions
	about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based
	on such evaluation; and






	 




	 




	 






	 




	(d)




	Disclosed
	in this report any change in the registrant’s internal control over financing reporting that occurred during the registrant’s
	most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant’s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially
	affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting;
	and






	 




	 




	 






	5.




	The
	registrant’s other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control
	over financial reporting, to the registrant’s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant’s board of directors
	(or persons performing the equivalent functions):






	 




	 






	 




	(a)




	All
	significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which
	are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
	information; and






	 




	 




	 






	 




	(b)




	Any
	fraud, whether or not material, that involved management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant’s
	internal control over financial reporting.

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of Common Stock by the selling 
security holders. All of the net proceeds from the sale of our Common Stock 
will go to the selling security holders. We have agreed to bear the expenses 
relating to the registration of the Common Stock for the selling security 
holders.


We may face substantial competition in the oil and gas industry. To Management’s
knowledge, there are many exploration companies in the oil and gas industry
which will compete directly with us. There are many large, well-capitalized,
private and public companies in this industry, which have the resources, lease
access, loyal buyers and expertise to drill and produce oil if they wish to do
so. Many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater
financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. These competitors may
be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies. This type of pricing pressure
could force us to offer discounts, decreasing our profit margin.


Company Description
We are an exploration-stage oil and natural gas company that focuses on the 
acquisition, development, and exploration of crude oil and natural gas 
properties in Texas. We do not yet have, however, reserves, undeveloped 
reserves, delivery commitments, any wells in the process of being drilled,


 
or drilling or other exploratory and development activities. We also do not 
yet own any oil and gas properties or acreage. 

The Company is currently managed by two people who are business and oil and gas
exploration veterans who specialize in the oil and gas acquisition and
exploration markets of the Central/West Texas region: its Chief Executive
Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer, and Co-Founder, Ross Henry Ramsey,
a fourth generation oil man who has been involved in several vertical and
horizontal exploration works along with deep and shallow drilling with
successful results; and its Chairman, Secretary, and Co-Founder, Dr. Benjamin
Tran, who has vast experience in corporate finance, private equity, and merchant
banking. The Company’s Chief Geologist is Dr. Syed Ahmad, who has thirty years
of diversified experience in the petroleum industry including extensive
geological and operational experience with Exxon Exploration (Texas), Saudi
Geophysical/Aramco, and Petrolog De Venezuela. At the moment, the Company’s
management team, Mr. Ramsey and Dr. Tran (collectively, “Management”), control
the majority of the Company’s outstanding shares.

The Company has recently prospected several lucrative exploration projects in
the prolific Bend Arch region which is approximately 120 miles long and 40 miles
wide running from Archer County, Texas in the north to Brown County, Texas in
the south. This area has been one of the most active drilling areas during the
recent resurgence of United States drilling activities.

Unlike many major oil companies that often drill very deep wells with a high
degree of risk, the Company plans to be a specialist in shallow well exploration
(3,000 to 6,000 feet) that is less expensive and has lower risk factors.

Management believes that the Company has the capacity and capability to take
potential oil and gas reservoirs and develop them from the ground floor to
completion. Management believes that the Company also has the ability to acquire
several high potential acreage that possess proven reserves of hydrocarbons.
From evaluating seismic data, to the final steps of drilling, testing,
completing and proceeding to production, our staff has expertise in geology,
petroleum engineering, geophysics and mechanical engineering. The Company is
currently developing several acquisition candidates including existing
hydrocarbon production and proven reserve hydrocarbon land leases capable of
additional drilling located in the Bend Arch/Fort Worth Basin.

The Company is aiming to develop a six (6) well drilling program in Coleman
County of Texas. This program shall execute drilling to an estimated depth of
4,600 feet which will place the wells into the geological formation known as the
Ellenberger Formation.

Management has access to the geology survey report as well as mud log and open
hole log of some existing wells of the Bend Arch Lion project. This data shows
that there are a total of up to five (5) potential oil and gas producing zones
between the surface and the Ellenberger Formation. The primary geological zones
to be explored in the initial 6 well drilling package will be the Palo Pinto,
Gardner Sand, Gray Sand, Barnett Shale and Ellenberger. Once the wells have
entered the Ellenberger Formation a suite of electronic logs will be run and the
information gathered off of the logs combined with the information gathered
during drilling will dictate which zone each well will be completed in.
Management believes that surrounding acreage would suggest that each well
targeted within the Ellenberger Formation will be completed and produced.
Management believes, however, that each of the other named Formations also have
the potential to provide very good commercial production.

In order to promote fast growth, Management envisions that the majority of
capital we generate from operations of acquired production will be reinvested to
fund new exploration projects. Our core business strategy is to: (a) acquire
petroleum exploration companies with moderate production growth and add capital
to instigate explosive growth; (b) acquire new high-potential hydrocarbon land
leases and perform initial exploration on those leases to add value as “proven
reserve” properties and then sell them off at multiples of the cost basis; and
(c) acquire existing oil and gas production with large reserves, to increase the
Company’s value.

We are currently an exploration stage company. Since inception, our operations
are limited to forming the Company and raising capital resource. We have not
generated any revenues to date. We do not currently engage in any business
activities that provide cash flow. At the date hereof, we have minimal cash at
hand. We require additional capital to implement our business and fund our
operations.

We were incorporated on February 19, 2014 under the laws of the state of Nevada. 
The Company’s principal executive office and mailing address is 5525 N. 
MacArthur Boulevard, Suite 280, Irving, TX 75038. Our telephone number is

About Us – International Western Petroleum, Inc.














































 
 











International Western Petroleum, Inc. (“the Company” or “IWP”) is a Texas-based E&P company that focuses on the acquisition, development, and exploration of crude oil and natural gas properties in Texas.  Operated out of Irving, Texas, we are actively looking to acquire oil and gas properties and apply latest technologies and production know-how to increase production and reserves. Our corporate culture cultivates a strong passion in exploring new technologies in everything we do.
The Company currently owns working interests of 3 oil and gas production fields and has secured several concessions covering approximately 2,400 acres in the Central West Texas region. Outside of the Central West Texas region and within the United States, the Company has accessibility to approximately 95,000 acres of large-reserve oil and gas concessions, currently under management review for acquisition efforts.
While there is tremendous upside potential in the Company’s current leasehold acreage and associated prospects, the Company is continuing to prospect several lucrative exploration projects in the prolific Bend Arch region which is approximately 120 miles long and 40 miles wide running from Archer County, Texas in the north to Brown County, Texas in the south. This area has been one of the most active drilling areas during the recent resurgence of United States drilling activities.
The Company’s management team believes that the Company has the capacity and capability to take potential oil and gas reservoirs and develop them from the ground floor to completion. From evaluating seismic data, to the final steps of drilling, testing, completing and proceeding to production, our staff has expertise in geology, petroleum engineering, geophysics and mechanical engineering. The Company is currently developing several acquisition candidates including existing hydrocarbon production and proven reserve hydrocarbon land leases capable of additional drillings with strong upside potential.
International Western Petroleum specializes in shallow well exploration (less than 5,000 feet), and is initially focused on the acquisition, development and exploration of crude oil and natural gas plays in Central West Texas, Permian Basin and the Texas Gulf Coast. The Company is led by an experienced management team with a long history in the oil and gas industry, and our management team is seeking to take advantage of recent declines in oil and gas prices to acquire and develop attractive assets at what may prove to be opportunistic costs. In parallel with this strategy, the Company has applied to uplist its shares to the Nasdaq Capital Market, which, if successful, would be a major event for the Company that would lower its funding costs of acquisitions by expanding access to institutional investors, improving the liquidity of its common equity, and raising its profile in the industry.
The Company is actively looking for large-reserve oil & gas concessions and productions, aiming to participate with international capital partners for large-scale transactions related to buyouts and joint ventures.  With a focus on taking
advantage of what we perceive as
attractively priced assets and
companies in a down oil market, we apply a four-pronged approach to our acquisition strategy:

acquire oil & gas companies with moderate growth that could accelerate production with new technologies and capital infusion;
acquire high-reserve leases and then enhance the value of the property by performing initial exploration activities;
acquire mature properties with attractive reserves whose production could be improved by state-of-the-art enhanced oil recovery (EOR) approach; and  grow its reserves through new leases of promising properties.
