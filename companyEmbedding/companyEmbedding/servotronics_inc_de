	VOTING INFORMATION


	 


	The
	record date for determining shares entitled to vote has been fixed at the close of business on March 16, 2017. On such date there
	were outstanding 2,434,449 shares of common stock of the Company, $.20 par value (“Common Stock”), entitled to one
	vote each.


	 


	In
	order to conduct the Annual Meeting, the presence, in person or by properly executed proxy, of the holders of a majority (i.e.,
	greater than 50%) of all the votes entitled to be cast at the Annual Meeting is necessary to constitute a quorum. Directors will
	be elected by a plurality of all the votes cast at the 2017 Annual Meeting with each share being voted for as many individuals
	as there are Directors to be elected. Ratification of the appointment of Freed Maxick CPAs, P.C. as the Company’s independent
	registered public accounting firm for the 2017 fiscal year requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast. Pursuant
	to SEC rules, shareholder proposals must have been received by March 14, 2017, which date is 45 days before the date (April 28)
	on which the Company mailed its proxy materials for last year’s annual meeting, to be considered at the 2017 Annual Meeting.
	At March 14, 2017 the Company had not received notice of any intention to submit any other matter; and, therefore, the named proxies
	have discretion to vote on any other matter that comes before the meeting.


	 


	Shares
	of Common Stock represented by a properly signed, dated and returned proxy will be treated as present at the meeting for the purposes
	of determining a quorum. Proxies relating to “street name” shares of Common Stock that are voted by brokers will be
	counted as shares of Common Stock (i) present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum and (ii) as having voted in
	accordance with the directions and statements on the form of proxy.



	 




	PROPOSAL 1: ELECTION
	OF DIRECTORS


	 


	The
	By-Laws of the Company provide that there shall not be less than three Directors not more than nine and that the number of Directors
	to be elected at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders shall be fixed by the Board of Directors. As of March 15, 2017, the Board of
	Directors has fixed the number of Directors to be elected at the meeting at six. Each person so elected shall serve until the next
	Annual Meeting of Shareholders and until his successor is elected and shall have qualified.


	 


	Five
	of the seven incumbent directors were nominated to stand for re-election. Directors Donald W. Hedges, Esq. and Rigel D. Pirrone
	informed the Board that they will retire from the Board and not stand for re-election at the Annual Meeting. Upon the recommendation
	of the Independent Directors Committee, the Board also nominated an additional director candidate who does not currently serve
	on the Board. The candidate was first recommended to the Independent Directors Committee by the Company’s President. The
	Directors believe that all of the nominees are willing and able to serve as Directors of the Company. If any nominee at the time
	of election is unable or unwilling to serve or is otherwise unavailable for election, the enclosed proxy will be voted in accordance
	with the best judgment of the person or persons voting the proxy.

	Dr. Nicholas
	D. Trbovich has been Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and served as a Director since 1959.  As a Founder of
	the Company, substantial shareholder and the Company’s past President, he has managed personally and through delegation the

	development, engineering, manufacturing and administration of the Company as the Company
	grew and its goals were achieved over the years. He has guided the Company in its transition from being primarily an engineering
	entity to a Company with expanded manufacturing and new product capabilities. He has been instrumental and successful in obtaining
	the appropriate corporate financing from banking institutions and the public sale of common shares to meet the Company’s
	increased requirements to support new product design, development and enhanced manufacturing capabilities. The Company’s
	designed and developed products fill key roles in many of the world’s well-known aerospace programs such as the Boeing 700

	helicopters, bombers and the Hubbell Space Telescope. Dr. Trbovich’s past and/or current business Directorships include manufacturing
	companies, banking institutions, professional and other enterprises. An elected Member of the Niagara Frontier Aviation and Space
	Hall of Fame, he is a holder of patents, recipient of Awards (i.e. Entrepreneur of the Year and other business and/or technical

	The
	Directors recommend a vote FOR the six nominees listed above. Unless instructed otherwise, proxies will be voted FOR these nominees.


	 


	CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND BOARD
	MATTERS



	 




	Independent Directors



	 


	Under
	the NYSE MKT listing standards, at least 50% of the Company’s directors must meet the test of “independence”
	as defined by the NYSE MKT. The NYSE MKT standards provide that, to qualify as an “independent” director, in addition
	to satisfying certain bright-line criteria, the Board of Directors must affirmatively determine that a director has no relationship
	with the Company that would interfere with such person’s ability to exercise independent judgment as a member of the Company’s
	Board.

	The
	Board of Directors has determined that each current director and nominee is independent other than Dr. Trbovich, the Company’s
	Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Trbovich, the Company’s President and Mr. Cosgrove, whose firm has
	provided legal services to the Company and its subsidiaries. In determining that Mr. Bear was “independent”, the Board
	considered the fact that the Company and its subsidiaries paid $69,200 to Full-Throttle Communications, Inc. in 2016 and is under
	contract to pay Full-Throttle Communications, Inc. $2,000 per month in 2017 for advertising services.


	 


	Committees and Meeting Data


	 


	The
	Board of Directors has a standing Audit Committee and Independent Directors Committee. Each member of each of these committees
	is “independent” as that term is defined in the NYSE MKT listing standards. The Audit Committee consists of Messrs.
	Gygax, Hedges and Marks with Mr. Marks chairing the Committee and being designated as the Company’s “Audit Committee
	financial expert”. The Audit Committee meets with the Company’s Independent Auditors and reviews with them matters
	relating to corporate financial reporting and accounting procedures and policies, the adequacy of financial, accounting and operating
	controls, the scope of the audit and the results of the audit. The Audit Committee is also charged with the responsibility of submitting
	to the Board of Directors any recommendations it may have from time to time with respect to financial reporting and accounting
	practices, policies and financial accounting and operation controls and safeguards.


	 


	The
	Independent Directors Committee consists of Messrs. Gygax, Hedges and Marks with Mr. Gygax chairing the Committee. The Independent
	Directors Committee is responsible for reviewing and recommending appropriate executive compensation policy and determining the
	compensation of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers. The responsibilities of the Independent Directors Committee
	also include assessing Board membership needs and identifying, screening, recruiting, presenting director candidates to the Board,
	implementing policies regarding corporate governance matters and making recommendations regarding committee memberships.


	 


	Pursuant
	to Board resolutions, the full Board of Directors approves/ratifies all Director nominees after they are determined by the Independent
	Directors Committee. See “Director Nominating Process” below. Additionally, Director and Executive Officer compensation
	determinations are subsequently submitted to the full Board of Directors for approval/ ratification.


	 


	During
	the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, the Audit Committee met 4 times, the Independent Directors Committee met 3 times and the
	Board of Directors met 6 times. No Director attended less than 100% of the meetings held during the period that each individual
	served as a Director. Each Director is encouraged to attend the Annual Meeting of Shareholders. In 2016, the Annual Meeting of
	Shareholders was attended by five of the six Directors then in office.

	Code of Ethics


	 


	The
	Company has adopted a Code of Ethics and Business Conduct (the “Code”) that applies to all Directors, Officers and
	employees of the Company as required by the listing standards of the NYSE MKT. The Code is available on the Company’s website
	at www.servotronics.com and the Company intends to disclose on this website any amendment to the Code. Waivers under the Code,
	if any, will be disclosed under the rules of the SEC and the NYSE MKT.


	 


	The
	Company also has a Whistleblower Policy, which is incorporated into the Code of Ethics and Business Conduct that requires Directors,
	Executive Officers and employees to comply with appropriate accounting and internal controls and establishes procedures to report
	any perceived wrongdoing, questionable accounting or auditing matters in a confidential and anonymous manner.



	 




	Report of the Audit Committee of the
	Board of Directors



	 




	The
	following Report of the Audit Committee does not constitute soliciting material and should not be deemed filed or incorporated
	by reference into any other filing by the Company under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 except
	to the extent the Company specifically incorporates this Report by reference therein.



	 


	The
	Audit Committee serves as the representative of the Board of Directors for general oversight of the Company’s financial
	accounting and reporting, systems of internal control, audit process and monitoring compliance with standards of business conduct.
	The Audit Committee operates under a written charter which is available on the Company’s website at www.servotronics.com.
	Management of the Company has primary responsibility for preparing financial statements of the Company as well as the Company’s
	financial reporting process. Freed Maxick CPAs, P.C. (“Freed Maxick”), acting as Independent Auditors, is responsible
	for expressing an opinion on the conformity of the Company’s audited financial statements with U.S. generally accepted accounting
	principles.


	 


	In this context, the
	Audit Committee hereby reports as follows:


	 






	1.


	The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements for fiscal year
	2016 with the Company’s Management.




	 






	2.


	The Audit Committee has discussed with the Independent Auditors the matters required to be discussed
	by the Standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB)

	.





	 






	3.


	The Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from the Independent Auditors
	required by PCAOB Ethics and Independence Rule 3526,

	Communication with Audit Committees Concerning Independence,

	and has
	discussed with Freed Maxick the matter of that firm’s independence.




	 






	4.


	Based on the review and discussion referred to in paragraphs (1) through (3) above, the Audit Committee
	approved that the audited financial statements be included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
	December 31, 2016, for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

	Leadership Structure


	 


	Dr.
	Nicholas D. Trbovich is the Company’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. The Company believes that having
	one person hold the roles of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer is the most effective way at this time to organize
	the leadership structure of the Board of Directors. Having one person hold the roles of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive
	Officer promotes unified leadership and direction for the Board and executive management and it allows for a single and clear focus
	for the chain of command to execute the Company’s strategic initiatives and business plans. Because Dr. Trbovich is primarily
	responsible for managing the Company’s day-to-day operations and strategic plan implementations, he is in the best position
	to chair meetings of the Board of Directors where key business and strategic issues are discussed.


	 


	Another
	component of our leadership structure is the active role played by non- management and independent Directors in overseeing the
	Company’s business, both at the Board and Committee level. The Board believes that the combined role of Chairman of the Board
	and Chief Executive Officer coupled with the existence of the independent Directors is the appropriate leadership structure for
	the Board of Directors at this time. This structure provides sufficient independent oversight while avoiding unnecessary confusion
	regarding the Board’s oversight responsibilities and the day-to-day management of the Company’s business operations
	and strategic plan implementations. The Independent Directors Committee periodically reviews this structure to assess its effectiveness
	on a continuing basis.


	 


	Board Oversight of Risk Management


	 


	The
	Board of Directors oversees the Company’s risk management process. This oversight is primarily accomplished through the Board’s
	committees and management’s reporting processes. The Company does not have a formal risk committee; however, the Audit Committee
	focuses on risk related to accounting, internal controls and financial and tax reporting. The Audit Committee also assesses economic
	and business risks and monitors compliance with ethical standards. The Independent Directors Committee identifies and oversees
	risks associated with the Company’s executive compensation policies and practices, Director independence, related party transactions
	and the implementation of corporate governance policies.

	Director Nominating
	Process


	 


	The
	determination of the individuals to be nominated for the Board of Directors is made by the Independent Directors Committee. This
	determination is then subsequently submitted to the full Board of Directors for approval/ratification.


	 


	The
	Board has not adopted specific minimum criteria for director nominees. Nominees are identified by first evaluating the current
	members of the Board willing to continue in service. Current members of the Board with skills and experience that are relevant
	to the Company’s business and who are willing to continue in service are considered for re-nomination. If any member of the
	Board does not wish to continue in service, the Board first considers the appropriateness of the size of the Board and then considers
	factors that it deems are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders in identifying and evaluating a new nominee.
	Consistent with the concept of diversity, the Company recognizes the value of having a Board that encompasses a broad range of
	skills, expertise, contacts, industry knowledge and diversity of opinion.


	 


	The
	Board will consider director nominees from any reasonable source, including nominees suggested by incumbent Board Members and Management
	as well as Shareholder recommendations tendered in accordance with the Company’s advance notice provisions. The Company does
	not currently employ an executive search firm, or pay a fee to any other third party, to locate qualified candidates for director
	positions.



	 




	Directors’
	Compensation


	 


	The
	Company’s Non-employee Director Compensation Policy was revised effective October 1, 2015. The Board amended and restated
	the policy on June 10, 2016. Under that policy, Non-employee Directors are paid an annual cash retainer of $50,000, payable in
	twelve monthly installments, plus reimbursement of actual expenses for attendance at Board or Committee meetings. The Chairperson
	of the Audit Committee and the Independent Directors Committee are also paid a $10,000 annual cash retainer, payable in twelve
	monthly installments.


	 


	The
	following table contains information with respect to the total compensation paid to the Non-employee Directors for the year ended
	December 31, 2016.

	EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION


	 


	The
	Summary Compensation Table quantifies the amount or value of the different forms of compensation earned by or awarded to the Company’s
	Chief Executive Officer, the next two most highly compensated officers of the Company and one additional individual who would have
	been among the most highly compensated officers, except that she was not serving as an officer at the end of 2016, (the “Named
	Officers”) in fiscal 2016 and 2015 and provides a dollar amount for total compensation. Descriptions of the material terms
	of the employment agreements with certain Named Officers are provided under “Employment Agreements” below.


	 


	The Compensation Process Overview


	 


	The
	Independent Directors Committee functions as the compensation committee of the Board and determines the compensation of the Company’s
	Executive Officers in accordance with the NYSE MKT listing standards. Compensation of the Company’s Executive Officers is
	recommended to the Board for determination by the Independent Directors Committee with the Chief Executive Officer and President
	playing a supporting role in the compensation-setting process for the Company’s other Executive Officers. The most significant
	aspects of management’s role are evaluating employee performance, recommending business performance targets and objectives,
	and recommending salary levels and other compensation awards, however final compensation determinations for all Executive Officers
	are approved by the Board upon the recommendation of the Independent Directors Committee.


	 


	2016 Base Salary


	 


	The
	Independent Directors Committee seeks to provide the Company’s Executive Officers with a level of assured cash compensation
	in the form of base salary that is commensurate with their professional status, accomplishments and geographic location. The base
	salaries are reviewed annually by the Independent Directors Committee and are adjusted from time to time to recognize competitive
	market data, the officer’s level of responsibility, outstanding individual performance, promotions and internal equity considerations.
	For the year ended December 31, 2016, base salary paid to each Named Officer is as set forth in the Summary Compensation Table.


	 


	2016 Bonus


	 


	The
	Company may also make cash awards to the Executive Officers and other employees that are not part of any pre-established, performance-based
	criteria. Awards of this type are completely discretionary and subjectively determined by the Board upon the recommendation of
	the Independent Directors Committee at the time they are awarded. In the event this type of cash award is made, it is reflected
	in the “Summary Compensation Table” under a separate column entitled “Bonus.” For 2016, the final amount
	of officer bonuses, if any, have not been determined at this time.


	 


	Equity Awards


	 


	Pursuant
	to the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as approved by the Company’s shareholders, the Independent Directors Committee may
	grant equity awards, the vesting of which may be based on the passage of time, achievement of performance conditions or vesting
	conditions otherwise determined by the Independent Directors Committee. On April 11, 2016, the Company awarded the following number
	of restricted shares to the Executive Officers pursuant to the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan; Dr. Trbovich 15,000 shares; Mr. Trbovich
	15,000 shares; Ms. Jaroslawsky 4,500 shares; Mr. Takacs 3,750 shares; and Mr. San Filippo 3,750 shares. These shares will vest
	on January 1, 2018. These awards were approved and are reflected in the Summary Compensation Table as 2016 compensation in accordance
	with the rules of the SEC. Ms. Jaroslawsky forfeited 9,000 unvested shares upon departure from the Company on October 7, 2016.

	Employment Agreements


	 


	Dr.
	Trbovich and Mr. Trbovich have employment agreements with the Company pursuant to which they are entitled to receive minimum salary
	compensation as set forth in the respective agreement, or such greater amount as the Company’s Board of Directors may approve/ratify.
	On February 26, 2016 the Board of Directors approved base salaries for Dr. Trbovich and Mr. Trbovich of $613,880 and $385,000,
	respectively, per annum. In the event of death or total disability during the term of the employment agreement, he or his estate
	is entitled to receive 50% of the compensation he is receiving from the Company at the time of his death or disability during the
	remainder of the term of the employment agreement. Also, in the event of (i) a breach of the agreement by the Company, (ii) a change
	in control of the Company, as defined, or (iii) a change in the responsibilities, positions or geographic office location, he is
	entitled to terminate the agreement and receive a payment of 2.99 times their average annual compensation from the Company for
	the preceding five years. If this provision is invoked and the Company makes the required payment, the Company will be relieved
	of any further salary liability under the agreement notwithstanding the number of years covered by the agreement prior to termination.
	The term of the agreement extends to and includes December 31, 2017 for Dr. Trbovich, and December 31, 2019 for Kenneth Trbovich
	provided however, the term of the agreement will be automatically extended for one additional year beyond its then expiration date
	unless either party has notified the other in writing that the term will not be extended. If the Company elects not to extend the
	agreement, he will be entitled to a severance payment equal to nine months’ salary and benefits.


	 


	The
	Company provides certain individual and spousal post-retirement health and life insurance benefits for Dr. Trbovich and Kenneth
	Trbovich. Upon retirement and after attaining at least the age of 65, the Company will pay for the retired executives and dependents

	Proposed
	transactions between the Company and a related person are submitted to the Independent Directors Committee for their determinations.
	In making its determinations, the Independent Directors Committee consider, among other factors, whether the proposed transaction
	is in the Company’s best interest and is on terms no less favorable to the Company than terms generally available from an
	unaffiliated third-party under the same or similar circumstances and the extent of the related person’s interest in the
	transaction. Also, the Independent Directors Committee may, at its discretion, request an independent appraisal if an independent
	appraisal has not already been provided. A related party is excluded from participating in the determinations of the Independent
	Directors Committee.

	PROPOSAL 2:



	RATIFICATION
	OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM



	 


	Freed Maxick CPAs,
	P.C. (“Freed Maxick”) has been selected by the Board of Directors as the independent public accountants for the Company’s
	current fiscal year. A representative of Freed Maxick is expected to be present at the meeting with the opportunity to make a statement
	if he desires to do so and will be available to respond to appropriate questions of shareholders.


	 


	At
	the Annual Meeting, the shareholders will be asked to ratify the selection of Freed Maxick as the Company’s independent registered
	public accounting firm. Pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Audit Committee has
	the direct responsibility to appoint, retain, fix the compensation and oversee the work of the Company’s independent registered
	public accounting firm. In the event that the shareholders fail to ratify the selection, it will be considered as a direction to
	the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee to consider the selection of a different firm. Even if the selection is ratified,
	the Audit Committee in its discretion may select a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the
	year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and our shareholders.


	 


	The
	affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal, assuming a quorum is present at the Annual Meeting, is required
	to ratify the appointment of Freed Maxick. The Directors of the Company unanimously recommend a vote “FOR” the ratification
	of Freed Maxick as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for 2017. Unless otherwise instructed, proxies
	will be voted “FOR” ratification of the appointment of Freed Maxick.


	 


	The
	following table shows the fees paid or accrued by the Company for the audit and other services provided by Freed Maxick CPAs, P.C.
	for fiscal years 2016 and 2015.

	$


	142,750


	 


	 


	$


	153,800


	 





	 






	(1)


	Audit fees represent fees for professional services provided in connection with the audit of the
	Company’s financial statements and review of the Company’s quarterly financial statements.




	 






	(2)


	Tax service fees principally included fees for tax preparation and tax consulting services.




	 


	The
	Audit Committee pre-approves audit and non-audit services provided by Freed Maxick. The Audit Committee has considered whether
	provision of the services described above is compatible with maintaining our accountant’s independence and has determined
	that such services have not adversely affected Freed Maxick’s independence.

	the 2017 mailing date (April 5), in order to be considered for inclusion, if appropriate, as a shareholder proposal in the Company’s

	Proposals to be introduced at the Annual

	OTHER MATTERS


	 


	So
	far as the Directors are aware, no matters other than the election of Directors and ratification of the engagement of Independent
	Auditors will be presented to the meeting for action on the part of the shareholders. If any other matters are properly brought
	before the meeting, it is the intention of the persons named in the accompanying proxy to vote thereon the shares to which the

	Item 1.




	Business






	 




	General



	 


	Servotronics, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively
	the “Registrant” or the “Company”) design, manufacture and market advanced technology products consisting
	primarily of control components and consumer products consisting of knives and various types of cutlery and other edged products.


	 


	The Company was incorporated
	in New York in 1959. In 1972, the Company was merged into a wholly-owned subsidiary organized under the laws of the State of Delaware,
	thereby changing the Company’s state of incorporation from New York to Delaware.


	 


	The Company’s
	shares currently trade on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) MKT under the symbol SVT.



	 




	Products




	 




	Advanced Technology Products



	 


	The Company designs,
	manufactures and markets a variety of servo-control components which convert an electrical current into a mechanical force or movement
	and other related products. The principal servo-control components produced include torque motors, electromagnetic actuators, hydraulic
	valves, pneumatic valves and similar devices, all of which perform the same general function. These are sold principally to the
	commercial aerospace, aircraft and government related industries, as well as medical and industrial markets.


	 


	To fill most of its
	orders for components, the Company must either modify a standard model or design a new product in order to satisfy the customer’s
	particular requirements. The Company also produces unique products based on specifications provided by its customers. The Company
	produces under long-term contracts and other types of orders.


	 


	The Company may from
	time to time produce metallic seals of various cross-sectional configurations. These seals fit between two surfaces, usually metal,
	to produce a more secure and leak-proof joint. The Company manufactures these seals to close tolerances from standard and special
	alloy steels. Ductile coatings are often applied to the seals in order to increase their effectiveness.


	 


	The Company has also
	produced other products of its own and/or of a given design to meet customers’ requirements.



	 




	Consumer Products



	 


	The Company designs,
	manufactures and sells a variety of edged products, tools and specialty consumer products for domestic and international distribution.
	These products include a wide range of cutlery items such as steak, carving, bread, butcher and paring knives for household use
	and for use in restaurants, institutions and private industry, as well as equipment and gear including fixed and folding knives
	for hunting, fishing and camping. The Company also sells knives and tools to the U.S. Government, related agencies, and allied
	foreign governments. These products include machetes, bayonets, axes, strap cutters, and other tools that are designed primarily
	for military and rescue/first-responder use, but are viable in commercial markets as well. The Company also produces and markets
	other edged products such as various specialty tools, putty knives, linoleum sheet cutters, field knives and SciMed items including
	scalpels and micro-spatulas. The Company manufactures its products from stainless and high carbon steels, titanium, or synthetic
	materials in numerous styles, designs, models and sizes. Substantially all of the Company’s commercial related products are
	intended for the moderate to premium priced markets. The Company also provides plastic fabrication, metal fabrication and other
	engineering, design, and OEM/white-label manufacturing services to regional customers. This includes the production of a wide range
	of machined, engineered, and/or molded consumer and industrial products and components.

	Sales, Marketing and Distribution




	 




	Advanced Technology Products



	 


	The Company’s
	Advanced Technology Group (ATG) products are marketed throughout the United States and in select foreign markets. Products are
	primarily non-seasonal in nature. These products are sold to the United States Government, government prime contractors, government
	subcontractors, commercial manufacturers and end-users. Sales are made primarily by the Company’s professional staff.


	 


	The Company’s
	prime contracts and subcontracts with the United States Government are subject to termination at the convenience of the Government.
	In the event of such termination, the Company is ordinarily entitled to receive payment for its costs and profits on work done
	prior to termination. Since the inception of the Company’s business, less than 1% of its Government contracts have been terminated
	for convenience. The Company’s sales of advanced technology products are composed primarily of a small group of customers
	with three customers accounting for 61% and 59% of the Company’s total revenue in 2016 and 2015, respectively. See Note 1,
	Business Description and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Concentration of Credit Risks, of the accompanying
	consolidated financial statements for information related to sales concentrations.



	 




	Consumer Products



	 



	The
	Company’s consumer products are marketed throughout the United States and in select foreign markets. Consumer sales are moderately
	seasonal. Sales are direct to consumer, through national and international distributors, and through retailers such as big box,
	hardware, supermarket, variety, department, discount, gift, drug, outdoors and sporting stores. The Company’s Consumer Products
	Group (CPG) also sells its knives and tools (principally machetes, bayonets, survival knives and kitchen knives) to various branches
	of the United States Government which accounted for less than 1% of the Company’s consolidated revenues in 2016 and 2015.
	Additionally, the Company provides OEM and white label product design and manufacturing services to a regional customer base across
	a wide range of consumer and commercial industries. No single customer of the CPG represented more than 10% of the Company’s
	consolidated revenues in 2016 or 2015. The Company sells its products and manufacturing services through its own sales resources,
	independent manufacturers’ representatives and electronic commerce

	.



	 




	Business Segments



	 


	Business segment information
	is presented in Note 11, Business Segments, of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.



	 




	Intellectual Properties



	 


	The Company has rights
	under certain copyrights, trademarks, patents, and registered domain names. In the view of management, the Company’s competitive
	position is not dependent on patent protection.

	Research Activities



	 


	The amount spent by
	the Company in research and development activities during its 2016 and 2015 fiscal years was not significant, but the Company does
	take advantage of tax credits for research and development activities when available. Such activities are expensed as incurred.



	 




	Environmental Compliance



	 


	The cost of compliance
	with current environmental laws has not been material and the Company does not anticipate that it will be in the future.



	 




	Manufacturing



	 


	The Company manufactures
	its advanced technology products in Elma, New York and its consumer products in Franklinville, New York.



	 




	Raw Materials and Other Supplies



	 


	The Company purchases
	raw materials and certain components for its products from outside vendors. The Company is generally not dependent upon a single
	source of supply for any raw material or component used in its operations.



	 




	Competition



	 


	Although no reliable
	industry statistics are available to enable the Company to determine accurately its relative competitive position with respect
	to any of its products, the Company believes that it is a significant factor with respect to certain of its servo-control components
	within its competitive market. The Company’s share of the overall cutlery market is not significant.


	 


	The Company has many
	different competitors with respect to servo-control components because of the nature of that business and the fact that these products
	also face competition from other types of control components which, at times, can accomplish the desired result.


	 


	The Company encounters
	active competition with respect to its consumer products from numerous companies, many of which are larger in terms of manufacturing
	capacity, financial resources and marketing organization. Its principal competitors vary depending upon the customer and/or the
	products involved. The Company believes that it competes primarily with more than 20 companies with respect to its consumer products,
	in addition to foreign imports. To the Company’s knowledge, its principal competitors with regard to cutlery include World
	Kitchen, Inc., Benchmade Knife Company, Inc., Tramontina, Inc., Dexter-Russell Inc., W. R. Case & Sons Cutlery Company, Lifetime
	Hoan Corp., Cutco Corporation and Gerber. The Company also competes with other regional manufacturing companies for its molded
	plastic and metal and plastic fabrication services. To the Company’s knowledge, its principal competitors with regard to
	manufacturing services include PM Plastics, Monarch Plastics and Ontario Plastics.


	 


	The Company markets
	most of its products throughout the United States and to a lesser extent in select foreign markets. The Company believes that it
	competes in marketing its servo-control products primarily on the basis of operating performance, adherence to rigid specifications,
	quality, price and delivery and its consumer products primarily on the basis of price, quality and delivery.



	 




	Employees



	 


	The Company, at December
	31, 2016, had 320 employees of which 307 are full time and are located in Western New York. Approximately 76% of its employees
	are engaged in production, inspection, packaging or shipping activities. The balance is engaged in executive, engineering, administrative,
	clerical or sales capacities. None are subject to a collective bargaining agreement.

	Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations






	 




	Business Overview



	 


	The aviation and aerospace
	industries as well as markets for the Company’s consumer products continually face evolving challenges on a global basis.
	The operations of the Company can be affected by the trends of the economy, including interest rates, income tax laws, government
	regulation, legislation, and other factors. In addition, uncertainties in today’s global economy, competition from expanding
	manufacturing capabilities and technical sophistication of low-cost developing countries and emerging markets, currency policies
	in relation to the U.S. dollar of some major foreign exporting countries, the effect of terrorism, difficulty in predicting defense
	and other government appropriations, the vitality of the commercial aviation industry and its ability to purchase new aircraft,
	the willingness and ability of the Company’s customers to fund long-term purchase programs, volatile market demand and the
	continued market acceptance of the Company’s advanced technology and cutlery products make it difficult to predict the impact
	on future financial results.


	 


	Both the ATG and CPG
	markets are sensitive to domestic and foreign economic conditions and policies, which may create volatility in operating results
	from period to period. For example, the airline industry is sensitive to fuel price increases and economic conditions. These factors
	directly impact the demand for aircraft production as well as the amount of repair and overhaul required on in-service aircraft.


	 




	-

	8

	-





	 




	 


	Government procurements
	are subject to Congressional appropriations and priorities that may change from year to year. Such changes could result in, but
	are not limited to, the expansion and/or contraction of Government procurement requirements, a reduction in funding, the continuation
	or termination of existing programs, the introduction of new programs requiring the funds that were originally directed to current
	programs, a stretch-out in Government delivery requirements or such other U.S. Government determinations that could result in increases
	or reductions of Government purchase orders for the ATG and/or the CPG products.


	 


	The Company’s
	suppliers are also subject to all the pressures and volatility being generated by the current global economic conditions. Any interruption
	of the Company’s continuous flow of material and product parts that are required for the manufacture of the Company’s
	products could adversely impact the Company’s ability to meet the Company’s customers’ delivery requirements.
	Consistent with the evolving requirements of the Aerospace Industry, companies are increasingly being requested to operate under
	Long-Term Agreements with their Customers on the basis of fixed prices, targeted year to year price reductions and/or year to year
	price adjustments predicated on mutually agreed indices and/or a combination of some or all of the above described pricing arrangements
	and/or otherwise. Therefore, productivity improvements and cost containment strategies are continuously sought within the Company’s
	concept of continuous improvement. The Company’s products are labor intensive and as such productivity improvements are expected
	to have positive effects on the Company’s operating results. However, increased costs for raw material, purchased parts and/or
	labor will have the reverse effect. Therefore, there are strong incentives to continuously improve productivity and to contain/reduce
	costs.


	 


	If any adverse economic
	events reduce the number of Airliners and/or Aircraft being produced by the Company’s relevant prime contractors, the negative
	effects of that reduction will in turn flow down through the supply chain. Also, certain major manufacturers have successfully
	imposed extended payment terms to their suppliers. At times, these extended payment terms are not available to the Company when
	purchasing raw material such as aluminum, magnetic material, steel and/or other product support items and services. If the Company’s
	customers delay their payments until after the extended due date or fail to pay, it could adversely impact the Company’s
	operating results.


	 


	Maximizing the Company’s
	operations requires continued dedicated performances from the Company’s key and other personnel. In the Company’s markets
	and business arenas there is substantial competition for the services of the highest performing individuals. Competitors, customers
	and other companies who may have interest in the Company’s most experienced and educated/highly trained personnel (i.e.,
	Managerial, Engineering and Accounting/Administrative) are a continuing consequence of the Company’s history of successful
	operational performance. Any unplanned replacement of such personnel may require the hiring of new personnel on an expedited basis
	(provided they are available) and may temporarily interrupt the Company’s operations and efforts for continuous improvement.



	 




	Management Discussion



	 


	During the years ended
	December 31, 2016 and 2015, approximately 9% and 11%, respectively, of the Company’s revenues were derived from contracts
	with agencies of the U.S. Government or their prime contractors and their subcontractors. Sales of products sold for government
	applications decreased approximately $649,000 and $1,353,000 from the prior year during 2016 and 2015, respectively, due to decreased
	government shipments at the ATG. The Company believes that government involvement in military operations overseas will continue
	to have an impact on the financial results in both the Advanced Technology and Consumer Products markets. While the Company is
	optimistic in relation to these potential opportunities, it recognizes that sales to the government are affected by defense budgets,
	the foreign policies of the U.S. and other nations, the level of military operations and other factors, as such, it is difficult
	to predict the impact on future financial results.

	The Company’s
	commercial business is affected by such factors as uncertainties in today’s global economy, global competition, the vitality
	and ability of the commercial aviation industry to purchase new aircraft, the effects and threats of terrorism, market demand and
	acceptance both for the Company’s products and its customers’ products which incorporate Company made components.


	 


	The ATG engages its
	business development efforts in its primary markets and is broadening its activities to include new domestic and foreign markets
	that are consistent with its core competencies. We believe our business remains particularly well positioned in the strong commercial
	aircraft market driven by the replacement of older aircraft with more fuel efficient alternatives and the increasing demand for
	air travel in emerging markets. Although the ATG backlog continues to be strong, actual scheduled shipments may be delayed/changed
	as a function of the Company’s customers’ final delivery determinations based on changes in the global economy and
	other factors.


	 


	The CPG continues to
	diversify its revenue streams with a broader government focus and new commercial channels, including the addition of national retailers,
	international accounts, and a direct-to-consumer business line, in response to recent and ongoing reductions in military spending.
	The CPG is also actively growing its custom manufacturing business to provide a wide range of metal and plastic fabrication services
	to a variety of consumer and industrial companies. New product development is focused on the commercialization of products with
	applications that span government and civilian requirements to maximize demand or that open up new lines of business entirely.


	 


	The ATG and CPG continue
	to respond to U.S. government procurement requests for quotes. New product development activities are ongoing along with the acquisition
	and development of new product lines.

	Revenue



	 



	The
	Company’s consolidated revenues from operations increased approximately

	$1,858,000

	or

	5.1%

	for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2016 when compared to the same period
	in 2015. The increase in revenue is attributable to an increase in commercial shipments of $3,120,000 at the ATG offset by decreases
	in commercial shipments at the CPG of approximately $605,000. Revenues from shipments to the Government and its prime vendors at
	the ATG decreased approximately $657,000 and $1,018,000, respectively, for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2016 when
	compared to the same period in 2015 due to previously reported budget cuts for military spending and vagaries inherent in the Government
	procurement process and programs.




	 




	Cost of Goods Sold



	 


	Cost of goods sold increased
	approximately $923,000 or 3.3% for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015. The
	increase in costs is primarily attributable to increased sales volume. Cost of goods sold, as a percentage of revenue, decreased
	from 75.3% to 74.0% due in part to the mix of product sold as well as the realization of certain expected operational efficiencies
	attributable to increased production volumes for in-house and outsourced operations. Total employment levels grew from 304 employees
	at December 31, 2015 to 320 employees at December 31, 2016. The increase in employees is in response to an increase in production
	capacity requirements at the ATG as evidenced by an increase of 17.8% in the value of purchase orders placed when comparing 2016
	to 2015. The Company continues to pursue cost saving opportunities in material procurements and other operating efficiencies including
	capital investments and technical developments in updated and new equipment/machinery as well as investing in the development and
	training of its labor force.

	Selling, General and Administrative
	Expenses



	 


	Selling, general and
	administrative (SG&A) expenses increased approximately $506,000 or 8.2% for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2016
	compared to the same period in 2015. Approximately 64% of SG&A expense relates to labor and labor related costs to support
	SG&A functions.

	Such expenses increased approximately $221,000 primarily due to an increase
	in salaries, wages and employee benefit costs for new and existing employees. Approximately 13% of SG&A expense is attributable
	to the sales and marketing of products including commissions and royalty expenses. These expenses increased approximately $179,000
	as a result of media and catalog advertising and travel opportunities to promote new product development primarily at the CPG.
	Approximately 10% of SG&A expense is attributable to professional and legal services. These expenses increased approximately
	$96,000 due to ongoing legal proceedings.




	 




	Depreciation and Amortization Expense



	 


	Depreciation and amortization
	expense increased approximately $105,000 or 14.6% for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period
	in 2015 primarily due to the assets related to the CPG expansion and renovation being placed in service in late 2015. Depreciation
	expense fluctuates due to variable estimated useful lives of depreciable property (as identified in Note 1, Business Description
	and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the accompanying consolidated financial statements) as well as the amount and
	nature of capital expenditures in current and previous periods. It is anticipated that the Company’s future capital expenditures
	and related depreciation and amortization expense will, at a minimum, follow the Company’s requirements to support its manufacturing
	delivery commitments and to meet certain information technology related capital expenditure requirements. See also Note 8, Commitments
	and Contingencies, of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information on capital expenditures.



	 




	Arbitration Award Expense



	 


	The Company incurred
	approximately $50,000 in additional interest in the first quarter of 2015 related to an arbitration award finalized on February
	23, 2015, and prior to payment of the award on March 6, 2015.



	 




	Insurance Proceeds - Arbitration



	 


	On February 20, 2015,
	the Company entered into an agreement with its insurance carrier pursuant to which the Company received $4,500,000 from the carrier
	related to the Company's claim for insurance for damages the Company suffered in connection with the previously discussed arbitration
	proceeding. The insurance carrier also paid under the policy partial attorney fees incurred by the Company in defense of the arbitration.
	The insurance proceeds were used to pay the majority of the arbitration award with the remainder being paid by the Company using
	cash on hand.

	See also Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies, of the accompanying consolidated
	financial statements for more information.




	 




	Interest Expense



	 


	Interest expense remained
	relatively consistent for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.

	See
	also Note 4, Long-Term Debt, of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information on long-term debt.

	Other Income



	 


	Components of other
	income include interest income on cash and cash equivalents and other amounts not directly related to the sale of the Company’s
	products. Other income is immaterial in relationship to the consolidated financial statements.



	 




	Income Taxes



	 


	The Company’s
	effective tax rate for operations was 29.0% in 2016 and 31.7% in 2015. The effective tax rate in both years reflects federal and
	state income taxes, permanent non-deductible expenditures, the deduction for domestic production activities and the federal tax
	credit for research and development expenditures. The effective tax rate was lower in 2016 due to increased impact of certain tax
	deductions and research tax credits in relation to the decrease in income from operations. See also Note 6, Income Taxes, of the
	accompanying consolidated financial statements for information concerning income taxes.


	 


	The Company recognizes
	deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts
	and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.



	 




	Net Income



	 


	Income from operations
	decreased approximately $2,844,000 or 61.9% when comparing the twelve month period ended December 31, 2016 to the same period in
	2015. This decrease is the result of a pretax $4,500,000 insurance settlement received on February 20, 2015 as discussed in Note
	8, Commitments and Contingencies, of the accompanying consolidated financial statements, offset by increases in revenues and operating
	profits.




	 






	Liquidity and Capital Resources



	 


	The Company’s
	primary liquidity and capital expenditure requirements relate to working capital needs; primarily inventory, accounts receivable,
	accounts payable, capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment and principal payments on debt. At December 31, 2016,
	the Company had working capital of approximately $20,969,000 ($19,959,000 – 2015) of which approximately $3,515,000 ($3,268,000
	– 2015) was comprised of cash and cash equivalents.


	 


	The Company generated
	approximately $2,441,000 in cash from operations during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $1,231,000 during
	the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. Cash was generated primarily through net income of approximately $1,753,000 as well
	as timing differences in payments to vendors. The primary use of cash for the Company’s operating activities for the twelve
	months ended December 31, 2016 include working capital requirements, mainly an increase in inventory of approximately $890,000
	and timing differences on collections of accounts receivable of approximately $590,000. Cash generated and used in operations is
	consistent with sales volume, customer expectations and competitive pressures.


	 


	The Company’s
	primary use of cash in its financing and investing activities in the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 included approximately
	$548,000 of current principal payments on long-term debt, approximately $380,000 for cash dividends paid on May 16, 2016 as well
	as approximately $275,000 for the purchase of treasury shares. The Company also expended approximately $991,000 for capital expenditures.

	On December 1, 2014,
	the Company, entered into a Loan Agreement that provides for a $2,620,000 seven-year term loan (the “Term Loan”) and
	$2,000,000 line of credit (the “Line of Credit”). The Line of Credit, which replaced the Company’s previous $2,000,000
	line of credit, was renewed on May 23, 2016 and is available until June 21, 2017 unless subsequently renewed. As of December 31,
	2016, there were no draws on the line. The proceeds from the Term Loan were used to pay off the Industrial Development Revenue
	Bonds that were issued by a government agency in 1994 to finance the construction of the Company’s headquarters/advanced
	technology facility and which matured on December 1, 2014.


	 


	In addition, the Company’s
	wholly-owned subsidiary, The Ontario Knife Company (OKC) entered into a separate Loan Agreement with the Bank on December 1, 2014.
	The OKC Loan Agreement provides for a $2,000,000 seven-year term loan (the “OKC Term Loan”). The proceeds from the
	OKC Term Loan were used to purchase equipment and expand/renovate the OKC facility in Franklinville, New York.


	 


	Borrowings under these
	Credit Facilities bear interest, at the Company’s option, at the Bank’s Prime Rate or LIBOR plus 1.4%. Principal installments
	are payable on the Term Loan and the OKC Term Loan through December 1, 2021 with a balloon payment of $786,000 at maturity of the
	Term Loan. The Term Loan and Line of Credit are secured by all of the Company’s equipment, receivables and inventory. The
	OKC Term Loan is secured by substantially all of OKC’s equipment and is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company.


	 


	The Company believes
	its cash generating capability and financial condition, together with available credit facilities will be adequate to meet our
	future operating, investing and financing needs.

	Critical Accounting Policies



	 


	The Company prepares

	by the Company in SEC reports under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
	specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including the CEO,

	reporting was effective as of December 31, 2016.

	the commercial aviation industry and its ability to purchase new aircraft, the willingness and ability of the Company’s customers

	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
	ACCOUNTING FIRM




	 



	To the Board of Directors and Shareholders


	Servotronics, Inc. and Subsidiaries


	 


	We have audited the accompanying consolidated
	balance sheets of Servotronics, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related
	consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are
	the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
	on our audits.


	 


	We conducted our audits in accordance with
	the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform
	the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company
	is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits
	included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate
	in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control
	over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
	supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
	made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
	basis for our opinion.


	 


	In our opinion, the consolidated financial
	statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Servotronics, Inc. and Subsidiaries
	as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity
	with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

	1.






	Business Description
	and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies







	 




	Business Description



	 


	Servotronics, Inc. and its subsidiaries
	design, manufacture and market advanced technology products consisting primarily of control components and consumer products consisting
	of knives and various types of cutlery and other edged products.



	 




	Principles of Consolidation



	 


	The consolidated
	financial statements include the accounts of Servotronics, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (the “Company”).
	All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.



	 




	Cash and Cash Equivalents



	 


	The
	Company considers cash and cash equivalents to include all cash accounts and short-term investments purchased with an original
	maturity of three months or less.


	 



	Accounts
	Receivable



	 


	The Company
	grants credit to substantially all of its customers and carries its accounts receivable at original invoice amount less an allowance
	for doubtful accounts. On a periodic basis, the Company evaluates its accounts receivable and establishes an allowance for doubtful
	accounts based on history of past write-offs, collections, and current credit conditions. The allowance for doubtful accounts amounted
	to approximately $77,000 at December 31, 2016 and $88,000 at December 31, 2015. The Company does not accrue interest on past due
	receivables.



	 




	Revenue
	Recognition



	 


	Revenues
	are recognized as services are rendered or as units are shipped and at the designated FOB point consistent with the transfer of
	title, risks and rewards of ownership. Such purchase orders generally include specific terms relative to quantity, item description,
	specifications, price, customer responsibility for in-process costs, delivery schedule, shipping point, payment and other standard
	terms and conditions of purchase.



	 




	Inventories



	 


	Inventories
	are stated at the lower of standard cost or net realizable value. Cost includes all costs incurred to bring each product to its
	present location and condition. Market provisions in respect of lower of cost or market adjustments and inventory expected to be
	used in greater than one year are applied to the gross value of the inventory through a reserve of approximately $1,513,000 and
	$1,429,000 at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Pre-production and start-up costs are expensed as incurred.


	 


	The purchase
	of suppliers’ minimum economic quantities of material such as steel, etc. may result in a purchase of quantities exceeding
	one year of customer requirements. Also, in order to maintain a reasonable and/or agreed to lead time or minimum stocking requirements,
	certain larger quantities of other product support items may have to be purchased and may result in over one year’s supply.

	INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES




	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	 




	Shipping
	and Handling Costs



	 


	Shipping
	and handling costs are classified as a component of cost of goods sold.



	 




	Property,
	Plant and Equipment



	 


	Property,
	plant and equipment is carried at cost; expenditures for new facilities and equipment and expenditures which substantially increase
	the useful lives of existing plant and equipment are capitalized; expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.
	Upon disposal of properties, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts and any profit
	or loss on disposition is included in income.


	 


	In 2015,
	the Company’s CPG received $700,000 in County and State grants that were used towards the purchase of machinery and equipment.
	The Company recorded the grant proceeds as a reduction to the carrying value of the related assets. See Note 8, Commitments and
	Contingencies for more information related to the facility expansion and subject grants.


	 


	Depreciation
	is provided on the basis of estimated useful lives of depreciable properties, primarily by the straight-line method for financial
	statement purposes and by accelerated methods for tax purposes. Depreciation expense includes the amortization of capital lease
	assets. The estimated useful lives of depreciable properties are generally as follows:



	 








	Buildings and improvements



	 



	5-40 years






	Machinery and equipment



	 



	5-20 years






	Tooling



	 



	3-5 years







	 




	Income
	Taxes



	 


	The Company
	recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying
	amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, as well as operating loss and credit carryforwards. The Company and its subsidiaries
	file a consolidated federal income tax return, combined New York and Texas state income tax returns and separate Pennsylvania and
	Arkansas income tax returns.


	 


	The Company’s
	practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. The Company did not have
	any accrued interest or penalties included in its consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2016 or December 31, 2015, and did
	not recognize any interest and/or penalties in its consolidated statements of income during the years ended December 31, 2016 and
	2015. The Company did not have any material uncertain tax positions or unrecognized tax benefits or obligations as of December
	31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The 2013 through 2015 federal and state tax returns remain subject to examination.



	 




	Supplemental
	Cash Flow Information



	 



	Income
	taxes paid during the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 amounted to approximately $684,000 and $622,000, respectively.
	Interest paid during the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 amounted to approximately $

	72,000 and $77,000

	,
	respectively.



	 



	Employee
	Stock Ownership Plan



	 


	Contributions
	to the employee stock ownership plan are determined annually by the Company according to plan formula.

	INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES




	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	 




	Impairment
	of Long-Lived Assets



	 


	The Company
	reviews long-lived assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying
	amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable based on undiscounted future operating cash flow analyses. If an impairment is
	determined to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value. Impairment losses on assets to be disposed
	of, if any, are based on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal. The Company has determined that no impairment
	of long-lived assets existed at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.



	 




	Use
	of Estimates



	 


	The preparation
	of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management
	to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
	and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
	reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.



	 




	Reclassifications



	 


	Certain
	balances as previously reported were reclassified to conform with classifications adopted in the current period.



	 




	Research
	and Development Costs



	 


	Research
	and development costs are expensed as incurred.



	 




	Concentration
	of Credit Risks



	 


	Financial
	instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risks principally consist of cash accounts in financial
	institutions. Although the accounts exceed the federally insured deposit amount, management does not anticipate nonperformance
	by the financial institutions.


	 


	During
	the Company’s 2016 fiscal year, sales of advanced technology products pursuant to contracts with prime or subcontractors
	for various branches of the United States Government accounted for approximately 9% of the Company’s consolidated revenues
	as compared to 10% in 2015. The Company had sales of advanced technology products to three customers, including various divisions
	and subsidiaries of a common parent company, which represented more than 10% of consolidated revenues in 2016. Total revenues from
	these three customers amounted to approximately 58% in 2016 as compared to two customers amounting to approximately 44% of the
	Company’s consolidated revenues in 2015. No other customers of the ATG or CPG represented more than 10% of the Company’s
	consolidated revenues in either of these years. Refer to Note 11, Business Segments, for disclosures related to business segments
	of the Company.


	 



	Fair
	Value of Financial Instruments



	 


	The carrying
	amount of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses are reasonable estimates of their
	fair value due to their short maturity. Based on variable interest rates and the borrowing rates currently available to the Company
	for loans similar to its long-term debt, their fair value approximates the carrying amount.

	Recent
	Accounting Pronouncements



	 


	In April
	2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-03, “Simplifying
	the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs”, which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability
	be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability. For public business entities,
	the ASU is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within
	those fiscal years. The Company adopted ASU 2015-03 on January 1, 2016 and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s
	financial statements.


	 


	In August
	2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15, “Interest - Imputation of Interest: Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance
	Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements,” which adds comments from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
	addressing ASU 2015-03, as discussed in the previous paragraph, and debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements.
	The SEC commented it would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing
	the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding
	borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. The Company adopted ASU 2015-15 in connection with its adoption of ASU 2015-03 on
	January 1, 2016 and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.


	 


	In May 2014,
	the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)." The new revenue recognition standard
	outlines a comprehensive model for companies to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes
	most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. In August 2015, the FASB affirmed its proposal
	to defer the effective date of the standard to annual reporting periods (and interim reporting periods within those years) beginning
	after December 15, 2017. Entities are permitted to apply the new revenue standard early, but not before the original effective
	date of annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company’s revenues are recognized as services are rendered
	or as units are shipped and at the designated FOB point. The Company does not believe the adoption will have a material impact
	on our consolidated financial statements.


	 


	In July
	2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, “Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory”. The ASU changes
	the measurement principle for certain inventory methods from the lower of cost or market to the lower of cost and net realizable
	value. For public business entities, the ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim
	periods within those fiscal years. The Company does not believe the adoption will have a material impact on the financial statements
	and disclosures.


	 


	In November
	2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, “Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes”. The guidance requires that all
	deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet.
	The guidance becomes effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted. The
	Company is currently evaluating the guidance to determine the impact it may have to its consolidated financial statements.

	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



	 


	In February
	2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842).” There are elements of the new standard that could impact almost
	all entities to some extent, although the lessees will likely see the most significant changes. Lessee will need to recognize virtually
	all of their leases on the balance sheet, by recording the right-of-use asset and a lease liability. Public business entities are
	required to adopt the new leasing standard for fiscal years, and interim period within those fiscal years, beginning December 15,
	2018. For calendar year-end public companies, this means an adoption date of January 1, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The
	Company does not believe the adoption will have a material impact on the financial statements and disclosures.


	 


	In March
	2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, “Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment
	Accounting,” which amends the current stock compensation guidance. The amendments simplify the accounting for the taxes related
	to stock based compensation, including adjustments to how excess tax benefits and a company's payments for tax withholdings should
	be classified. The standard is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The
	Company is currently evaluating the guidance to determine the impact it may have to its consolidated financial statements.

	The term
	loans and line of credit are secured by all personal property of the Company with the exception of certain equipment that was purchased

	Certain lenders require the
	Company to comply with debt covenants as described in the specific loan documents, including a debt service ratio. At December
	31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 the Company was in compliance with these covenants.


	 







	5.




	Employee Benefit Plans






	 




	Employee Stock Ownership
	Plan (ESOP)



	 


	In 1985,
	the Company established an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) for the benefit of employees who meet certain minimum age and service
	requirements. Upon inception of the ESOP, the Company borrowed $2,000,000 from a bank and lent the proceeds to the trust established
	under the ESOP to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock. The Company’s loan to the trust is at an interest
	rate approximating the prime rate and is repayable to the Company over a 40-year term ending in December 2024. During 1987 and
	1988, the Company loaned an additional $1,942,000 to the trust under terms similar to those under the Company’s original
	loan.


	 


	ESOP shares
	are held by the plan trustees in a suspense account until allocated to participant accounts. Each year the Company makes contributions
	to the trust sufficient to enable the trust to repay the principal and interest due to the Company under the trust loans. As the
	loans are repaid, shares are released from the suspense account pro rata based on the portion of the aggregate loan payments that
	are paid during the year. During 2010, the ESOP plan was amended to allow dividends on unallocated shares to be distributed to
	participants in cash, unless otherwise directed. ESOP shares released from the suspense account are allocated to participants on
	the basis of their relative compensation in the year of allocation and/or on the participant’s account balance. For this
	purpose, “compensation” means taxable pay.

	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



	 


	If Servotronics
	shares are not readily tradable on an established securities market at the times of an ESOP participant’s termination of
	employment or retirement and if such ESOP participant requests that his/her ESOP distributed shares be repurchased by the Company,
	the Company is obligated to do so. The Company’s shares currently trade on NYSE MKT, formerly known as the American Stock
	Exchange. There were no outstanding shares subject to the repurchase obligation at December 31, 2016.


	 


	Since
	inception of the ESOP, 410,196 shares have been allocated, exclusive of shares distributed to ESOP participants. At December 31,
	2016 and 2015, 140,292 and 158,396 shares, respectively, remain unallocated.


	 


	Related compensation expense associated
	with the Company’s ESOP, which is equal to the principal reduction on the loans receivable from the trust, amounted to approximately
	$100,000 in 2016 and $101,000 in 2015, respectively. Included as a reduction to shareholders’ equity is the ESOP trust commitment
	which represents the remaining indebtedness of the trust to the Company. Employees are entitled to vote allocated shares and the
	ESOP trustees are entitled to vote unallocated shares and those allocated shares not voted by the employees.


	 



	Other Postretirement Benefit
	Plans



	 


	The Company provides certain postretirement
	health and life insurance benefits for certain executives of the Company. Upon retirement and after attaining at least the age
	of 65, the Company will pay the annual cost of health insurance for the retired executives and their dependents and will continue
	the Company provided life insurance offered at the time of retirement. The retiree’s health insurance benefits ceases upon
	the death of the retired executive. The actuarially calculated future obligation of the benefits at December 31, 2016 and 2015
	is approximately $614,000 and $498,000, respectively, excluding the estimated liability related to postretirement benefits for
	the former Executive Officer discussed in Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies. Additional expense of approximately $91,000 per
	year is expected to be paid subsequent to December 31, 2016. Estimated future annual expenses associated with the plan are immaterial.
	Included in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income for 2016 and 2015 is approximately $20,000 and $3,000, respectively,
	net of deferred taxes, associated with the unrecognized service cost of the plan.

	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



	 


	In assessing
	the ability of the Company to realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than
	not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Based upon the level of historical taxable income,
	the opportunity for net operating loss carrybacks, and projections for future taxable income over the periods which deferred tax
	assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely than not the Company will generate sufficient taxable income to realize
	the benefits of these deductible differences at December 31, 2016, except for a valuation allowance of $253,000 ($397,000 –
	2015) related to certain state net operating loss carryforwards, state tax credit carryforwards and other state net deferred tax
	assets. At December 31, 2016, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards with full valuation allowances from Pennsylvania
	of approximately $2,240,000 ($2,240,000 – 2015), which begin to expire in 2019, and Arkansas of approximately $839,000 ($2,530,000
	– 2015), which begin to expire in 2018, respectively. The Company also has a New York state tax credit carryforward at December
	31, 2016 of approximately $97,000 ($217,000 – 2015), which begins to expire in 2024.


	 


	There
	are no uncertain tax positions or unrecognized tax benefits for 2016 and 2015. The Company is subject to routine audits of its
	tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and various state taxing authorities. The 2013 through 2015 Federal and state tax returns
	remain subject to examination.

	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



	 


	On April
	18, 2013, the Company issued 165,000 shares of restricted stock to Executive Officers of the Company under the Company's 2012 Long-Term
	Incentive Plan that was approved by the shareholders at the 2012 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. This plan authorizes the issuance
	of up to 300,000 shares. The restricted share awards vest over four year periods between January 2014 and January 2017; however,
	have voting rights and accrue dividends prior to vesting. The aggregate amount of expense to the Company, measured based on grant
	date fair value is expected to be $1,336,500 and will be recognized over the four year requisite service period.


	 


	On April
	11, 2016, the Company issued 51,000 shares of restricted stock to Executive Officers and certain key management of the Company
	under the Company’s 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The restricted share awards have varying vesting periods between January
	2017 and January 2018; however, these shares have voting rights and accrue dividends prior to vesting. The aggregate amount of
	expense to the Company, measured based on grant date fair value is expected to be approximately $406,000 and will be recognized
	over the requisite service period. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, there was approximately $479,000 and $361,000,
	respectively, of compensation expense related to the restrictive share awards.


	 



	On
	January 1, 2016, 41,250 shares of restricted stock vested of which

	17,335

	shares were withheld
	and repurchased by the Company for approximately $145,000 to satisfy statutory minimum withholding tax requirements for those participants
	who elected this option as permitted under the Company’s 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan.



	 


	On March
	14, 2016, the Company announced that its Board of Directors declared a $0.15 per share cash dividend. The dividend was subsequently
	paid on May 16, 2016 to shareholders of record on April 11, 2016 and was approximately $380,000 in the aggregate as compared to
	approximately $375,000 paid in 2015, respectively. These dividends do not represent that the Company will pay dividends on a regular
	or scheduled basis. The amount is recorded as a reduction to retained earnings on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.



	 




	Earnings
	Per Share



	 


	Basic earnings
	per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. The weighted
	average number of common shares outstanding does not include any potentially dilutive securities or any unvested restricted shares
	of common stock. These unvested restricted shares, although classified as issued and outstanding, are considered forfeitable until
	the restrictions lapse and will not be included in the basic EPS calculation until the shares are vested. Diluted earnings per
	share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period plus the number
	of shares of common stock that would be issued assuming all contingently issuable shares having a dilutive effect on the earnings
	per share that were outstanding for the period. The dilutive effect of unvested restrictive stock is determined using the treasury
	stock method.

	Shareholders’ Rights Plan



	 


	During
	2012, the Company’s Board of Directors adopted a shareholders’ rights plan (the “Rights Plan”) and simultaneously
	declared a dividend distribution of one right for each outstanding share of the Company’s common stock outstanding at October
	15, 2012. The Rights Plan replaced a previous shareholders rights plan that was adopted in 2002 and expired on August 28, 2012.
	The rights do not become exercisable until the earlier of (i) the date of the Company’s public announcement that a person
	or affiliated group other than Dr. Nicholas D. Trbovich, Kenneth D. Trbovich or the ESOP trust (an “Acquiring Person”)
	has acquired, or obtained the right to acquire, beneficial ownership of 25% or more of the Company’s common stock (excluding
	shares held by the ESOP trust) or (ii) ten business days following the commencement of a tender offer that would result in a person
	or affiliated group becoming an Acquiring Person.

	The exercise price of a right has been established
	at $32.00. Once exercisable, each right would entitle the holder to purchase one one-hundredth of a share of Series A Junior Participating
	Preferred Stock. In the event that any person becomes an Acquiring Person, each right would entitle any holder other than the Acquiring
	Person to purchase common stock or other securities of the Company having a value equal to three times the exercise price. The
	Board of Directors has the discretion in such event to exchange two shares of common stock or two one-hundredths of a share of
	preferred stock for each right held by any holder other than the Acquiring Person.

	Aero, Inc. Aero, Inc. is suing Servotronics, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary and has alleged damages in the amount of
	$3,000,000. The Company has filed a response to the Aero, Inc. lawsuit and has also filed a counter-claim in the amount of
	$3,191,000. The Company considers the risk of loss remote, and is unable to reasonably or accurately estimate the likelihood
	and amount of any liability or benefit that may be realized as a result of this litigation. Accordingly, no gain or loss has
	been recognized in the accompanying financial statements related to this litigation.


	 



	Post
	retirement obligation.

	As previously disclosed in filings with the Securities and Exchange
	Commission (“SEC”), in the first quarter of 2015 the Company paid a former Executive Officer of the Company
	(the “Former Employee”) an arbitration award in connection with the termination of the Former
	Employee’s employment agreement. The Company is also expected to pay post employment health related benefits for the
	Former Employee, of which approximately $528,000 and $471,000, respectively, has been accrued as of December 31, 2016 and
	2015. This amount is reflected as Post Retirement Obligation in the accompanying balance sheet.


	 



	Agreement
	with respect to Insurance Claim

	. As previously disclosed, the Company received $4,500,000 in the first quarter of 2015
	from the carrier related to the Company's claim for insurance for damages the Company suffered in connection with the above
	arbitration proceeding. The insurance carrier also paid under the policy partial attorney fees incurred by the Company in
	defense of the arbitration. The Company recorded the benefit from this agreement during the first quarter of 2015.



	 




	Leases


	.

	of the CPG. The five year plan included the construction of an approximate 28,000 square foot addition, capital improvements to
	the existing plant, the reconfiguration of its production process within the expanded facility, and the addition of new state of
	the art knife-making equipment. The Company broke ground in the second quarter of 2014 and is now manufacturing in the newly constructed
	facility. The cost of the project is approximately $4,000,000 over a five year period of which $3,432,000 was completed as of December
	31, 2016 and is included in property plant and equipment.

	in connection with the proposed expansion project. As part of the terms of the Grant Contract with Cattaraugus County, the Company’s
	CPG has agreed to maintain certain employment levels for a period of five years from the date of the agreement, March 13, 2014.

	salary liability under the agreement notwithstanding the number of years covered by the agreement prior to termination. The term
	of the agreement extends to and includes December 31, 2017 for Dr. Trbovich and December 31, 2019 for Kenneth Trbovich provided,
	however, the term of the agreement will be automatically extended for one additional year beyond its then expiration date unless

	he will be entitled to a severance payment equal to nine month’s salary and benefits.

	INDEMNIFICATION
	AGREEMENT





	 



	This INDEMNIFICATION
	AGREEMENT is made as of __________, by and between

	SERVOTRONICS, INC.

	, a Delaware corporation (the “Corporation”),
	and _______________ (“Indemnitee”).


	 



	INTRODUCTION



	 


	Indemnitee
	is serving as a [director and/or officer] of the Corporation and the Corporation wishes Indemnitee to continue in such position.
	Indemnitee is willing to continue in such positions with the indemnification and other rights provided hereby.


	 


		In recent years,
	litigation seeking to impose liability on directors and officers of publicly-held corporations has become more frequent. Such litigation
	is extremely expensive to defend. In many cases, defense costs exceed the financial means of individual defendants. Further, the
	possibility of liability for extremely large sums is a deterrent to persons accepting positions of responsibility with a public
	corporation.


	 


		Indemnitee
	is deeply concerned regarding this situation, as well as the adequacy of the indemnification available under the Corporation’s
	By-laws and the fact that directors and officers liability insurance, even if obtainable, has become much more limited in the scope
	of its protection and extremely expensive and can be cancelled at any time.


	 


	NOW, THEREFORE, to
	induce Indemnitee to continue to serve the Corporation and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency
	of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereby agree as follows:

	INDEMNIFICATION


	 


	Section 2.1.          

	Proceedings
	by Third Parties

	.


	 


	The Corporation shall
	indemnify Indemnitee if he was or is a party, or is threatened to be made a party, to any Proceeding (other than a Derivative Proceeding)
	by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the
	request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee, agent or trustee of another Entity, against Losses in connection with
	the defense or settlement of such Proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed
	to the best interests of the Corporation and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe
	his conduct was criminal.

	–


	 






	 



	 


	Section 2.2.          

	Derivative
	Proceedings

	.


	 


	(a)          Except
	as provided in Section 2.2(b), the Corporation shall indemnify Indemnitee if he was or is a party, or is threatened to be made
	a party, to any Derivative Proceeding to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer,
	employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee,
	agent or trustee of another Entity, against Losses in connection with the defense or settlement of such Proceeding if he acted
	in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation.


	 


	(b)          No
	indemnification under Section 2.2(a) shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter in a Proceeding as to which Indemnitee
	shall have been adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction to be liable for (i) a breach of fiduciary duty to the Corporation
	or its stockholders that resulted in personal enrichment to the Indemnitee to which he was not legally entitled, or (ii) intentional
	fraud or intentional criminal conduct, unless and only to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction or the court in which
	such Proceeding was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability referred to in clauses
	(i) and (ii) but in view of all relevant circumstances, Indemnitee is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification for such
	Losses which a court of competent jurisdiction or other such court shall deem proper. As used in this Section 2.2(b) and in Section
	2.8, the term “personal enrichment” does not comprehend fees paid to a director or salary and bonus paid to an executive
	officer for serving the Corporation in such capacity provided such fees, salary and bonuses are duly approved by the Corporation’s
	Board of Directors or an appropriate committee of the Board of Directors.


	 


	Section 2.3.          

	No
	Presumptions Based on Manner Proceeding is Terminated

	.


	 


	The termination of
	any Proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of

	nolo contendere

	or its equivalent, shall not
	create a presumption (i) that Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not
	opposed to the best interests of the Corporation or (ii) with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, that Indemnitee had
	reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was criminal.


	 


	Section 2.4.          

	Indemnification
	Against Expenses of Successful Party

	.


	 


	Notwithstanding any
	other provision hereof, to the extent that Indemnitee has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, including the dismissal
	of an action without prejudice, in defense of any Proceeding, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, the Corporation
	promptly shall pay for or reimburse Indemnitee’s Litigation Costs incurred in connection therewith to the extent not already
	advanced pursuant to Section 2.5.


	 


	Section 2.5.          

	Advances
	of Litigation Costs

	.


	 


	At the request of
	Indemnitee, Litigation Costs incurred by him in any Proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition
	of such matter with the undertaking of Indemnitee, which hereby is given, that if it shall be ultimately determined that Indemnitee
	was not entitled to be indemnified, or was not entitled to be fully indemnified, Indemnitee shall repay to the Corporation the
	amount, or appropriate portion thereof, so advanced. The payment by the


	 






	 


	–

	3

	–


	 






	 



	 


	Corporation shall be made promptly (but in any event within 15
	days) after its receipt of Indemnitee’s request therefor.


	 


	Section 2.6.          

	Determination
	of Right to Indemnification Upon Application; Procedure Upon Application

	.


	 


	(a)          Indemnification
	under Section 2.1 and Section 2.2 shall be made promptly, and in any event within 90 days of Indemnitee’s written request
	therefor, unless a determination is made reasonably and within such 90-day period by the Corporation, in the manner provided in
	Section 2.6(b), that Indemnitee acted in bad faith and in a manner that he did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best
	interests of the Corporation or, with respect to any criminal proceeding, that Indemnitee believed or had reasonable cause to believe
	that his conduct was criminal.


	 


	(b)          The
	determination to be made by the Corporation under Section 2.6(a) shall be based on the facts known at the time and shall be made
	(i) by the Board, by a majority vote of the directors who were not parties to the Proceeding (“disinterested directors”)
	even though less than a quorum, or (ii) by a committee of the disinterested directors designated by majority vote of such directors,
	even though less than a quorum, or (iii) if there are no disinterested directors, or if such disinterested directors do direct,
	by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (iv) by the stockholders of the Corporation.


	 


	(c)          The
	right to indemnification hereunder shall be enforceable by Indemnitee in any court of competent jurisdiction if Indemnitee’s
	claim therefor is denied, in whole or in part, in the manner provided herein, or if no disposition of such claim is made within
	the aforesaid 90-day period; provided, however, that either party to this Agreement shall have the right to have any controversy,
	claim or dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including, without limitation, any claim for breach of this Agreement)
	settled by arbitration in a proceeding under the Rules of the American Arbitration Association, except that no arbitration shall
	be commenced on a controversy arising under Section 2.6(a) until the earlier to occur of (i) the expiration of the aforesaid 90-day
	period, (ii) the Corporation refuses to pay all or any portion of the indemnification requested by Indemnitee or (iii) a determination
	is made under Section 2.6(a) in the manner provided for in Section 2.6(b) that Indemnitee is not entitled to all or any portion
	of the indemnification requested by Indemnitee. The election of either party to initiate an arbitration proceeding shall operate
	to stay any other action with respect to the same controversy, claim or dispute, notwithstanding that such action may have been
	initiated prior to the initiation of the arbitration proceeding, and the decision of the arbitrators with respect to such controversy,
	claim or dispute shall be controlling. Any arbitration shall take place in the County of Erie, State of New York, unless both parties
	shall consent to another location, and judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrators pursuant hereto may be entered in any
	court having jurisdiction thereof. Indemnitee’s Litigation Costs incurred in connection with successfully establishing his
	right to indemnification, in whole or in part, in any action or proceeding also shall be indemnified by the Corporation.


	 


	(d)          It
	shall be a defense to an action or proceeding under Section 2.6(c) that Indemnitee has not met the standards of conduct referred
	to herein which make it permissible hereunder for the Corporation to indemnify Indemnitee for the amount claimed, but the burden


	 






	 


	–

	4

	–


	 






	 



	 


	of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including the Board, independent legal
	counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action or proceeding that indemnification
	of Indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standards of conduct hereunder, nor an actual determination
	by the Corporation (including the Board, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that Indemnitee had not met such applicable
	standard of conduct, shall be a defense to Indemnitee’s action or proceeding or create a presumption that Indemnitee had
	not met the applicable standards of conduct.


	 


	Section 2.7.          

	Exclusions

	.


	 


	(a)          The
	Corporation shall not be liable to make any payment hereunder (whether in the nature of indemnification or contribution) to the
	extent payment is actually made to or on behalf of Indemnitee under a valid, enforceable and collectible insurance policy (the
	“Insurance Policy”). If Indemnitee is required to pay any amount that the Corporation is obligated to pay hereunder
	except for the exclusion in this subsection, before payment is reasonably expected to be made under the Insurance Policy, the Corporation
	shall promptly advance the amount Indemnitee is required to pay for which the Corporation is liable hereunder. Any advance by the
	Corporation shall be made with the undertaking of Indemnitee, which hereby is given, that he shall immediately pay over to the
	Corporation, from the funds Indemnitee later receives under the Insurance Policy, an amount equal to the amount which the Corporation
	advanced pursuant to this subsection.


	 


	(b)          The
	Corporation shall not be liable hereunder for amounts paid in settlement of a Proceeding effected without its written consent,
	which consent may not be unreasonably withheld. Without intending to limit the circumstances in which it would be unreasonable
	for the Corporation to withhold its consent to a settlement, the parties agree that it would be unreasonable for the Corporation
	to withhold its consent (i) to a settlement in an amount that did not exceed, in the judgment of the Board, the estimated amount
	of Litigation Costs of Indemnitee to litigate the Proceeding to conclusion or (ii) with respect to a Proceeding other than a Derivative
	Proceeding, to any settlement proposed by Indemnitee unless a determination is made reasonably and within 90 days of being proposed
	by the Corporation, in the manner provided in Section 2.6(b), that Indemnitee acted in bad faith and in a manner that he did not
	believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation or, with respect to any criminal proceeding, that Indemnitee
	believed or had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was criminal. Clause (i) of this Section 2.7(b) is not intended to
	eliminate the requirement that Indemnitee satisfy the applicable standards of conduct in Section 2.1 and Section 2.2 (determined
	as provided in Section 2.6).


	 


	(c)          The
	Corporation shall not be liable hereunder for any Fine imposed by law which the Corporation is prohibited by applicable law from
	paying as indemnity or otherwise.


	 


	Section 2.8.          

	Contribution

	.


	 


	In order to provide
	for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for herein is held by a court of competent
	jurisdiction to be unavailable to Indemnitee in whole or part, the parties agree that, in such event, the Corporation shall


	 






	 


	–

	5

	–


	 






	 



	 


	contribute to the
	payment of Indemnitee’s Losses in an amount that is just and equitable in the circumstances, taking into account, among
	other things, contributions by other directors and officers of the Corporation pursuant to Indemnification Agreements or otherwise.
	The Corporation and Indemnitee agree that, in the absence of personal enrichment of Indemnitee as a result of his illegal or improper
	conduct, or acts of intentional fraud or intentional criminal conduct on the part of Indemnitee, it would not be just and equitable
	for Indemnitee to contribute to the payment of Losses arising out of a Proceeding in an amount greater than: (i) in a case where
	Indemnitee is a director of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries but not an officer of either, the amount of fees paid to
	Indemnitee for serving as a director during the 12 months preceding the commencement of such Proceeding; or (ii) in a case where
	Indemnitee is an officer of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries (whether or not he is a director of either or both), 5%
	of the aggregate cash compensation paid to Indemnitee for serving as such officer(s) during the 12 months preceding the commencement
	of such Proceeding; provided, however, that if the amount of any improper personal enrichment of Indemnitee is immaterial, Indemnitee
	shall nevertheless be entitled to contribution hereunder and the amount that Indemnitee shall contribute hereunder shall be increased
	by the amount of any such improper personal enrichment. The Corporation shall contribute to the payment of Losses covered hereby
	to the extent not payable by Indemnitee pursuant to the contribution provisions set forth in the preceding sentence.


	 


	Section 2.9.          

	Notice
	to Corporation; Cooperation

	.


	 


	(a)          Indemnitee
	shall give the Corporation notice, as soon as practicable, of any claim made against him for which indemnification will be or could
	be sought hereunder; provided, however, that the failure of Indemnitee to give such notice shall not affect in any way the enforceability
	of any of Indemnitee’s rights hereunder.


	 


	(b)          Indemnitee
	shall give the Corporation such cooperation and information as it may reasonably require in connection with any claim by Indemnitee
	hereunder.


	 


	(c)          The
	Corporation shall give Indemnitee notice, as soon as practicable, of any Proceeding of which it has knowledge and as to which there
	is reasonable grounds to believe that Indemnitee may become a party thereto; provided, however, that the failure of the Corporation
	to give such notice shall not affect in any way the enforceability of any of the Corporation’s rights hereunder.


	 


	Section 2.10.         

	Other
	Rights and Remedies

	.


	 


	The
	rights provided hereby shall not be deemed exclusive of any other right to which Indemnitee may be entitled under any statute,
	applicable charter or by-law provision, agreement, vote of stockholders or of disinterested directors, or otherwise, both as to
	action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue after Indemnitee
	ceases to serve the Corporation in the position identified in the Introduction hereof.


	 


	Section 2.11.         

	Serving
	at Corporation’s Request

	.


	 


	References in ARTICLE
	Two to “serving at the request of the Corporation” include service with respect to any employee benefit plan, its participants,
	or beneficiaries. If


	 






	 


	–

	–


	 






	 



	 


	Indemnitee acted in
	good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit
	plan, he shall be deemed to have acted in a manner “not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation” as referred
	to in ARTICLE Two.


	 


	Section 2.12.         

	Proceedings
	Initiated by Indemnitee

	.


	 


	The Corporation shall
	indemnify Indemnitee if he was or is a party, or had taken steps to become a party, to any Proceeding initiated by Indemnitee by
	reason of or arising out of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was
	serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee, agent or trustee of another Entity, against Litigation
	Costs in connection with the Proceeding to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware Corporation Law, as the same exists or
	may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation
	to provide broader indemnification rights than such law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment) only if the
	Proceeding (or part thereof) had been authorized by the Corporation in the manner provided in Section 2.6(b).

	Three



	 


	MISCELLANEOUS


	 


	Section 3.1.          

	Binding
	Effect

	.


	 


	This Agreement shall
	be binding upon all successors and assigns of the Corporation (including any transferee of all or substantially all of its assets
	and any successor by merger or operation of law) and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, personal representatives and estate
	of Indemnitee.


	 


	Section 3.2.          

	Savings
	Clause

	.


	 


	If all or any portion
	of any section hereof is held invalid or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever, the validity and enforceability of the remaining

	CERTIFICATION


	 


	I, Dr. Nicholas D. Trbovich, certify that:


	 






	1.


	I have reviewed this annual report on Form 10-K of Servotronics, Inc.;




	 






	2.


	Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
	omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements
	were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;




	 






	3.


	Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this
	report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant
	as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;




	 






	4.


	The registrant’s other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining
	disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial
	reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:




	 






	a)


	Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures
	to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated
	subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being
	prepared;




	 






	b)


	Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial
	reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
	and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;




	 






	c)


	Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures and presented
	in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered
	by this report based on such evaluation; and




	 






	d)


	Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting
	that occurred during the registrant’s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant’s fourth fiscal quarter in the case
	of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant’s internal
	control over financial reporting; and




	 






	5.


	The registrant’s other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent
	evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant’s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant’s
	board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):




	 






	a)


	All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control
	over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant’s ability to record, process, summarize
	and report financial information; and




	 






	b)


	Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
	role in the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting.

The operations of the Company can be affected by the trends of the economy, including interest rates, income tax laws, government regulation, legislation, and other factors. In addition, uncertainties in today's global economy, competition from expanding manufacturing capabilities and technical sophistication of low-cost developing countries and emerging markets, currency policies in relation to the U.S. dollar of some major foreign exporting countries, the effect of terrorism, difficulty in predicting defense and other government appropriations, the vitality of the commercial aviation industry and its ability to purchase new aircraft, the willingness and ability of the Company's customers to fund long-term purchase programs, volatile market demand and the continued market acceptance of the Company's advanced technology and cutlery products make it difficult to predict the impact on future financial results.


                                        








Both the ATG and CPG markets are sensitive to domestic and foreign economic conditions and policies, which may create volatility in operating results from period to period. For example, the airline industry is sensitive to fuel price increases and economic conditions. These factors directly impact the demand for aircraft production as well as the amount of repair and overhaul required on in-service aircraft.

Government procurements are subject to Congressional appropriations and priorities that may change from year to year. Such changes could result in, but are not limited to, the expansion and/or contraction of Government procurement requirements, a reduction in funding, the continuation or termination of existing programs, the introduction of new programs requiring the funds that were originally directed to current programs, a stretch-out in Government delivery requirements or such other U.S. Government determinations that could result in increases or reductions of Government purchase orders for the ATG and/or the CPG products.


                                        








The Company's suppliers are also subject to all the pressures and volatility being generated by the current global economic conditions. Any interruption of the Company's continuous flow of material and product parts that are required for the manufacture of the Company's products could adversely impact the Company's ability to meet the Company's customers' delivery requirements. Consistent with the evolving requirements of the Aerospace Industry, companies are increasingly being requested to operate under Long-Term Agreements with their Customers on the basis of fixed prices, targeted year to year price reductions and/or year to year price adjustments predicated on mutually agreed indices and/or a combination of some or all of the above described pricing arrangements and/or otherwise. Therefore, productivity improvements and cost containment strategies are continuously sought within the Company's concept of continuous improvement. The Company's products are labor intensive and as such productivity improvements are expected to have positive effects on the Company's operating results. However, increased costs for raw material, purchased parts and/or labor will have the reverse effect. Therefore, there are strong incentives to continuously improve productivity and to contain/reduce costs.


                                        








If any adverse economic events reduce the number of Airliners and/or Aircraft being produced by the Company's relevant prime contractors, the negative effects of that reduction will in turn flow down through the supply chain. Also, certain major manufacturers have successfully imposed extended payment terms to their suppliers. At times, these extended payment terms are not available to the Company when purchasing raw material such as aluminum, magnetic material, steel and/or other product support items and services. If the Company's customers delay their payments until after the extended due date or fail to pay, it could adversely impact the Company's operating results.


                                        








Maximizing the Company's operations requires continued dedicated performances from the Company's key and other personnel. In the Company's markets and business arenas there is substantial competition for the services of the highest performing individuals. Competitors, customers and other companies who may have interest in the Company's most experienced and educated/highly trained personnel (i.e., Managerial, Engineering and Accounting/Administrative) are a continuing consequence of the Company's history of successful operational performance. Any unplanned replacement of such personnel may require the hiring of new personnel on an expedited basis (provided they are available) and may temporarily interrupt the Company's operations and efforts for continuous improvement.


                                        








Management Discussion


                                        








During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, approximately 9% and 11%, respectively, of the Company's revenues were derived from contracts with agencies of the U.S. Government or their prime contractors and their subcontractors. Sales of products sold for government applications decreased approximately $649,000 and $1,353,000 from the prior year during 2016 and 2015, respectively, due to decreased government shipments at the ATG. The Company believes that government involvement in military operations overseas will continue to have an impact on the financial results in both the Advanced Technology and Consumer Products markets. While the Company is optimistic in relation to these potential opportunities, it recognizes that sales to the government are affected by defense budgets, the foreign policies of the U.S. and other nations, the level of military operations and other factors, as such, it is difficult to predict the impact on future financial results.

The Company's commercial business is affected by such factors as uncertainties in today's global economy, global competition, the vitality and ability of the commercial aviation industry to purchase new aircraft, the effects and threats of terrorism, market demand and acceptance both for the Company's products and its customers' products which incorporate Company made components.


                                        








The ATG engages its business development efforts in its primary markets and is broadening its activities to include new domestic and foreign markets that are consistent with its core competencies. We believe our business remains particularly well positioned in the strong commercial aircraft market driven by the replacement of older aircraft with more fuel efficient alternatives and the increasing demand for air travel in emerging markets. Although the ATG backlog continues to be strong, actual scheduled shipments may be delayed/changed as a function of the Company's customers' final delivery determinations based on changes in the global economy and other factors.


                                        








The CPG continues to diversify its revenue streams with a broader government focus and new commercial channels, including the addition of national retailers, international accounts, and a direct-to-consumer business line, in response to recent and ongoing reductions in military spending. The CPG is also actively growing its custom manufacturing business to provide a wide range of metal and plastic fabrication services to a variety of consumer and industrial companies. New product development is focused on the commercialization of products with applications that span government and civilian requirements to maximize demand or that open up new lines of business entirely.


                                        








The ATG and CPG continue to respond to U.S. government procurement requests for quotes. New product development activities are ongoing along with the acquisition and development of new product lines.

The Company's consolidated revenues from operations increased approximately $1,858,000 or 5.1% for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015. The increase in revenue is attributable to an increase in commercial shipments of $3,120,000 at the ATG offset by decreases in commercial shipments at the CPG of approximately $605,000. Revenues from shipments to the Government and its prime vendors at the ATG decreased approximately $657,000 and $1,018,000, respectively, for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015 due to previously reported budget cuts for military spending and vagaries inherent in the Government procurement process and programs.


                                        








Cost of Goods Sold


                                        








Cost of goods sold increased approximately $923,000 or 3.3% for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015. The increase in costs is primarily attributable to increased sales volume. Cost of goods sold, as a percentage of revenue, decreased from 75.3% to 74.0% due in part to the mix of product sold as well as the realization of certain expected operational efficiencies attributable to increased production volumes for in-house and outsourced operations. Total employment levels grew from 304 employees at December 31, 2015 to 320 employees at December 31, 2016. The increase in employees is in response to an increase in production capacity requirements at the ATG as evidenced by an increase of 17.8% in the value of purchase orders placed when comparing 2016 to 2015. The Company continues to pursue cost saving opportunities in material procurements and other operating efficiencies including capital investments and technical developments in updated and new equipment/machinery as well as investing in the development and training of its labor force.

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased approximately $506,000 or 8.2% for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. Approximately 64% of SG&A expense relates to labor and labor related costs to support SG&A functions. Such expenses increased approximately $221,000 primarily due to an increase in salaries, wages and employee benefit costs for new and existing employees. Approximately 13% of SG&A expense is attributable to the sales and marketing of products including commissions and royalty expenses. These expenses increased approximately $179,000 as a result of media and catalog advertising and travel opportunities to promote new product development primarily at the CPG. Approximately 10% of SG&A expense is attributable to professional and legal services. These expenses increased approximately $96,000 due to ongoing legal proceedings.


                                        








Depreciation and Amortization Expense


                                        








Depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately $105,000 or 14.6% for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to the assets related to the CPG expansion and renovation being placed in service in late 2015. Depreciation expense fluctuates due to variable estimated useful lives of depreciable property (as identified in Note 1, Business Description and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the accompanying consolidated financial statements) as well as the amount and nature of capital expenditures in current and previous periods. It is anticipated that the Company's future capital expenditures and related depreciation and amortization expense will, at a minimum, follow the Company's requirements to support its manufacturing delivery commitments and to meet certain information technology related capital expenditure requirements. See also Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies, of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information on capital expenditures.

On February 20, 2015, the Company entered into an agreement with its insurance carrier pursuant to which the Company received $4,500,000 from the carrier related to the Company's claim for insurance for damages the Company suffered in connection with the previously discussed arbitration proceeding. The insurance carrier also paid under the policy partial attorney fees incurred by the Company in defense of the arbitration. The insurance proceeds were used to pay the majority of the arbitration award with the remainder being paid by the Company using cash on hand. See also Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies, of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information.

Income Taxes


                                        








The Company's effective tax rate for operations was 29.0% in 2016 and 31.7% in 2015. The effective tax rate in both years reflects federal and state income taxes, permanent non-deductible expenditures, the deduction for domestic production activities and the federal tax credit for research and development expenditures. The effective tax rate was lower in 2016 due to increased impact of certain tax deductions and research tax credits in relation to the decrease in income from operations. See also Note 6, Income Taxes, of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information concerning income taxes.


                                        








The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.


                                        








Net Income


                                        








Income from operations decreased approximately $2,844,000 or 61.9% when comparing the twelve month period ended December 31, 2016 to the same period in 2015. This decrease is the result of a pretax $4,500,000 insurance settlement received on February 20, 2015 as discussed in Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies, of the accompanying consolidated financial statements, offset by increases in revenues and operating profits.


                                        








Liquidity and Capital Resources


                                        








The Company's primary liquidity and capital expenditure requirements relate to working capital needs; primarily inventory, accounts receivable, accounts payable, capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment and principal payments on debt. At December 31, 2016, the Company had working capital of approximately $20,969,000 ($19,959,000 - 2015) of which approximately $3,515,000 ($3,268,000 - 2015) was comprised of cash and cash equivalents.


                                        








The Company generated approximately $2,441,000 in cash from operations during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $1,231,000 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. Cash was generated primarily through net income of approximately $1,753,000 as well as timing differences in payments to vendors. The primary use of cash for the Company's operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 include working capital requirements, mainly an increase in inventory of approximately $890,000 and timing differences on collections of accounts receivable of approximately $590,000. Cash generated and used in operations is consistent with sales volume, customer expectations and competitive pressures.


                                        








The Company's primary use of cash in its financing and investing activities in the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 included approximately $548,000 of current principal payments on long-term debt, approximately $380,000 for cash dividends paid on May 16, 2016 as well as approximately $275,000 for the purchase of treasury shares. The Company also expended approximately $991,000 for capital expenditures.

On December 1, 2014, the Company, entered into a Loan Agreement that provides for a $2,620,000 seven-year term loan (the "Term Loan") and $2,000,000 line of credit (the "Line of Credit"). The Line of Credit, which replaced the Company's previous $2,000,000 line of credit, was renewed on May 23, 2016 and is available until June 21, 2017 unless subsequently renewed. As of December 31, 2016, there were no draws on the line. The proceeds from the Term Loan were used to pay off the Industrial Development Revenue Bonds that were issued by a government agency in 1994 to finance the construction of the Company's headquarters/advanced technology facility and which matured on December 1, 2014.


                                        








In addition, the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, The Ontario Knife Company (OKC) entered into a separate Loan Agreement with the Bank on December 1, 2014. The OKC Loan Agreement provides for a $2,000,000 seven-year term loan (the "OKC Term Loan"). The proceeds from the OKC Term Loan were used to purchase equipment and expand/renovate the OKC facility in Franklinville, New York.


                                        








Borrowings under these Credit Facilities bear interest, at the Company's option, at the Bank's Prime Rate or LIBOR plus 1.4%. Principal installments are payable on the Term Loan and the OKC Term Loan through December 1, 2021 with a balloon payment of $786,000 at maturity of the Term Loan. The Term Loan and Line of Credit are secured by all of the Company's equipment, receivables and inventory. The OKC Term Loan is secured by substantially all of OKC's equipment and is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company.


                                        








The Company believes its cash generating capability and financial condition, together with available credit facilities will be adequate to meet our future operating, investing and financing needs.
