 Mutual FundsAll Cap Fund Fact Sheet
 


Wellington Shields All‐Cap Mutual Fund (WSCMX)
Wellington Shields All Cap Mutual Fund (WSCMX) has an objective of capital appreciation. The managers use a G.A.A.R.P philosophy to invest in high quality companies with above market growth potential.
Earnings Growth
WSCMX owns a portfolio that in aggregate has an outlook for above market earnings growth.
Capitalization Focus
The Fund invests across the capitalization spectrum but owns a core portfolio of large and mid‐cap names representing over 80% of the portfolio. The balance of the portfolio may be invested in smaller capitalization names offering the prospect of exceptional growth.
Dividend and Cash Generation
While WSCMX does not have a current income objective, it targets businesses that produce free cash flow, giving flexibility to return cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks or to reinvest in their business. As a result not all holdings pay a dividend.
Sector Diversification
Sectors and industries come into and out of favor in an unpredictable manner. Therefore we maintain exposure to quality companies in all major sectors of the S&P 500, targeting sector weights of no more than double, and no less than half of the major sectors of the S&P 500.
Risk Control
WSCMX targets initial positions weightings of approximately 3.3%. If a position decreases 15% in value from its original cost, it is reviewed by the investment committee. If a position appreciates to 7.5% of the portfolio, the investment committee evaluates taking profits.
The Fund may hold up to 20% of its assets in cash.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).

What Our Clients say







 I am particularly satisfied with my portfolio's performance, especially given in the present complicated economic context. But most of all I value the ease with which I can discuss strategies or the relative virtues of a particular stock with the expert who is on top of my portfolio. Communication is First Class at Wellington Shields Co
- C. Noble 
 



 I want to thank you for the excellent job that you have done with our account. Having worked with many Investment managers, I value the unique approach your company adopts to manage the client portfolios. Each is tailored to the needs of an investor. Your stock picking ability has been exceptional. My best to you.
- M.Lachman CPA
 



 After working for nearly a year with a rival investment bank to finance an acquisition, we approached Wellington Shields at year-end and told them we needed to get a deal done quickly since our LOI was about to expire. Ed Cabrera and Wellington spent time with us to understand the transaction, they developed a unique marketing strategy and were successful in raising us $4.5 million between Christmas and New Years, to our amazement. The professionalism of Wellington Shields and their creativity has led us to make Wellington Shields our go-to bankers
- John Salerno, iGambit, Inc Chairman, CEO
