Capital and Sponsorship for the Natural Resources Industry Since 1988 | Natural Gas Partners 






































 



































 
























Capital and Sponsorship for the Natural Resources Industry Since 1988



Founded in 1988, NGP has a family of private equity investment funds with approximately $17 billion of cumulative equity commitments organized to make direct equity investments in the energy sector.  NGP invests where there is a clear match between a management team’s growth strategy and NGP’s unique sponsorship capabilities.  NGP understands the dynamics of investing in a commodity business and works to support its portfolio companies as their growth strategy is executed.  
The strength of the firm lies in establishing relationships with “owner-managers” who see the mutual advantage of having an active sponsor, and then financing that management team.  NGP’s investments range from $10-$500 million.  
Since 1988, NGP has invested in over 300 transactions with over 190 companies throughout the energy sector and has been the catalyst for some of the largest recapitalizations and merger transactions in the industry.  We believe our consistent approach has become the standard for the energy-focused private equity industry.  NGP’s investment team offers a depth of experience supporting management teams to reach their goals while generating attractive returns for its investors.  

 














Tombstones are reflective of the NGP flagship funds.
