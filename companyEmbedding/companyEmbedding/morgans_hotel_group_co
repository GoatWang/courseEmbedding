Car Accident Lawyers



Car Accident Lawyers







At Morgan & Morgan, our attorneys understand the difficulties that can arise after a car accident. We have witnessed the injuries and damage that can result from a crash and understand the struggle some victims may face in trying to recover compensation for their losses.
Our car accident attorneys have handled automobile accident cases in several states and if you’ve suffered any degree of injury, we may be able to help you.
If you’ve been in a car accident and are unsure of your next step, please fill out our free case review form. Our firm will review your claim for free and determine if our lawyers may be able to help you with your personal injury claim.
How Can a Car Accident Attorney Help Me?
Driving is getting more dangerous. In fact, 35,092 people died in crashes on U.S. roadways in 2015 according to the National Highway Safety Administration.
So having an experienced attorney represent you after your car accident is becoming more important than ever before.
There are specific rules and regulations that can complicate insurance claims and the recovery of additional damages, such as for pain and suffering, in cases of severe injury or death. An attorney can help ensure you receive full benefits from the insurance company and determine whether you can file a claim for additional damages against the party at fault in the event of a car accident.
If you have suffered any degree of injury, we may be able to help you file a lawsuit to claim compensation beyond what is provided by insurance claims.
Once you’ve exhausted your personal injury protection (PIP) benefits and decide you want to take legal action against the driver at fault for the crash, our attorneys can begin preparing your claim by:

Collecting police and accident scene reports
Questioning witnesses
Reconstructing the accident scene
Taking photographs of the scene, damage, and injuries
Analyzing medical reports
Contacting expert witnesses to review evidence
Speaking with the insurance providers on your behalf

The insurance company or negligent party from which you are attempting to collect compensation will work to categorize your injury as temporary, rather than permanent. Your attorney can collect and organize evidence on your behalf to rebut the defendant’s claims.
Car Accident Injuries and Compensation
Because each accident is different, the extent of injuries suffered will vary between cases. In many cases, the costs for treatment of the injuries sustained will not be covered by PIP insurance and will require additional litigation or negotiations.
Some injuries that we may attempt to collect compensation for include, but are not limited to:

Paralysis
Burns and scars
Loss of limbs
Spinal cord injuries
Head injuries
Joint, muscle, back, neck, and bone injuries
Knee damage
Whiplash
Permanent disability
Wrongful death

If you have suffered any degree of injury, contact us by filling out our free, no-obligation case review form.
Economic auto accident damages, also known as compensatory damages, attempt to compensate the injured car crash victim for his or her monetary losses. Common economic damages awarded in car accident lawsuits include:


Medical Expenses: This could include expenses for emergency room
visits, hospitalization, emergency surgery, any assistive devices and
future appointments with a medical professional.


Future Medical
Expenses: If the car accident victim can prove that they will need
continued medical care as a result of the crash, they may be able to
recover the cost of future medical expenses.


Lost Wages: Car
accident victims who have been injured can seek compensation for lost
wages from the time of injury to the conclusion of the lawsuit. Even if
the victim was unemployed, he or she could receive compensation for lost
wages if the attorney can prove that the accident limited his or her
earning potential.


Loss of Earning Capacity: If you sustained
injuries that prevent you from working, you may be able to receive
compensation by proving that your earning capacity was negatively
impacted by the incident. In this case, the jury will
typically determine the amount the victim could have earned if the car accident had not occurred.


Non-economic car accident damages award the plaintiff for non-financial losses. Car accident damages for non-monetary losses are typically harder to quantify and may include compensation for the following:


Pain and Suffering: This includes compensation for the pain and
suffering you faced after the accident. In awarding damages for pain and
suffering, the jury will examine the extent of your injuries, including
how long you are expected to suffer, the nature of the injury, and what
financial burdens the incident places on you and your family.


Mental
Anguish: You may also be able to attain compensation for the emotional
pain you faced after the incident. Mental anguish, for example, can
include feelings of fright, nervousness, worry, grief, and any other
type of emotional trauma a victim can face after a devastating accident.


Loss of Consortium: The surviving spouse may be awarded compensation for the loss of services, assistance, aid, society, and companionship of his or her loved one in the case of a wrongful death caused by a car accident. Surviving parents may be awarded compensation for the loss of love, affection and companionship of their minor children as a result of their wrongful death. Likewise, minor children may be awarded compensation for the loss of services, assistance, aid, society and companionship of their parents as a result of their wrongful death.


Punitive Damages: If the
actions of the defendant were so malicious or egregious, the jury may
impose punitive damages, which are intended to punish the defendant and
discourage similar behavior in the future.


Seeking Additional Damages
The strength and success of your claim will likely hinge on the ability of your attorney to collect, analyze, and present evidence.
If you are seeking additional damages, your attorney will approach the negligent party’s insurance company in an attempt to recover compensation to cover your remaining costs. Your claim will be submitted for approval to the insurance company, which will have conducted an investigation of its own.
The strength and success of your claim will likely hinge on the ability of your attorney to collect, analyze, and present evidence. This is no easy task though because the opposing insurance company will want to minimize their payout. 
Providing your attorney with as much information as possible can help strengthen your claim. If your attorney and the insurance company cannot agree on a settlement, the case may proceed to trial.
Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist Accidents
After exhausting PIP coverage, if the other driver has no other insurance or an amount of coverage that is insufficient to cover the costs related to your injury, your uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage may cover the damage caused by the negligent party.
If the negligent party was underinsured, your insurance will cover the difference between your losses and the amount you received from the other party’s insurance company. If you do not have this coverage, you should contact an attorney to obtain compensation for injuries resulting from the accident.
An attorney may be able to seek damages from the negligent party’s homeowners’ insurance, your own insurance carrier or your health insurance provider. Attempting to collect compensation through your uninsured motorist coverage can be complicated and will likely require the assistance of an experienced attorney.
Your insurance company may try to limit your payout, based on their own investigation of the accident and how much they believe your claim is worth. If you receive an amount that you believe does not properly cover your losses, your attorney may be able to file a lawsuit against your insurance company in an attempt to recover additional compensation.
Types of Car Accident Claims
“No-fault” insurance law attempts to limit the number of lawsuits filed over minor car accidents. Civil suits to recover additional compensation for personal injury damages are only permitted under certain circumstances, such as:
Negligence
Most car accidents rely on the concept of negligence, or the
party’s failure to exercise a certain level of caution while operating a
vehicle or using common roads. Negligence is one of the most common factors in accidents that harm other motorists, pedestrians, or bicyclists.
To prove negligence, your attorney 
will conduct a preliminary investigation to identify who was responsible for the accident.
To have the best chances of receiving compensation, the attorney must
prove that the defendant failed to meet a reasonable standard of care
and that his or her negligence caused the accident. Some examples of
defendants are negligent drivers, reckless drivers, intoxicated drivers, and bus drivers.
Manufacturer Liability
If your vehicle, or the other party’s vehicle, had a defect contributed
to the accident, the injured party may have a claim against the
manufacturer of the vehicle or one of its parts. If the car had a faulty
design, or a manufacturing and labeling issue, the manufacturer can be
held responsible regardless of who was actually at fault for the
accident.
To prevail, your attorney must prove that you were not at fault for the
accident as the defect that caused the accident occurred during the
manufacturing process. Oftentimes expert testimony and analysis is used
as evidence to prove that the defect contributed in some way to the
accident. Successful lawsuits will require the plaintiff to show:

The defective car or part was “unreasonably dangerous”
The vehicle was being operated as intended
The vehicle’s performance had not changed since its initial purchase

Claims are usually filed against manufacturers in the case of defective parts such as seat belts, airbags, accelerators, brakes, and engines.
Road Design
In some cases, faulty construction, design, or maintenance of roads can contribute to accidents. Some common causes include:


Embankments: When a road curves, the outer edge is set
at an incline as a safety precaution. These raised areas serve the
purpose of managing traffic so that vehicles can approach the outer edge
of the road without driving off it. If the embankment is too steep or
not elevated properly, motorists may be in danger.


Barriers and
Guard Rails: Barriers, guard rails, speed bumps, medians, and
curbs help to influence safe driving. If any of these structures are
poorly designed or placed, driver safety may be compromised.


Surfaces: Various alterations in road surface alert drivers of
approaching hazards or that they are leaving their lane unexpectedly.


Signage: Signs give drivers prior notice of approaching
intersections, sharp turns, animal crossings, etc. They should be
positioned in obvious locations and brightly illuminated for maximum
visibility.


Traffic Control: Traffic lights, stop and
yield signs, lights to warn drivers of intersections and crosswalks, and
other devices are utilized to dictate traffic flow. Proper placement and
operation of these devices are imperative.


Wrongful Death
If you have lost a loved one in a car crash, you may have legal recourse through a wrongful death lawsuit. In these cases, the family or survivors of the victim must prove that their loved one was killed as a result of another’s negligence. Economic, non-economic, and punitive damages may be available.

What You Should Know About Personal Injury

Personal Injury Lawsuits



Personal Injury Lawsuits







No one likes to get injured — it often means dealing with lengthy periods of pain and a pile of medical bills. But when it’s not even your fault, that can be worse. You’re left dealing with physical, emotional, and financial pain that someone else caused. Luckily, the legal system is fine-tuned to address this scenario. This is called “personal injury law.”
What is Personal Injury?
Personal injury law is a very specific type of civil law. A private individual plaintiff can file a lawsuit against someone they accuse of wrongful conduct that contributed to their injury. Personal injury attorneys in these cases will go to great lengths to advocate for their clients. This can include investigating the scene of the accident, questioning witnesses, working with medical experts, and sometimes even working with experts that can help reconstruct the accident, among other things.
Why File A Personal Injury Lawsuit?
An injury may not seem like grounds for a lawsuit at first, but it can cause lasting physical and emotional damage, leading to long-time pain and financial strain. If someone else caused a severe or lingering injury, you may be able to file a personal injury suit and gain compensation for your damages. Whether someone else can be held be responsible is key to determining if you have a lawsuit on your hands. With enough evidence that another party’s negligence caused your injury, you may be able to reach a settlement or take your case to trial.
At Morgan & Morgan, we have more than 300 lawyers nationwide with vast experience in various types of personal injury law and a reputation for helping people receive the compensation they need. Our attorneys have years of experience taking cases to trial, where we have been able to recover many times the amount of an insurance company’s initial settlement offer.
What Type of Personal Injury Lawsuits Do People File?
Here are some of the forms of personal injury lawsuits we have worked on, and the ways these injuries and lawsuits come about.
Motor Vehicle Accidents
Vehicles all bring with them a unique risk of injury, and a number of different types of lawsuits. The majority of these accidents are car accidents, but can also include motorcycle, trucking, and even boating accidents. Often, these personal injury claims stem from the negligence of another driver. From texting while driving and driving under the influence, these acts and more can cause lifelong damage to someone. Even lesser accidents can require long-term medical care. These lawsuits are often brought to get compensation for medical bills and future medical expenses, such as rehabilitation. There are also damages potentially available for lost time at work, and the physical and emotional suffering endured.
Premises Liability/Slip and Fall
Those who have slipped and fallen on someone’s property may find themselves with an injury that could have been avoided had the property owner acted more carefully in maintaining their property. This type of fall can cause an injury that lingers, resulting in lengthy, costly medical bills. Slip and fall lawsuits can be a lot of work at times, but if you have the evidence to show negligence, the owner of a restaurant, store, or other establishment may be held liable for your damages.
Construction Injuries
Construction jobs are inherently risky, and construction sites are home to many on-the-job injuries. And as such, many construction accident injury claims can also fall into other categories.
Dog Bites
Dog bites and attacks can be far more serious than they sound. Those who have been bitten by someone else’s pet can, if it’s determined that the victim was not provoking the dog, potentially file a lawsuit against the owner and their homeowners’ insurance (should it apply) and be entitled to compensation for their medical expenses and emotional distress.
Birth Injuries
Birth injuries are among the most dangerous forms of medical malpractice. A negligent mistake by an obstetrician can result in physical injuries to a newborn, and it can also lead to lasting disorders, such as cerebral palsy, paralysis, and brain damage. This can be traumatic to the children and the parents, as well as a major financial strain on the family. A personal injury lawsuit for a family dealing with an injury to their newborn during birth gives the family the potential to recover compensation for these tangible and intangible damages.
Brain & Spinal Cord Injuries
The most alarming types of injuries that can stem from car accidents, medical malpractice, and more are ones to the brain or to the spinal cord. In personal injury cases involving these specific injuries, there is potentially permanent physical and/or mental damage to the victim. As a result, a lot of work goes into proving there was negligence and a breach of care by the other party, because the potential compensation the victim and his or her family can get is much higher, as it would be for long-term medical expenses.
Burn Injuries
Burn injuries are some of the most dangerous injuries one can be inflicted with, as negligence can cause fiery motor vehicle accidents, faulty electrical wiring, scalding water, and more. These can cause horrific burns. There are different degrees of burns; some heal quickly. Others can lead to lifelong scarring and trauma. As such, compensation received in a burn injury lawsuit is often awarded for long-term medical expenses, as well as for pain and suffering.
Wrongful Death
Personal injury cases that have resulted in a fatality fall into the category of wrongful death. In addition to the usual medical bills and expenses one can attain in a personal injury lawsuit through compensation, the victim’s family can potentially be compensated for the costs of the funeral. Families could also be eligible to receive other damages.
For example, if the victim was the primary source of income, a spouse or family could possibly receive compensation for their sudden lost income. Compensation is also available for the pain and suffering, as well as the loss of companionship. These damages can help the family obtain some peace of mind after a sudden loss.
How We May be Able to Help
The ways that another person’s negligence can injure you are larger in number than you may have thought, and more severe. But there are options for you in the aftermath of your injury. Morgan & Morgan’s personal injury attorneys may be able to help you through these difficult times. Contact your local office for a free, no-obligation case evaluation form.

Morgans
Hotel
Group













About us


At Morgans Hotel Group, we are the global leader and innovator of the lifestyle hospitality sector, dedicated to building a differentiated brand portfolio and establishing our properties in 24 hour urban and select resort markets. We create a vibe that encourages our guests, who we call the Creative Class, to live every moment more intensely. Morgans Hotel Group is immersive, transformative and deeply engaging; embracing irony and style, elegance and luxury, with strong and daring vision. We bring together the creative power of many – designers, artists, musicians – to bend the rules, stretch the realm of possibility and constantly push the boundaries of what a hotel can be. We lead, where others follow.DELANO BRAND
Delano is the ultimate oasis of sensuality and soul, where sophistication and ease seamlessly blend with timeless design. Effortlessly chic and flirtatious, yet restrained in its simplicity, Delano is proof that the new rules of elegance are crisp, clean, and modern, without fuss or complexity. There is a world outside Delano, but there is nothing there you need. Delano is in South Miami Beach, Las Vegas, and is coming soon to Cartagena, Cesme and Dubai.MONDRIAN BRAND
Mondrian is a place to see-and-be-seen. Here we believe in the perfect moment, where confidence reigns and perpetual possibility awaits. Intense, current, and playful, Mondrian is bold and brave, offering instant excitement the minute the door swings open - seductive and striking, it’s where glamour and fantasy prevail. Mondrian is in London, Los Angeles, and South Miami Beach, and is coming soon to Doha and Istanbul.HUDSON BRAND
Hudson is filled with exuberance and energy, social interaction and passion for life. It all begins in the lobby, the heart and soul of the hotel, where intriguing lives intersect, genuine conversations spark, and adventure and experimentation begin. Spirited and casual, Hudson is the perfect urban playground, where youthful curiosity hangs with eclectic enchantment, and around every corner lies another opportunity to explore. Hudson is in New York City.ORIGINALS BRAND
Originals are a family of individual hotels that shun the status quo, each distinctive and daring, creating a surreal fantasy where anything is possible. Stimulating, charismatic and iconic, Originals bring vision and style together with a spirit filled with magic and illusion. Sanderson and St Martins Lane in London, Morgans and Royalton in New York, Clift in San Francisco, Shore Club in South Miami Beach, and 10 Karaköy in Istanbul are all Originals.

About Hudson
An energetic social hub filled with urban adventure and daredevil design, Hudson takes
 convention and turns it on its head.  Born from the innovative vision 
of design impresario Philippe Starck, , Hudson, a New York
boutique hotel, is stylish, democratic, young at heart and utterly cool. Best places to hang: Hudson Common, a modern-day beer hall and burger joint with nightly entertainment; Hudson Bar, a quintessential New York cocktail bar and lounge; Sky Terrace (open
 seasonally), an English garden with breathtaking views of New York 
City; and Private Park, a
garden oasis in the middle of a bustling city. Located in midtown, just steps from Central Park, Columbus Circle 
Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center, Time Warner Center and the theater 
district.

About Clift
An inspired
fusion of old-world hotel glamour with distinctly modern energy and design, the
nearly century-old Clift’s daring sense of diversity perfectly captures the
spirit of San Francisco, while maintaining its essence as a boutique luxury
hotel. Designed by Philippe Starck, Clift features a soaring lobby with
one of the most eclectic furniture collections in all of California, including
chairs from Ray and Charles Eames, a coffee table by Salvador Dali, and a
surreal stool by Roberto Matta (inspired by René Margritte). The legendary Redwood
Room bar,
paneled with the wood of a single Redwood tree, is accented with digital art
and the buzz of an elite San Francisco crowd. Velvet
Room is a
multi-purpose venue for eating, drinking and special events. Guests who simply
want to relax, read or people watch can find the comforts of an old English
club in the Living
Room. Clift is the ultimate boutique hotel
in San Francisco, located steps from Union Square and the Financial District,
and close to Moscone Convention Center, Nob Hill, Fisherman's Wharf,
Embarcadero, Telegraph Hill, Coit Tower and the Golden Gate Bridge.

            From the first day I talked to Jay about my case until the day my case was settled, he made me feel like he truly cared about me as a person, not just a client. I highly recommend Morgan & Morgan to anyone in need. And, I will never be able to thank them enough for what they did for me!

            Mary Anne Laforme was a true blessing. We were in an accident and she was so kind when helping us with any questions or concerns. Very considerate and up front about everything in our situation. If we have any other issues, we will definitely be calling them. Thanks for everything, Mary Anne.

How Can a Car Accident Attorney Help Me?
Driving is getting more dangerous. In fact, 35,092 people died in crashes on U.S. roadways in 2015 according to the National Highway Safety Administration.
So having an experienced attorney represent you after your car accident is becoming more important than ever before.
There are specific rules and regulations that can complicate insurance claims and the recovery of additional damages, such as for pain and suffering, in cases of severe injury or death. An attorney can help ensure you receive full benefits from the insurance company and determine whether you can file a claim for additional damages against the party at fault in the event of a car accident.
If you have suffered any degree of injury, we may be able to help you file a lawsuit to claim compensation beyond what is provided by insurance claims.
Once you’ve exhausted your personal injury protection (PIP) benefits and decide you want to take legal action against the driver at fault for the crash, our attorneys can begin preparing your claim by:

Collecting police and accident scene reports
Questioning witnesses
Reconstructing the accident scene
Taking photographs of the scene, damage, and injuries
Analyzing medical reports
Contacting expert witnesses to review evidence
Speaking with the insurance providers on your behalf

The insurance company or negligent party from which you are attempting to collect compensation will work to categorize your injury as temporary, rather than permanent. Your attorney can collect and organize evidence on your behalf to rebut the defendant’s claims.
Car Accident Injuries and Compensation
Because each accident is different, the extent of injuries suffered will vary between cases. In many cases, the costs for treatment of the injuries sustained will not be covered by PIP insurance and will require additional litigation or negotiations.
Some injuries that we may attempt to collect compensation for include, but are not limited to:

Paralysis
Burns and scars
Loss of limbs
Spinal cord injuries
Head injuries
Joint, muscle, back, neck, and bone injuries
Knee damage
Whiplash
Permanent disability
Wrongful death

Economic auto accident damages, also known as compensatory damages, attempt to compensate the injured car crash victim for his or her monetary losses. Common economic damages awarded in car accident lawsuits include:


Medical Expenses: This could include expenses for emergency room
visits, hospitalization, emergency surgery, any assistive devices and
future appointments with a medical professional.


Future Medical
Expenses: If the car accident victim can prove that they will need
continued medical care as a result of the crash, they may be able to
recover the cost of future medical expenses.


Lost Wages: Car
accident victims who have been injured can seek compensation for lost
wages from the time of injury to the conclusion of the lawsuit. Even if
the victim was unemployed, he or she could receive compensation for lost
wages if the attorney can prove that the accident limited his or her
earning potential.


Loss of Earning Capacity: If you sustained
injuries that prevent you from working, you may be able to receive
compensation by proving that your earning capacity was negatively
impacted by the incident. In this case, the jury will
typically determine the amount the victim could have earned if the car accident had not occurred.


Non-economic car accident damages award the plaintiff for non-financial losses. Car accident damages for non-monetary losses are typically harder to quantify and may include compensation for the following:


Pain and Suffering: This includes compensation for the pain and
suffering you faced after the accident. In awarding damages for pain and
suffering, the jury will examine the extent of your injuries, including
how long you are expected to suffer, the nature of the injury, and what
financial burdens the incident places on you and your family.


Mental
Anguish: You may also be able to attain compensation for the emotional
pain you faced after the incident. Mental anguish, for example, can
include feelings of fright, nervousness, worry, grief, and any other
type of emotional trauma a victim can face after a devastating accident.


Loss of Consortium: The surviving spouse may be awarded compensation for the loss of services, assistance, aid, society, and companionship of his or her loved one in the case of a wrongful death caused by a car accident. Surviving parents may be awarded compensation for the loss of love, affection and companionship of their minor children as a result of their wrongful death. Likewise, minor children may be awarded compensation for the loss of services, assistance, aid, society and companionship of their parents as a result of their wrongful death.


Punitive Damages: If the
actions of the defendant were so malicious or egregious, the jury may
impose punitive damages, which are intended to punish the defendant and
discourage similar behavior in the future.


Seeking Additional Damages
The strength and success of your claim will likely hinge on the ability of your attorney to collect, analyze, and present evidence.
If you are seeking additional damages, your attorney will approach the negligent party’s insurance company in an attempt to recover compensation to cover your remaining costs. Your claim will be submitted for approval to the insurance company, which will have conducted an investigation of its own.
The strength and success of your claim will likely hinge on the ability of your attorney to collect, analyze, and present evidence. This is no easy task though because the opposing insurance company will want to minimize their payout. 
Providing your attorney with as much information as possible can help strengthen your claim. If your attorney and the insurance company cannot agree on a settlement, the case may proceed to trial.
Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist Accidents
After exhausting PIP coverage, if the other driver has no other insurance or an amount of coverage that is insufficient to cover the costs related to your injury, your uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage may cover the damage caused by the negligent party.
If the negligent party was underinsured, your insurance will cover the difference between your losses and the amount you received from the other party’s insurance company. If you do not have this coverage, you should contact an attorney to obtain compensation for injuries resulting from the accident.
An attorney may be able to seek damages from the negligent party’s homeowners’ insurance, your own insurance carrier or your health insurance provider. Attempting to collect compensation through your uninsured motorist coverage can be complicated and will likely require the assistance of an experienced attorney.
Your insurance company may try to limit your payout, based on their own investigation of the accident and how much they believe your claim is worth. If you receive an amount that you believe does not properly cover your losses, your attorney may be able to file a lawsuit against your insurance company in an attempt to recover additional compensation.
Types of Car Accident Claims
“No-fault” insurance law attempts to limit the number of lawsuits filed over minor car accidents. Civil suits to recover additional compensation for personal injury damages are only permitted under certain circumstances, such as:
Negligence
Most car accidents rely on the concept of negligence, or the
party’s failure to exercise a certain level of caution while operating a
vehicle or using common roads. Negligence is one of the most common factors in accidents that harm other motorists, pedestrians, or bicyclists.
To prove negligence, your attorney 
will conduct a preliminary investigation to identify who was responsible for the accident.
To have the best chances of receiving compensation, the attorney must
prove that the defendant failed to meet a reasonable standard of care
and that his or her negligence caused the accident. Some examples of
defendants are negligent drivers, reckless drivers, intoxicated drivers, and bus drivers.
Manufacturer Liability
If your vehicle, or the other party’s vehicle, had a defect contributed
to the accident, the injured party may have a claim against the
manufacturer of the vehicle or one of its parts. If the car had a faulty
design, or a manufacturing and labeling issue, the manufacturer can be
held responsible regardless of who was actually at fault for the
accident.
To prevail, your attorney must prove that you were not at fault for the
accident as the defect that caused the accident occurred during the
manufacturing process. Oftentimes expert testimony and analysis is used
as evidence to prove that the defect contributed in some way to the
accident. Successful lawsuits will require the plaintiff to show:

The defective car or part was “unreasonably dangerous”
The vehicle was being operated as intended
The vehicle’s performance had not changed since its initial purchase

Claims are usually filed against manufacturers in the case of defective parts such as seat belts, airbags, accelerators, brakes, and engines.
Road Design
In some cases, faulty construction, design, or maintenance of roads can contribute to accidents. Some common causes include:


Embankments: When a road curves, the outer edge is set
at an incline as a safety precaution. These raised areas serve the
purpose of managing traffic so that vehicles can approach the outer edge
of the road without driving off it. If the embankment is too steep or
not elevated properly, motorists may be in danger.


Barriers and
Guard Rails: Barriers, guard rails, speed bumps, medians, and
curbs help to influence safe driving. If any of these structures are
poorly designed or placed, driver safety may be compromised.


Surfaces: Various alterations in road surface alert drivers of
approaching hazards or that they are leaving their lane unexpectedly.


Signage: Signs give drivers prior notice of approaching
intersections, sharp turns, animal crossings, etc. They should be
positioned in obvious locations and brightly illuminated for maximum
visibility.


Traffic Control: Traffic lights, stop and
yield signs, lights to warn drivers of intersections and crosswalks, and
other devices are utilized to dictate traffic flow. Proper placement and
operation of these devices are imperative.


Wrongful Death
If you have lost a loved one in a car crash, you may have legal recourse through a wrongful death lawsuit. In these cases, the family or survivors of the victim must prove that their loved one was killed as a result of another’s negligence. Economic, non-economic, and punitive damages may be available.

Personal Injury Lawsuits







No one likes to get injured — it often means dealing with lengthy periods of pain and a pile of medical bills. But when it’s not even your fault, that can be worse. You’re left dealing with physical, emotional, and financial pain that someone else caused. Luckily, the legal system is fine-tuned to address this scenario. This is called “personal injury law.”
What is Personal Injury?
Personal injury law is a very specific type of civil law. A private individual plaintiff can file a lawsuit against someone they accuse of wrongful conduct that contributed to their injury. Personal injury attorneys in these cases will go to great lengths to advocate for their clients. This can include investigating the scene of the accident, questioning witnesses, working with medical experts, and sometimes even working with experts that can help reconstruct the accident, among other things.
Why File A Personal Injury Lawsuit?
An injury may not seem like grounds for a lawsuit at first, but it can cause lasting physical and emotional damage, leading to long-time pain and financial strain. If someone else caused a severe or lingering injury, you may be able to file a personal injury suit and gain compensation for your damages. Whether someone else can be held be responsible is key to determining if you have a lawsuit on your hands. With enough evidence that another party’s negligence caused your injury, you may be able to reach a settlement or take your case to trial.
At Morgan & Morgan, we have more than 300 lawyers nationwide with vast experience in various types of personal injury law and a reputation for helping people receive the compensation they need. Our attorneys have years of experience taking cases to trial, where we have been able to recover many times the amount of an insurance company’s initial settlement offer.
What Type of Personal Injury Lawsuits Do People File?
Here are some of the forms of personal injury lawsuits we have worked on, and the ways these injuries and lawsuits come about.
Motor Vehicle Accidents
Vehicles all bring with them a unique risk of injury, and a number of different types of lawsuits. The majority of these accidents are car accidents, but can also include motorcycle, trucking, and even boating accidents. Often, these personal injury claims stem from the negligence of another driver. From texting while driving and driving under the influence, these acts and more can cause lifelong damage to someone. Even lesser accidents can require long-term medical care. These lawsuits are often brought to get compensation for medical bills and future medical expenses, such as rehabilitation. There are also damages potentially available for lost time at work, and the physical and emotional suffering endured.
Premises Liability/Slip and Fall
Those who have slipped and fallen on someone’s property may find themselves with an injury that could have been avoided had the property owner acted more carefully in maintaining their property. This type of fall can cause an injury that lingers, resulting in lengthy, costly medical bills. Slip and fall lawsuits can be a lot of work at times, but if you have the evidence to show negligence, the owner of a restaurant, store, or other establishment may be held liable for your damages.
Construction Injuries
Construction jobs are inherently risky, and construction sites are home to many on-the-job injuries. And as such, many construction accident injury claims can also fall into other categories.
Dog Bites
Dog bites and attacks can be far more serious than they sound. Those who have been bitten by someone else’s pet can, if it’s determined that the victim was not provoking the dog, potentially file a lawsuit against the owner and their homeowners’ insurance (should it apply) and be entitled to compensation for their medical expenses and emotional distress.
Birth Injuries
Birth injuries are among the most dangerous forms of medical malpractice. A negligent mistake by an obstetrician can result in physical injuries to a newborn, and it can also lead to lasting disorders, such as cerebral palsy, paralysis, and brain damage. This can be traumatic to the children and the parents, as well as a major financial strain on the family. A personal injury lawsuit for a family dealing with an injury to their newborn during birth gives the family the potential to recover compensation for these tangible and intangible damages.
Brain & Spinal Cord Injuries
The most alarming types of injuries that can stem from car accidents, medical malpractice, and more are ones to the brain or to the spinal cord. In personal injury cases involving these specific injuries, there is potentially permanent physical and/or mental damage to the victim. As a result, a lot of work goes into proving there was negligence and a breach of care by the other party, because the potential compensation the victim and his or her family can get is much higher, as it would be for long-term medical expenses.
Burn Injuries
Burn injuries are some of the most dangerous injuries one can be inflicted with, as negligence can cause fiery motor vehicle accidents, faulty electrical wiring, scalding water, and more. These can cause horrific burns. There are different degrees of burns; some heal quickly. Others can lead to lifelong scarring and trauma. As such, compensation received in a burn injury lawsuit is often awarded for long-term medical expenses, as well as for pain and suffering.
Wrongful Death
Personal injury cases that have resulted in a fatality fall into the category of wrongful death. In addition to the usual medical bills and expenses one can attain in a personal injury lawsuit through compensation, the victim’s family can potentially be compensated for the costs of the funeral. Families could also be eligible to receive other damages.
For example, if the victim was the primary source of income, a spouse or family could possibly receive compensation for their sudden lost income. Compensation is also available for the pain and suffering, as well as the loss of companionship. These damages can help the family obtain some peace of mind after a sudden loss.
How We May be Able to Help
The ways that another person’s negligence can injure you are larger in number than you may have thought, and more severe. But there are options for you in the aftermath of your injury. Morgan & Morgan’s personal injury attorneys may be able to help you through these difficult times. Contact your local office for a free, no-obligation case evaluation form.
