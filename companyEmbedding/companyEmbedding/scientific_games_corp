History[edit]
Two leading totalizator companies were combined in 1989 when United Tote purchased Autotote Systems, Inc. from Thomas H. Lee[6][7] Before the companies' operations could be integrated, the merger was challenged by federal antitrust regulators.[6] A 1991 court ruling forced the company to split back up. The former United Tote assets were sold back to that company's founders, the Shelhamer family, and what remained of the company was renamed as Autotote Corporation.[6][8]
In 2000, Autotote Corp. bought Scientific Games Holdings Corp., the leading maker of instant lottery equipment, for $308 million.[9][10] Scientific Games had been founded in 1973, and introduced the first secure instant lottery ticket in 1974.[1] The combined company changed its name from Autotote to Scientific Games Corporation in 2001.[11]
By 2002, two thirds of the entire $20 billion annually wagered on racing in North America was tracked by Autotote computers. [12] Autotote supplied pari-mutuel wagering systems worldwide. These were automated, computerized off-track and on-track systems for betting on horse races and greyhound racing. It was an integrated system for off-track betting, keeping track of race results and winning tickets, and race simulcasting.[citation needed]
In 2006, Scientific Games acquired The Global Draw, which provides server-based gambling machines to betting shops in the U.K. The Company has added to its position in the U.K. by acquiring Games Media, specializing in server-based, digital gambling and entertainment solutions to U.K. pubs, in 2007 and Barcrest from IGT in 2010.[13] Barcrest, which was founded in 1968, established itself as a market leader in betting and gambling terminals in the UK. Several of Barcrest's slot machine titles, such as Rainbow Riches and Monty's Millions, have been redeveloped for online real money gambling. Despite being acquired in 2011 by Scientific Games, the Barcrest brand lives on, with the logo appearing on some new slot game releases.[citation needed]
In 2007, the New York Times credited Scientific Games and Gtech for transforming what was known “historically [as] an underground operation run by mobsters” into “a lucrative, state-sponsored corporate enterprise.”[1] The Autotote racing division was sold to Sportech in 2010.[14]
In October 2013, the company bought WMS Industries, the third largest manufacturer of slot machines, for $1.5 billion.[15]
In June 2014, Gavin Isaacs was appointed president and CEO. [16]
In September 2014, they extended their deal with the Slovakian national lottery, TIPOS a.s., for another four years.[17]
In November 2014, Scientific Games acquired slot machine maker Bally Technologies for $3.3 billion plus $1.8 billion in assumed debt.[18]
In August 2016, Kevin Sheehan was named CEO, replacing Isaacs.
In March 2017, Scientific Games Corporation were awarded the James Bond franchise[19] after reaching a deal with EON Productions Limited, Danjaq, LLC and MGM Interactive. The deal, gives Scientific Games the rights to all James Bond films alongside the 007 franchise’s trademark opening sequence, soundtrack and catchphrases.

WMS Industries

Sciplay
The Global Draw
Games Media (sold to Gamestec part of the Novomatic group)
Barcrest

Along with its own operations, Scientific Games owns significant stakes in the following companies:[21]

20% Lotterie Nazionali - Italy's instant game, largest instant game in the World
49% CSG Lottery - Instant lottery games in China
50% Guard Libang - Lottery systems and services in China
20% Northstar Lottery Group - Private manager of Illinois State Lottery. Was the first state awarded private contract (July 2011)
20% Sportech - United Kingdom betting site.
29.4% Robert Communications Network - Communications provider.

Controversy[edit]
The security of Autotote software for the racing industry garnered media attention in 2002 when one of their software developers attempted to steal $3 million through a hole in their software and processes described as "... an example of a very simple exploitation of a rather stupid design flaw." [12] The role of Autotote's software in the 2002 Breeders' Cup betting scandal caused the National Thoroughbred Racing Association to take swift action in the face of a growing outcry once the nature of the scam emerged. It required all tote companies to modify their software to allow bets to be forwarded immediately after a race closed.[22] The Autotote racing division was sold to Sportech PLC in 2010.[14]
In December 2008, then CEO A. Lorne Weil’s son Luke Weil[23][24] was employed as Director, International Business Development.[25]

Scientific Games Corporation is an American company that provides gambling products and services to lottery and gambling organizations worldwide. The company is headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada. Products include electronic gaming machines, table games, iGaming and iLottery products, instant lottery games, lottery gaming systems, terminals and services, internet applications, server-based interactive gambling terminals, and gambling control systems.
Scientific Games introduced the first secure, instant lottery ticket in 1974.[1] Through high-security techniques including complex algorithms, printing treatments, encryption and firewalls, Scientific Games ensures that no one knows where a winning ticket is. They provide lottery retailers with secure point-of-sale systems that print Mega Millions and Powerball tickets. Over time, Scientific Games has added loyalty and reward websites, where players can earn points and prizes on non-winning tickets bought at retail.[3]
In 2012, global lottery revenues totaled $262 billion.[4] In 2011, U.S. lottery revenues totaled $56 billion with approximately 30% of total revenues directed to government transfers. There are currently 44 states and territories in the U.S. that offer government-operated lotteries.[5]

History[edit]
Two leading totalizator companies were combined in 1989 when United Tote purchased Autotote Systems, Inc. from Thomas H. Lee[6][7] Before the companies' operations could be integrated, the merger was challenged by federal antitrust regulators.[6] A 1991 court ruling forced the company to split back up. The former United Tote assets were sold back to that company's founders, the Shelhamer family, and what remained of the company was renamed as Autotote Corporation.[6][8]
In 2000, Autotote Corp. bought Scientific Games Holdings Corp., the leading maker of instant lottery equipment, for $308 million.[9][10] Scientific Games had been founded in 1973, and introduced the first secure instant lottery ticket in 1974.[1] The combined company changed its name from Autotote to Scientific Games Corporation in 2001.[11]
By 2002, two thirds of the entire $20 billion annually wagered on racing in North America was tracked by Autotote computers. [12] Autotote supplied pari-mutuel wagering systems worldwide. These were automated, computerized off-track and on-track systems for betting on horse races and greyhound racing. It was an integrated system for off-track betting, keeping track of race results and winning tickets, and race simulcasting.[citation needed]
In 2006, Scientific Games acquired The Global Draw, which provides server-based gambling machines to betting shops in the U.K. The Company has added to its position in the U.K. by acquiring Games Media, specializing in server-based, digital gambling and entertainment solutions to U.K. pubs, in 2007 and Barcrest from IGT in 2010.[13] Barcrest, which was founded in 1968, established itself as a market leader in betting and gambling terminals in the UK. Several of Barcrest's slot machine titles, such as Rainbow Riches and Monty's Millions, have been redeveloped for online real money gambling. Despite being acquired in 2011 by Scientific Games, the Barcrest brand lives on, with the logo appearing on some new slot game releases.[citation needed]
In 2007, the New York Times credited Scientific Games and Gtech for transforming what was known “historically [as] an underground operation run by mobsters” into “a lucrative, state-sponsored corporate enterprise.”[1] The Autotote racing division was sold to Sportech in 2010.[14]
In October 2013, the company bought WMS Industries, the third largest manufacturer of slot machines, for $1.5 billion.[15]
In June 2014, Gavin Isaacs was appointed president and CEO. [16]
In September 2014, they extended their deal with the Slovakian national lottery, TIPOS a.s., for another four years.[17]
In November 2014, Scientific Games acquired slot machine maker Bally Technologies for $3.3 billion plus $1.8 billion in assumed debt.[18]
In August 2016, Kevin Sheehan was named CEO, replacing Isaacs.
In March 2017, Scientific Games Corporation were awarded the James Bond franchise[19] after reaching a deal with EON Productions Limited, Danjaq, LLC and MGM Interactive. The deal, gives Scientific Games the rights to all James Bond films alongside the 007 franchise’s trademark opening sequence, soundtrack and catchphrases.
Subsidiaries[edit]
Wholly-owned subsidiaries of Scientific Games Corporation:[20]

Bally Technologies
WMS Industries
MDI Entertainment, LLC
Sciplay
The Global Draw
Games Media (sold to Gamestec part of the Novomatic group)
Barcrest

Along with its own operations, Scientific Games owns significant stakes in the following companies:[21]

20% Lotterie Nazionali - Italy's instant game, largest instant game in the World
49% CSG Lottery - Instant lottery games in China
50% Guard Libang - Lottery systems and services in China
20% Northstar Lottery Group - Private manager of Illinois State Lottery. Was the first state awarded private contract (July 2011)
20% Sportech - United Kingdom betting site.
29.4% Robert Communications Network - Communications provider.

Controversy[edit]
The security of Autotote software for the racing industry garnered media attention in 2002 when one of their software developers attempted to steal $3 million through a hole in their software and processes described as "... an example of a very simple exploitation of a rather stupid design flaw." [12] The role of Autotote's software in the 2002 Breeders' Cup betting scandal caused the National Thoroughbred Racing Association to take swift action in the face of a growing outcry once the nature of the scam emerged. It required all tote companies to modify their software to allow bets to be forwarded immediately after a race closed.[22] The Autotote racing division was sold to Sportech PLC in 2010.[14]
In December 2008, then CEO A. Lorne Weil’s son Luke Weil[23][24] was employed as Director, International Business Development.[25]

Dow industrials nail first support, S&P 500 digests the technical breakout
U.S. stocks are slightly higher early Wednesday, digesting the mid-2017 technical breakout ahead of Thursday’s ECB policy directive, U.K. general election, and scheduled political testimony in the U.S.  Against this backdrop, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has effectively nailed first support (and drawn buyers), while the S&P 500’s corresponding pullback remains conspicuously flat.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Why Scientific Games Corp. Stock Soared on Monday
The gambling products and services provider's seventh straight quarter of revenue growth has investors optimistic. 











                Daniel Sparks
            

                (TMFDanielSparks)



            
            Jul 24, 2017 at 2:31PM
            
            





What happened
Shares of casino and lottery gaming company Scientific Games (NASDAQ:SGMS) jumped as much as 24.5% on Monday after it reported its second-quarter financial results. The stock was up 24.2% at the time of this writing.
So what
Scientific Games reported Q2 revenue of $766.3 million and a loss per share of $0.44. Both metrics were better than analysts were expecting. On average, analysts had forecast revenue of $733 million and a loss per share of $0.52.

Importantly, with its Q2 revenue increase of 5% year over year, Scientific Games has now posted seven quarters in a row of revenue growth. Last quarter, that was driven by gains in global gaming machine sales, gaming systems, table products, and interactive gaming, management said.





Now what
Going forward, Scientific Games CEO Kevin Sheehan said the company has "many opportunities" it intends to capitalize on. And CFO Michael Quartieri said it will continue to improve its capital structure and lower its cost of capital.
