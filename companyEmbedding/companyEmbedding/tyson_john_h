      72762-6999; http://www.tysonfoodsinc.com.
    

      ■ Expectations were not particularly high when in 2000 John H.
      Tyson was confirmed as chairman and chief executive officer of Tyson
      Foods, the giant poultry-processing company founded 65 years earlier by
      his grandfather. Tyson had a somewhat checkered past, having been
      effectively sidelined from business by nasty twin addictions to cocaine
      and alcohol in the late 1980s. Although he had worked in the family
      business since his teens, through much of his early career he had been
      given relatively marginal responsibilities. Tyson had been named chairman
      of the company in 1998 but had shared responsibilities for leading the
      company with the then CEO Wayne Britt; it was Britt who won praise for
      leading Tyson Foods to a sharp jump in earnings in the late 1990s. To some
      outside observers it seemed that Tyson had little more going for him than
      the family name.
    

      The skeptics and naysayers were in for a surprise. Under Tyson's
      direction, Tyson Foods emerged as the world's largest
    




           John H. Tyson.

          . 
        


      protein-processing company largely on the strength of its 2001 acquisition
      of the South Dakota–based IBP, a giant processor of beef and pork.
      That acquisition, as engineered by John Tyson, accomplished what his
      father, Donald J. Tyson, had attempted but failed to do during his tenure
      as chairman and CEO—namely, to successfully diversify beyond the
      confines of the poultry business. As of early 2003 Tyson Foods was
      producing roughly 25 percent of all the meat products consumed in the
      United States, according to Greg Lee, the company's co–chief
      operating officer and group president for food service and international
      business.
    

      COMPANY PROFITS CLIMB IN WAKE OF ACQUISITION
    

      Even more impressive, especially for company shareholders, was the impact
      of Tyson's achievements on the company's
       bottom line. In the fiscal year ending September 30, 2002, the
      company's sales more than doubled to $23.4 billion from the roughly
      $10.8 billion of the previous year. Profits for fiscal 2002 totaled $383
      million, more than three times the company's profits of $106.6
      million in fiscal 2001. In fiscal 2003, despite a 75 percent jump in
      fourth-quarter earnings, profits for the year totaled only $337 million,
      or $0.96 a share, down from 2002's $383 million, or $1.08 per
      share. However, revenue in fiscal 2003 was up, topping $24.5 billion, as
      compared with the $23.4 billion of the year before.
    

      John H. Tyson, grandson of the Tyson Foods founder John W. Tyson, was born
      in Springdale, Arkansas, home of the family business, on September 5,
      1953. At the time of Tyson's birth his father, Donald J. Tyson, was
      manager of the company's Springdale plant. His mother, Twilla Jean,
      devoted her energies to raising Tyson and his sisters, Cheryl and Carla.
      Two years after Tyson's birth his father was promoted to president,
      a post he held until 1967 when he succeeded John W. Tyson, who had passed
      away, as chairman and chief executive officer. While attending Springdale
      High School, John H. Tyson began working weekends in the family
      company's plants.
    

      In the summer of 1969 Donald Tyson arranged for his 16-year-old son to
      spend the summer working at a company poultry-processing plant in Green
      Forest, Arkansas. According to a 2002 profile of John H. Tyson in 
      
        Fortune
      
      , part of his responsibilities involved the unloading of chicken coops
      from a truck and placing them on a conveyor belt. After watching a
      longtime plant employee demonstrate each step in this process, Tyson
      noted, "I said to myself, 'That didn't look
      difficult'"; when the teenager attempted to replicate the
      task, he grabbed onto a coop and hefted it head-high but made the mistake
      of tilting it the wrong way. As a result, the chicken excrement lining the
      bottom of the coop slid in his direction. "It hit me right in the
      face," Tyson recalled, "and slid down the front of my
      shirt" (May 13, 2002).
    

      STUDIES BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION AT SMU
    

      After graduating from high school, Tyson enrolled at Southern Methodist
      University in Dallas, Texas, to study business administration. When he
      received his bachelor's degree in 1975, he returned to Springdale
      to take his place in the family business. Over the next several years he
      worked his way through a series of farm, sales, and purchasing positions,
      none of which were particularly demanding from a management standpoint.
      Largely on the strength of his family ties, Tyson was appointed to the
      company's board of directors in 1984. The latter half of the 1980s
      found Tyson in the grip of a double addiction to alcohol and cocaine. 
      
        Fortune
      
       reported that during a 1998 legal proceeding Tyson acknowledged the
      magnitude of his substance-abuse struggle: "The only reason I was
      on the payroll was because I was the son of the boss. Any other
      corporation, I would have been thrown to the wolves" (May 13,
      2002).
    

      With the support of his family Tyson entered a drug rehabilitation program
      where he successfully conquered his addictions. He returned to Tyson Foods
      with renewed energy and determination to succeed. In 1993, as a measure of
      confidence in his son, Donald Tyson appointed John as president of the
      company's fledgling meat and seafood businesses, segments in which
      the older Tyson placed great hope for the future. According to 
      
        Fortune
      
      , Tyson Foods' early foray into nonpoultry processing was abandoned
      by the late 1990s as impractical; the company ran into problems adapting
      its time-tested poultry-processing techniques to other meats and seafood.
    

      Despite this disappointing failure Donald Tyson remained confident that
      his son was ready for greater responsibility. Effective October 1, 1998,
      John succeeded the outgoing Leland Tollett as chairman. At the same time
      the company tapped the chief financial officer Wayne Britt to assume
      Tollett's responsibilities as CEO. Tollett expressed confidence
      that both of his successors would carry the company to greater heights.
      According to a corporate press release, after citing the achievements of
      John H. Tyson's grandfather and father, Tollett observed: "I
      believe that our shareholders, team members, and associates will continue
      to prosper and grow with continued family leadership at the highest
      level" (September 25, 1988).
    

      SUCCEEDS BRITT AS CEO
    

      Roughly 18 months after taking over as chairman, Tyson succeeded Britt as
      CEO when the latter abruptly resigned in April 2000. According to a report
      by Kyle Mooty in 
      
        Arkansas Business
      
      , Britt said that although his adult life had been dedicated exclusively
      to Tyson Foods, "I am leaving because our transition to a new
      generation is complete and, frankly, I would like time to pursue other
      interests" (April 17, 2000). Britt's resignation ended the
      split management of the company and gave Tyson complete control. Assessing
      the company's future prospects for 
      
        Arkansas Business
      
      , the New York–based security analyst John McMillin said he thought
      Tyson would turn in a creditable performance as CEO: "I think
      he'll be highly motivated, and he's walking into the job at
      a good time in the cycle. There should be less competing proteins around
      next year" (April 17, 2000). In October 2000 Britt was named
      nonexecutive chairman of Spectral Fusion Technologies, based in the United
      Kingdom.
    

      Although it was originally his father's dream to successfully move
      Tyson Foods beyond the boundaries of the poultry-processing business, it
      fell upon John to get the job done. Only months after he took over as CEO
      of Tyson Foods, word spread through the food-processing industry that IBP,
      the giant meatpacker based in South Dakota, was entertaining acquisition
       offers. The first bid for IBP came in the form of a leveraged-buyout
      proposal from a coalition of IBP executives and investment bankers from
      the Wall Street firm of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. That offer,
      valued at $3.8 billion ($2.4 billion in cash and stock plus $1.4 billion
      in refinancing of IBP debt), was soon topped by an offer of $4.1 billion
      from the Virginia-based Smithfield Foods, the country's largest
      pork producer.
    

      Tyson Foods was the last prospective buyer to join the bidding for IBP; on
      December 4, 2000, it brought to the table what was then the most
      attractive offer, valued at a total of $4.2 billion, including $2.8
      billion (or $26 a share) in cash and stock and $1.4 billion in assumed
      debt. Not surprisingly, Tyson's entry into the fray set off not
      only a war of words but an all-out bidding war between the two leading
      contenders. Smithfield Foods publicly characterized Tyson's bid as
      a hostile tender offer despite the decision of IBP's board to
      consider it. By the end of December 2000 Tyson had sweetened its bid to a
      total of $4.3 billion, preemptively topping an anticipated bid increase
      from Smithfield.
    

      BIDDING WAR INTENSIFIES
    

      Over the 2000–2001 New Year's holiday, Smithfield increased
      its offer to $32 in stock for each share of IBP; however, IBP's
      board opted for the final bid from Tyson at $30 a share in equal parts
      cash and stock, which was considered more attractive because of the cash.
      Another factor in IBP's decision was the fear that a merger into
      Smithfield would be closely scrutinized by federal regulators because of
      implications for the U.S. pork market. A few days into the new year
      Smithfield publicly acknowledged that it had been outbid. Tyson
      Foods' final offer was valued at a total of $4.7 billion.
    

      In early spring the much-anticipated marriage of Tyson and IBP hit a snag
      that for the next few months threatened to tear the companies apart. On
      March 30, 2001, John Tyson, alleging that IBP had supplied misleading
      information, announced that Tyson Foods was terminating its merger
      agreement and filing suit to collect damages. At the center of the
      controversy was IBP's announcement days earlier that an internal
      probe of its DFG Foods subsidiary had uncovered mismanagement, possible
      manipulation of financial records, and product theft. In response to
      Tyson's announcement IBP declared that it was filing its own
      lawsuit in a Delaware chancery court to force Tyson Foods to complete the
      acquisition.
    

      In the end IBP prevailed. In mid-June 2001 a Delaware judge handed down an
      order requiring Tyson Foods to follow through with its acquisition of IBP;
      Tyson Foods quickly made clear its intentions to obey the judge's
      order. During the trial in Delaware both John Tyson and Bob Peterson,
      IBP's chairman and CEO, testified that the combination of the two
      companies still made strategic sense. After the court proceedings,
      according to a report by Victor Epstein in the 
      
        Omaha World-Herald
      
      , Tyson said, "Despite the trial, we believe the management teams
      of IBP and Tyson can work together" (June 19, 2001).
    

      FOCUSES ON INTEGRATING IBP INTO COMPANY
    

      For Tyson one of the first orders of business after the finalization of
      the IBP acquisition in the fall of 2001 was the streamlining and
      rationalization of the newly combined company. By early 2003 John Tyson
      seemed satisfied that most areas of redundancy had been—or were
      scheduled to be—eliminated. At the company's annual
      shareholders meeting in February 2003 Tyson reported that $50 million in
      savings had been achieved during 2002 with another $100 million in savings
      expected to be realized before the end of 2003. He told shareholders that
      the company's focus for the short term would be on paying down its
      debt, which had jumped sharply in the wake of the IBP acquisition.
    

      Twice in the early 2000s Tyson Foods came under the close scrutiny of
      federal regulators. In December 2001 the company and three of its managers
      were indicted on charges that they had conspired to smuggle illegal
      immigrants into the United States for work in company plants. The case
      went to trial in federal court in Chattanooga, Tennessee, in early 2003;
      the company and the three executives were acquitted of all charges. In
      March 2004 the company revealed that it was under investigation by the
      Securities and Exchange Commission over benefits paid to top executives,
      including John H. Tyson.
    

      Tyson and his wife, Kimberly, lived in northwestern Arkansas with their
      two children, John Randal and Olivia Laine. Away from the corporate
      offices Tyson managed to find time to serve on the board of the National
      Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence and was also involved with the
      Walden Woods Project, formed in 1990 to protect wooded areas surrounding
      Thoreau's Walden Pond. In 1994 Tyson was named Man of the Year by
      the Arkansas Poultry Federation. In 2003 under his direction Tyson Foods
      was named by 
      
        National Provisioner
      
       magazine as its first Poultry Processor of the Year. Also in 2003 
      
        Fortune
      
       selected Tyson Foods as the most admired company in the food-production
      industry. According to a report in 
      
        Arkansas Business
      
      , in acknowledging this honor Tyson said, "It's incredibly
      gratifying to have the hard work of our people recognized by others in the
      industry" (March 3, 2003).

Profile[edit]
The company was established by John W. Tyson in 1935,[3] and benefitted during World War II when chicken was not included in foods that were rationed.[4] As of 2014 the company employs 115,000 people, who work at more than 300 facilities, 90 of which are in the US.[3] As of 2014, Tyson had about 97,000 employees in 27 states; locations are concentrated in the Midwest, with 16 locations in Arkansas, 11 in Texas, 9 in Iowa, and the remainder of the mostly eastern US with less than 3-4 locations.[3] Tyson also works with 6,729 independent contract chicken growers.[citation needed]
It is one of the largest U.S. marketers of value-added chicken, beef and pork to retail grocers, broad line foodservice distributors and national fast food and full service restaurant chains; fresh beef and pork; frozen and fully cooked chicken, beef and pork products; case-ready beef and pork; supermarket deli chicken products; meat toppings for the pizza industry and retail frozen pizza; club store chicken, beef and pork; ground beef and flour tortillas. It supplies Yum! Brands chains that use chicken, including KFC and Taco Bell, as well as McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's, Wal-Mart, Kroger, IGA, Beef O'Brady's, small restaurant businesses, and prisons.[citation needed]
The company makes a wide variety of animal-based and prepared products at its 123 food processing plants. It produces many different products, including Buffalo wings, boneless Buffalo wings, chicken nuggets and tenders. Every week, its 54 chicken plants, 13 beef plants, and six pork plants slaughter and package 42.5 million chickens, 170,938 cattle, and 347,891 pigs. Their largest meat packing facility is their beef production plant in Dakota City, Nebraska. Other plants include feed mills, hatcheries, farms and tanneries.[citation needed]
Acquisitions[edit]




The Tyson logo, used as a corporate logo from 1978 to 2017. It has been seen with minor changes since 1972. It continues to be used as a logo on Tyson brand products.


In 2001, Tyson Foods acquired IBP, Inc., the largest beef packer and number two pork processor in the U.S., for US$3.2 billion in cash and stock. Tyson has also acquired such companies as Hudson Foods Company, Garrett poultry, Washington Creamery, Franz Foods, Prospect Farms, Krispy Kitchens, Ocoma Foods, Cassady Broiler, Vantress Pedigree, Wilson Foods, Honeybear Foods, Mexican Original, Valmac Industries, Heritage Valley, Lane Poultry, Cobb-Vantress, Holly Farms, Wright Brand Foods, Inc. and Don Julio Foods. It also acquired along with its purchase of IBP, the naming rights to an event center in Sioux City, Iowa. On 29 May 2014, the company announced a $6.13 billion cash offer to acquire all the shares in Hillshire Brands, two days after a $6.4 billion cash and shares bid for Hillshire by Pilgrim's Corp. In June 2014, Tyson won the bidding war against Pilgrim's Pride, agreeing to buy the maker of Jimmy Dean sausage and Ball Park hot dogs for $8.5 billion.[5] On July 28, 2014, the company said it would sell its Mexican and Brazilian poultry businesses to JBS S.A. for $575 million and use the proceeds to pay down debt from its pending $7.7 billion purchase of Hillshire Brands Co.[6]
Tyson Renewable Energy[edit]
Tyson's processing plants are left with a vast supply of animal fats. In late 2006, the company created a business unit called Tyson Renewable Energy to examine ways to commercialize use of this leftover material by converting it into biofuels.[7] The unit is also examining the potential use of poultry litter to generate energy and other products.[8] On April 16, 2007, Tyson announced a joint venture with ConocoPhillips to produce roughly 175 million gallons of biodiesel a year—enough to run Tyson Foods' truck fleet for 3.5 years.[9]
Corporate charity[edit]
Since 2000, Tyson Foods has given more than 78 million pounds of its products to hunger and disaster relief in the United States - altogether enough protein to have served one meal to every American citizen.[10] Tyson has donated millions of dollars in cash to help non-profit organizations across the country. For these efforts, Forbes named Tyson Foods the second most proportionally generous company for its donations in 2007 totaling 1.6 percent ($8 million) of its annual operating income.[11] Tyson initiated the KNOW Hunger campaign in early 2011 to raise awareness of hunger in the United States.[10] After the Joplin tornado of 2011, Tyson sent 77,000 pounds of food to the city.[12] It also sent 100,000 pounds of food to the communities along the Gulf of Mexico after the oil spill.[13]
Religious activities[edit]
Current chairman John Tyson is a practicing Interfaith Christian. In addition to placing 128 part-time chaplains (including both Protestant and Catholic Christians and Muslim Imams) in 78 Tyson plants,[14] in 2006, the company invited their customers to download a prayer book, containing prayers from many faiths, including Christianity, Judaism, Islam, and American Indian spirituality, from the company's website to read during mealtime.[15][16]

Donnie Smith served as CEO from November 2009 to 2016. In November 2016, the company announced Smith would step down at the end of the year and would be succeeded by company president Tom Hayes.[18]
Controversies[edit]




World headquarters of Tyson Foods at 2200 Don Tyson Pkwy, Springdale, Arkansas


Environmental record[edit]
During the past decade, Tyson has been involved in several lawsuits related to air and water pollution. In June 2003, the company admitted to illegally dumping untreated wastewater from its poultry processing plant near Sedalia, Missouri, pleading guilty to 20 felony violations of the federal Clean Water Act. As part of the plea agreement, the company agreed to pay $7.5 million in fines, hire an outside consultant to perform an environmental audit, and institute an "enhanced environmental management system" at the Sedalia plant. At the same time, Tyson also settled a case filed by the Missouri attorney general's office related to the same illegal dumping.[citation needed]
The United States Environmental Protection Agency began the investigation into the discharges in 1997, and federal officials served two criminal search warrants at the plant in 1999. According to EPA and U.S. Department of Justice officials, Tyson continued to illegally dump wastewater after the search warrants were executed, prompting an EPA senior trial attorney to remark that: "Having done this work for nearly 20 years, I don't recall any case where violations continued after the execution of two search warrants. That's stunning." Under the federal and state plea agreements, Tyson agreed to pay $5.5 million to the federal government, $1 million to the Pettis County School Fund and $1 million to the Missouri Natural Resources Protection Fund to help remedy the damage.[19]
In 2002, three residents of Western Kentucky, together with the Sierra Club, filed a lawsuit concerning the discharge of dangerous quantities of ammonia from Tyson's Western Kentucky factories. Tyson settled the suit in January 2005, agreeing to spend $500,000 to mitigate and monitor the ammonia levels.[20]
In 2004, Tyson was one of six poultry companies to pay a $7.3 million settlement fee to the city of Tulsa, Oklahoma, to settle charges that the use of chicken waste as fertilizer had created phosphorus pollution in Tulsa's main drinking water sources.[21]
Employment of undocumented immigrants[edit]
In 2001, Tyson was charged with conspiracy to smuggle undocumented workers to work on its production lines. Tyson plant managers arranged for delivery of illegal workers with undercover immigration officials. Prosecutors alleged that the conspiracy to import workers dates back to 1994 when plant managers began to find it difficult to fill positions with "cheap legal help". Of the six managers who were indicted, two accepted plea bargain deals, and one committed suicide one month after being charged. In March 2003, a federal jury acquitted Tyson of having knowingly hired illegal immigrants.[22][23]
In May 2006, Tyson suspended operations at nine plants during a nationwide day of immigration demonstrations citing expected lack of workers.[24]
In October 2006, a federal judge granted class-action status to a lawsuit brought by Tyson employees who allege that Tyson's practice of hiring illegal immigrants depresses wages 10–30%. The suit further contends that the company violated federal racketeering laws by conspiring with National Council of La Raza and League of United Latin American Countries not to question the employment applications of anyone with a Hispanic surname.[25][26][27]
Price manipulation[edit]
In 2004 a federal jury found that Tyson Fresh Meats had used captive supply agreements to artificially lower fed cattle prices in violation of the Packers and Stockyards Act. Damages were found to be $1.28 billion. A U.S. Court of Appeals voided the verdict because it determined Tyson had a legitimate business justification to artificially lower cattle prices.[28]
Undisclosed use of antibiotics[edit]
In 2007, Tyson began labeling and advertising its chicken products as "Raised without Antibiotics." After being advised by the USDA that Tyson's use of protozoa-killing ionophores in unhatched eggs constituted antibiotic use, Tyson and the USDA compromised on rewording Tyson's slogan as "raised without antibiotics that impact antibiotic resistance in humans." Tyson competitors Perdue Farms and Sanderson Farms sued claiming that Tyson's claim violated truth-in-advertising/labeling standards. In May 2008, a federal judge ordered Tyson to stop using the label.[citation needed]
In June 2008, USDA inspectors discovered that Tyson had also been using gentamicin, an antibiotic, in eggs. USDA Undersecretary for Food Safety Richard Raymond claimed that the company hid the use of this antibiotic from federal inspectors claiming that the use of this chemical is standard industry practice. Tyson agreed to voluntarily remove its "raised without antibiotics" label in future packaging and advertising.[29]
Employee abuse[edit]
An Oxfam report issued in 2016 cited anonymous employees who stated they have been denied bathroom breaks so frequently that they have started wearing adult diapers to work. According to the report:[30]

"Workers struggle to cope with this denial of a basic human need. They urinate and defecate while standing on the line; they wear diapers to work; they restrict intake of liquids and fluids to dangerous degrees; they endure pain and discomfort while they worry about their health and job security.

Animal abuse[edit]
From December 2004 through February 2005, an undercover investigator for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals claimed to have worked on the slaughter line of a Tyson Foods chicken processing plant in Heflin, Alabama. Using a hidden camera, he allegedly documented the treatment of the more than 100,000 chickens killed every day in the plant. PETA alleges that workers were instructed to rip the heads off of birds who missed the throat-cutting machines. He claims he saw birds scalded alive in the feather removal tank, and he said that managers said that it was acceptable to scald 40 birds alive per shift. The investigator claims plant employees were also seen throwing around dead birds just for fun. PETA has asked Tyson to implement controlled atmosphere killing (CAK). For this reason, PETA is boycotting businesses that use Tyson as a supplier, such as KFC and distribution channels such as Sunset Strips. The video, taken by the investigator of the killings, was posted on YouTube.[31]
In 2006, Tyson completed a study to determine whether CAK, which uses gas to render chickens unconscious before slaughter, could be a more humane practice than conventional electrical stunning. According to Bill Lovette, Tyson's senior group vice president of poultry and prepared foods, the study found no difference between the humaneness of the two methods. The company plans to ask scientists at the University of Arkansas to initiate a similar study to test these initial results. The research will be led by the newly created Chair in Food Animal Wellbeing at the Dale Bumpers College of Agricultural, Food and Life Sciences of the University of Arkansas. Tyson has committed $1.5 million to help establish the Chair, which will be involved in overseeing research and classes focused on the humane management and treatment of food animals.[32]
A 2016 undercover investigation by the animal rights organization Compassion Over Killing showed workers at four separate Tyson processing plants throwing, punching and kicking chickens as well as sticking plastic rods through their beaks. They also wrung birds' necks, ran over them with forklifts and left injured birds in heaping piles to die.[33]

Controversies[edit]

Environmental record[edit]
During the past decade, Tyson has been involved in several lawsuits related to air and water pollution. In June 2003, the company admitted to illegally dumping untreated wastewater from its poultry processing plant near Sedalia, Missouri, pleading guilty to 20 felony violations of the federal Clean Water Act. As part of the plea agreement, the company agreed to pay $7.5 million in fines, hire an outside consultant to perform an environmental audit, and institute an "enhanced environmental management system" at the Sedalia plant. At the same time, Tyson also settled a case filed by the Missouri attorney general's office related to the same illegal dumping.[citation needed]
The United States Environmental Protection Agency began the investigation into the discharges in 1997, and federal officials served two criminal search warrants at the plant in 1999. According to EPA and U.S. Department of Justice officials, Tyson continued to illegally dump wastewater after the search warrants were executed, prompting an EPA senior trial attorney to remark that: "Having done this work for nearly 20 years, I don't recall any case where violations continued after the execution of two search warrants. That's stunning." Under the federal and state plea agreements, Tyson agreed to pay $5.5 million to the federal government, $1 million to the Pettis County School Fund and $1 million to the Missouri Natural Resources Protection Fund to help remedy the damage.[19]
In 2002, three residents of Western Kentucky, together with the Sierra Club, filed a lawsuit concerning the discharge of dangerous quantities of ammonia from Tyson's Western Kentucky factories. Tyson settled the suit in January 2005, agreeing to spend $500,000 to mitigate and monitor the ammonia levels.[20]
In 2004, Tyson was one of six poultry companies to pay a $7.3 million settlement fee to the city of Tulsa, Oklahoma, to settle charges that the use of chicken waste as fertilizer had created phosphorus pollution in Tulsa's main drinking water sources.[21]
Employment of undocumented immigrants[edit]
In 2001, Tyson was charged with conspiracy to smuggle undocumented workers to work on its production lines. Tyson plant managers arranged for delivery of illegal workers with undercover immigration officials. Prosecutors alleged that the conspiracy to import workers dates back to 1994 when plant managers began to find it difficult to fill positions with "cheap legal help". Of the six managers who were indicted, two accepted plea bargain deals, and one committed suicide one month after being charged. In March 2003, a federal jury acquitted Tyson of having knowingly hired illegal immigrants.[22][23]
In May 2006, Tyson suspended operations at nine plants during a nationwide day of immigration demonstrations citing expected lack of workers.[24]
In October 2006, a federal judge granted class-action status to a lawsuit brought by Tyson employees who allege that Tyson's practice of hiring illegal immigrants depresses wages 10–30%. The suit further contends that the company violated federal racketeering laws by conspiring with National Council of La Raza and League of United Latin American Countries not to question the employment applications of anyone with a Hispanic surname.[25][26][27]
Price manipulation[edit]
In 2004 a federal jury found that Tyson Fresh Meats had used captive supply agreements to artificially lower fed cattle prices in violation of the Packers and Stockyards Act. Damages were found to be $1.28 billion. A U.S. Court of Appeals voided the verdict because it determined Tyson had a legitimate business justification to artificially lower cattle prices.[28]
Undisclosed use of antibiotics[edit]
In 2007, Tyson began labeling and advertising its chicken products as "Raised without Antibiotics." After being advised by the USDA that Tyson's use of protozoa-killing ionophores in unhatched eggs constituted antibiotic use, Tyson and the USDA compromised on rewording Tyson's slogan as "raised without antibiotics that impact antibiotic resistance in humans." Tyson competitors Perdue Farms and Sanderson Farms sued claiming that Tyson's claim violated truth-in-advertising/labeling standards. In May 2008, a federal judge ordered Tyson to stop using the label.[citation needed]
In June 2008, USDA inspectors discovered that Tyson had also been using gentamicin, an antibiotic, in eggs. USDA Undersecretary for Food Safety Richard Raymond claimed that the company hid the use of this antibiotic from federal inspectors claiming that the use of this chemical is standard industry practice. Tyson agreed to voluntarily remove its "raised without antibiotics" label in future packaging and advertising.[29]
Employee abuse[edit]
An Oxfam report issued in 2016 cited anonymous employees who stated they have been denied bathroom breaks so frequently that they have started wearing adult diapers to work. According to the report:[30]

"Workers struggle to cope with this denial of a basic human need. They urinate and defecate while standing on the line; they wear diapers to work; they restrict intake of liquids and fluids to dangerous degrees; they endure pain and discomfort while they worry about their health and job security.

Animal abuse[edit]
From December 2004 through February 2005, an undercover investigator for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals claimed to have worked on the slaughter line of a Tyson Foods chicken processing plant in Heflin, Alabama. Using a hidden camera, he allegedly documented the treatment of the more than 100,000 chickens killed every day in the plant. PETA alleges that workers were instructed to rip the heads off of birds who missed the throat-cutting machines. He claims he saw birds scalded alive in the feather removal tank, and he said that managers said that it was acceptable to scald 40 birds alive per shift. The investigator claims plant employees were also seen throwing around dead birds just for fun. PETA has asked Tyson to implement controlled atmosphere killing (CAK). For this reason, PETA is boycotting businesses that use Tyson as a supplier, such as KFC and distribution channels such as Sunset Strips. The video, taken by the investigator of the killings, was posted on YouTube.[31]
In 2006, Tyson completed a study to determine whether CAK, which uses gas to render chickens unconscious before slaughter, could be a more humane practice than conventional electrical stunning. According to Bill Lovette, Tyson's senior group vice president of poultry and prepared foods, the study found no difference between the humaneness of the two methods. The company plans to ask scientists at the University of Arkansas to initiate a similar study to test these initial results. The research will be led by the newly created Chair in Food Animal Wellbeing at the Dale Bumpers College of Agricultural, Food and Life Sciences of the University of Arkansas. Tyson has committed $1.5 million to help establish the Chair, which will be involved in overseeing research and classes focused on the humane management and treatment of food animals.[32]
A 2016 undercover investigation by the animal rights organization Compassion Over Killing showed workers at four separate Tyson processing plants throwing, punching and kicking chickens as well as sticking plastic rods through their beaks. They also wrung birds' necks, ran over them with forklifts and left injured birds in heaping piles to die.[33]

Profile[edit]
The company was established by John W. Tyson in 1935,[3] and benefitted during World War II when chicken was not included in foods that were rationed.[4] As of 2014 the company employs 115,000 people, who work at more than 300 facilities, 90 of which are in the US.[3] As of 2014, Tyson had about 97,000 employees in 27 states; locations are concentrated in the Midwest, with 16 locations in Arkansas, 11 in Texas, 9 in Iowa, and the remainder of the mostly eastern US with less than 3-4 locations.[3] Tyson also works with 6,729 independent contract chicken growers.[citation needed]
It is one of the largest U.S. marketers of value-added chicken, beef and pork to retail grocers, broad line foodservice distributors and national fast food and full service restaurant chains; fresh beef and pork; frozen and fully cooked chicken, beef and pork products; case-ready beef and pork; supermarket deli chicken products; meat toppings for the pizza industry and retail frozen pizza; club store chicken, beef and pork; ground beef and flour tortillas. It supplies Yum! Brands chains that use chicken, including KFC and Taco Bell, as well as McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's, Wal-Mart, Kroger, IGA, Beef O'Brady's, small restaurant businesses, and prisons.[citation needed]
The company makes a wide variety of animal-based and prepared products at its 123 food processing plants. It produces many different products, including Buffalo wings, boneless Buffalo wings, chicken nuggets and tenders. Every week, its 54 chicken plants, 13 beef plants, and six pork plants slaughter and package 42.5 million chickens, 170,938 cattle, and 347,891 pigs. Their largest meat packing facility is their beef production plant in Dakota City, Nebraska. Other plants include feed mills, hatcheries, farms and tanneries.[citation needed]
Acquisitions[edit]




The Tyson logo, used as a corporate logo from 1978 to 2017. It has been seen with minor changes since 1972. It continues to be used as a logo on Tyson brand products.


In 2001, Tyson Foods acquired IBP, Inc., the largest beef packer and number two pork processor in the U.S., for US$3.2 billion in cash and stock. Tyson has also acquired such companies as Hudson Foods Company, Garrett poultry, Washington Creamery, Franz Foods, Prospect Farms, Krispy Kitchens, Ocoma Foods, Cassady Broiler, Vantress Pedigree, Wilson Foods, Honeybear Foods, Mexican Original, Valmac Industries, Heritage Valley, Lane Poultry, Cobb-Vantress, Holly Farms, Wright Brand Foods, Inc. and Don Julio Foods. It also acquired along with its purchase of IBP, the naming rights to an event center in Sioux City, Iowa. On 29 May 2014, the company announced a $6.13 billion cash offer to acquire all the shares in Hillshire Brands, two days after a $6.4 billion cash and shares bid for Hillshire by Pilgrim's Corp. In June 2014, Tyson won the bidding war against Pilgrim's Pride, agreeing to buy the maker of Jimmy Dean sausage and Ball Park hot dogs for $8.5 billion.[5] On July 28, 2014, the company said it would sell its Mexican and Brazilian poultry businesses to JBS S.A. for $575 million and use the proceeds to pay down debt from its pending $7.7 billion purchase of Hillshire Brands Co.[6]
Tyson Renewable Energy[edit]
Tyson's processing plants are left with a vast supply of animal fats. In late 2006, the company created a business unit called Tyson Renewable Energy to examine ways to commercialize use of this leftover material by converting it into biofuels.[7] The unit is also examining the potential use of poultry litter to generate energy and other products.[8] On April 16, 2007, Tyson announced a joint venture with ConocoPhillips to produce roughly 175 million gallons of biodiesel a year—enough to run Tyson Foods' truck fleet for 3.5 years.[9]
Corporate charity[edit]
Since 2000, Tyson Foods has given more than 78 million pounds of its products to hunger and disaster relief in the United States - altogether enough protein to have served one meal to every American citizen.[10] Tyson has donated millions of dollars in cash to help non-profit organizations across the country. For these efforts, Forbes named Tyson Foods the second most proportionally generous company for its donations in 2007 totaling 1.6 percent ($8 million) of its annual operating income.[11] Tyson initiated the KNOW Hunger campaign in early 2011 to raise awareness of hunger in the United States.[10] After the Joplin tornado of 2011, Tyson sent 77,000 pounds of food to the city.[12] It also sent 100,000 pounds of food to the communities along the Gulf of Mexico after the oil spill.[13]
Religious activities[edit]
Current chairman John Tyson is a practicing Interfaith Christian. In addition to placing 128 part-time chaplains (including both Protestant and Catholic Christians and Muslim Imams) in 78 Tyson plants,[14] in 2006, the company invited their customers to download a prayer book, containing prayers from many faiths, including Christianity, Judaism, Islam, and American Indian spirituality, from the company's website to read during mealtime.[15][16]

Environmental record[edit]
During the past decade, Tyson has been involved in several lawsuits related to air and water pollution. In June 2003, the company admitted to illegally dumping untreated wastewater from its poultry processing plant near Sedalia, Missouri, pleading guilty to 20 felony violations of the federal Clean Water Act.

Employment of undocumented immigrants[edit]
In 2001, Tyson was charged with conspiracy to smuggle undocumented workers to work on its production lines. Tyson plant managers arranged for delivery of illegal workers with undercover immigration officials. Prosecutors alleged that the conspiracy to import workers dates back to 1994 when plant managers began to find it difficult to fill positions with "cheap legal help". Of the six managers who were indicted, two accepted plea bargain deals, and one committed suicide one month after being charged. In March 2003, a federal jury acquitted Tyson of having knowingly hired illegal immigrants.[22][23]
In May 2006, Tyson suspended operations at nine plants during a nationwide day of immigration demonstrations citing expected lack of workers.[24]
In October 2006, a federal judge granted class-action status to a lawsuit brought by Tyson employees who allege that Tyson's practice of hiring illegal immigrants depresses wages 10–30%. The suit further contends that the company violated federal racketeering laws by conspiring with National Council of La Raza and League of United Latin American Countries not to question the employment applications of anyone with a Hispanic surname.[25][26][27]

In 2004 a federal jury found that Tyson Fresh Meats had used captive supply agreements to artificially lower fed cattle prices in violation of the Packers and Stockyards Act.

"Workers struggle to cope with this denial of a basic human need. They urinate and defecate while standing on the line; they wear diapers to work; they restrict intake of liquids and fluids to dangerous degrees; they endure pain and discomfort while they worry about their health and job security.

Animal abuse[edit]
From December 2004 through February 2005, an undercover investigator for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals claimed to have worked on the slaughter line of a Tyson Foods chicken processing plant in Heflin, Alabama. Using a hidden camera, he allegedly documented the treatment of the more than 100,000 chickens killed every day in the plant. PETA alleges that workers were instructed to rip the heads off of birds who missed the throat-cutting machines. He claims he saw birds scalded alive in the feather removal tank, and he said that managers said that it was acceptable to scald 40 birds alive per shift. The investigator claims plant employees were also seen throwing around dead birds just for fun. PETA has asked Tyson to implement controlled atmosphere killing (CAK).

A 2016 undercover investigation by the animal rights organization Compassion Over Killing showed workers at four separate Tyson processing plants throwing, punching and kicking chickens as well as sticking plastic rods through their beaks. They also wrung birds' necks, ran over them with forklifts and left injured birds in heaping piles to die.[33]

Profile[edit]
The company was established by John W. Tyson in 1935,[3] and benefitted during World War II when chicken was not included in foods that were rationed.[4] As of 2014 the company employs 115,000 people, who work at more than 300 facilities, 90 of which are in the US.[3] As of 2014, Tyson had about 97,000 employees in 27 states; locations are concentrated in the Midwest, with 16 locations in Arkansas, 11 in Texas, 9 in Iowa, and the remainder of the mostly eastern US with less than 3-4 locations.[3] Tyson also works with 6,729 independent contract chicken growers.[citation needed]
It is one of the largest U.S. marketers of value-added chicken, beef and pork to retail grocers, broad line foodservice distributors and national fast food and full service restaurant chains; fresh beef and pork; frozen and fully cooked chicken, beef and pork products; case-ready beef and pork; supermarket deli chicken products; meat toppings for the pizza industry and retail frozen pizza; club store chicken, beef and pork; ground beef and flour tortillas. It supplies Yum! Brands chains that use chicken, including KFC and Taco Bell, as well as McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's, Wal-Mart, Kroger, IGA, Beef O'Brady's, small restaurant businesses, and prisons.[citation needed]
The company makes a wide variety of animal-based and prepared products at its 123 food processing plants. It produces many different products, including Buffalo wings, boneless Buffalo wings, chicken nuggets and tenders. Every week, its 54 chicken plants, 13 beef plants, and six pork plants slaughter and package 42.5 million chickens, 170,938 cattle, and 347,891 pigs. Their largest meat packing facility is their beef production plant in Dakota City, Nebraska. Other plants include feed mills, hatcheries, farms and tanneries.[citation needed]
Acquisitions[edit]




The Tyson logo, used as a corporate logo from 1978 to 2017. It has been seen with minor changes since 1972. It continues to be used as a logo on Tyson brand products.


In 2001, Tyson Foods acquired IBP, Inc., the largest beef packer and number two pork processor in the U.S., for US$3.2 billion in cash and stock. Tyson has also acquired such companies as Hudson Foods Company, Garrett poultry, Washington Creamery, Franz Foods, Prospect Farms, Krispy Kitchens, Ocoma Foods, Cassady Broiler, Vantress Pedigree, Wilson Foods, Honeybear Foods, Mexican Original, Valmac Industries, Heritage Valley, Lane Poultry, Cobb-Vantress, Holly Farms, Wright Brand Foods, Inc. and Don Julio Foods. It also acquired along with its purchase of IBP, the naming rights to an event center in Sioux City, Iowa. On 29 May 2014, the company announced a $6.13 billion cash offer to acquire all the shares in Hillshire Brands, two days after a $6.4 billion cash and shares bid for Hillshire by Pilgrim's Corp. In June 2014, Tyson won the bidding war against Pilgrim's Pride, agreeing to buy the maker of Jimmy Dean sausage and Ball Park hot dogs for $8.5 billion.[5] On July 28, 2014, the company said it would sell its Mexican and Brazilian poultry businesses to JBS S.A. for $575 million and use the proceeds to pay down debt from its pending $7.7 billion purchase of Hillshire Brands Co.[6]
Tyson Renewable Energy[edit]
Tyson's processing plants are left with a vast supply of animal fats. In late 2006, the company created a business unit called Tyson Renewable Energy to examine ways to commercialize use of this leftover material by converting it into biofuels.[7] The unit is also examining the potential use of poultry litter to generate energy and other products.[8] On April 16, 2007, Tyson announced a joint venture with ConocoPhillips to produce roughly 175 million gallons of biodiesel a year—enough to run Tyson Foods' truck fleet for 3.5 years.[9]
Corporate charity[edit]
Since 2000, Tyson Foods has given more than 78 million pounds of its products to hunger and disaster relief in the United States - altogether enough protein to have served one meal to every American citizen.[10] Tyson has donated millions of dollars in cash to help non-profit organizations across the country. For these efforts, Forbes named Tyson Foods the second most proportionally generous company for its donations in 2007 totaling 1.6 percent ($8 million) of its annual operating income.[11] Tyson initiated the KNOW Hunger campaign in early 2011 to raise awareness of hunger in the United States.[10] After the Joplin tornado of 2011, Tyson sent 77,000 pounds of food to the city.[12] It also sent 100,000 pounds of food to the communities along the Gulf of Mexico after the oil spill.[13]
Religious activities[edit]
Current chairman John Tyson is a practicing Interfaith Christian. In addition to placing 128 part-time chaplains (including both Protestant and Catholic Christians and Muslim Imams) in 78 Tyson plants,[14] in 2006, the company invited their customers to download a prayer book, containing prayers from many faiths, including Christianity, Judaism, Islam, and American Indian spirituality, from the company's website to read during mealtime.[15][16]

Donnie Smith served as CEO from November 2009 to 2016. In November 2016, the company announced Smith would step down at the end of the year and would be succeeded by company president Tom Hayes.[18]
Controversies[edit]

Environmental record[edit]
During the past decade, Tyson has been involved in several lawsuits related to air and water pollution. In June 2003, the company admitted to illegally dumping untreated wastewater from its poultry processing plant near Sedalia, Missouri, pleading guilty to 20 felony violations of the federal Clean Water Act. As part of the plea agreement, the company agreed to pay $7.5 million in fines, hire an outside consultant to perform an environmental audit, and institute an "enhanced environmental management system" at the Sedalia plant. At the same time, Tyson also settled a case filed by the Missouri attorney general's office related to the same illegal dumping.[citation needed]
The United States Environmental Protection Agency began the investigation into the discharges in 1997, and federal officials served two criminal search warrants at the plant in 1999. According to EPA and U.S. Department of Justice officials, Tyson continued to illegally dump wastewater after the search warrants were executed, prompting an EPA senior trial attorney to remark that: "Having done this work for nearly 20 years, I don't recall any case where violations continued after the execution of two search warrants. That's stunning." Under the federal and state plea agreements, Tyson agreed to pay $5.5 million to the federal government, $1 million to the Pettis County School Fund and $1 million to the Missouri Natural Resources Protection Fund to help remedy the damage.[19]
In 2002, three residents of Western Kentucky, together with the Sierra Club, filed a lawsuit concerning the discharge of dangerous quantities of ammonia from Tyson's Western Kentucky factories. Tyson settled the suit in January 2005, agreeing to spend $500,000 to mitigate and monitor the ammonia levels.[20]
In 2004, Tyson was one of six poultry companies to pay a $7.3 million settlement fee to the city of Tulsa, Oklahoma, to settle charges that the use of chicken waste as fertilizer had created phosphorus pollution in Tulsa's main drinking water sources.[21]
Employment of undocumented immigrants[edit]
In 2001, Tyson was charged with conspiracy to smuggle undocumented workers to work on its production lines. Tyson plant managers arranged for delivery of illegal workers with undercover immigration officials. Prosecutors alleged that the conspiracy to import workers dates back to 1994 when plant managers began to find it difficult to fill positions with "cheap legal help". Of the six managers who were indicted, two accepted plea bargain deals, and one committed suicide one month after being charged. In March 2003, a federal jury acquitted Tyson of having knowingly hired illegal immigrants.[22][23]
In May 2006, Tyson suspended operations at nine plants during a nationwide day of immigration demonstrations citing expected lack of workers.[24]
In October 2006, a federal judge granted class-action status to a lawsuit brought by Tyson employees who allege that Tyson's practice of hiring illegal immigrants depresses wages 10–30%. The suit further contends that the company violated federal racketeering laws by conspiring with National Council of La Raza and League of United Latin American Countries not to question the employment applications of anyone with a Hispanic surname.[25][26][27]
Price manipulation[edit]
In 2004 a federal jury found that Tyson Fresh Meats had used captive supply agreements to artificially lower fed cattle prices in violation of the Packers and Stockyards Act. Damages were found to be $1.28 billion. A U.S. Court of Appeals voided the verdict because it determined Tyson had a legitimate business justification to artificially lower cattle prices.[28]
Undisclosed use of antibiotics[edit]
In 2007, Tyson began labeling and advertising its chicken products as "Raised without Antibiotics." After being advised by the USDA that Tyson's use of protozoa-killing ionophores in unhatched eggs constituted antibiotic use, Tyson and the USDA compromised on rewording Tyson's slogan as "raised without antibiotics that impact antibiotic resistance in humans." Tyson competitors Perdue Farms and Sanderson Farms sued claiming that Tyson's claim violated truth-in-advertising/labeling standards. In May 2008, a federal judge ordered Tyson to stop using the label.[citation needed]
In June 2008, USDA inspectors discovered that Tyson had also been using gentamicin, an antibiotic, in eggs. USDA Undersecretary for Food Safety Richard Raymond claimed that the company hid the use of this antibiotic from federal inspectors claiming that the use of this chemical is standard industry practice. Tyson agreed to voluntarily remove its "raised without antibiotics" label in future packaging and advertising.[29]
Employee abuse[edit]
An Oxfam report issued in 2016 cited anonymous employees who stated they have been denied bathroom breaks so frequently that they have started wearing adult diapers to work. According to the report:[30]

"Workers struggle to cope with this denial of a basic human need. They urinate and defecate while standing on the line; they wear diapers to work; they restrict intake of liquids and fluids to dangerous degrees; they endure pain and discomfort while they worry about their health and job security.

Animal abuse[edit]
From December 2004 through February 2005, an undercover investigator for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals claimed to have worked on the slaughter line of a Tyson Foods chicken processing plant in Heflin, Alabama. Using a hidden camera, he allegedly documented the treatment of the more than 100,000 chickens killed every day in the plant. PETA alleges that workers were instructed to rip the heads off of birds who missed the throat-cutting machines. He claims he saw birds scalded alive in the feather removal tank, and he said that managers said that it was acceptable to scald 40 birds alive per shift. The investigator claims plant employees were also seen throwing around dead birds just for fun. PETA has asked Tyson to implement controlled atmosphere killing (CAK). For this reason, PETA is boycotting businesses that use Tyson as a supplier, such as KFC and distribution channels such as Sunset Strips. The video, taken by the investigator of the killings, was posted on YouTube.[31]
In 2006, Tyson completed a study to determine whether CAK, which uses gas to render chickens unconscious before slaughter, could be a more humane practice than conventional electrical stunning. According to Bill Lovette, Tyson's senior group vice president of poultry and prepared foods, the study found no difference between the humaneness of the two methods. The company plans to ask scientists at the University of Arkansas to initiate a similar study to test these initial results. The research will be led by the newly created Chair in Food Animal Wellbeing at the Dale Bumpers College of Agricultural, Food and Life Sciences of the University of Arkansas. Tyson has committed $1.5 million to help establish the Chair, which will be involved in overseeing research and classes focused on the humane management and treatment of food animals.[32]
A 2016 undercover investigation by the animal rights organization Compassion Over Killing showed workers at four separate Tyson processing plants throwing, punching and kicking chickens as well as sticking plastic rods through their beaks. They also wrung birds' necks, ran over them with forklifts and left injured birds in heaping piles to die.[33]

John H. Tyson








Cal State – Northridge ’75
Brother Tyson is the CEO of Tyson Foods Inc.




Tyson Foods Inc., founded in 1935 with headquarters in Springdale, Arkansas, is the world’s largest processor and marketer of chicken, beef, and pork and the second-largest food company in the Fortune 500. The company produces a wide variety of protein-based and prepared food products, which are marketed under the “Powered by TysonT” strategy. Tyson is the recognized market leader in the retail and food service markets it serves, providing products and service to customers throughout the United States and more than 80 countries. Tyson has approximately 114,000 team members employed at more than 300 facilities and offices in the United States and around the world.
John H. Tyson was born on September 5, 1953 in Springdale, Arkansas. He is the son on Don and Jean Tyson and the grandson of John W. Tyson, the founder of Tyson Foods, Inc.
After graduating from Springdale High School in 1971, John attended the University of Arkansas where in 1972 he was initiated into the Arkansas Alpha chapter. John later transferred to SMU where he received a Bachelor’s degree in Business Administration. John has worked in the family business since his early teens and became a member of the board in 1984.
Today he is chairman of the board of Tyson Foods and has served in that capacity since 1998. Under John’s direction, Tyson Foods has emerged as the world’s largest protein-processing company largely on the strength of the 2001 acquisition of IBP, a giant processor of beef and pork.
That acquisition, engineered by John, accomplished a long time family goal – namely, to successfully diversify the company beyond the confines of the poultry business. By early 2003 Tyson Foods was producing roughly 25% of all the meat products consumed in the United States. Brother Tyson has been honored with the Woodrow Wilson Award for Corporate Citizenship. He has been named Man of the Year by the Arkansas Poultry Industry, by the Arkansas Easter Seals and by the Art Center of the Ozarks. He was also named Humanitarian of the Year by the National Conference for Community and Justice.
John serves on numerous boards and committees including: Walden Woods Project, the Advisory Board for the Yale Center for Faith and Culure, University of Arkansas, and as Committee Chairman of the University of Arkansas Capital Campaign for the 21st Century.
For his long and continued support of the Free Enterprise system, Phi Delta Theta honored John H. Tyson with the Nance-Millett “Free Enterprise” Award at the 2008 General Convention.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
