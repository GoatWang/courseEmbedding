 Clean Coal Technologies, Inc. (CCTC)    3/12/14, Webcast CC Update 	                                                 2012 FACT SHEET           Press Releases For CCTC QB       Filings  For CCTC QB     CCTC Day Chart   Clean Coal Technologies  processes are straightforward.  Read More Here Clean Coal Technologies, Inc.    Clean Coal Technologies, Inc. (OTCQB: CCTC) (PINK: CCTC) is a late-stage start-up company that has introduced proprietary patented and patent pending technologies to convert raw coal into a cleaner, more efficient fuel source. Use of the company's innovative process makes possible the upgrade of low-rank coals, including lignite, into premium fuels that are high in calorific content and low in pollutants.  Clean Coal Technologies' trademarked products,  Pristine™ and  Pristine-M™, are significantly more efficient, less polluting and more cost-effective than untreated coal. The company's products offer solutions for coal users involved in power generation, steel, and coal-to-gas or coal-to-liquids projects. 		   An Emerging Growth Business Specializing  		in the Production of Cleaner Coal  Based in New York, Clean Coal Technologies, Inc. (OTCQB: CCTC) (PINK: CCTC) has introduced proprietary patented and patent pending technologies to convert raw coal into a cleaner, more efficient fuel source. Pristine™ and Pristine-M™, Clean Coal Technologies' trademarked products, are significantly more efficient, less polluting and more cost-effective than untreated coal.  In late 2010, Clean Coal Technologies retained new management whose mission was to establish a commercial platform to market its innovative processes worldwide. In so doing, it became quickly apparent that the quickest path to market was through the Asian market that, at present, is the most dynamic coal-based energy market in the world.  The Asian opportunity, initially, is being addressed through Clean Coal Technologies' Pristine-M™ process that solves the two key problems faced by companies that offer a dry coal product. These problems are that very dry coal is dangerous to transport owing to the risk of spontaneous combustion and, second, that the dried coal tends to re-absorb moisture quickly before it reaches the end user. The company's Pristine-M™ process successfully addresses both problems, and does so very cost-effectively. Unlike most competing processes, Clean Coal's process does not involve pulverization and subsequent briquetting of the coal. The company's "Vapor Phase Deposition" process allows for the increase of the calorific content of the raw coal beyond what would be achieved naturally by the removal of moisture alone.  Currently, Clean Coal Technologies, together with  Archean Group, its partner in Good Coal Pte, Ltd, is working with  SAIC on the construction of a 1:10 scale pilot plant that will be tested at the site of a major U.S coal-fired power company in Oklahoma. Tests are underway to complete the final design of the key components of the plant.  Owing to the unique design of the plant, there are no problems anticipated in scaling up from the pilot plant to the full-scale unit. The pilot plant is on track to be commissioned in early 2013 after which Clean Coal Technologies and Good Coal Pte will enter aggressively into a marketing program to deploy the technology widely, primarily in Asia. 		    $1.4 Trillion Industry and the World's Most Abundant Fossil Fuel  Coal is one of the world's most important fuel sources. Driven by burgeoning demand for electricity in Asia, primarily in India and China, international coal markets, at present and for the foreseeable future, are among the most dynamic segments of the world's energy markets. At the same time, continued dependence on coal for power generation in most countries, including the United States and much of Europe where coal-fired generation still accounts for about 40% of total generation, has clashed with the need to find a more environmentally friendly fuel source, including clean coal.    Below are a series of statistics that help frame the importance of the world's coal markets:      »    Global coal mining is expected to generate revenue of $1.46 trillion in 2012, up from $562.6 billion in 2007.1      »    Global coal use shows stable long term growth and is set to rise faster than all other energy sources.2      »    High demand for coal has increased the pressure for environmentally friendly energy to be used throughout the world.      »    Clean coal represents a truly global opportunity with major coal users like: U.S., China and India.      »    In an effort to curb the effects of untreated dirty coal, the U.S. energy industry alone has invested $90 billion to deploy clean coal technologies.3      »    Coal remains the dominant fuel in the energy mix at over 40%, with some regions, notably Asia, where it is 60%.4      »    Many countries have a sizeable supply of low rank coal, but few efficient ways to process it into a usable fuel source.5      »    Export countries like Indonesia with low-rank coal can use Clean Coal's Pristine™ technology to revitalize their industry. 						        SAIC  Science Applications International Corporation("SAIC"; NYSE: SAI), has entered into a 15-year contract with Clean Coal Technologies whereby it has acquired the right to provide all engineering and EPC services to the company, globally, in exchange for a participation in the company's revenues. SAIC is a Fortune 500 enterprise that is currently the single largest engineering consultant to the U.S. government in the world. SAIC served as the research arm of the Department of Energy for over two decades during which time it came into contact with the Clean Coal Technologies' processes and began a relationship that began in 1998. SAIC employs some 41,000 scientists, engineers and support staff worldwide.  Archean Group  Clean Coal Technologies has executed 25-year agreements with the  Archean Group ("Archean"), which owns some 800 million tons of coal reserves in Indonesia and is currently exporting 4 million tons of low-rank coal to India and China. As part of this relationship, a Singapore corporation doing business under the name of Good Coal Pte, Ltd. ("Good Coal"- Clean Coal Technologies 45%, Archean 55%) has been formed, capitalized and already executed a contract for the construction of a 1:10-scale commercial pilot plant to be located on the site of a major U.S. power company in the state of Oklahoma. Through Good Coal, Archean will fund the US$2 million cost to build the pilot facility. The Archean Group has also invested directly in Clean Coal Technologies, thus far acquiring 6.7% (convertible debenture) of the company's outstanding capital with an option to acquire up to a total of 19.99%.  Jindal Steel and Power  Clean Coal Technologies has executed a 25-year Technology License Agreement with  Jindal Steel & Power who also owns reserves of low-rank, high moisture coal in Indonesia that it is anxious to upgrade. Jindal Steel & Power is a major Indian multinational corporation with businesses in steel, mining and energy that span the globe. Coal samples from its mines have already been tested with excellent results, using the Pristine-M™ process. On the basis of the test results, Jindal agreed to acquire its 25-year license and pay Clean Coal Technologies an upfront licensing fee even before the construction of the 1:10 scale commercial pilot. 		   Clean Coal Executives.

Since 1992, as a Senior Scientist at SAIC, Dr. Paul has provided technical and management support to the Department of Energy's (DOE) National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL). Dr. Paul holds a Ph.D. Materials Engineering Science, Virginia Tech, 1988; an M.S. Chemical Engineering, Virginia Tech, 1984; a B. Tech. Chemical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, India, 1978 and an MBA University of Pennsylvania 2003. 		   The Need for Coal with Less Moisture and Volatile Chemicals    Low rank coal tends to have a high moisture content, which makes the coal much less efficient when used in a coal-fired plant for energy production. Unfortunately, with most existing technologies, upgraded coal that has had its moisture removed tends to spontaneously combust and reabsorbs moistures in both transportation and storage. Furthermore, traditional upgrade technologies involve the pulverization of coal and briquetting it back into a solid form, which is exceedingly expensive and time consuming.  Clean Coal Technologies' Pristine-M™ process uses patented technology to solve these problems before it reaches the end user, and does so very cost-effectively. This unique process is designed to remove moisture from coal and produce a coal of exceptional stability, i.e., one that is able to be transported safely over long distances and without re-absorbing moisture. Unlike most competing processes, Clean Coal does not involve pulverization and subsequent briquetting of the coal. Instead, the company's "Vapor Phase Deposition" process allows for the increase of the calorific content of the raw coal beyond what would be achieved naturally by the removal of moisture alone.  In addition, Clean Coal's second technology, the Pristine™ process, addresses the issue of volatile chemicals in coal. By extracting theses chemicals, Clean Coal significantly reduced levels of toxic air pollutant precursors, such as sulfur and mercury. The Pristine™ process also produce liquid byproducts that contain hydrocarbon compounds that, via chemical synthesis, may be converted into commodity chemicals for an additional revenue stream. 		    Modular Construction with Numerous Advantages  From an industrial perspective, Clean Coal Technologies' processes are straightforward and elegant. The industrial plant, an original design by SAIC, is a modular and scalable concept, as opposed to constructing a single plant to the desired capacity. It should be noted that several prominent players have failed to up-scale their pilot plants as the scale-up ratios ranged from 1:50 to 1:100, as compared with Clean Coal's 1:10.  The Pristine™ and Pristine-M™ standard modules can handle 167K and 240K tons per annum, respectively, in continuous mode. Owing to the extraction of volatile matters, namely, a significant amount of "coal derived liquids" ("CDLs"), the modules are self-fueling once they have been initiated using propane or diesel fuel. The valuable CDL byproducts add significant value to the Pristine™ process, greatly improving plant economics. As a fundamental design parameter that sought to minimize technology risk as much as possible, the commercial plant will be built using well-established, tried and time-proven components that are available widely and off-the-shelf.  There are numerous advantages of the modular design. Most important is that scale-up risk is minimized. If a company wants to increase capacity, it merely adds as many identical units as needed. Performance risk is minimized, as failure of a component will not disable the entire plant. Plant expansions and renovations can be made in affordable increments rather than in the usual "step-up" fashion that entails a degree of over-capacity at the outset. 		   Future Steps toward a Successful Technology Rollout  To further validate Clean Coal's technology on an industrial scale, the company plans to construct a 1:10 scale pilot plant in the United States. Clean Coal and its various technology partners are presently in negotiations with a major U.S. power company to locate the pilot plant on the site of its coal-fired power generation facility in Oklahoma. Future work on full-scale commercial plants in Indonesia is expected to follow what the Company believes will be a successful commissioning of the pilot plant in Oklahoma by year-end 2012 or early 2013.  Based on its current models, Clean Coal's processes are expected to offer exceptional plant economics. Even assuming zero debt in the capital structure, and considering only the cost of the plant with only basic ancillary equipment, DCF analysis indicates an investment recovery period of just over 3 years and an ROI in the range of 35%. With "normal", e.g., 20% debt in the capital structure, both the recovery period and the investments returns improve significantly, with the investment recovered in just over 2 years and an ROI in excess of 50%. The financial modeling that illustrates these results was based on actual test results.  Going forward, Clean Coal Technologies is committed to market its patented processes in the global energy economy. Now, with an experienced management team in place, highly sought-after technologies and world-class execution, the company has positioned itself to capitalize on the extraordinary demand for cleaner, premium coal, with an unequivocal commitment to building long-term shareholder value. 		   Copyright Notice  This website and its contents are Copyright © 2012-2013 Clean Coal Technologies, Inc., all rights reserved.

CCTI Technology Portfolio


 



Clean Coal Technologies, Inc. (CCTI) has developed a suite of patented processes in the cleantech space that address multi-billion dollar unmet needs of the global coal and power industries. Our processes are able to address numerous needs across different industries from coal mining companies that need to upgrade low-rank coal (LRC); power companies that need to meet air quality standards; steel companies that need low-cost coking material; chemical companies who can benefit from the harvesting of hydrocarbon compounds from low-cost coal as opposed to high-cost oil; agricultural companies, alternative fuels (e.g., pet coke substitute), activated carbon; carbon electrodes; etc.
 
 
 


Pristine-M
CCTI’s Pristine M technology is a patented, low-cost coal dehydration technology. The Pristine M process begins with the extraction of volatile material in liquid form from lower ranking coals. Once the moisture is removed from the targeted coal, the liquid volatiles are used through an “absorption” process to fill the pores of the coal that has been dehydrated. The end result is an impermeable, stable coal with an upgraded BTU content that can be economically transported and used for coal-fired power generation.
 
 

Pristine-SA
Pristine-SA, is a development stage technology designed to eliminate 100% of the volatile material in feed coal.  To achieve stable combustion, Pristine-SA would be co-fired with treated biomass or natural gas. The process would result in a clean fuel, eliminating the need for emissions scrubbers and the corollary production of toxic FGD sludge. Pristine-SA is a versatile product that can be used to produce numerous non-fuel products.
 
 

Pristine™
CCTI’s legacy technology, Pristine™, is designed to remove moisture and volatile matter (VM), as per client-specified requirements. The factor determining volatile material reduction is boiler design and the need for a certain amount of volatile material to remain in the coal to ensure proper burn. The end product is a cleaner burning, dry coal.  CCTI will advance the Pristine™ technology following the commercial launch of the Pristine-M technology in 2015.

Making Progress with Coal Co.'s and US Gov. Toward Renewed Jobs and ExportsAccesswireFebruary 23, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareNEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / February 23, 2017 / Clean Coal Technologies, Inc. (OTC PINK: CCTC) ("CCTI" or the "Company"), an emerging cleaner-energy company utilizing patented and proven technology to convert untreated coal into a cleaner burning and more efficient fuel, today announced progress they're making in helping advance domestic coal interests in Wyoming."After several months of working with both the DOE and Capitol Hill, we are very pleased to announce that key meetings have been scheduled for CCTI management the week commencing February 27th in the PRB region of Wyoming," said CCTI CTO, Robin Eves. "These meetings have been arranged for by local officials and will combine both government officials as well as visits to local working coal mines and mines that have been shuttered due to the recent challenges facing the coal industry. We remain steadfast in the belief that our technology can assist in bringing jobs back to the US coal industry. Our focus is on penetrating the export market with our patented processed coal by improving the quality of the coal, increasing its value for export and making it more environmentally safe for transport."Company management is very excited about the change in attitude towards coal since the Trump Administration took office. It's the company's hope that coal mining, handling and transportation jobs will no longer be lost because of dwindling exports. Environmental activism and technological advancement can mutually exist to create a more efficient and cleaner use of coal, and CCTI's patented technology is proving that. The company is committed to working with both industry bodies, those businesses supporting the industry and the US government to deploy technology to bring back badly needed jobs but to do so in ways that upgrade and update processes for the entire coal-fired energy industry."It's becoming an increasingly exciting time in this space and we are being very careful to explore every opportunity available to us that will increase shareholder value with as little dilution as possible," continued Mr. Eves. "Our objective is to secure not just short-term value for CCTI but to create sustainable medium to long-term value in our company and its technology to ensure an effective and timely up-listing to a major exchange in the future.""We have spent the last few months developing and revising economic analysis on PRB and other coals, assessing both US domestic production costs and international demand specifications, and we are confident that our unique stabilized, dust-free coal provides an attractive alternative to transporting and exporting traditional coal," added Aiden Neary, CCTI CFO/COO. "Despite the strong $US, treating PRB coal with our technology can finally provide a competitive advantage for US mined coal by reducing moisture, increasing the coal's BTUs and stabilizing the final product for transport. The meetings next week should allow us to complete our economic modeling and potentially provide a place for the relocation of our test plant, and the potential location for our first commercial plant."About Clean Coal Technologies, Inc.
