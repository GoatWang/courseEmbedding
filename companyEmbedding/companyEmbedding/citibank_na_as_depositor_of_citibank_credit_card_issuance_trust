The customer service is right on point. They are always able to answer any questions that I may have unlike other companies out there. I have never had a problem with them. If I am late with a payment they work with me and give me a call to see what is going on and see if they can help. When I first applied for my card they walked me through all of the necessary steps to get it activated and told me about what the company could do for me. I even received a sign on bonus for opening a account with them. I was able to get 0% APR until the next year and they also had low transfer rates. Now that I have been with the company for a long time there is no way I would switch. I have also talked to some of my family and friends joining Citi and switching from the credit cards that they had. They are glad that they did and it is the only ones that they use now. They have also used Citi for loans and also personal banking.  Thank you, Citi!

Hi Marty,

It is a rule in the credit card industry that you cannot transfer balances between credit cards issued from the same bank. The reason you are not able to transfer your balance to the Citi Simplicity is because the AT&T Access More Credit Card is issued by Citibank as well. But 20% APR is very high, so I would certainly recommend transferring your balance to a low interest credit card to avoid paying a fortune in interest. Two cards to consider that aren't issued by Citibank would be the Chase Slate, which offers 15 months with 0% APR and no balance transfer fee, or the Discover It, which has 18 months with 0% APR.

The best card I have is Capital Visa, even though I had very  bad credit .First they gave me $300.00 limits so I build it up to $500.00. Then they sent me a Visa Credit application, I sent it for the heck of it I received the card from them I was shock.They gave me $10,000.00 limits on this visa card plus if I spent $2,000.00 in my first 2 month i will get 20,000 mile which i already got. I really feel that Capital One Is the best card. I use it for everything now just to get my mile to travel.

If you have less than perfect credit, but can pay your credit card bill on time every time, get yourself a credit card from Capital One. I have a friend with excellent credit and has been a Citi card holder since 1989. Never missed a payment. His Interest rate is 19.99%. Do yourself favor contact Capital One.

Your friend should ask to speak to an acct mgr; I've been with Citi for 22 years and have a very high credit score- my record with them is perfect and without pulling a report  they reduced my interest rate at the time to very low interest; the 19.99 makes no sense unless something negative has happened.

I have been with Citi '99 and have always had excellent customer service with them.  I have called them quite a few times with various requests and have always gotten quickly through to a person.  I have even received 2 calls over the years from them asking about questionable purchases.  Both were fraudulent purchases.  They denied the charges, I never saw a charge on my statement, and they issued new cards.  Awesome company to deal with.

Citi operates in more than 100 different countries and boasts approximately 200 million customers.

	Citi Bank was originally founded in 1812 as a New York banking company. In the late 1990s Citi merged with Travelers Group to form the current CitiGroup brand. In addition to its credit card business CitiGroup also operates stock brokerage firms, insurance companies, investment banking services, wealth management services, and other ventures that offer financial services and related products.

Social Security number

Premier High Yield Savings Account FAQs
I noticed that the APY will be lower if my balance exceeds $100,000.  How can I ensure I get and maintain the top APY offered on my Premier High Yield Savings Account?
The Premier High Yield Savings account features exceptional interest rates, and our top APY is reserved for savers with balances no greater than $100,000.  Once the balance rises above $100,000, the APY will decline.   To get and maintain the top APY offered (currently 1.30%), keep your balance (and this includes deposits AND interest) below $100,000.  If your balance exceeds $100,000 your APY will decline to 1.25%, based on current rates.  The Premier High Yield Savings Account is a variable rate account and the interest rates may change without notice.
What can I do to set an alert on my account to notify me of my balance level?
After you open an account, you'll receive an email with simple instructions on how to create an alert  that will notify you when your balance reaches a set level.  It's fast and easy to set up.




1 APY  -  Annual Percentage Yields (APYs) are accurate as of July 7, 2017: 1.30% APY on balances of $100,000 or less; 1.25% APY on balances greater than $100,000. Interest is paid on the entire account balance based on the interest rate and APY in effect that day for the balance tier associated with the end-of-day account balance. For example: A balance of $95,000 will earn 1.30% APY, and a balance of $105,000 will earn 1.25% APY. Minimum opening deposit is $100. Interest rates for the Premier High Yield Savings account are variable and may change at any time without prior notice.
2 Limited-time bonus offer.  The bonus offer of $100 is valid on Premier High Yield Savings accounts opened using promotional code PREMIER between July 7, 2017 and September 8, 2017, provided that all of the following requirements are met, and subject to the additional limitations shown below:

The account must be funded within 30 calendar days from the account opening date.
A Monthly Balance of at least $15,000 must be maintained for the first three full statement cycles.  A full statement cycle is defined as beginning the first day of a month and ending the last day of that same month.  For example, if an account were opened on July 10, 2017, the first full statement cycle would be for the period of August 1 through August 31, 2017; the July statement cycle would be excluded because it covers only part of the month. For bonus purposes, the Monthly Balance for each full statement cycle is calculated as follows: at the end of each day, the Premier High Yield Savings account balance is recorded.  When the statement cycle ends, these end-of-day balances are added together and then divided by the number of days in the statement cycle to determine the Monthly Balance.  
All funds used to qualify for bonus eligibility must be new funds.  Funds on deposit with CIT Bank, N.A. or its OneWest Bank division at any time during the 90 days preceding account opening are ineligible and will not be included in the calculation of the Monthly Balance.
The account must remain open and in good standing at the time of the bonus payment or the bonus will be forfeited.  

Additional bonus limitations:Limit one Premier High Yield Savings account bonus offer per customer.  If multiple accounts are opened by a customer, only one account will be eligible for the bonus. 
Customers who received a CIT Bank bonus payment or enrolled in another CIT Bank bonus offer between January 1, 2017 and July 14, 2017 (regardless of whether the bonus has yet been paid) are not eligible for this Premier High Yield Savings account bonus offer.
A $100 bonus will be deposited to the Premier High Yield Savings account of the qualified customer within 45 days of the end of the third full statement cycle following account opening.  For example, a customer who qualified for the bonus on a Premier High Yield Savings account opened on July 10, 2017, would receive a statement credit of $100 no later than December 15, 2017.
The bonus payment is reported as interest earned on IRS Form 1099-INT for the calendar year in which it was paid.  Recipient is responsible for any applicable taxes.
3 National average annual percentage yield (APY) on savings accounts as published in the FDIC Weekly National Rates and Rate Caps, accurate as of as of July 7, 2017.

5/1 Adjustable-Rate MortgageThe 5/1 Adjustable-Rate Mortgage is a 30-year mortgage, with fully amortizing principal and interest payments and an initial 5-year fixed rate period. After the 5-year fixed period, the payments, interest rate and annual percentage rate may increase or decrease.EXAMPLE: a $2,000,000 loan with a loan-to-value ratio of 75% and an applicant FICO score of 720 or above, for a purchase transaction of an owner-occupied, one-unit, single family residence in California. At the advertised rate of % (APR %) with % points, which are included in the total closing costs of , the monthly payment would be  for the first 60 months. Beginning at month 61, assuming a new interest rate of %, the new payment would be  until the next annual change date. The rate and payment may change annually based on changes to the index value.Important DisclosuresThe above example for payments beginning at month 61 was calculated using the 1 Year LIBOR index rate of %, a margin of %, and assumes that the 1 Year LIBOR index remains unchanged for the life of the loan.

	of August 9, 2011, between Citibank Credit Card Issuance Trust (the Issuer) and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee (as so amended and restated, the Indenture). Capitalized terms used herein that are not
	otherwise defined have the meanings set forth in the Indenture. All references herein to designated Sections are to the designated Sections of the Indenture.




	Section 301(h) provides that the Issuer may from time to time create a tranche of Notes either by or pursuant to an Issuer Certificate setting forth the principal terms thereof. Pursuant to this
	Issuer Certificate, there is hereby created a tranche of Notes having the following terms:





	Series Designation

	: Citiseries. This series
	is included in Group 1.





	Tranche Designation

	: $1,750,000,000 Floating Rate Class 2013-A1 Notes of April 2015 (Legal Maturity Date April
	2017) (hereinafter, the Class 2013-A1 Notes)





	Currency

	: The Class 2013-A1 Notes will be payable, and denominated, in
	Dollars.





	Denominations

	: The Class 2013-A1 Notes will be issuable in minimum denominations of $100,000 and multiples of $1,000 in
	excess of that amount.





	Issuance Date

	: May 6, 2013





	Initial Principal Amount

	: $1,750,000,000





	Issue Price

	: 100%





	Interest Rate

	: The Class 2013-A1 Notes will accrue interest with respect to any interest period at a per annum rate equal to the Class 2013-A1
	Note Rate for such interest period, calculated on the basis of the actual number of days in such interest period divided by 360. The Class 2013-A1 Note Rate means, with respect to the first interest period, 0.32025% per annum and,
	with respect to each interest period thereafter, a per annum rate equal to LIBOR for such interest period plus 0.10%.




	The Issuer will
	determine LIBOR for each applicable interest period on the second business day before the beginning of that interest period. For purposes of calculating LIBOR, a business day is any day on which dealings in deposits in U.S. Dollars are transacted in
	the London interbank market.







	

	LIBOR

	 means, as of any date of determination, the rate for deposits in U.S. Dollars for
	the Designated Maturity (commencing on the first day of the relevant interest period) which appears on the Reuters Screen LIBOR01 Page as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on such date. If such rate does not appear on the Reuters Screen LIBOR01 Page, the
	rate for that day will be determined on the basis of the rates at which deposits in U.S. Dollars are offered by the Reference Banks at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on that day to prime banks in the London interbank market for the
	Designated Maturity (commencing on the first day of the relevant interest period). The Issuer will request the principal London office of each of the Reference Banks to provide a quotation of its rate. If at least two such quotations are provided,
	the rate for that day will be the arithmetic mean of the quotations. If fewer than two quotations are provided as requested, the rate for that day will be the arithmetic mean of the rates quoted by major banks in New York City, selected by the
	Issuer, at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on that day for loans in U.S. Dollars to leading European banks for a period of the Designated Maturity (commencing on the first day of the relevant interest period).




	

	Reuters Screen LIBOR01 Page

	 means the display page currently so designated on the Reuters Monitor Money Rates service (or such other
	page as may replace that page on that service or any successor service for the purpose of displaying comparable rates or prices).




	

	Designated Maturity

	 means one month.




	

	Reference Banks

	 means four major banks in the London interbank market selected by the Issuer.





	Scheduled Interest Payment Dates

	: The 24th day of each month, beginning June 2013.




	Each
	payment of interest on the Class 2013-A1 Notes will include all interest accrued from and including the preceding Interest Payment Date  or, for the first interest period, from and including the Issuance Date  to and including the day
	preceding the current Interest Payment Date, plus any interest accrued but not previously paid.




	The first deposit targeted to be made to the
	Interest Funding sub-Account for the Class 2013-A1 Notes will be on the June 23, 2013 Interest Deposit Date and in an amount equal to $762,817.71.





	Expected Principal Payment Date

	: April 24, 2015





	Legal Maturity Date

	:
	April 24, 2017





	Monthly Principal Date

	: For the month in which the Expected Principal Payment Date occurs, April 24, 2015,
	and for each other month, the 24th day of such month, or if such day is not a Business Day, the next following Business Day.





	Required
	Subordinated Amount of Class B Notes

	: $104,700,925





	Required Subordinated Amount of Class C Notes

	: $139,601,175





	Controlled Accumulation Amount

	: $145,833,333.33




	 




	2








	Form of Notes

	: The Class 2013-A1 Notes will be issued as Global Notes. The Global Notes will
	initially be registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of The Depository Trust Company, and will be exchangeable for individual Notes only in accordance with the provisions of Section 204(c).





	Additional Issuances of Class 2013-A1 Notes

	: The Issuer may at any time and from time to time issue additional Class 2013-A1 Notes, subject to the
	satisfaction of (i) the conditions precedent set forth in Section 311(a) and (ii) the following conditions:

	the Holders of the additional Class 2013-A1 Notes; and





	 





	 




	(e)




	The ratio of the Controlled Accumulation Amount to the Initial Dollar Principal Amount of the Class 2013-A1 Notes, including the additional Class 2013-A1 Notes, will be
	equal to the ratio of the Controlled Accumulation Amount (before giving effect to the additional issuance) to the Initial Dollar Principal Amount of the Class 2013-A1 Notes, excluding the additional Class 2013-A1 Notes.






	As of the date of issuance of additional Class 2013-A1 Notes, the Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount and Nominal Liquidation Amount of the Class 2013-A1

	submitted to me as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to me as certified or photostatic copies and the authenticity of the originals of such copies.




	Based upon and subject to the foregoing, I am of the opinion that when the Notes have been duly executed, authenticated and delivered in
	accordance with the Indenture, and sold in the manner described in the Prospectus, the Notes will be legally issued, fully paid, non-assessable and binding obligations of the Issuance Trust, and the holders of the Notes will be entitled to the
	benefits of the Indenture.

	Ladies and Gentlemen:




	We have acted as special Federal tax counsel for Citibank, N.A. in connection with the issuance and sale of the above-captioned notes

The customer service is right on point. They are always able to answer any questions that I may have unlike other companies out there. I have never had a problem with them. If I am late with a payment they work with me and give me a call to see what is going on and see if they can help. When I first applied for my card they walked me through all of the necessary steps to get it activated and told me about what the company could do for me. I even received a sign on bonus for opening a account with them. I was able to get 0% APR until the next year and they also had low transfer rates. Now that I have been with the company for a long time there is no way I would switch. I have also talked to some of my family and friends joining Citi and switching from the credit cards that they had. They are glad that they did and it is the only ones that they use now. They have also used Citi for loans and also personal banking.  Thank you, Citi!

Hi Marty,

It is a rule in the credit card industry that you cannot transfer balances between credit cards issued from the same bank. The reason you are not able to transfer your balance to the Citi Simplicity is because the AT&T Access More Credit Card is issued by Citibank as well. But 20% APR is very high, so I would certainly recommend transferring your balance to a low interest credit card to avoid paying a fortune in interest. Two cards to consider that aren't issued by Citibank would be the Chase Slate, which offers 15 months with 0% APR and no balance transfer fee, or the Discover It, which has 18 months with 0% APR.

The best card I have is Capital Visa, even though I had very  bad credit .First they gave me $300.00 limits so I build it up to $500.00. Then they sent me a Visa Credit application, I sent it for the heck of it I received the card from them I was shock.They gave me $10,000.00 limits on this visa card plus if I spent $2,000.00 in my first 2 month i will get 20,000 mile which i already got. I really feel that Capital One Is the best card. I use it for everything now just to get my mile to travel.

If you have less than perfect credit, but can pay your credit card bill on time every time, get yourself a credit card from Capital One. I have a friend with excellent credit and has been a Citi card holder since 1989. Never missed a payment. His Interest rate is 19.99%. Do yourself favor contact Capital One.

Your friend should ask to speak to an acct mgr; I've been with Citi for 22 years and have a very high credit score- my record with them is perfect and without pulling a report  they reduced my interest rate at the time to very low interest; the 19.99 makes no sense unless something negative has happened.

I have been with Citi '99 and have always had excellent customer service with them.  I have called them quite a few times with various requests and have always gotten quickly through to a person.  I have even received 2 calls over the years from them asking about questionable purchases.  Both were fraudulent purchases.  They denied the charges, I never saw a charge on my statement, and they issued new cards.  Awesome company to deal with.

	Citibank Credit Card Review

	Citibank credit cards are issued through Citi Bank, a subsidiary of CitiGroup, which is a multinational umbrella organization encompassing dozens of major corporations within the global financial services industry. Citi operates in more than 100 different countries and boasts approximately 200 million customers.

	Citi Bank was originally founded in 1812 as a New York banking company. In the late 1990s Citi merged with Travelers Group to form the current CitiGroup brand. In addition to its credit card business CitiGroup also operates stock brokerage firms, insurance companies, investment banking services, wealth management services, and other ventures that offer financial services and related products.

	Citibank credit cards include student credit cards, travel rewards cards, and Citi credit cards that have “thank you” points programs that earn valuable rewards as you shop and make purchases. The Citi Platinum Select lineup of credit cards, for example, provide zero introductory APR offers and the Citi PremierPass card is a generous rewards credit card offering bonus points for selected purchases.

Social Security number

Premier High Yield Savings Account FAQs
I noticed that the APY will be lower if my balance exceeds $100,000.  How can I ensure I get and maintain the top APY offered on my Premier High Yield Savings Account?
The Premier High Yield Savings account features exceptional interest rates, and our top APY is reserved for savers with balances no greater than $100,000.  Once the balance rises above $100,000, the APY will decline.   To get and maintain the top APY offered (currently 1.30%), keep your balance (and this includes deposits AND interest) below $100,000.  If your balance exceeds $100,000 your APY will decline to 1.25%, based on current rates.  The Premier High Yield Savings Account is a variable rate account and the interest rates may change without notice.
What can I do to set an alert on my account to notify me of my balance level?
After you open an account, you'll receive an email with simple instructions on how to create an alert  that will notify you when your balance reaches a set level.  It's fast and easy to set up.




1 APY  -  Annual Percentage Yields (APYs) are accurate as of July 7, 2017: 1.30% APY on balances of $100,000 or less; 1.25% APY on balances greater than $100,000. Interest is paid on the entire account balance based on the interest rate and APY in effect that day for the balance tier associated with the end-of-day account balance. For example: A balance of $95,000 will earn 1.30% APY, and a balance of $105,000 will earn 1.25% APY. Minimum opening deposit is $100. Interest rates for the Premier High Yield Savings account are variable and may change at any time without prior notice.
2 Limited-time bonus offer.  The bonus offer of $100 is valid on Premier High Yield Savings accounts opened using promotional code PREMIER between July 7, 2017 and September 8, 2017, provided that all of the following requirements are met, and subject to the additional limitations shown below:

The account must be funded within 30 calendar days from the account opening date.
A Monthly Balance of at least $15,000 must be maintained for the first three full statement cycles.  A full statement cycle is defined as beginning the first day of a month and ending the last day of that same month.  For example, if an account were opened on July 10, 2017, the first full statement cycle would be for the period of August 1 through August 31, 2017; the July statement cycle would be excluded because it covers only part of the month. For bonus purposes, the Monthly Balance for each full statement cycle is calculated as follows: at the end of each day, the Premier High Yield Savings account balance is recorded.  When the statement cycle ends, these end-of-day balances are added together and then divided by the number of days in the statement cycle to determine the Monthly Balance.  
All funds used to qualify for bonus eligibility must be new funds.  Funds on deposit with CIT Bank, N.A. or its OneWest Bank division at any time during the 90 days preceding account opening are ineligible and will not be included in the calculation of the Monthly Balance.
The account must remain open and in good standing at the time of the bonus payment or the bonus will be forfeited.  

Additional bonus limitations:Limit one Premier High Yield Savings account bonus offer per customer.  If multiple accounts are opened by a customer, only one account will be eligible for the bonus. 
Customers who received a CIT Bank bonus payment or enrolled in another CIT Bank bonus offer between January 1, 2017 and July 14, 2017 (regardless of whether the bonus has yet been paid) are not eligible for this Premier High Yield Savings account bonus offer.
A $100 bonus will be deposited to the Premier High Yield Savings account of the qualified customer within 45 days of the end of the third full statement cycle following account opening.  For example, a customer who qualified for the bonus on a Premier High Yield Savings account opened on July 10, 2017, would receive a statement credit of $100 no later than December 15, 2017.
The bonus payment is reported as interest earned on IRS Form 1099-INT for the calendar year in which it was paid.  Recipient is responsible for any applicable taxes.
