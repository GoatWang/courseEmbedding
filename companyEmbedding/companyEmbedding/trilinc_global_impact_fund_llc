Impact Objective(s):

With a 2015 GDP of $11.5 billion and population of 2.5 million5, Namibia ranks ninth across the Sub-Saharan African region on the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business index6.  Between 2010 and 2015, annual GDP growth rates averaged approximately 5.6%,5 mainly driven by metal exports7. Namibia is experiencing rapid rural to urban migration, with an average urban population growth rate of 4.5% per year, driving the demand for serviced land and urban infrastructure development8. 

	  Recognizing the shortage of affordable housing near Namibia’s cities, TriLinc extended a $15,000,000 senior secured four-and-a-half year term loan facility to a Namibia-based company that primarily engages in property development (mainly land acquisition and site development) and financial services (including micro-insurance, retail banking, and education). TriLinc’s financing will support the efforts of the property development division and assist in the development of a roughly 4.5 square mile housing project located north of Windhoek, the capital of Namibia. The borrower initially services the land by installing the necessary infrastructure, such as water piping, sewage, storm water reticulation, electric grid connections, road pavement, and street lighting, after which the property is sold to small- and medium-sized developers and individuals for residential and commercial construction. The borrower seeks to address the middle-income housing shortage that currently exists in Windhoek due to a steady increase in urbanization, combined with geographical hindrances. All of the company’s property development land acquisition meets the International Finance Corporation’s Performance Standards, as well as the company’s proprietary environmental management system. 

	  To complement the holding company’s online education institution, which is the largest distance-learning education program in Namibia, the company is planning to open a vocational training center where members of the public, in addition to the company’s staff, can obtain training and accreditation in all trades concerning brick & mortar, plastering, concrete, electrical, and plumbing work. Additionally, the holding company’s insurance branch provides insurance products, such as legal insurance, funeral cost coverage, life coverage, and income protection, to individuals previously excluded from traditional insurance.

The borrower information presented in the Impact Investment Case Study represents an actual transaction in TriLinc Global Impact Fund as of March 31, 2017.

Fixed Income and Impact Investing: A Primer for Families
Published by: The ImPact
March 2016
Fixed income (FI) is a cornerstone of traditionally balanced investment portfolios, offering stable income, varying liquidity, and a relatively low risk profile.

Social Investment Insights Series
Published by: Big Society Capital
March 2016
Social Investment is one tool to enable charities and social enterprises that are achieving significant impact in our communities to do more with the most vulnerable people in society. Currently, in the UK a large proportion of social investment is being made by institutional investors – pension funds, foundations, large charities and other financial institutions – as well as High Net Worth individuals. This is due, in part, to how the social investment market has evolved over time, with a large proportion of investment happening through intermediated channels, often via fund structures. In this way, the shape of the market has to an extent reflected the shape of the capital available.

Great Expectations: Mission Preservation and Financial Performance in Impact Investing
Published by: Wharton Social Impact Initiative
October 2015
This new study provides an objective, rigorous look at two of the most important aspects of impact investing: financial returns and long-term impact. Specifically, the study explores the widespread assumption that impact investing private equity funds cannot achieve market-rate financial performance. The report’s findings suggest that – in certain market segments – investors might not need to expect lower returns as a tradeoff for social impact. The research found that impact funds in the sample that reported seeking market-rate return—which is only one segment of the broad spectrum of impact funds—demonstrated that they can achieve results comparable to market indices.

In 2014 that number increased to $1 out of every $6 – to a total of $6.57 trillion now invested sustainably.

Priming the Pump: The Case for a Sector Based Approach to Impact Investing
Published by: Omidyar Network
September 2012
The impact investing sector, while still in its infancy, has made remarkable progress in building awareness that business can generate a positive social impact. Although individual firms remain the essential innovators and building blocks of social change, they are means to a broader end of creating innovations that can touch the lives of hundreds of millions. This paper argues for a shift in the impact investing industry toward scaling entire industry sectors in addition to individual firms. Market scalers can accelerate the growth of a sector (e.g. access to finance) by increasing their size and business activities as individual firms.
