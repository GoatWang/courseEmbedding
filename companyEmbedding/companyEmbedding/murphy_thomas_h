                                            Madison - Thomas H. Murphy passed away, peacefully, at Sebring Assisted Living on December 20, 2016.  Tom was born in Eau Claire, WI on June 13, 1926, to Thomas and Amy (nee Walsh) Murphy.  He attended St. Patrick's High School before being drafted to serve in the Second World War.

After serving in the Navy, Tom attended the University of WI-Madison, graduating with an English degree in 1949.  After completing school, Tom felt called to follow his Faith and attend Seminary, which he did for 3 years in Boston, before pursuing a journalism career.  His work took him to several organizations in Madison and Chicago, including CUNA Mutual Insurance Society, WGN-he wrote for The Bozo Show- and the American Medical Association.

Tom and his late wife, Peg, moved to Madison in 1966 where he began working as the editor of the WI Alumni Magazine, which he did with recognized distinction until he retired in 1989.  Tom's second career then started as he became a prominent artist, producing many fine oil paintings, which were sold in several galleries throughout the Midwest and donated to a handful of charities and fundraisers. He also taught painting classes at MATC and Edgewood College. Tom's art accomplishments and the relationships that he built in association with them, brought him a tremendous amount of joy and fulfillment.

Tom was a very devoted member of Blessed Sacrament Church for 50 years, during which time he built many wonderful friendships, while serving the church in a variety of roles.  He was heavily involved in the EdgeFest Follies and Blessed Sacrament's Encore presentations and really enjoyed the people and the creative processes that were involved in these productions.

Tom had a quick wit and a great appreciation for humor.  He was funny, old-fashioned (coincidently, his favorite drink), engaging, stubborn and very Irish, ironically.   

Tom was preceded in death by a sister, Eileen Blake of Scottsdale, AZ and his wife of 52 years, Peg.  Tom is survived by his daughters Molly (Andy) Walloch of Greenfield, WI and Meg (Scott) Selby of Apple Valley, MN, a son Matt (Molly) of Glen Ellyn, IL, and 8 grandchildren; Nicholas and Cory Walloch, Lauren and William Selby, and Jack, Cam, Ali and Aidan Murphy.

The family would like to give a special thanks to the staffs at Coventry Village, Sebring Assisted Living and United Home Hospice for the care and love that they provided dad over the past 9 months, Jana Hughes for being dad's friend (and chauffer) and demonstrating a great deal of patience with and care for him, and Ian Perrin, who provided a watchful eye over dad and became a very good friend to him. We appreciate each of you and love that you showed dad.

Services will be held on Saturday, January 7th Blessed Sacrament Catholic Church, 2121 Rowley Ave., Madison.  A visitation will be from 10:30 a.m. to 12 Noon, with a Mass and luncheon to follow.  In lieu of flowers, please feel free to make a donation to a charity of your choice, in Tom's honor.

Tom wrote many of the skits and said he had me in mind to play "Bubbles," the office secretary.   Gee, Tom, I'm not sure if that was a compliment or not but I had a lot of fun and enjoyed your great sense of humor.   Rest well and keep the heavens laughing.

Tom always carried a smile and was willing to share it with others along with a kind word.  In particular, Tom was always interested in others needs and during my Mother's later years he would always inquire about her wellbeing.  My Mom had her own personal challenges but that never kept Tom from saying a warm hello when she would attend mass and checking in on her through me when he hadn't seen her in a bit.  Bless you Tom.

                                            Madison - Thomas H. Murphy passed away, peacefully, at Sebring Assisted Living on December 20, 2016.  Tom was born in Eau Claire, WI on June 13, 1926, to Thomas and Amy (nee Walsh) Murphy.  He attended St. Patrick's High School before being drafted to serve in the Second World War.

After serving in the Navy, Tom attended the University of WI-Madison, graduating with an English degree in 1949.  After completing school, Tom felt called to follow his Faith and attend Seminary, which he did for 3 years in Boston, before pursuing a journalism career.  His work took him to several organizations in Madison and Chicago, including CUNA Mutual Insurance Society, WGN-he wrote for The Bozo Show- and the American Medical Association.

Tom and his late wife, Peg, moved to Madison in 1966 where he began working as the editor of the WI Alumni Magazine, which he did with recognized distinction until he retired in 1989.  Tom's second career then started as he became a prominent artist, producing many fine oil paintings, which were sold in several galleries throughout the Midwest and donated to a handful of charities and fundraisers. He also taught painting classes at MATC and Edgewood College. Tom's art accomplishments and the relationships that he built in association with them, brought him a tremendous amount of joy and fulfillment.

Tom was a very devoted member of Blessed Sacrament Church for 50 years, during which time he built many wonderful friendships, while serving the church in a variety of roles.  He was heavily involved in the EdgeFest Follies and Blessed Sacrament's Encore presentations and really enjoyed the people and the creative processes that were involved in these productions.

Tom had a quick wit and a great appreciation for humor.  He was funny, old-fashioned (coincidently, his favorite drink), engaging, stubborn and very Irish, ironically.   

Tom was preceded in death by a sister, Eileen Blake of Scottsdale, AZ and his wife of 52 years, Peg.  Tom is survived by his daughters Molly (Andy) Walloch of Greenfield, WI and Meg (Scott) Selby of Apple Valley, MN, a son Matt (Molly) of Glen Ellyn, IL, and 8 grandchildren; Nicholas and Cory Walloch, Lauren and William Selby, and Jack, Cam, Ali and Aidan Murphy.

The family would like to give a special thanks to the staffs at Coventry Village, Sebring Assisted Living and United Home Hospice for the care and love that they provided dad over the past 9 months, Jana Hughes for being dad's friend (and chauffer) and demonstrating a great deal of patience with and care for him, and Ian Perrin, who provided a watchful eye over dad and became a very good friend to him. We appreciate each of you and love that you showed dad.

Services will be held on Saturday, January 7th Blessed Sacrament Catholic Church, 2121 Rowley Ave., Madison.  A visitation will be from 10:30 a.m. to 12 Noon, with a Mass and luncheon to follow.  In lieu of flowers, please feel free to make a donation to a charity of your choice, in Tom's honor.

Tom wrote many of the skits and said he had me in mind to play "Bubbles," the office secretary.   Gee, Tom, I'm not sure if that was a compliment or not but I had a lot of fun and enjoyed your great sense of humor.   Rest well and keep the heavens laughing.

Tom always carried a smile and was willing to share it with others along with a kind word.  In particular, Tom was always interested in others needs and during my Mother's later years he would always inquire about her wellbeing.  My Mom had her own personal challenges but that never kept Tom from saying a warm hello when she would attend mass and checking in on her through me when he hadn't seen her in a bit.  Bless you Tom.

Dec 28, 2016










































Thomas H. Murphy

























































MADISON - Thomas H. Murphy passed away, peacefully, at Sebring Assisted Living on Dec. 20, 2016. Tom was born in Eau Claire, Wis., on June 13, 1926, to Thomas and Amy (nee Walsh) Murphy. He attended St. Patrick's High School before being drafted to serve in World War II.After serving in the U.S. Navy, Tom attended the University of Wisconsin-Madison, graduating with an English degree in 1949. After completing school, Tom felt called to follow his faith and attend Seminary, which he did for three years in Boston, before pursuing a journalism career. His work took him to several organizations in Madison and Chicago, including CUNA Mutual Insurance Society, WGN-he wrote for The Bozo Show- and the American Medical Association.Tom and his late wife, Peg, moved to Madison in 1966 where he began working as the editor of the Wisconsin Alumni Magazine, which he did with recognized distinction until he retired in 1989. Tom's second career then started as he became a prominent artist, producing many fine oil paintings, which were sold in several galleries throughout the Midwest and donated to a handful of charities and fundraisers. He also taught painting classes at MATC and Edgewood College. Tom's art accomplishments and the relationships that he built in association with them, brought him a tremendous amount of joy and fulfillment.
Tom was a very devoted member of Blessed Sacrament Church for 50 years, during which time he built many wonderful friendships, while serving the church in a variety of roles. He was heavily involved in the EdgeFest Follies and Blessed Sacrament's Encore presentations and really enjoyed the people and the creative processes that were involved in these productions.Tom had a quick wit and a great appreciation for humor. He was funny, old-fashioned (coincidently, his favorite drink), engaging, stubborn and very Irish, ironically.Tom was preceded in death by a sister, Eileen Blake of Scottsdale, Ariz., and his wife of 52 years, Peg. Tom is survived by his daughters, Molly (Andy) Walloch of Greenfield, Wis., and Meg (Scott) Selby of Apple Valley, Minn.; a son, Matt (Molly) of Glen Ellyn, Ill.; and eight grandchildren, Nicholas and Cory Walloch, Lauren and William Selby, and Jack, Cam, Ali and Aidan Murphy.

Thomas H. Murphy

























































MADISON - Thomas H. Murphy passed away, peacefully, at Sebring Assisted Living on Dec. 20, 2016. Tom was born in Eau Claire, Wis., on June 13, 1926, to Thomas and Amy (nee Walsh) Murphy. He attended St. Patrick's High School before being drafted to serve in World War II.After serving in the U.S. Navy, Tom attended the University of Wisconsin-Madison, graduating with an English degree in 1949. After completing school, Tom felt called to follow his faith and attend Seminary, which he did for three years in Boston, before pursuing a journalism career. His work took him to several organizations in Madison and Chicago, including CUNA Mutual Insurance Society, WGN-he wrote for The Bozo Show- and the American Medical Association.Tom and his late wife, Peg, moved to Madison in 1966 where he began working as the editor of the Wisconsin Alumni Magazine, which he did with recognized distinction until he retired in 1989. Tom's second career then started as he became a prominent artist, producing many fine oil paintings, which were sold in several galleries throughout the Midwest and donated to a handful of charities and fundraisers. He also taught painting classes at MATC and Edgewood College. Tom's art accomplishments and the relationships that he built in association with them, brought him a tremendous amount of joy and fulfillment.
Tom was a very devoted member of Blessed Sacrament Church for 50 years, during which time he built many wonderful friendships, while serving the church in a variety of roles. He was heavily involved in the EdgeFest Follies and Blessed Sacrament's Encore presentations and really enjoyed the people and the creative processes that were involved in these productions.Tom had a quick wit and a great appreciation for humor. He was funny, old-fashioned (coincidently, his favorite drink), engaging, stubborn and very Irish, ironically.Tom was preceded in death by a sister, Eileen Blake of Scottsdale, Ariz., and his wife of 52 years, Peg. Tom is survived by his daughters, Molly (Andy) Walloch of Greenfield, Wis., and Meg (Scott) Selby of Apple Valley, Minn.; a son, Matt (Molly) of Glen Ellyn, Ill.; and eight grandchildren, Nicholas and Cory Walloch, Lauren and William Selby, and Jack, Cam, Ali and Aidan Murphy.
