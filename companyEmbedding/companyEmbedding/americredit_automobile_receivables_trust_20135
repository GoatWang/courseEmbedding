                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

(c)
Not Applicable.  SUBSTITUTE INFORMATION INCLUDED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERAL INSTRUCTION J
TO  FORM 10-K: 
ITEM 1112(b) OF REGULATION AB. (SIGNIFICANT OBLIGORS OF POOL ASSETS) 
There is no single obligor that represents more than 10% of the pool assets. 


ITEM 1114(b)(2) OF REGULATION AB. (CREDIT ENHANCEMENT AND OTHER SUPPORT, EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN DERIVATIVES
INSTRUMENTS (FINANCIAL INFORMATION))  There is no external credit enhancement or other support provider that is liable to provide payments supporting
any notes or certificates issued by the Issuing Entity.  ITEM 1115(b) OF REGULATION AB. (CERTAIN DERIVATIVE INFORMATION (FINANCIAL INFORMATION))
 No entity provides any derivative instruments that are used to alter the payment characteristics of the cash flows from the Issuing Entity. 
ITEM 1117 OF REGULATION AB. (LEGAL PROCEEDINGS)  As
a consumer finance company, the sponsor is subject to various consumer claims and litigation seeking damages and statutory penalties, based upon, among other things, usury, disclosure inaccuracies, wrongful repossession, violations of bankruptcy
stay provisions, certificate of title disputes, fraud, breach of contract and discriminatory treatment of credit applicants. Some litigation against the sponsor could take the form of class action complaints by consumers and certain legal actions
include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages.  In July 2014, in connection with an
investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice in contemplation of a civil proceeding for potential violations of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989, General Motors Financial Company, Inc. (General Motors
Financial), immediate parent of the sponsor, was served with a subpoena by the U.S. Department of Justice directing it to produce certain documents relating to its and its subsidiaries and affiliates origination and securitization
of subprime automobile loans since 2007. Among other matters, the subpoena requests information relating to the underwriting criteria used to originate these automobile loans and the representations and warranties relating to those underwriting
criteria that were made in connection with the securitization of the automobile loans. General Motors Financial has subsequently been served with additional investigative subpoenas to produce documents from state attorneys general and other
governmental offices relating to its retail auto loan business and securitization of auto loans. In October 2014, General Motors Financial received a document request from the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with its investigation
into certain practices in subprime auto loan securitization. These investigations are ongoing and could in the future result in the imposition of damages, fines or civil or criminal claims and/or penalties. 
No assurance can be given that the ultimate outcome of the investigations or any resulting proceedings would not materially and adversely affect General
Motors Financial or any of its subsidiaries and affiliates, including the servicer, or the interests of the noteholders or the servicers ability to perform its duties under the transaction documents. 
In the ordinary course of business, The Bank of New York Mellon is named as a defendant in or made a party to pending and potential legal actions. In
connection with its role as trustee of certain residential mortgage-backed securitization, or RMBS, transactions, The Bank of New York Mellon has been named as a defendant in a number of legal actions brought by RMBS investors. These lawsuits allege
that the trustee had expansive duties under the governing agreements, including the duty to investigate and pursue breach of representation and warranty claims against other parties to the RMBS transactions. While it is inherently difficult to
predict the eventual outcomes of pending actions, The Bank of New York Mellon denies liability and intends to defend the litigations vigorously. 


ITEM 1119 OF REGULATION AB. (AFFILIATIONS AND CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS) 
Information required by Item 1119 of Regulation AB has been omitted from this report on Form 10-K in reliance on the Instruction to Item 1119.

Fitch Expects to Rate AmeriCredit Automobile Receivables Trust 2013-2 | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Expects to Rate AmeriCredit Automobile Receivables Trust 2013-2
    





April 01, 2013 09:28 AM Eastern Daylight Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings expects to assign the following ratings and Rating 
      Outlooks to the notes issued by AmeriCredit Automobile Receivables Trust 
      2013-2:
    

      --$214,700,000 class A-1 notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --$382,800,000 class A-2 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$183,800,000 class A-3 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$84,170,000 class B notes 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$104,490,000 class C notes 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$102,750,000 class D notes 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$27,290,000 class E notes 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Consistent Credit Quality: The credit quality of 2013-2 is consistent 
      with 2013-1 and 2012 transactions. The weighted average (WA) Fair Isaac 
      Corp. (FICO) score is 566, and WA internal credit score is 240. Used 
      cars total 56.7% and WA loan-to-value (LTV) ratio is 110%, all 
      consistent with recent pools.
    

      Consistent Credit Enhancement Structure: The cash flow distribution is a 
      sequential-pay structure. Initial hard credit enhancement (CE) is 
      consistent with the last four transactions. The reserve is 2.00% 
      (non-declining) and initial overcollateralization (OC) is 5.25% (both of 
      the initial pool balance), growing to a target of 14.25% of the current 
      pool balance, less the reserve.
    

      Stronger Portfolio/Securitization Performance: Losses on GM Financial's 
      portfolio and 2009 - 2012 AMCAR securitizations have declined to some of 
      the lowest levels ever seen, supported by the gradual economic recovery 
      and strong used vehicle values supporting higher recovery rates.
    

      Stable Corporate Health: Fitch rates GM 'BB+' with a Stable Outlook, and 
      GM Financial 'BB' with a Positive Watch. GM Financial recorded positive 
      corporate financial results since 2010, and the overall health of GM has 
      also improved.
    

      Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: AFSI demonstrates 
      adequate abilities as originator, underwriter, and servicer, as 
      evidenced by historical portfolio delinquency and loss experience and 
      securitization performance. Fitch deems AFSI capable of adequately 
      servicing this series.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITY
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce CNL levels higher than the base 
      case and would likely result in declines of CE and remaining loss 
      coverage levels available to the notes. Decreased CE may make certain 
      note ratings susceptible to potential negative rating actions, depending 
      on the extent of the decline in coverage. Hence, Fitch conducts 
      sensitivity analysis by stressing a transaction's initial base case CNL 
      assumption by 1.5x and 2.5x and examining the rating implications on all 
      classes of issued notes. The 1.5x and 2.5x increases of the base case 
      CNL represent moderate and severe stresses, respectively, and are 
      intended to provide an indication of the rating sensitivity of notes to 
      unexpected deterioration of a trust's performance.
