The investment seeks the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares’ per share net asset value (“NAV”) to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the spot price of light, sweet crude oil delivered to Cushing, Oklahoma, as measured by the daily changes in the price of a specified short-term futures contract on light, sweet crude oil called the “Benchmark Oil Futures Contract,” less USO’s expenses.
 USO seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing primarily in futures contracts for light, sweet crude oil, other types of crude oil, diesel-heating oil, gasoline, natural gas, and other petroleum-based fuels.

Fund Details
The United States Oil Fund® LP (USO) is an exchange-traded security designed to track the daily price movements of West Texas Intermediate ("WTI") light, sweet crude oil. USO issues shares that may be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca.
The investment objective of USO is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares' NAV to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the spot price of light, sweet crude oil delivered to Cushing, Oklahoma, as measured by the daily changes in price of USO's Benchmark Oil Futures Contract, less USO's expenses.
USO's Benchmark is the near month crude oil futures contract traded on the NYMEX. If the near month futures contract is within two weeks of expiration, the Benchmark will be the next month contract to expire. The crude oil contract is WTI light, sweet crude oil delivered to Cushing, Oklahoma.
USO invests primarily in listed crude oil futures contracts and other oil-related futures contracts, and may invest in forwards and swap contracts. These investments will be collateralized by cash, cash equivalents, and US government obligations with remaining maturities of two years or less. 
USO's Fund Benefits

USO offers commodity exposure without using a commodity futures account.
USO provides "equity-like" features including, intra-day pricing, and market, limit, and stop orders.
USO provides portfolio holdings, market price, NAV and TNA on its website each day.

The above frequency distribution chart presents information about the difference between the daily market price for shares of the Fund and the Fund's reported net asset value. The amount that the fund's market price is above the reported NAV is called the premium. The amount that the fund's market price is below the reported NAV is called the discount. The market price is determined using the midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest offer on the listing exchange, as of the time that the Fund's NAV is calculated (usually 4:00 pm Eastern time). The horizontal axis of the chart shows the premium or discount expressed in basis points. The vertical axis indicates the number of trading days in the period covered by the chart. Each bar in the chart shows the number of trading days in which the Fund traded within the premium/discount range indicated.
 
* A basis point is equal to 1/100th of 1% and is used to denote the change in a financial instrument.

USO Fund Description
The United States Oil Fund holds near-month NYMEX futures contracts on WTI crude oil.
  
USO FactSet Analytics Insight
USO, among the largest and most liquid oil ETPs available, delivers its exposure to oil using near-month futures. USO's huge asset base waves away any hint of closure risk, and its massive liquidity makes trading a snap. USO gets exposure to oil using derivatives, like all oil ETPs. Derivative returns can vary greatly from spot oil prices, but spot oil is uninvestable. USO holds front-month futures contracts on WTI, rolling into the next contract every month, just like our segment benchmark. This method is particularly sensitive to short-term changes in spot prices, but can also result in heavy roll costs. That makes USO a great vehicle for riding short-term moves in crude prices, but long-term holders may want to look at other options.USO is structured as a commodities pool, so expect a K-1 at tax time. Long-term holders will be taxed on any gains even if they didn’t sell shares. Alternatively, investors could also consider OIL, which follows the same strategy in an ETN wrapper. In all, USO does a great job of capturing the performance of the near-term oil futures market at a low all-in cost, earning it our Analyst Pick designation.

	United States Oil Fund LP (ETF) (USO): The Quick Guide to USO
The USO is a big oil ETF, but it's far from perfect

Prior to the evolution of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the way most investors obtained exposure to oil was via energy stocks. Oil is one of the most heavily traded commodities, and issuers of ETPs have seized upon that theme by bringing to market a scores of non-equity oil products over the years. That includes the United States Oil Fund LP (ETF) (NYSEARCA:USO).
The USO, which tracks front-month West Texas Intermediate futures, is the king of futures-based oil ETFs.
Issuer U.S. Commodity Funds gives the long explanation of the fund:
“The investment objective of USO is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares’ NAV to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the spot price of light, sweet crude oil delivered to Cushing, Oklahoma, as measured by the daily changes in price of USO’s Benchmark Oil Futures Contract, less USO’s expenses. … USO invests primarily in listed crude oil futures contracts and other oil-related futures contracts, and may invest in forwards and swap contracts. These investments will be collateralized by cash, cash equivalents, and US government obligations with remaining maturities of two years or less.”
The short version: When you buy USO, you’re not really buying oil, per se. There’s no barrel that you can collect by turning in your ETF units.
The 10 Best ETFs to Buy for the Rest of 2017
But you’re still more closely investing in oil than you can through energy stocks like Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) or Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB), as you’re invested in the same futures contracts that many pros and bigger investors use to invest in oil.
USO: Big, But Not Perfect
The USO ETF is home to more than $2.8 billion in assets under management, making it one of the largest commodities funds in America. With average daily volume of 21.9 million shares, which works out to be about $2.3 billion in dollar terms, USO is also one of the most heavily traded commodities funds, underscoring the professional community’s use of this products.
However, neither of those factors mean USO is a perfect investment. Far from it.
Although USO is not a leveraged oil ETF, it still comes with one of the same disclaimers: The longer you hold it, the bigger your potential for disappointment.
See, because it constantly rolls over derivatives and futures exposure, not only are its costs high (0.72% per year, or more than triple the average ETF’s yearly fee), but that constant rolling mean the fund can (and does) deviate from the price of spot crude.
The ETF’s “method is particularly sensitive to short-term changes in spot prices, but can also result in heavy roll costs. That makes USO a great vehicle for riding short-term moves in crude prices, but long-term holders may want to look at other options,” according to ETF.com.
Simply put: If spot oil prices jump 20% in a year, it’s unlikely that USO will sport a comparable gain.
The long and short of investing in this fund is that it’s an imperfect way to invest in oil, but as far as faithful methods go, retail investors like you and I have few options anyway. This ETF is an imperfect proxy, but it hasn’t drawn in assets for nothing, either.

This fund offers exposure to one of the the world's most important commodities, oil, and potentially has appeal as an inflation hedge. While oil may be appealing, USO often suffers from severe contango making the product more appropriate for short-term traders.

United States Oil Fund LP (ETF)(NYSE:USO): Oil Jumps On EIA Product Cut Report | ETF Daily News

































 































































Here’s Why Oil Prices Are Surging Today


 February 10, 2017 10:22am  NYSE:USO  



 




From Tyler Durden: Oil jumped this morning, with Brent rising 1%, trading above $56 after the International Energy Agency said OPEC had achieved record initial compliance of 90% with planned production cuts – it is unclear how much of this was self-reported and questionable – while demand grew faster than expected.




In the first month of OPEC’s supply cut agreement, key member Saudi Arabia reduced production by 116%, or even more than it had committed, despite Venezuela’s struggles to reduce output (it had achieved only 18% of planned cuts) while higher demand is aiding the group’s bid to re-balance world markets, the IEA said.
The following Bloomberg chart shows alleged deal compliance by nation…

… and the detailed breakdown is shown below:

The IEA, which advises industrial nations on energy policy, said that if current compliance levels are maintained, the global oil stocks overhang that has weighed on prices should fall by about 600,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the next six months. The IEA also estimated that 11 producers including Russia, Kazakhstan pumped 269k b/d less crude in January versus October-November levels, citing preliminary data.
The IEA also increased its 2016 estimates for world oil demand growth for a third month, and boosted its outlook for 2017, anticipating an increase of 1.4 million barrels a day this year. World oil inventories will fall by 600,000 barrels a day during the first half of the year if OPEC sticks to its agreement, the IEA said.
Oil has fluctuated above $50 a barrel since a deal to trim output between OPEC and 11 other nations took effect on Jan. 1. U.S. producers are taking advantage of higher prices by increasing drilling activity and boosting daily output to the highest level since April, a dynamic the IEA said is capping prices in the mid-$50s.
“There is a demand element to this price rise as well as OPEC compliance,” says Michael Hewson, market analyst at CMC Markets. “We’re still short of the highs of the month.”

“The key question for the oil market is how long OPEC can sustain this deal,” Spencer Welch, a director at IHS Energy, said by e-mail. “Historic analysis of similar production limits suggests that 100 percent compliance is unlikely.”
While the oil market welcomed the data, which may or may not be accurate as verification remains problematic and recent surges in inventory suggest quite the opposite of what the IEA reports, increasingly more attention has recently fallen on US crude production, especially in light of a recent surge in Permian drilling rigs…

… which threatens to disrupt the much desired supply/demand equilibrium.
The United States Oil Fund LP ETF (NYSE:USO) was trading at $11.51 per share on Friday morning, up $0.16 (+1.41%). Year-to-date, USO has declined -1.79%, versus a 3.37% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.
USO currently has an ETF Daily News SMART Grade of B (Buy), and is ranked #49 of 121 ETFs in the Commodity ETFs category.

S&P 500 reaches uncharted territory, the 2,500 technical target within view
Technically speaking, the U.S. benchmarks have extended — or are vying to extend — a powerful 2017 uptrend.  On a headline basis, the S&P 500 and Dow industrials have reached uncharted territory, and the Nasdaq Composite is rising from its second-best close on record, as a small- and mid-cap breakout attempt concurrently remains underway.

S&P 500 nails the 2,405 support amid volatile second-quarter conclusion
Technically speaking, the U.S. benchmarks are concluding the second quarter against a slightly bending, but still bullish, bigger-picture backdrop.  Consider that the S&P 500 has nailed the breakout point — S&P 2,405 — and rallied respectably, preserving its uptrend.  Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite has been more firmly pressured, edging under its 50-day moving average, currently 6,154, and the retest remains underway.

Dow industrials maintain gap support, Nasdaq presses post-FAANG peak
U.S. stocks are slightly higher early Thursday, rising after crude-oil prices nailed a technical target, and subsequently rallied, punctuating a nearly 19% one-month downdraft.  Against this backdrop, the Nasdaq Composite is pressing notable resistance — the post-FAANG peak of 6,243 — while the S&P 500 and Dow industrials continue to digest an early-week break to record territory.

Charting the latest S&P 500 breakout amid bullish sector rotation
Technically speaking, two of the big three U.S. benchmarks have extended the persistent 2017 bull trend.  On a headline basis, the S&P 500 and Dow industrials have once again tagged all-time highs — reaching uncharted territory — while the Nasdaq Composite has thus far absorbed the mid-June downdraft, largely without incident.

S&P 500 maintains support amid second FAANG-fueled downturn
U.S. stocks are lower early Thursday, pressured amid ongoing reaction to the Federal Reserve’s policy directive, combined with a second round of FAANG-fueled selling pressure.  Against this backdrop, the S&P 500 has thus far maintained near-term support, circa 2,416, while the Nasdaq Composite remains more firmly pressured, partly as a source of funds deployed to other sectors.

S&P 500 reaches uncharted territory, the 2,500 technical target within view
Technically speaking, the U.S. benchmarks have extended — or are vying to extend — a powerful 2017 uptrend.  On a headline basis, the S&P 500 and Dow industrials have reached uncharted territory, and the Nasdaq Composite is rising from its second-best close on record, as a small- and mid-cap breakout attempt concurrently remains underway.

S&P 500 nails the 2,405 support amid volatile second-quarter conclusion
Technically speaking, the U.S. benchmarks are concluding the second quarter against a slightly bending, but still bullish, bigger-picture backdrop.  Consider that the S&P 500 has nailed the breakout point — S&P 2,405 — and rallied respectably, preserving its uptrend.  Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite has been more firmly pressured, edging under its 50-day moving average, currently 6,154, and the retest remains underway.

Dow industrials maintain gap support, Nasdaq presses post-FAANG peak
U.S. stocks are slightly higher early Thursday, rising after crude-oil prices nailed a technical target, and subsequently rallied, punctuating a nearly 19% one-month downdraft.  Against this backdrop, the Nasdaq Composite is pressing notable resistance — the post-FAANG peak of 6,243 — while the S&P 500 and Dow industrials continue to digest an early-week break to record territory.

Charting the latest S&P 500 breakout amid bullish sector rotation
Technically speaking, two of the big three U.S. benchmarks have extended the persistent 2017 bull trend.  On a headline basis, the S&P 500 and Dow industrials have once again tagged all-time highs — reaching uncharted territory — while the Nasdaq Composite has thus far absorbed the mid-June downdraft, largely without incident.

S&P 500 maintains support amid second FAANG-fueled downturn
U.S. stocks are lower early Thursday, pressured amid ongoing reaction to the Federal Reserve’s policy directive, combined with a second round of FAANG-fueled selling pressure.  Against this backdrop, the S&P 500 has thus far maintained near-term support, circa 2,416, while the Nasdaq Composite remains more firmly pressured, partly as a source of funds deployed to other sectors.

Charting a garden-variety pullback, Dow industrials nail the breakout point (again)
True to 2017 form, the major U.S. benchmarks have flatlined following an initially powerful technical June breakout.  In the process, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has closely observed first support, across consecutive sessions, while the S&P 500 continues to hold relatively tightly to record highs.
