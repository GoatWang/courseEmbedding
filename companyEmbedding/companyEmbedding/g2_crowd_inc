Service[edit]
Business solution users sign in with a LinkedIn account and can review the products they use. To encourage reviewers to participate, some users are compensated by G2 Crowd with gift cards, contest rewards and reputation points on the website.[4] G2 Crowd attempts to identify fraudulent user reviews through an algorithm that identifies employees at companies reviewing their own products and employees at companies reviewing their competitor's product. In addition, reviews are manually screened and voted on by the community to discourage spam and unhelpful comments.[5] G2 Crowd also requests screenshots of the reviewer using the product for verification purposes.[6]
Information from reviews is aggregated to score business software products on The GridSM, which acts as a competitor to Gartner’s magic quadrant review model. Satisfaction and market presence ratings are generated based on product reviews and market presence data, which are then used to plot products onto a quadrant. The four quadrants in a G2 Crowd Grid are Leaders, High Performers, Contenders and Niche.
Research Reviews[edit]
The reviews submitted to G2 Crowd are available for public consumption. An individual researching software can build their profile and filter information provided by reviewers similar to themselves based on company size, user role and user industry.[6]
History[edit]
In 2011 five former employees of BigMachines – Tim Handorf, Godard Abel, Matt Gorniak, Mark Myers and Mike Wheeler – founded G2 Crowd, with Abel serving as president.[1][7] When Abel left to continue building Steelbrick (now Salesforce CPQ) with Salesforce, Handorf took over as CEO, a role he continues in today.
A beta version of the review site launched in December 2012, with several thousand users testing the service before its full launch in 2013.[4]
In February 2015, former LinkedIn executive, Adrienne Weissman joined G2 Crowd as the organization's new chief marketing officer.[8] G2 Crowd named Michael Fauscette as the organization’s chief research officer in February, 2016.[9]
Funding[edit]
In 2014, G2 Crowd raised $2.3 million in seed funding from investors, including Chicago Ventures, Hyde Park Venture Partners, Andrew Filipowski, and Greg Jones, founding CEO of uBid.[10] In 2015, G2 Crowd raised an additional $7 million in Series A funding led by Pritzker Group Venture Capital. Investors included 2014’s contributors in addition to co-founder Godard Abel, Thomas Lehrman and Scott Dorsey. G2 Crowd announced it would use these funds to invest in its leadership and capabilities.[11]
In 2017, G2 Crowd secured a $30 million Series B, led by VC Accel with participation from LinkedIn and the company's founders. The funds are being used to help the company expand into services. [12]
Significant Milestones[edit]
In December 2015, G2 Crowd surpassed 50,000 verified-user product reviews, more than 28,000 of which were submitted that year. The firm also reported that more than 3,000 reviews were submitted per month on average.[13] In January 2016, G2 Crowd reported more than 400,000 sessions per month, and includes more than 400 product categories.[14]
In September 2016, G2 Crowd reached more than 100,000 reviews. [15]
Awards[edit]
G2 Crowd has been nominated for and earned a number of awards since its founding for its growth and culture.

The reviews submitted to G2 Crowd are available for public consumption. An individual researching software can build their profile and filter information provided by reviewers similar to themselves based on company size, user role and user industry.[6]
History[edit]
In 2011 five former employees of BigMachines – Tim Handorf, Godard Abel, Matt Gorniak, Mark Myers and Mike Wheeler – founded G2 Crowd, with Abel serving as president.[1][7] When Abel left to continue building Steelbrick (now Salesforce CPQ) with Salesforce, Handorf took over as CEO, a role he continues in today.
A beta version of the review site launched in December 2012, with several thousand users testing the service before its full launch in 2013.[4]
In February 2015, former LinkedIn executive, Adrienne Weissman joined G2 Crowd as the organization's new chief marketing officer.[8] G2 Crowd named Michael Fauscette as the organization’s chief research officer in February, 2016.[9]

Investors included 2014’s contributors in addition to co-founder Godard Abel, Thomas Lehrman and Scott Dorsey. G2 Crowd announced it would use these funds to invest in its leadership and capabilities.[11]
In 2017, G2 Crowd secured a $30 million Series B, led by VC Accel with participation from LinkedIn and the company's founders. The funds are being used to help the company expand into services. [12]
Significant Milestones[edit]
In December 2015, G2 Crowd surpassed 50,000 verified-user product reviews, more than 28,000 of which were submitted that year. The firm also reported that more than 3,000 reviews were submitted per month on average.[13] In January 2016, G2 Crowd reported more than 400,000 sessions per month, and includes more than 400 product categories.[14]

Service[edit]
Business solution users sign in with a LinkedIn account and can review the products they use. To encourage reviewers to participate, some users are compensated by G2 Crowd with gift cards, contest rewards and reputation points on the website.[4] G2 Crowd attempts to identify fraudulent user reviews through an algorithm that identifies employees at companies reviewing their own products and employees at companies reviewing their competitor's product. In addition, reviews are manually screened and voted on by the community to discourage spam and unhelpful comments.[5] G2 Crowd also requests screenshots of the reviewer using the product for verification purposes.[6]
Information from reviews is aggregated to score business software products on The GridSM, which acts as a competitor to Gartner’s magic quadrant review model. Satisfaction and market presence ratings are generated based on product reviews and market presence data, which are then used to plot products onto a quadrant. The four quadrants in a G2 Crowd Grid are Leaders, High Performers, Contenders and Niche.

Service[edit]
Business solution users sign in with a LinkedIn account and can review the products they use. To encourage reviewers to participate, some users are compensated by G2 Crowd with gift cards, contest rewards and reputation points on the website.[4] G2 Crowd attempts to identify fraudulent user reviews through an algorithm that identifies employees at companies reviewing their own products and employees at companies reviewing their competitor's product. In addition, reviews are manually screened and voted on by the community to discourage spam and unhelpful comments.[5] G2 Crowd also requests screenshots of the reviewer using the product for verification purposes.[6]
Information from reviews is aggregated to score business software products on The GridSM, which acts as a competitor to Gartner’s magic quadrant review model. Satisfaction and market presence ratings are generated based on product reviews and market presence data, which are then used to plot products onto a quadrant. The four quadrants in a G2 Crowd Grid are Leaders, High Performers, Contenders and Niche.
Research Reviews[edit]
The reviews submitted to G2 Crowd are available for public consumption. An individual researching software can build their profile and filter information provided by reviewers similar to themselves based on company size, user role and user industry.[6]
History[edit]
In 2011 five former employees of BigMachines – Tim Handorf, Godard Abel, Matt Gorniak, Mark Myers and Mike Wheeler – founded G2 Crowd, with Abel serving as president.[1][7] When Abel left to continue building Steelbrick (now Salesforce CPQ) with Salesforce, Handorf took over as CEO, a role he continues in today.
A beta version of the review site launched in December 2012, with several thousand users testing the service before its full launch in 2013.[4]
In February 2015, former LinkedIn executive, Adrienne Weissman joined G2 Crowd as the organization's new chief marketing officer.[8] G2 Crowd named Michael Fauscette as the organization’s chief research officer in February, 2016.[9]
Funding[edit]
In 2014, G2 Crowd raised $2.3 million in seed funding from investors, including Chicago Ventures, Hyde Park Venture Partners, Andrew Filipowski, and Greg Jones, founding CEO of uBid.[10] In 2015, G2 Crowd raised an additional $7 million in Series A funding led by Pritzker Group Venture Capital. Investors included 2014’s contributors in addition to co-founder Godard Abel, Thomas Lehrman and Scott Dorsey. G2 Crowd announced it would use these funds to invest in its leadership and capabilities.[11]
In 2017, G2 Crowd secured a $30 million Series B, led by VC Accel with participation from LinkedIn and the company's founders. The funds are being used to help the company expand into services. [12]
Significant Milestones[edit]
In December 2015, G2 Crowd surpassed 50,000 verified-user product reviews, more than 28,000 of which were submitted that year. The firm also reported that more than 3,000 reviews were submitted per month on average.[13] In January 2016, G2 Crowd reported more than 400,000 sessions per month, and includes more than 400 product categories.[14]
In September 2016, G2 Crowd reached more than 100,000 reviews. [15]
Awards[edit]
G2 Crowd has been nominated for and earned a number of awards since its founding for its growth and culture.

  About G2 Crowd






Our Company
G2 Crowd real-time and unbiased user reviews help you objectively assess what is best for your business. 
Until recently, selecting business solutions was hard, risky and inherently biased. G2 Crowd empowers business buying decisions by highlighting the voice of the customer. Our review platform leverages more than 170,000 independent and authenticated user reviews read by nearly 900,000 buyers each month. Our model brings transparency to B2B buying—changing the way decisions are made.
G2 Crowd’s mission is to provide the insights business professionals need to gain confidence in their buying decisions and become more successful in their jobs.
G2 Crowd is backed by $45M in capital from Accel, Prtizker Group, its founders and many industry leaders. See more.

Our VisionThe current approach to buying business technology is broken. Buyers spend too much time sifting through spin, reading outdated analyst reports, and sitting through endless meetings. After all this, buyers still lack confidence in their choice of technology and most projects fail to meet their expectations. By capturing collective wisdom, G2 Crowd will make purchasing business technology as easy as buying consumer products.
