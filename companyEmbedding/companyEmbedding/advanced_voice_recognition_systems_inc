A fourth patent (U.S. Patent No. 8,131,557) is an expansion of the coverage of AVRS’s second and third patents and incorporates speech recognition and transcription among transcription engines employing incompatible protocols for generating, transcribing, and exchanging speech among users employing incompatible protocols utilizing peer-to-peer networks, node-to-node networks, and the cloud. A fifth patent granted on July 30, 2013, (U.S. Patent No. 8,498,871) further expands on previous patents by covering free-form dictation in which recognition is dynamically constrained in response to the directed dictation field communicated to the transaction manager through a bi-directional communication path, so as to achieve highest accuracy.

 ADVANCED VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEMS, INC. (OTCMKTS:AVOI) Files An 8-K Termination of a Material Definitive AgreementItem 1.02.  Termination of Material Definitive Agreement
Advanced Voice Recognition Systems, Inc. (“AVRS”) and Dominion Harbor Group, LLC (“Dominion”)have agreed to terminate the August 20, 2015 letter agreement between them (the “Agreement”) effective as of June 28, 2017.   The parties mutually agreed to terminate the agreement.  AVRS did not incur any material early termination penalties in connection with the termination of the Agreement.
Under the Agreement, Dominion was providing strategic advisory services to AVRS with respect to AVRS’s intellectual property, including advising AVRS on opportunities to sell or license its intellectual property, and to prosecute and enforce AVRS’s intellectual property rights.   In exchange, AVRS agreed to pay Dominion 42.5% of the Net Consideration for the services, except that if proceeds were generated outside of litigation, the amount would have been 35% of the Net Consideration.  “Net Consideration” was defined in the Agreement to include the gross amount received from any licensing fee, litigation settlement, damages or other monetization event, net of any contingency fees of counsel recommended by Dominion and of any costs advanced by Dominion.  Because no proceeds were generated related to AVRS’s intellectual property rights during the term of the Agreement, AVRS is not responsible for any advanced costs paid by Dominion or any accrued counsel fees for litigation for any litigation counsel that may have been introduced to AVRS by Dominion.
The description of the Agreement above is only a summary of certain material terms of the Agreement. A copy of the Agreement was filed as Exhibit 10.1 to AVRS’s Report on Form 8-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on August 21, 2015.

  Advanced Voice Recognition Systems, Inc.  7659 E. Wood Drive  Scottsdale, AZ  85260   Telephone: 480-704-4183  Fax: 480-626-5378  E-mail: info@avrsys.com News: http://finance.yahoo.com/q/h?s=AVOI.OB+Headlines  SEC Filings: http://sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&CIK=0001342936&owner=exclude&count=40  Advanced Voice Recognition Systems, Inc. is a software development company based in Scottsdale, Arizona and is publicly traded under the symbol AVOI. Advanced Voice Recognition Systems specializes in creating interface and application solutions for speech recognition technologies. The speech recognition software and related firmware were first introduced in 1994 at an industry trade show. The company owns a portfolio of patents and patent-pending applications related to these technologies. The company's first patent #5,960,447 includes 42 claims that cover a wide array of features applicable to existing Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) products and markets. Advanced Voice Recognition Systems' second patent #7,558,530 covers features that the company believes are essential for client server based ASR products such as today's smartphones, language translation applications and large medical transcription systems. The company's first patent #5,960,447 includes 42 claims that cover a wide array of features applicable to existing Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) products and markets. Advanced Voice Recognition Systems' second patent #7,558,530 covers features that the company believes are essential for client server based ASR products such as today's smartphones, language translation applications and large medical transcription systems. United States Patent and Trademark Office Declares Interference Involving Advanced Voice Recognition Systems' Patent A patent interference is a proceeding conducted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in instances where two or more parties claim patent rights to the same technology. The U.S. patent system awards patents to the first party who invented a particular technology. In an interference, the primary purpose of the USPTO is to determine which party invented the technology first, and to award the patent to that party. On March 15, 2010, Advanced Voice Recognition Systems announced the declaration of interference by the USPTO. The USPTO declared the interference between Advanced Voice Recognition Systems' application serial number 09/351,542 as Senior Party and U.S. Patent #5,799,273 owned by Allvoice Developments, LTD as Junior Party. AVOI's patent was filed on November 13, 1995 approximately 10 months before the Allvoice filing. On January 13, 2011, Oblon Spivak of Alexandria Virginia, representing AVRS in the Interference proceedings between Allvoice Developments and AVRS, Inc., delivered oral arguments before a three judge panel of the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences (BPAI). The Company hopes to receive a timely decision. The Allvoice patent is the subject of a lawsuit that Allvoice filed against Microsoft in August 2009 in the East District Court of Texas in which Allvoice alleged infringement of Allvoices' patent. Microsoft filed invalidity contentions based in part on Advanced Voice Recognition Systems' patent and its product Digital Dictate. Advanced Voice Recognition Systems' principal assets are the patents. The business strategy will be to attempt to interest other companies in entering into license agreements or other strategic relationships and to enforce and defend its patents through infringement and interference proceedings, as appropriate.
