EcoStim Energy Solutions - Field Management


































OverviewField ManagementWell Stimulation + Completion




Field Management // Where Smart And Profitable Overlap
HomeServicesField Management 






With EcoStim Energy Solutions’ Field Management System, we have created a revolutionary methodology for reducing costs, improving efficiencies and increasing resource-recovery rates.


Geophysical Prediction Tools



Our suite of advanced but fully commercialized technologies can be combined to build confidence in the geophysical predictive models we provide our clients. These proprietary, cost-effective, and extremely efficient Geo-Predict® techniques, which include our sliding sleeves and permanent fiber-optic diagnostic monitoring systems, can help customers target their well-completion operations on the sweet spots, allowing for a potentially significant reduction in the number of stimulation stages to be executed. This methodology has the potential to lower production cost while reducing the environmental impact at the same time.





Fiber Optics


 


Through EcoStim’s fiber-optic monitoring and other diagnostic tools, we are able to precisely verify wellbore cement integrity to minimize the risk of any possible contamination of aquifers or surface water. We can also monitor the stimulation operation in real time and production characteristics over the life of the well including the ability to measure information from each stimulation stage.





Pinpoint Well Stimulation

Coil-tubing deployed
No pump-down plugs, actuating balls or perforating guns
Five minutes between hydraulic stimulations
Uses up to 20 percent less water
Add stages on the fly with jet perforating
No components to retrieve and no plugs or ball seats to drill out after stimulation
More reliable than any other multi-stage system

The EcoStim Geo-Predict® workflow allows integration of geo-mechanics, geology and geophysics to engineer and optimize well design parameters.
EcoStim provide tools for operators to adjust stage location, stage spacing, well placement and stimulation programs. In addition to optimized completions this enhanced simulation capability allows for better controls in selecting stimulation locations, determining well spacing and estimating EUR.
Key Features
Predict microseismicity
Predict energy at each frac stage and use it in completion optimization
Predict and validate proppant distribution
Predict asymmetric half-length fractures for frac-design software
Predicted stimulated permeabiliy in SRV for reservoir simulator

Fiber-Optic Monitoring
HomeTechnologiesFiber Optics 








 


Through EcoStim Energy Solutions’ permanent fiber-optic monitoring, we are able to verify wellbore-cement integrity to minimize the risk of disastrous contamination of aquifers and surface water. When using our sliding-sleeve system, producers can also monitor the stimulation operation in real time and also measure the type and quantity of inflow from each stimulation stage over the life of the well. We also offer a temporary monitoring program that does not require sleeves but still provides the same flow properties achieved with the permanent monitoring process. The economic benefits achieved by using less water and power are substantial. Combined with our GeoPredict solutions, which can reduce the number of necessary stages by as much as two-thirds, savings can multiply dramatically.

As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
