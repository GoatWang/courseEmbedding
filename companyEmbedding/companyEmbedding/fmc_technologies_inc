ProductsWe install products from manufacturers that adhere to open–protocol standards as their primary communications protocol.  LonWorks and BACnet are the two most popular open-protocols used in the HVAC industry today. 
 
FMC Technologies is an advocate of open standards for control systems.  Open protocols allow for everyday devices to be smart, completely open, able to communicate with one another and compatible with the Internet.  Open protocols allow flexibility to meet the requirements of all industries, and all manufacturers within the industries.  By choosing an open system, customers have the flexibility to choose products from various manufacturers when upgrading.  This results in lower costs because they are not locked into one system.
