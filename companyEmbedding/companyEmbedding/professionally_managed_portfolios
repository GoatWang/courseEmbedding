How are my accounts protected?



Ally Invest Securities, LLC, is a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), which provides protection for accounts up to $500,000 (including $250,000 for claims of cash) per client as defined by SIPC rules. Visit http://www.sipc.org/for-investors/what-sipc-protects for more information or call 1-202-371-8300.
Our clearing firm, Apex Clearing, has also purchased an additional insurance policy through a group of London Underwriters (with Lloyd's of London Syndicates as the Lead Underwriter) to supplement SIPC protection. This additional insurance policy becomes available to customers in the event that SIPC limits are exhausted and provides protection for securities and cash up to an aggregate of $150 million. This insurance is provided to pay amounts in addition to those returned in a SIPC liquidation proceeding. This additional insurance policy is limited to a combined return to any customer from a Trustee, SIPC and London Underwriters of $37.5 million, including cash of up to $900,000. Like SIPC protection, this additional insurance does not protect against a loss in the market value of securities.

About options:
An option is a contract that gives you the right to buy or sell an underlying asset at a future date. When you purchase an option, you’re reserving the

About ETFs:
An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a more diversified investment that trades like a stock but pools the money of many investors to purchase a group of assets such as stocks, bonds, foreign currency or commodities. Some of the most popular
                ETFs offer a type of index investment, where the manager seeks to track the performance of a specific index such as the Dow Jones or S&P 500. There are a few types of high risk ETFs such as leveraged and inverse which are short-term,
                higher-risk investments that should only be implemented by experienced traders.

About bonds:
A bond is a form of debt security in which an investor lends money to an entity in return for interest. The bond acts as an IOU — once it matures, the bond issuer pays you back the money, plus interest.
Each bond has unique characteristics that investors need to understand prior to purchase. Generally, the higher the interest rate, the riskier the investment.

In foreign exchange trade, you buy one currency while simultaneously selling another — that is, you're exchanging the sold currency for the one you're buying. The foreign exchange market is an over-the-counter market, which means
                trading doesn’t take place on one of the formal exchanges. Keep in mind that forex trading involves significant risk and is not suitable for all investors.

                  change in price as of the delivery date. Keep in mind that futures trading involves significant risk and is not suitable for all investors.

Can I transfer my account from another broker?



Yes. You can fund your Ally Invest account by transferring assets from another brokerage firm.
You'll need to submit an asset transfer request form (ACAT form).
We'll also need a recent statement for the account that you want to transfer. You can fax the documents to us at 1-855-880-25591-855-880-2559, or you can send them by mail to one of the following addresses:
Ally Invest Securities

P.O. Box 49050

Charlotte, NC 28277-3432
For overnight deliveries, mail to:
Ally Invest Securities

11605 N Community House Rd

Third Floor

Charlotte, NC 28277
Account transfers normally complete in 5 to 7 business days. Keep in mind, the account at the other broker and account you have with us must be the same kind (such as individual, joint or IRA).
After an account transfer processes, some assets may remain in the account at the carrying firm. This is quite common, for example, with interests that were not yet in the account at the carrying firm when the transfer completed. To make sure your transfer is complete, our clearing firm performs automatic residual sweeps every 2 weeks to transfer what might have not transferred the first time around.
We do not charge for incoming ACAT account transfers. There may be a fee for other types of transfers.

How are my accounts protected?



Ally Invest Securities, LLC, is a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), which provides protection for accounts up to $500,000 (including $250,000 for claims of cash) per client as defined by SIPC rules. Visit http://www.sipc.org/for-investors/what-sipc-protects for more information or call 1-202-371-8300.
Our clearing firm, Apex Clearing, has also purchased an additional insurance policy through a group of London Underwriters (with Lloyd's of London Syndicates as the Lead Underwriter) to supplement SIPC protection. This additional insurance policy becomes available to customers in the event that SIPC limits are exhausted and provides protection for securities and cash up to an aggregate of $150 million. This insurance is provided to pay amounts in addition to those returned in a SIPC liquidation proceeding. This additional insurance policy is limited to a combined return to any customer from a Trustee, SIPC and London Underwriters of $37.5 million, including cash of up to $900,000. Like SIPC protection, this additional insurance does not protect against a loss in the market value of securities.

What is an actively managed portfolio? | Ameriprise Financial



Skip to main content























What you need to know about actively managed portfolios


Key Points

If an investment professional is making frequent decisions to buy and sell certain investments on your behalf, then your portfolio is being actively managed.
Passively managed portfolios, on the other hand, typically track an index.
Your investment goals and risk tolerance may dictate the best approach for your portfolio.







Basically, “actively managed” means that your money is being handled by a professional money manager, co-managers or a team of managers who are making decisions on what investments to buy, hold and sell. Managers use a variety of tools, including Wall Street research, forecasts and their own judgment to make these decisions. This is different from passive investing that usually refers to investments that follow a particular market index or group of indices.
Some investing companies take active management a step further and create a special diversified product with an eye toward asset allocation and specific investing goals. These managers choose a group of mutual funds and/or exchange traded funds in a variety of asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, international securities and real estate to create the asset allocation that is tailored toward a particular individual’s needs and goals.
Advantages and disadvantages of actively managed portfolios
Active management can give you access to investment professionals who often strive to manage risk and limit portfolio volatility with the goal of delivering a more consistent return over time. They may also rebalance the portfolio on a regular basis to help stay in line with the original investing goals.
As with any investment, there are risks from market and economic volatility as well as other factors that may be difficult to predict. But, many actively managed portfolios use a diverse mix of investments and asset classes that together help manage risk. When one sector of the portfolio is lagging, others may be thriving. Professional managers are also often able to move in and out of risky or overly volatile sectors far more easily than individual investors.
Is an actively managed portfolio right for you?
If you’re focused on generating income in your portfolio, protecting your assets and creating enough growth to see you through 30 or more years of retirement, then an actively managed portfolio may be a good option for you. Many active managers focus on providing growth and income while managing risk. But, before you choose active management for your portfolio, make sure this investment strategy aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

Schwab Managed Portfolios ™ - How do we manage risk?
Managing risk is about more than timing moves in and out of the market.  At Charles Schwab Investment Advisory, Inc., (CSIA) we believe that risk management begins with asset allocation. .





Transcript

Jim Peterson: At Charles Schwab Investment Advisory, managing risk is not just about making big timing moves in and out of the market. 

In fact, timing like that can add risk to a portfolio, not lessen it. 
 
Risk management in our portfolios begins with asset allocation - that is, how we spread the portfolio across different types of investments and around the globe. 

And, we build that asset allocation for today's world; not the markets of the 90's or early 2000's. 

We do this by investing in US stocks and bonds as well as international stocks and bonds. 

We invest in real assets such as gold, industrial metals, and US as well as international real estate. 

Each of these investments is designed to tap into a specific source of risk or return. 

The reason we use these broad groups of investments is because the risk in more traditional investment strategies tends to be driven almost entirely by equity risk - that is, the risk is coming from the stock portion of the portfolio. 

So, even in a traditional balanced portfolio of 60% stocks and 40% bonds we have found that up to 99% of the risk - or 99% of variability in returns - comes from traditional stocks. 

This factor alone can cause a pretty rocky ride for investors that we seek to smooth out. 

So when we build a balanced portfolio today we use an expanded set of investments that give investors exposure to multiple sources of risk and return. 

This is key, and to us the most important factor when it comes to managing risk.

        The Use of Professionally Managed Portfolios Projected to Reach 75% by 2021
      

          The use of automatic features has also benefited participants, Vanguard says.

Vanguard expects that the use of professionally managed portfolios,
which are currently employed by more than half of its participants today, will
reach 75% by 2021. Furthermore, the skyrocketing use of automatic features in
the past 10 years has meaningfully benefited participation rates, savings rates
and balanced asset allocation strategies, according to Vanguard’s report, "How
America Saves 2017." Ninety-seven percent of participants received a company
match in 2016, Vanguard found.
“DC plans have evolved to become a pillar of retirement savings for millions of
Americans, and plan sponsors have responded by building plans that encourage
employees to participate, save more and invest appropriately,” says Martha
King, managing director of Vanguard’s Institutional Investor Group.
Nearly half of plans automatically enroll their workers into their retirement
plan—a 300% increase in the past 10 years. Plans that automatically enroll
participants report a 90% participation rate. Among plans that automatically
enroll and leave that decision up to the participant, 79% of workers
participate in their 401(k) plan, a 16% increase from 2007.In addition, plans that automatically enroll participants at
a 4% or higher deferral rate have doubled to 48%, and plans that have an
automatic deferral rate of 6% or higher have tripled to 20%. Ninety-seven
percent of plans that automatically enroll participants use a target-date fund (TDF) as the qualified default investment alternative (QDIA).Furthermore, the percentage of participants who are invested
exclusively in equities has dropped from 17% in 2007 to 6% in 2016. Also, fewer
than 10% of participants made a change to their portfolio last year.The full, 110-page How America Saves 2017 can be downloaded

There are both pros of mutual funds and cons of mutual funds. Let’s take a look at a few of the pros of mutual funds and what they may offer the novice and experienced investor alike.

        	Diversify and grow your assets.
        Getty Images
    


Investment diversification is a risk management strategy. In order to implement an investment diversification strategy, an investor will buy investments that have different risk/reward characteristics.
The most basic investment diversification strategy will include both stocks and bonds (either through mutual funds or direct purchase of stocks and/or bonds). Adding various stocks to a portfolio adds investment diversification in the sense that if one stock performs poorly, then you may have another stock that does well. By adding bonds to a portfolio, an investor will achieve even greater investment diversification.
The greatest investment diversification may be accomplished by adding stocks of differing market caps (large cap, mid cap and small cap) and by adding various types of bonds (from municipal bonds to corporate bonds).
Investment diversification is a great advantage of mutual funds. This investment diversification of a mutual fund means that an investor is able to obtain instant access to a hundreds of individual stocks or bonds with a low minimum investment. Otherwise, in order add investment diversification to your portfolio, you might have to buy dozens of individual stocks and bonds.
In different words, an investor can achieve diversification with just one or two mutual funds, depending upon the type of fund.

Mutual funds are professionally managed portfolios. Many investors don’t have the resources or the time to buy individual stocks so they turn to these professionally managed portfolios.
Most investors have careers, families, hobbies, and/or other interests that consume their time. In contrast, mutual fund managers and analysts wake up each morning dedicating their professional lives to researching and analyzing current and potential holdings for their mutual fund. If you prefer to enjoy your time rather than pour over financial data, then use professionally managed portfolios.

The various types of mutual funds are an advantage of this structure of investment. Investors can diversify their portfolio by looking no further than mutual funds.
Whether you need to add large cap equities, international equities or bonds to your portfolio, you are able to do so with mutual funds. There are even target date funds that will hold various types of mutual funds all wrapped into one.
Therefore investors can easily build a diversified portfolio with just three to five mutual funds from different categories, such as large-cap stock, small-cap stock, international stock, and bonds.

How are my accounts protected?



Ally Invest Securities, LLC, is a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), which provides protection for accounts up to $500,000 (including $250,000 for claims of cash) per client as defined by SIPC rules. Visit http://www.sipc.org/for-investors/what-sipc-protects for more information or call 1-202-371-8300.
Our clearing firm, Apex Clearing, has also purchased an additional insurance policy through a group of London Underwriters (with Lloyd's of London Syndicates as the Lead Underwriter) to supplement SIPC protection. This additional insurance policy becomes available to customers in the event that SIPC limits are exhausted and provides protection for securities and cash up to an aggregate of $150 million. This insurance is provided to pay amounts in addition to those returned in a SIPC liquidation proceeding. This additional insurance policy is limited to a combined return to any customer from a Trustee, SIPC and London Underwriters of $37.5 million, including cash of up to $900,000. Like SIPC protection, this additional insurance does not protect against a loss in the market value of securities.

About ETFs:
An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a more diversified investment that trades like a stock but pools the money of many investors to purchase a group of assets such as stocks, bonds, foreign currency or commodities. Some of the most popular
                ETFs offer a type of index investment, where the manager seeks to track the performance of a specific index such as the Dow Jones or S&P 500. There are a few types of high risk ETFs such as leveraged and inverse which are short-term,
                higher-risk investments that should only be implemented by experienced traders.

About bonds:
A bond is a form of debt security in which an investor lends money to an entity in return for interest. The bond acts as an IOU — once it matures, the bond issuer pays you back the money, plus interest.
Each bond has unique characteristics that investors need to understand prior to purchase. Generally, the higher the interest rate, the riskier the investment.

                trading doesn’t take place on one of the formal exchanges. Keep in mind that forex trading involves significant risk and is not suitable for all investors.

About futures:
Futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell a commodity or asset at a set price on a future date. The price is determined by supply and demand in the marketplace at the time of the contract, with the investor anticipating a favorable
                  change in price as of the delivery date. Keep in mind that futures trading involves significant risk and is not suitable for all investors.

Can I transfer my account from another broker?



Yes. You can fund your Ally Invest account by transferring assets from another brokerage firm.
You'll need to submit an asset transfer request form (ACAT form).
We'll also need a recent statement for the account that you want to transfer. You can fax the documents to us at 1-855-880-25591-855-880-2559, or you can send them by mail to one of the following addresses:
Ally Invest Securities

P.O. Box 49050

Charlotte, NC 28277-3432
For overnight deliveries, mail to:
Ally Invest Securities

11605 N Community House Rd

Third Floor

Charlotte, NC 28277
Account transfers normally complete in 5 to 7 business days. Keep in mind, the account at the other broker and account you have with us must be the same kind (such as individual, joint or IRA).
After an account transfer processes, some assets may remain in the account at the carrying firm. This is quite common, for example, with interests that were not yet in the account at the carrying firm when the transfer completed. To make sure your transfer is complete, our clearing firm performs automatic residual sweeps every 2 weeks to transfer what might have not transferred the first time around.
We do not charge for incoming ACAT account transfers. There may be a fee for other types of transfers.

How are my accounts protected?



Ally Invest Securities, LLC, is a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), which provides protection for accounts up to $500,000 (including $250,000 for claims of cash) per client as defined by SIPC rules. Visit http://www.sipc.org/for-investors/what-sipc-protects for more information or call 1-202-371-8300.
Our clearing firm, Apex Clearing, has also purchased an additional insurance policy through a group of London Underwriters (with Lloyd's of London Syndicates as the Lead Underwriter) to supplement SIPC protection. This additional insurance policy becomes available to customers in the event that SIPC limits are exhausted and provides protection for securities and cash up to an aggregate of $150 million. This insurance is provided to pay amounts in addition to those returned in a SIPC liquidation proceeding. This additional insurance policy is limited to a combined return to any customer from a Trustee, SIPC and London Underwriters of $37.5 million, including cash of up to $900,000. Like SIPC protection, this additional insurance does not protect against a loss in the market value of securities.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
