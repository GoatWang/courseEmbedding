Michael McCurdy 




Michael McCurdy is an award-winning artist, illustrator, author and publisher who worked from his red barn studio in the hills of Great Barrington for twenty-five years before retiring to Springfield, Massachusetts.
 
Born in New York City in 1942 and raised in New Rochelle, New York and Marblehead, Massachusetts, he attended the school of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston (which provided him with a traveling scholarship in 1966), and Tufts University in Medford.  Since then, McCurdy has produced an impressive collection of wood engravings, etchings and drawings which have appeared in over 200 books for both adults and children and at art galleries and museums nationwide.
 
From 1968-1985, under the auspices of Penmaen Press Books, Michael published many small-press first editions for leading American and European writers and poets, including William Saroyan, Joyce Carol Oates, Howard Norman, William Stafford, Allen Ginsberg, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, and the Nobel Prize-winning poet Vicente Aleixandre. He has also authored numerous publications himself, including his most recent book, An Algonquian Year: The Year According to the Full Moon.
 
McCurdy’s distinctive drawings, etchings and woodcarvings range from depictions of rural life to interpretations of historical events to whimsical scenes of fantasy. Compositions often include human or animal figures juxtaposed against magnificent vistas of land, sea, sky and water, conveying a powerful yet meditative sense of awe and reverence for nature.
 
Well known for works in black and white, McCurdy has also produced colored scratchboard drawings and paintings of acrylic and casein. He has passed on his skill to others through various adult printmaking courses and has taught at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and Concord Academy in Concord.
 
Mr. McCurdy has been the recipient of numerous awards and accolades, twice receiving the New York Times Best Illustrated Books Award. He has been featured in Who's Who in American Art, Who's Who in America, Contemporary Authors, and Something About the Author. He will be listed in a new edition of Major Authors and Illustrators for Children and Young Adults and will be included in the next edition of Anita Silvey's Children's Books and Their Creators.
 
Michael has served  on the Housing Authority and on the Arts Lottery Commission in Great Barrington.

Biography[edit]
Michael McCurdy was born in New York City in 1942 and grew up in New Rochelle, New York and Marblehead, Massachusetts. As a young boy, he was inspired by illustrator Lynd Ward, writing him a fan letter in his teen years that evolved into a lifelong friendship and collaboration. He also developed an interest in hand-printing, thanks to a toy printing press that he received as a present at the age of twelve.
From 1960 to 1966, McCurdy attended the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, Massachusetts, where he completed his first wood engraving in 1963 and met his longtime friend and collaborator Robert Hauser. While he was at the Museum School, his roommate was David M. McPhail, the well-known children's book author and illustrator. Another future children's book illustrator, Wallace Tripp, was also in the printmaking department. At Tufts University, McCurdy earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1964 and a Master of Fine Arts in 1971. He served as an Instructor at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts from 1966-1967, at Concord Academy from 1972-1975, and at Wellesley College Library Rare Book Print Lab from 1975-1976.
A conscientious objector during the Vietnam War, McCurdy worked for two years as an orderly in the orthopedic ward at Children's Hospital in Boston to fulfill his alternative service. He married Deborath Lamb McCurdy on September 7, 1968. When he was released from hospital duty in 1969, he and his wife used his Museum of Fine Arts award of a traveling fellowship to spend nearly five months traveling throughout Europe and the Soviet Union.
In the following years, the couple raised their two children in Lincoln and Great Barrington, Massachusetts. They are now retired and living in Springfield, Massachusetts.
Penmaen Press[edit]
McCurdy founded Penmaen Press in Boston, Massachusetts in 1968 and continued production in Lincoln and Great Barrington. Penmaen Press published many high quality literary works, including first-edition poetry, fiction, and translation by leading American and European writers and poets. These writers included William Saroyan, Joyce Carol Oates, Howard Norman, William Stafford, Allen Ginsberg, Richard Eberhart, Robert Steiner, William Ferguson; and the Nobel Prize winning poet Vicente Aleixandre.
Penmaen Press also produced broadsides of poems by May Sarton, Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Allen Ginsberg. A limited edition broadside of “Moloch” (taken from Allen Ginsburg’s poem Howl) was illustrated by Lynd Ward in 1978.
In 1984, McCurdy and Robert Hauser formed a partnership to produce Face to Face: Twelve Contemporary American Artists Interpret Themselves in a Limited Edition of Original Wood Engravings. Engravers who submitted self-portraits for this were McCurdy, Fred Becker, Jack Coughlin, John DePol, Fritz Eichenberg, Raymond Gloeckler, James Grashow, Judith Jaidinger, Stefan Martin, Barry Moser, Gillian Tyler, and Herbert Waters.
Penmaen Press was discontinued in 1985, as McCurdy devoted himself increasingly to writing and illustrating trade books, as well as limited editions for other publishers.
He died on 28 May 2016 at the age of 74.[2]
Works[edit]
Throughout his career, McCurdy has illustrated books, greeting cards, corporate commissions, and logos (including those for The New Yankee Workshop and Martha Stewart). McCurdy's wood engravings and drawings are found in trade books for both adults and children and in fine limited editions. Books of note for which McCurdy provided illustrations include The Man Who Planted Trees by Jean Giono (1985), an illustrated version of The Gettysburg Address by Abraham Lincoln (1995), American Tall Tales by Mary Pope Osborne (1991), Lucy’s Summer and Lucy’s Christmas by United States Poet Laureate Donald Hall, and a limited edition of American Buffalo by David Mamet (1992). He has also designed and illustrated the John Muir Library Series for Sierra Club Books. Throughout his career, McCurdy has illustrated several books and items relating to Walden by Henry David Thoreau, including a sesquicentennial edition published in 2004 with 50 new wood engravings.
McCurdy has also authored numerous books, including Toward the Light (a collection of his wood engravings with accompanying anecdotes, published in Canada), The Illustrated Harvard: Harvard University in Wood Engravings and Words, The Devils Who Learned to be Good, Hannah's Farm: The Seasons on an Early American Homestead, The Old Man and the Fiddle, Trapped by the Ice: Shackleton's Amazing Antarctic Adventure and An Algonquian Year: The Year According to the Full Moon. He edited and illustrated an abridged version of the first autobiography of Frederick Douglass, renamed Escape from Slavery: The Boyhood of Frederick Douglass in His Own Words, published in 1994.
Awards[edit]
Howard Norman's The Owl-Scatterer included McCurdy’s engravings and book design and was chosen by the New York Times as one of the Ten Best Illustrated Children's Books of 1986. Ann Whitford Paul's book The Seasons Sewn: The Year in Patchwork received the same recognition from the Times in 1996.
McCurdy’s collection of engravings, Toward the Light, was awarded the Bronze Medal in an international book exhibition in Leipzig in 1983. Other books have received awards from the New England Book Show and the American Institute of Graphic Arts.
McCurdy was elected a member of the Boston Society of Printers in 1971 and was selected as a Literary Light by the Boston Public Library in 2002.
Giants in the Land, a children's picture book that McCurdy illustrated with black and white scratchboard, won numerous prizes.
Archives[edit]
The main archive of McCurdy's work as an author and illustrator, covering a period of 48 years, is housed in the Boston Public Library. Original work, dating from McCurdy's first wood engraving in 1962 to later work for both adults and children, is included along with correspondence with authors and publishers, initial sketches, proofs, and wood blocks.
McCurdy’s Penmaen Press archive is housed in the Thomas J. Dodd Research Center, University of Connecticut, Storrs. The UCONN archive preserves books and ephemera printed and published at McCurdy's Penmaen Press from 1969 to 1985. The work includes first-edition books of poetry, fiction and translation, as well as correspondence.

Biography[edit]
Michael McCurdy was born in New York City in 1942 and grew up in New Rochelle, New York and Marblehead, Massachusetts. As a young boy, he was inspired by illustrator Lynd Ward, writing him a fan letter in his teen years that evolved into a lifelong friendship and collaboration. He also developed an interest in hand-printing, thanks to a toy printing press that he received as a present at the age of twelve.
From 1960 to 1966, McCurdy attended the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, Massachusetts, where he completed his first wood engraving in 1963 and met his longtime friend and collaborator Robert Hauser. While he was at the Museum School, his roommate was David M. McPhail, the well-known children's book author and illustrator. Another future children's book illustrator, Wallace Tripp, was also in the printmaking department. At Tufts University, McCurdy earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1964 and a Master of Fine Arts in 1971. He served as an Instructor at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts from 1966-1967, at Concord Academy from 1972-1975, and at Wellesley College Library Rare Book Print Lab from 1975-1976.
A conscientious objector during the Vietnam War, McCurdy worked for two years as an orderly in the orthopedic ward at Children's Hospital in Boston to fulfill his alternative service. He married Deborath Lamb McCurdy on September 7, 1968. When he was released from hospital duty in 1969, he and his wife used his Museum of Fine Arts award of a traveling fellowship to spend nearly five months traveling throughout Europe and the Soviet Union.
In the following years, the couple raised their two children in Lincoln and Great Barrington, Massachusetts. They are now retired and living in Springfield, Massachusetts.
Penmaen Press[edit]
McCurdy founded Penmaen Press in Boston, Massachusetts in 1968 and continued production in Lincoln and Great Barrington. Penmaen Press published many high quality literary works, including first-edition poetry, fiction, and translation by leading American and European writers and poets. These writers included William Saroyan, Joyce Carol Oates, Howard Norman, William Stafford, Allen Ginsberg, Richard Eberhart, Robert Steiner, William Ferguson; and the Nobel Prize winning poet Vicente Aleixandre.
Penmaen Press also produced broadsides of poems by May Sarton, Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Allen Ginsberg. A limited edition broadside of “Moloch” (taken from Allen Ginsburg’s poem Howl) was illustrated by Lynd Ward in 1978.
In 1984, McCurdy and Robert Hauser formed a partnership to produce Face to Face: Twelve Contemporary American Artists Interpret Themselves in a Limited Edition of Original Wood Engravings. Engravers who submitted self-portraits for this were McCurdy, Fred Becker, Jack Coughlin, John DePol, Fritz Eichenberg, Raymond Gloeckler, James Grashow, Judith Jaidinger, Stefan Martin, Barry Moser, Gillian Tyler, and Herbert Waters.
Penmaen Press was discontinued in 1985, as McCurdy devoted himself increasingly to writing and illustrating trade books, as well as limited editions for other publishers.
He died on 28 May 2016 at the age of 74.[2]
Works[edit]
Throughout his career, McCurdy has illustrated books, greeting cards, corporate commissions, and logos (including those for The New Yankee Workshop and Martha Stewart). McCurdy's wood engravings and drawings are found in trade books for both adults and children and in fine limited editions. Books of note for which McCurdy provided illustrations include The Man Who Planted Trees by Jean Giono (1985), an illustrated version of The Gettysburg Address by Abraham Lincoln (1995), American Tall Tales by Mary Pope Osborne (1991), Lucy’s Summer and Lucy’s Christmas by United States Poet Laureate Donald Hall, and a limited edition of American Buffalo by David Mamet (1992). He has also designed and illustrated the John Muir Library Series for Sierra Club Books. Throughout his career, McCurdy has illustrated several books and items relating to Walden by Henry David Thoreau, including a sesquicentennial edition published in 2004 with 50 new wood engravings.
McCurdy has also authored numerous books, including Toward the Light (a collection of his wood engravings with accompanying anecdotes, published in Canada), The Illustrated Harvard: Harvard University in Wood Engravings and Words, The Devils Who Learned to be Good, Hannah's Farm: The Seasons on an Early American Homestead, The Old Man and the Fiddle, Trapped by the Ice: Shackleton's Amazing Antarctic Adventure and An Algonquian Year: The Year According to the Full Moon. He edited and illustrated an abridged version of the first autobiography of Frederick Douglass, renamed Escape from Slavery: The Boyhood of Frederick Douglass in His Own Words, published in 1994.

Howard Norman's The Owl-Scatterer included McCurdy’s engravings and book design and was chosen by the New York Times as one of the Ten Best Illustrated Children's Books of 1986. Ann Whitford Paul's book The Seasons Sewn: The Year in Patchwork received the same recognition from the Times in 1996.
McCurdy’s collection of engravings, Toward the Light, was awarded the Bronze Medal in an international book exhibition in Leipzig in 1983. Other books have received awards from the New England Book Show and the American Institute of Graphic Arts.

Biography[edit]
Michael McCurdy was born in New York City in 1942 and grew up in New Rochelle, New York and Marblehead, Massachusetts. As a young boy, he was inspired by illustrator Lynd Ward, writing him a fan letter in his teen years that evolved into a lifelong friendship and collaboration. He also developed an interest in hand-printing, thanks to a toy printing press that he received as a present at the age of twelve.
From 1960 to 1966, McCurdy attended the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, Massachusetts, where he completed his first wood engraving in 1963 and met his longtime friend and collaborator Robert Hauser. While he was at the Museum School, his roommate was David M. McPhail, the well-known children's book author and illustrator. Another future children's book illustrator, Wallace Tripp, was also in the printmaking department. At Tufts University, McCurdy earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1964 and a Master of Fine Arts in 1971. He served as an Instructor at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts from 1966-1967, at Concord Academy from 1972-1975, and at Wellesley College Library Rare Book Print Lab from 1975-1976.
A conscientious objector during the Vietnam War, McCurdy worked for two years as an orderly in the orthopedic ward at Children's Hospital in Boston to fulfill his alternative service. He married Deborath Lamb McCurdy on September 7, 1968. When he was released from hospital duty in 1969, he and his wife used his Museum of Fine Arts award of a traveling fellowship to spend nearly five months traveling throughout Europe and the Soviet Union.
In the following years, the couple raised their two children in Lincoln and Great Barrington, Massachusetts. They are now retired and living in Springfield, Massachusetts.
Penmaen Press[edit]
McCurdy founded Penmaen Press in Boston, Massachusetts in 1968 and continued production in Lincoln and Great Barrington. Penmaen Press published many high quality literary works, including first-edition poetry, fiction, and translation by leading American and European writers and poets. These writers included William Saroyan, Joyce Carol Oates, Howard Norman, William Stafford, Allen Ginsberg, Richard Eberhart, Robert Steiner, William Ferguson; and the Nobel Prize winning poet Vicente Aleixandre.
Penmaen Press also produced broadsides of poems by May Sarton, Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Allen Ginsberg. A limited edition broadside of “Moloch” (taken from Allen Ginsburg’s poem Howl) was illustrated by Lynd Ward in 1978.
In 1984, McCurdy and Robert Hauser formed a partnership to produce Face to Face: Twelve Contemporary American Artists Interpret Themselves in a Limited Edition of Original Wood Engravings. Engravers who submitted self-portraits for this were McCurdy, Fred Becker, Jack Coughlin, John DePol, Fritz Eichenberg, Raymond Gloeckler, James Grashow, Judith Jaidinger, Stefan Martin, Barry Moser, Gillian Tyler, and Herbert Waters.
Penmaen Press was discontinued in 1985, as McCurdy devoted himself increasingly to writing and illustrating trade books, as well as limited editions for other publishers.
He died on 28 May 2016 at the age of 74.[2]
Works[edit]
Throughout his career, McCurdy has illustrated books, greeting cards, corporate commissions, and logos (including those for The New Yankee Workshop and Martha Stewart). McCurdy's wood engravings and drawings are found in trade books for both adults and children and in fine limited editions. Books of note for which McCurdy provided illustrations include The Man Who Planted Trees by Jean Giono (1985), an illustrated version of The Gettysburg Address by Abraham Lincoln (1995), American Tall Tales by Mary Pope Osborne (1991), Lucy’s Summer and Lucy’s Christmas by United States Poet Laureate Donald Hall, and a limited edition of American Buffalo by David Mamet (1992). He has also designed and illustrated the John Muir Library Series for Sierra Club Books. Throughout his career, McCurdy has illustrated several books and items relating to Walden by Henry David Thoreau, including a sesquicentennial edition published in 2004 with 50 new wood engravings.
McCurdy has also authored numerous books, including Toward the Light (a collection of his wood engravings with accompanying anecdotes, published in Canada), The Illustrated Harvard: Harvard University in Wood Engravings and Words, The Devils Who Learned to be Good, Hannah's Farm: The Seasons on an Early American Homestead, The Old Man and the Fiddle, Trapped by the Ice: Shackleton's Amazing Antarctic Adventure and An Algonquian Year: The Year According to the Full Moon. He edited and illustrated an abridged version of the first autobiography of Frederick Douglass, renamed Escape from Slavery: The Boyhood of Frederick Douglass in His Own Words, published in 1994.
Awards[edit]
Howard Norman's The Owl-Scatterer included McCurdy’s engravings and book design and was chosen by the New York Times as one of the Ten Best Illustrated Children's Books of 1986. Ann Whitford Paul's book The Seasons Sewn: The Year in Patchwork received the same recognition from the Times in 1996.
McCurdy’s collection of engravings, Toward the Light, was awarded the Bronze Medal in an international book exhibition in Leipzig in 1983. Other books have received awards from the New England Book Show and the American Institute of Graphic Arts.
McCurdy was elected a member of the Boston Society of Printers in 1971 and was selected as a Literary Light by the Boston Public Library in 2002.
Giants in the Land, a children's picture book that McCurdy illustrated with black and white scratchboard, won numerous prizes.
Archives[edit]
The main archive of McCurdy's work as an author and illustrator, covering a period of 48 years, is housed in the Boston Public Library. Original work, dating from McCurdy's first wood engraving in 1962 to later work for both adults and children, is included along with correspondence with authors and publishers, initial sketches, proofs, and wood blocks.
McCurdy’s Penmaen Press archive is housed in the Thomas J. Dodd Research Center, University of Connecticut, Storrs. The UCONN archive preserves books and ephemera printed and published at McCurdy's Penmaen Press from 1969 to 1985. The work includes first-edition books of poetry, fiction and translation, as well as correspondence.

About McCurdy Construction & Remodel - Phoenix, AZ
























































 
 








ABOUT MICHAEL MCCURDY
In late 2007, Michael McCurdy decided to bring his years of construction experience together to form McCurdy Construction in Arizona. Mike likes to work closely with his clients to come up with the best remodeling solution for each customers individual needs. This may sound quite obvious but in Mike’s experience, each project should be considered its own individual situation which has its own problems to be solved and hurdles to overcome.
What has worked on one project in the past may not work on another. Communication with his clients, attention to detail and excellent workmanship standards all come together to bring any project, big or small to completion on time and within budget. That is what this company is all about.
Mike will make a point to listen to your desires and needs for your home. After your initial needs are addressed, he will design the perfect solution for your remodeling project. McCurdy Construction specializes in Residential and Small Commercial Remodeling in Phoenix Arizona.
Mike likes to say that whatever construction service your home or business needs he can take care of it for you. Your project is our obsession. We will build your project as if it was our own.
Every member of our staff is hand-picked for their expertise in each part of your home renovation process. So whether you have a specific blueprint in mind or would like to take advantage of our design consultations, we have the expertise and training to ensure that your renovation project is completed, on time and within your budget.
Product selections can sometimes seem a bit overwhelming and frustrating at times. This is when the interior designer can become the single greatest asset to the completion of your renovation project. Their expertise in the design selection and space planning will save you an immense amount of stress and headaches. Having a designer who already works with a renovation company is extremely beneficial. Communication increases with a designer and things run smoother. This is what helps make the entire process much easier for you. That is our #1 goal.
