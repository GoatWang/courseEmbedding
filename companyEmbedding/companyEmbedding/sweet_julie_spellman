JUST days before Julie Terese Spellman's 35th birthday in October 2002, she was feeling sick. She was in Beijing to teach a course on securities law and would soon be uprooted again, moving to the Hong Kong office of Cravath, Swaine & Moore, the New York law firm in which she is a partner. And there was the wedding of a friend she wanted to attend in Singapore.This was not Ms. Spellman's first tour in Asia. In 1994 she had helped open the Hong Kong office.When Ms. Spellman, a native Californian, decided to leave New York for Asia again, her friends admonished her. "They said, 'You are never going to meet anyone there,' " she recalled. Boy, were they wrong.Ms. Spellman recovered from her illness in time to jet to Singapore for the rehearsal dinner for her friend's wedding.There she noted a man with a wide politician's smile and wondered if he might be single. He was Chad Creighton Sweet, and he noticed her, too, and made his way toward her. He was from Texas, he said, and an investment adviser in Houston for Goldman Sachs.

Like her, he was an extrovert. Like her, he felt drawn to Asia, where he had worked for seven years. The similarities continued: a passion for travel, strong ties to family, dedication to work. Continue reading the main story

But their timing was off. Mr. Sweet, now 35, had been with Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong during Ms. Spellman's first tour for Cravath, Swaine & Moore. There he had recruited Kanad Virk, the Singapore bridegroom, from Ms. Spellman's firm. Now, however, the idea of taking up with someone living half a world away seemed out of the question."Hong Kong to Houston, that's a big commute," observed Susan Webster, Ms. Spellman's colleague at Cravath.Besides, Ms. Spellman thought he might just be a smooth talker. A close friend of both of theirs, Joe Stevens, quickly assured her that this was not the case. "He's one of the few guys I work with who I'd gladly introduce to my sister," Mr. Stevens told her.So she gave it a shot. After Mr. Virk's wedding they decided to take in the sights of Hong Kong together. A cascade of e-mail messages and phone calls followed. By Thanksgiving that year, she began making monthly visits to Houston to see him.

Any long-distance relationship has its problems, they knew. Then a threat appeared. Six months into their courtship, news broke about the epidemic of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, in Hong Kong, which triggered an exodus of fearful Westerners from the city. Ms. Spellman, who was back in the United States for another wedding, felt compelled to return to help colleagues close the Hong Kong law office.Mr. Sweet argued against the trip. "He was concerned about the potential of her becoming a victim," recalled his father, Dr. R. Leldon Sweet, a cardiologist in Beaumont, Tex.She returned safely, but the experience shook the couple and made them think deeply about what it is they wanted from life and each other.So she moved closer -- well, sort of. Ms. Spellman transferred to her firm's New York office, reducing the strain somewhat. And when Mr. Sweet proposed to her last New Year's Eve on a boat in Lake Tahoe, she was quick to accept, but their agreement included a provision for continuing their long-distance arrangement for the foreseeable future.

They were married on Oct. 3 at the Southwest School of Art & Craft in San Antonio, beside the River Walk, where the Rev. Dr. David McKechnie, a Presbyterian minister officiated under the pecan trees in the stone-paved courtyard of the school, a former convent built in 1851.The bride, in a Vera Wang couture gown, wiped tears from Mr. Sweet's face and from her own."It just clicked with these two," Ms. Webster said. "They made it work."And when did the bride, who will spend four nights a week in Houston, know it was right? It was, she recalled a few days before the ceremony, when Mr. Sweet insisted on having written agendas for their telephone conferences with the wedding planner. "We really get each other," she said.

Julie Spellman Sweet, Accenture

2015 Working Mother of the Year

 Comments 











Julie Spellman Sweet


Courtesy of Accenture

Group Chief Executive—North America; Bethesda, MD; mom of Chloe, 8, and Abby, 7
Taking the road less traveled is a common theme for Julie Spellman Sweet. “At each stage of my career, I’ve really focused on doing something that others haven’t. I call that exploring uncharted territory,” she says. “For example, moving to Taiwan at 19 and then China to study Mandarin was uncommon for Americans in 1987. Additionally, joining a law firm with only three women partners and then leaving that successful practice and partnership after 17 years to join Accenture, were also unexpected choices. Taking risks, and succeeding at each stage of my career, has given me the confidence to seek the next opportunity.”
Previously general counsel, secretary and chief compliance officer, and a member of Accenture’s Global Management Committee, Julie made a significant contribution to the company’s business and investment strategies, demonstrating a strong commitment to its clients and people, and promoting a strong culture of ethics and compliance. Now, she’s taken on her next opportunity, as group chief executive – North America, leading Accenture’s largest market, a business in excess of $12 billion and with more than 51,000 employees.
She balances her leadership position in a demanding business environment with raising two young daughters. “Accenture’s culture respects people’s lives beyond work," says Julie. "I often work from home after extensive travel to be there when the kids get home from school. This kind of flexibility is priceless to a working parent.” Julie is also committed to being an example of service to others for her children. She and her daughters regularly volunteer at a homeless shelter. What’s more, Julie is an inspiration and champion for inclusion and diversity. “I want to be remembered as a leader who helped women and ethnic minorities advance," she says.

Title: Partner
               Company: Cravath , Swaine & Moore LLP
Job Details
               Since 2000, Cravath has served as counsel to either the issuer or the underwriters in over 155 SEC-registered and Rule 144A initial public offerings with an aggregate deal value of approximately US$72 billion. Since 2000, the Firm has acted as counsel in approximatelyÂ 2,100 SEC-registered or Rule 144A offerings totaling over US$2.5 trillion in proceeds. Since January 1, 2007, Cravath has been involved in over 795 SEC-registered or Rule 144A offerings with an aggregate deal value of over US$960 billion in proceeds. Our representation includes alerting our clients to newly enacted U.S. securities laws, as well as SEC and exchange rules and regulations, and advising them with respect to compliance with these requirements. Our partners maintain strong relations with members of the SEC staff, and when the need arises will help our foreign private issuer clients resolve potential reporting and compliance issues. It has been our experience that working together with our corporate clients on their periodic SEC filings has contributed greatly to our understanding of their business, which has in turn enhanced considerably our level of service on transactional and litigation matters. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 provides an example of this aspect of our practice. Since its enactment, Cravath has assisted its foreign private issuer clients in their understanding of the new rules by making available to them extensive memoranda, focused on foreign private issuers, and by advising them with respect to their compliance with the Act. In certain instances, this has included face-to-face meetings with the SEC staff to address certain client-specific compliance issues. Cravath has served as issuerâ€™s counsel for SEC-registered and Rule 144A securities offerings for many of our corporate clients, including Bristol-Myers Squibb, International Business Machines, Johnson & Johnson, Sappi, Shell and Unilever. We have served as counsel on SEC-registered and Rule 144A offerings by sovereign entities, including the Republic of Poland, Hungary, Ghana, the State of Israel and the European Investment Bank. The Firm also has served as underwritersâ€™ counsel for major investment banking firms, including Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and UBS. In addition, Cravath has been designated underwritersâ€™ counsel for SEC-registered and Rule 144A offerings for many U.S. and international issuers. As part of our capital markets practice, we also have represented issuers and underwriters in offerings by sovereign and supranational entities.

Julie Spellman Sweet


The Value of Legal at the Table


An Interview with Julie Spellman Sweet, General Counsel, Secretary, and Chief Compliance Officer, Accenture


Editors’ NoteJulie Sweet also oversees Accenture’s Govern-­ment Relations function and is a member of the company’s Global Management Committee. Prior to joining Accenture in 2010, Sweet was a partner in the Corporate department of the law firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, which she joined in 1992. In 2009, she was recognized by The Legal 500 for her work in equity offerings in the capital markets. Sweet speaks Mandarin Chinese and has spent substantial time working in Hong Kong and mainland China. She is a member of the board of trustees of Claremont McKenna College and holds a B.A. degree from Claremont McKenna College and a J.D. degree from Columbia Law School.
Company BriefAccenture (www.accenture.com) is a global management consulting, technology services, and outsourcing company. It combines capabilities across all industries and business functions, and extensive research on the world’s most successful companies, collaborating with clients to help them become high-performance businesses and governments. The company has approximately 236,000 people serving clients in more than 120 countries.
When this opportunity presented itself, what made you feel it would be the right fit?
Three reasons come immediately to mind. First was Accenture’s truly global footprint. While I did a lot of international work during my years practicing law, every day at Accenture I work on issues in different parts of the world and across multiple countries and cultures. I’m also excited by our push to expand into emerging markets. 
Second, it was about the people. Accenture people are extremely smart and really care about each other. With our top 20 leaders located across the world, we enjoy tremendous diversity in thinking and perspective, which ultimately helps us deliver results and makes this a great place to work.
The third piece for me was the role of the General Counsel at Accenture, which is at the heart of the business. When I interviewed, our former CEO and now Executive Chairman, Bill Green, said that he was looking for my business judgment, not just my legal advice. That was important, because it was how I had always approached my practice. Being able to help grow and protect a business was attractive to me and Accenture has a management team that sees the General Counsel in that role.
How do you define your role with Accenture?
Part of the role is supporting the board and corporate governance.
Another significant aspect is leading a global team that provides the legal support to help drive our business. As part of this, I focus on attracting and retaining the best talent because that kind of talent is critical to supporting $25 billion in revenue.
Another component is risk management, which isn’t about saying “no”; it’s about understanding what we want to achieve and the risks involved and then helping to make decisions about how we’re going to meet those objectives and balance risk. Because you can’t grow without taking risk, a lot of what I do is help the business make good decisions about smart risk. That might include putting in preventive measures, like the right compliance programs, or helping make decisions about how we’ll adapt to doing business in an emerging market, where you face different contract terms and expectations. 
Has the public dialogue on compliance been effective or does there need to be more change in terms of regulation?
The challenges that continue to plague even well-regulated markets are in the news every day. I believe the focus needs to be on smart regulation, based on a deep understanding by the government of both the businesses they are regulating and the actual dynamics of the marketplace. 
Keep in mind that regulation also creates a public dialogue around an issue. Sometimes the dialogue itself has value, keeping important issues on the front page
Is it tough to describe what makes Accenture different?
Not at all. Of the top 20 leaders, all but four of us have been with the company 20 years or more. Something keeps people here beyond just needing a paycheck and I think it comes down to our collegial, collaborative culture. We have an amazing ability to team across geographies, cultures, and workforces to deliver the best solutions to our clients. We also have the best people in the business and to ensure that they have necessary skills to serve clients and advance in their own careers, we invest significantly in their training and professional development. In fact, we invested more than $810 million in training last year – that’s why we’re different.
What is the value of cultural diversity within the firm?
We look at diversity through the widest possible lens. We capitalize on the diversity of our workforce across countries, cultures, generations, and a broad mix of education, experiences, and backgrounds, giving our clients access to a rich range of talent. At the same time, we understand that achieving success is a constant journey. For example, we have 80,000 women, which is terrific, but we know there is more to do. Our top leadership is directly engaged to ensure that we raise the bar on diversity. 
In bringing talent in, what makes for the right fit?
The ticket to the show starts with a strong skill set. But that is only the beginning. A person’s leadership ability is critical. In Legal, we particularly look for three leadership qualities: understanding what integrity means; the ability to show empathy, because you need to understand the other point of view in order to be a better lawyer and communicate hard messages; and demonstrating the courage to deliver those hard messages.
For me, it’s also about being willing to challenge yourself and your thinking. No one on my leadership team sits on the sidelines. Regardless of whether it’s your specialty or not, everyone is empowered to participate. We make decisions as a leadership team, in an atmosphere where people have the opportunity to challenge whether we’re making the right decisions, and we make sure we have heard everyone’s point of view.•

CONNECT WITH ME













































Julie Sweet is chief executive officer – North America, responsible for leading Accenture’s business in the United States, the company's largest market, and Canada. She is also a member of Accenture’s Global Management Committee.

Prior to assuming her current position in June 2015, Ms. Sweet served as general counsel, secretary and chief compliance officer, and was a member of the Global Management Committee. As general counsel, she had ultimate responsibility for all legal support to Accenture, serving as principal counsel to senior leadership and the board of directors and leading the company's Legal department.
