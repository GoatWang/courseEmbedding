Description


Additional information









Joel Bush Cherry was hybridized and developed by the late Elwyn Meader of Durham, New Hampshire. Dr. Meader wanted a Montmorency type cherry that would ripen late in the summer season to escape spring frost for the flowers. Bird damage was another reason for the late ripening cherries, because birds do not normally consume red fruits in the late summer. Now you can enjoy ripe cherries twice a year!

Site and Soil: Joel Bush likes 1/2 day to full sun and well-drained soil.
Pollination Requirements: Cross pollination of this plant is needed for heavy crops with Joy Bush Cherry being a good choice

Bearing Age: 2-3 years after planting

You can finally forget about your arborvitae and your boxwoods. Roberta’s 1 pc Joel Cherry Bush collection is exactly what a shrub should be – flowering in the spring, producing an abundance of juicy, anti-oxidant rich fruit in the late summer, and taking on gorgeous red tones in the autumn, we’ve never come across a bush that can elevate your garden’s landscape quite like this. Hybridized for over 25 years by famed breeder Dr. Meader of New Hampshire, no longer do you need a vast tract of space to grow a large, difficult to harvest cherry tree, because our Joel Cherry Bush grows only about 4’ tall and 3’ wide. It is the perfect size for a shrub and its habit resembles a flowering almond. And this self-fertile cherry bush doesn’t need brothers or sisters in the garden to produce fruit which means you can place them all over the yard on their own and still expect them to fruit.  However, they are so striking in the landscape, you may want to plant a small grove of them.SKU:  R53022/ PerennialBotanical Name:  (Prunus japonica x Prunus jacquemontii)Common Name:   Joel Cherry BushHardiness Zone:   3-8, Cold Tolerance: -35FSun-Shade:   Full SunHT/WD at Maturity:   4' / 3'Bloom Time:   Blooms in Spring and ripens late summer-fall (2nd yr.)Cultivar:  Joel Cherry (half gallon pot)Special:   Compact and tidy and not too large of a shrub with 3 seasons of intrigue; juicy, anti-oxidant rich cherries in late summer; beautiful, pink flowers in spring and Autumnal hues in fall; low maintenance and long-lived; self-fertile, producing fruit regularly; vigorous plant that exhibits staunch disease resistance; bird resistant due to sour taste and birds having other fruits around in late summer; resistant to cherry wormsUses: Edible landscaping, border, perennial garden, alongside the sidewalk, containersGrowing Guide:  Joel Cherry BushShipping Schedule :  Spring Shipping & Hardiness Zone Page

 Details

        Pink flowers appear in the spring making it an exceptional ornamental bush in and of its own right. But then by the second year you’ll begin harvesting bright red tart cherries in the late summer or early fall, and your bushes will maintain a productive life of around 20 years!  Bush Cherry Joel is a truly low maintenance, highly vigorous plant that exhibits staunch disease resistance making it a necessity for every garden seeking a dimension of edibility. You will be amazed at how bountiful each year’s harvest will be, making way for a delicious summer and fall filled with fresh cherries, homemade jams, pies, or even juice. This is especially true because the birds almost never bother these delicious sour cherries.  Shrubs and bushes are a key foundation of every garden, and finding one that brings three seasons of intrigue with flowers in the spring, fruit in the late summer, and autumnal hues in the fall is no easy task – simply put, the Joel Cherry Bush should not be overlooked!

  Dormant Meader bush cherry 
History and background
Selected and introduced by E.M. Meader of the University of New Hampshire, these hybrid cherries have similar characteristics. They all ripen in late August and early September, with the potential to extend the tart cherry season. They have a distinctive flavor that is somewhat of an acquired taste but could be enjoyed as a fresh fruit.
Observations at Carandale Farm
‘Jan’ was acquired from Raintree Nursery in 2003. Plants were small but adapted well and produced a crop the following year. It is a low-growing shrub that suckers readily but has never exceeded three feet in height. ‘Jan’ needs to be cross pollinated by ‘Joel’ or ‘Joy’ for good fruit set.
‘Joel’ and ‘Joy’ were acquired from St. Lawrence Nurseries in 2004. These tissue-cultured plants adapted very well. Both are taller than ‘Jan’ (about four feet) and do not have as much suckering. ‘Joy’ is considered self-fruitful; ‘Joel’ requires cross pollination. Fruit yield has been consistent and good.
Discussion
These plants have received little attention over the last 9-10 years but still persist in the Carandale test plot. Because of its small stature, ‘Jan’ is not as competitive and will require more attention as a commercial crop. With pruning and pest management, the Meader hybrids could be a sustainable crop. Late ripening could help extend the tart cherry season. Their potential to be machine-harvested could give them a place in an integrated system. But these plants will have to compete with the new Romance series of bush cherries coming out of the Canadian breeding program.

Very pretty for the price. A little taller than I expected so they're a bit higher than the arm of the couch, but still think they look great. They shipped quick, arrived as scheduled and assembled easily.

Nicely finished solid wood. Esay to assemble, and sturdy once put together properly. Anticipate a very long life for this nicely finished well made (in Vietnam) piece of furniture. Holds my tower computer on the bottom shelf quite nicely (17.4 x 6.9 x 15.7 inches).

I was pleasantly surprised that this item shipped so quickly! It was packaged so well I thought it might take until the next day to open it!! Since it was packaged SOOOO well, there was no damage to the product. It was very easy to assemble. I was a little confused at the screws that were supposed to be installed on the bottom shelf though, since there was no hole for them to screw into on the table leg...I guess it was to make it's own hole?? I just assembled the bottom shelf without the screws and the legs hold it in place. I'm not putting anything heavy on it so I think it should be ok.

I purchased this as a present for my wife. I was impressed just removing it from the box as I could tell the wood and finish are spot on. My wife loves it and I might bet there isn't a better chair wedge side table at this price point out there.

On one hand was suprised to find the table was a trapizoid. The description did not say that, said rectangle. Was disappointed in the workmanship. There was a bad place in the top shelf of the table on one of the long edges.

When you decide it's time to choose new pieces for your home, Walmart can help with Every Day Low Prices. To get things started, make sure you have an idea of what you need, such as how much space you have and where you want the pieces to go. You might want to consider if you want a particular style of furniture or mix-and-match pieces based on what you see available. Save money while you're at it with our low prices, every day, on everything, including big-ticket items like living room furniture.Sofas, loveseats, sectionals and futonsDepending on the size of your living room, the sofa you choose will likely be the biggest piece of furniture in the room, especially if you choose a sectional. If you have a smaller living room, such as in a condominium or apartment, you may only have room for a loveseat or futon.Sofa   Depending on the size, sofas allow seating for two to four people. Sofas can range between around 30 inches and more than 110 inches wide   with most being between 50 and 80 inches wide   and are upholstered in materials like leather, faux leather, linen or microfiber. If you have frequent overnight guests or just want to have another sleeping option, you can choose a sofa sleeperLoveseat   For large living rooms, you can have both a sofa and a loveseat in the room. However, if your space is smaller, you may want to consider a loveseat as your primary piece. These are made from the same types of material as sofas. Loveseats seat two average-size people or three smaller people, such as kids, and are usually between 30 and 89 inches long in a multitude of colors.Sectional   If you have a lot of space in your living room, a sectional can be a great piece to have. Sectionals seat four people, six or more, and some even double as recliners on one end or both. Most recliners are in an "L" shape, but some have rounded backs in more of a "C" shape. Sectionals also come in a variety of coverings, such as linen, leather, faux leather, bonded leather or microfiber. The minimum size for a sectional is 60 inches, and these can be more than 100 inches too.Futon   These are like smaller versions of sleeper sofas, serving as a loveseat or bed depending on your needs. A futon has a single twin-size mattress that turns into the bottom and back of the futon when rearranged.Recliners and chairsIn conjunction with a loveseat or sofa, you may want to add a chair or two into the mix. These can be recliners or accent chairs.Recliners   These are deep, usually plush chairs that have backs that recline and legs that extend out, allowing you to lay almost flat in the chair. The materials are the same as the other furniture you can choose for the living room to allow you to match pieces or choose your favorite upholstery, and some have heating and massaging capabilities. There are even recliners that have power lift technology, which assists people who have difficulty getting up or sitting down.Accent chairs   These chairs run the gamut of styles, including armchairs and armless chairs in many styles like contemporary, modern and mid-century. Chairs, including recliners, are typically categorized by how wide the seating area is, and living room chairs range from 15 inches or less (ideal for little ones) to 36 inches or more.Accent tablesTo go with the seating choices you have made, you also need a table or two in your living room as well. These can be coffee tables, end tables and console tables.Coffee tables   These tables do more than allow you to rest coffee cups on them. They're usually set in front of a sofa or sectional and have storage area   open, closed or both   beneath the top. These tables take many shapes but are usually rectangular.End tables   End tables sit next to sofas, loveseats and chairs and are good places for table lamps to rest. End tables also have storage space and some also have a drawer for storage.Console tables   These are tall narrow tables that go behind a sofa or along a wall. Some just have a tabletop, and some have shelving underneath.Other living room furnitureOnce you have the main pieces, there are peripheral pieces you may want to add to complete your living room layout. ottomans   These are square, circular or rectangular pieces of furniture that you can use as an extra seat or as a footrest. Many also have storage space that you access through a lid on the top.bookcases   Bookcases allow you to store books or other media like DVDs and Blu-ray discs or items that you want to display like knickknacks.TV stands and entertainment centers   If you have a television or stereo system you want to have in the living room, you can place these appliances in an entertainment center or TV stand in a central location and arrange your seating around it.Show moreElectrode, Comp-147349575, DC-prod-dal2, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-
