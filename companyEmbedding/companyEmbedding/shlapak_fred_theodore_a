Fred Shlapak, president of Motorola's SPS, to retireFred Shlapak, president of Motorola's SPS, to retire

		  AUSTIN, Texas  Fred Shlapak, who came in as president of Motorola's semiconductor products sector (SPS) just as the industry's worst downturn was about to begin, will retire soon.


Motorola chairman Chris Galvin sent a memo to employees Tuesday (June 3rd) saying that Shlapak had told Galvin of an intention to retire by his 60th birthday, which comes in October.


Shlapak was named SPS president at an inauspicious time: September of 2000, just when early signs appeared that what was to become the industry's most severe downturn ever was about to begin.


Faced with a revenue decline from more than $7.5 billion in 2000 to slightly less than $5 billion in 2001 and again last year, Shlapak has managed what one employee described as "an organized retreat," laying off some 10,000 SPS employees, cutting capital investments sharply while forging a process development alliance with Philips Semiconductors and STMicroelectronics, and signing a strategic partnership with foundry TSMC while paring Motorola's own manufacturing operations from 28 to 10.


Long-time Motorola spokesman Ken Phillips, who is retiring himself next month after more than two decades at SPS, said "that will be Fred's legacy, that he took this place through a total makeover. It doesn't get much tougher than the job Fred had to do, and he did it with great fortitude."


Shlapak joined Motorola in 1970 as an applications engineer in Canada, and spent much of his career managing Motorola's semiconductor operations in Europe.


However good Motorola's defense has been in terms of forging new partnerships and cutting costs, Shlapak's critics within Motorola have argued that he failed to engineer a potent offense in terms of new product initiatives. For example, Motorola has largely sat on the sidelines, despite its heritage in both wireless and networking, as wireless LAN technology has become the single most exciting new opportunity in the electronics industry.


One source, who asked not to be identified, said morale within SPS remains fairly low even as the big layoffs have subsided. The emphasis on cutting costs has not been matched with innovative strategies to position Motorola in growth areas, he said.


"They talk about the number of new products, but they are nearly all incremental improvements. Motorola needs to do something new. You can't just keep cutting costs and expect to get to profitability. You have to spend on the new things," he said.


Galvin's memo said that "even though 2003 has started off slowly for SPS, we strongly believe that silicon and software provide a core offering for our customers. I support your plan to introduce 269 new products this year, up from 181 last year (and about 108 in 2001). The senior leadership team continues to value your contribution as Motorolans and is committed to the success of this business."


Motorola is participating in exciting developments within the automotive electronics field, seeing the fruits of efforts within SPS over the past decade, spokesman Phillips said. And Shlapak is proud of a new product line of electronic switches that may replace conventional switches and relays.


Bill Walker, the second-ranked executive within SPS, will not seek to replace Shlapak. Among the internal candidates are Scott Anderson, who runs the automotive and standard products group, which includes microcontrollers; Chris Belden, vice president of technology and manufacturing, Ray Burgess, the vice president of marketing and strategy who earlier ran the digital consumer operation, and David Perkins, who heads up the networking and computer systems group.


Franz Fink, a native of Germany who has held a variety of jobs within SPS, recently was named vice president of the Wireless and Broadband Systems Group. Fink replaces Peter Shinyeda, who has yet to be re-assigned to a new job within Motorola, Phillips said.
