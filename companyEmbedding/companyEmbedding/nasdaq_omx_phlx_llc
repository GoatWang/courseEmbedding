II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.
A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
1. Purpose
The Exchange proposes to modify Section IX of the Exchange's Options Pricing Schedule to delete references to the PHOTO Historical data product. PHOTO Historical is a stored data product and not a real time data feed. NASDAQ OMX stores the data on a server within a technology subsidiary that functions like any vendor that receives and stores real time data feed. PHOTO Historical is not a facility of the Exchange and fees associated with it do not belong in the Exchange Rule Manual.
Background. In September 2010, the Exchange established fees for its PHOTO market data product.[3] 
           PHOTO is a market data product offered by the Exchange that provides proprietary electronic trade data to subscribers. PHOTO is available as either an “Intra-Day” or “End-of-Day” product. PHOTO Historical, as the name implies, is not a real-time product; it is a stored product that permits a subscriber to select a particular prior calendar month or months and receive the “End of Day” or “Intra-Day” data for each trading session conducted during the calendar month(s) selected.
Like PHOTO subscribers, PHOTO Historical subscribers receive the following data:Start Printed Page 30918


Aggregate number of buy and sell transactions in the affected series for each trading session conducted during the specified calendar month(s);
Aggregate volume traded electronically on the Exchange in the affected series for each trading session conducted during the specified calendar month(s);
Aggregate number of trades effected on the Exchange to open a position [4] 
           for each trading session conducted during the specified calendar month(s);


Aggregate number of trades effected on the Exchange to close a position [5] 
           for each trading session conducted during the specified calendar month(s);


Origin of the orders involved in trades on the Exchange in the affected series for each trading session conducted during the specified calendar month(s), specifically aggregated in the following categories of participants: Customers, broker-dealers, market makers (including specialists, Registered Options Traders (“ROTs”), Streaming Quote Traders (“SQTs”) [6] 
           and Remote Streaming Quote Traders (“RSQTs”) [7] 
          ), and professionals.[8] 


The fee for the PHOTO Historical Data End of Day product for subscribers is $400.00 per calendar month selected. The fee for the PHOTO Historical Data Intra-day product subscribers is $750.00 per calendar month selected.
Proposal. NASDAQ believes that PHOTO Historical is not a facility of the Exchange within the meaning of the Act, and that previous proposed rule changes with respect to such PHOTO Historical were unnecessary under the Act. Congress enacted the Exchange Act to impose federal regulation on stock exchanges, and included in its definition of “exchange” “the market facilities maintained by such exchange.” [9] 

           The Exchange Act separately defines “facility,” providing that “[t]he term `facility' when used with respect to an exchange includes [1] its premises, [2] tangible or intangible property whether on the premises or not, [3] any right to the use of such premises or property or any service thereof for the purpose of effecting or reporting a transaction on an exchange (including among other things, any system of communication to or from the exchange, by ticker or otherwise, maintained by or with the consent of the exchange), and [4] any right of the exchange to the use of any property or service.” Id. The Commission has not separately interpreted the definition of “facility.” [10] 

PHOTO Historical does not satisfy any of the four prongs set forth in the statutory definition of “facility.” First, it is not the “premises” of the Exchange. The term “premises” is generally understood to refer to a building, its land, and appurtenances. Second, PHOTO Historical is not tangible or intangible property of the Exchange. While the Exchange initially distributes the PHOTO product as a facility; NASDAQ OMX stores and distributes PHOTO Historical as any vendor would do. Third, PHOTO Historical is not used on the Exchange's premises “for the purpose of effecting or reporting a transaction” on an exchange.[11] 
           Fourth, PHLX, in its capacity as an exchange, does not hold any right to PHOTO Historical other than as the original distributor of such data for which it receives applicable, filed fees.
The Exchange's proposal is consistent with past precedent regarding the distribution of historical data. Specifically, in 2010, the NASDAQ Stock Market submitted a proposed rule change to eliminate from the NASDAQ rule manual references to Historical TotalView.[12] 
           In that case, TotalView was a real-time data product that was stored in a non-exchange subsidiary that then redistributed the stored data in the same manner and capacity as any market data vendor. The proposal was designated as an immediately effective proposal and was not acted upon by the Commission.
Conversely, there is no Commission precedent for considering the historical data of an exchange to be considered a facility when re-distributed by a market data vendor. For example, when NASDAQ separated from NASD, the Commission was asked to determine whether TRF LLC, which would operate NASD's Trade Reporting Facility, was a facility of NASD or the Nasdaq Exchange, which together owned TRF LLC.[13] 

           The Nasdaq Exchange was to be “primarily responsible for the management of the TRF LLC's business affairs,” and all “profits and losses from the TRF LLC [were] allocated to NASDAQ.” Id. at 15; see also id. at 18 (“[T]he Nasdaq Exchange's parent company controls the board of the TRF LLC, directs all business decisions, provides technology, and will reap the economic benefits of the TRF LLC.”). Nevertheless, the Commission concluded that the TRF LLC was a facility of NASD, not the Nasdaq Exchange, because the “Trade Reporting Facility is not a service `for the purpose of effecting or reporting a transaction' on the Nasdaq Exchange.” Id. at 18. The Start Printed Page 30919TRF LLC was instead “a service for the purpose of reporting transactions to the NASD.” Id.

Similarly, the Commission concluded that the ACES System, “a neutral communications service that allows NASDAQ members and non-members to route orders to one another,” is not a facility of the NASDAQ Exchange.[14] 

           The Commission deemed it significant that the ACES System does not route orders to NASDAQ and does not report executed trades on the Exchange. Id. The Commission emphasized that, because the ACES System is “not linked to the Exchange's core systems, including the NASDAQ Market Center,” it “is not possible for an order to be routed to the NASDAQ Market Center via the ACES system.” Id. Accordingly, the Commission concluded that ACES does not have “the purpose of effecting or reporting a transaction on an exchange” within the meaning of the Exchange Act. Id. The Commission has also permitted NASDAQ to remove from its rule book fees related to the Mutual Fund Quotation Service and the NASDAQ Index Dissemination Service, both of which disseminated market data not properly considered “facilities” of NASDAQ within the meaning of the Exchange Act.[15] 

Given the plain language of the Exchange Act and the above-referenced precedents, there is no basis in the Act for determining that a real-time market data facility of an exchange retains that character when an affiliated vendor redistributes it on an historical basis. First, the affiliated vendor is not an exclusive processor of such data, unlike the data that PHLX produces directly. Second, historical data does not provide access or order entry capability to the Exchange's execution system; nor does it carry information from or about executions currently within the execution system. Third, the affiliated vendor receives the data via an arms-length agreement and it has no inherent advantage over any other recipient of such data. Moreover, historical data is available via multiple sources. It is a completely voluntary product in that PHLX makes it available on a voluntary basis, and clients purchase it from NASDAQ OMX (or another vendor) only if they voluntarily choose to do so.
For all of these reasons, PHLX believes that its PHOTO Historical data service is not a facility of a national securities exchange within the meaning of the Act and that it is not required under Section 19(b)(1) of the Act [16] 
           and Rule 19b-4 thereunder [17] 
           to file rules regarding the applicable charges.
2. Statutory Basis
PHLX believes that PHOTO Historical is not a facility of a national securities exchange within the meaning of the Act and the terms of this service are not rules that must be filed with the Commission under Section 19(b)(1) of the Act [18] 
           and Rule 19b-4 thereunder.[19] 
           Therefore, removing the applicable provisions from the PHLX rule book would be consistent with the provisions of Section 6(b) of the Act.[20] 

PHLX's proposal to remove PHOTO Historical from the rule manual is also consistent with the Exchange Act insofar as it will have no impact on PHLX's or its members' compliance with applicable regulations and rules. First, PHLX has no obligation under the Exchange Act, either as an exchange or a vendor, to offer PHOTO Historical to PHLX members. Having chosen to offer such data and to do so on non-discriminatory terms imposes no continuing obligation to do so. Second, even assuming PHLX did have an obligation to make PHOTO Historical available, it will continue to do so in the same manner if does now. Therefore, to the extent PHLX members utilize PHOTO Historical, that use will be uninterrupted. Third, there are multiple vendors of historical, many of whom are not subject to Commission oversight.
B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition
PHLX does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act, as amended. To the contrary, PHLX believes that this proposed rule change removing from the PHLX rule manual a service improperly included, promotes competition by removing an impediment to PHLX's competition with unregulated market data providers with which PHLX competes for these services. Removing barriers to competition has the potential to promote innovation, reduce prices, and increase efficiency.
C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others
No written comments were either solicited or received.
III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action
Within 45 days of the date of publication of this notice in the Federal Register or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the Exchange consents, the Commission shall: (a) By order approve or disapprove such proposed rule change, or (b) institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.
IV. Solicitation of Comments

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
