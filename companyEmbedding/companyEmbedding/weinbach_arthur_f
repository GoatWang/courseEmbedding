CA, Inc. Names Arthur F. Weinbach as Non-Executive Chairman (NASDAQ:CA)

CA, Inc. Names Arthur F. Weinbach as Non-Executive Chairman
Succeeds Bill McCracken Who Continues as CA's Chief Executive Officer and Member of its Board of Directors
ISLANDIA, N.Y., May 6, 2010 /PRNewswire via COMTEX News Network/ -- CA, Inc. (Nasdaq: CA), the world's leading independent IT management software company, today announced that its Board of Directors has appointed Arthur F. Weinbach, 67, as its non-executive chairman of the Board. The appointment is effective immediately.
(Photo:  http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20090402/NYTH500LOGO )
He succeeds Bill McCracken, 67, who became the Company's chief executive officer in January 2010.  He also succeeds Gary Fernandes, who served as CA's Lead Independent Director during the three-month period that McCracken served as both executive chairman of the board and CEO.
"Art Weinbach is a proven leader with a track record of directing companies as chief executive and as the chairman of the board," said Fernandes. "Art's appointment ensures that Bill McCracken and his senior management team will have the strong support and independent counsel needed to help further build CA into a market and thought leader in new and emerging technologies such as virtualization, software-as-a-service, cloud computing and security."
Weinbach, who currently is executive chairman of Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc., and was previously chairman and chief executive officer of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP), joined CA's Board of Directors in 2008.  He has served as a member of the Board's Audit Committee and its Compensation and Human Resources Committee.
"I am delighted to be taking on this role with CA's Board of Directors in such a pivotal period in the Company's history.   There are great opportunities ahead and I look forward to working with the Board and the CA management team to successfully execute our corporate strategy and clearly establish the Company as a market and thought leader," said Weinbach.
CA has split the chairman and CEO roles since 2004, other than during the brief transitional period when McCracken served as both chairman and CEO.  McCracken served as CA's non-executive chairman from 2007 to 2009 and became CA's executive chairman when former CEO John Swainson announced his retirement in September 2009.  McCracken will remain on the Board as its only inside director. The Board currently has nine members.
"On the recommendation from CA's Corporate Governance Committee, the CA Board unanimously agreed that it was in the best interest of the Company, CA shareholders, and its employees to continue to separate the roles of chairman and chief executive officer," said Fernandes.  "We believe that this is the appropriate board leadership structure for CA at the present time."
Weinbach spent 28 years at ADP. He served as ADP's president and CEO from 1996 to 1998, as chairman and CEO from 1998 to 2006, and as non-executive chairman from 2006 to November 2007.  Prior to joining ADP, Weinbach was a partner in the accounting firm of Touche Ross & Co., which is now part of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu.
Weinbach earned a Master of Science degree in accounting from University of Pennsylvania's Wharton Graduate School and a Bachelor of Science degree in economics also from Wharton.

Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.
