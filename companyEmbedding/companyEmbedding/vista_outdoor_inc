FARMINGTON, Utah, July 10, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Vista Outdoor Inc. (NYSE:    VSTO) announced today that Chairman and CEO Mark DeYoung is retiring from the Company and the Board of Directors, effective immediately. Michael Callahan, Vista Outdoor's Lead Independent Director, has been named Interim Chairman and CEO. 
The Board of Directors is conducting a search for a permanent CEO and has retained a leading executive search firm to assist in the process. The Board intends to consider both internal and external candidates for the position.













                Michael Callahan, Interim Chairman and CEO, Vista Outdoor
              

 
 



"On behalf of the Board and the entire Vista Outdoor team, I'd like to thank Mark for his service and many contributions to the Company," said Michael Callahan. "Mark led the creation of the company that became Vista Outdoor, directed it through its successful spin-off from ATK, and grew it into a diversified global leader in outdoor recreation. Given the opportunities and challenges that come with significant change in our industry, and the likelihood that Mark would elect to retire at the end of his employment agreement, the Board and Mark mutually determined that now is the time for a new leader to guide Vista Outdoor in its next phase of growth. Therefore, we collectively agreed it was appropriate for Mark to accelerate his retirement plans and for us to begin the search for his replacement.  
"I'm pleased to step into the role of Interim Chairman and CEO to help support a smooth transition of leadership while the Board conducts a thorough search for the Company's next CEO. I look forward to working with the Company's excellent team as we remain committed to providing our customers with innovative and high-quality products. We will also maintain our focus on expanding our brands' e-commerce presence, reducing inventory, and driving continuous improvement. Vista Outdoor is well positioned to capitalize on the significant growth opportunities in the outdoor recreation industry, and the Board and I are excited about our future."
Callahan added, "We recently completed the first quarter of our Fiscal Year 2018 and, while we will not report results until August 10, the company had a strong quarter that positions us well to deliver on our full-year financial guidance."
"After a long and rewarding career, it is now time for me to move on to the next phase of my life," said DeYoung. "Vista Outdoor is the culmination of a vision focused on creating a world-leading outdoor recreation company. It has been a rewarding experience to have led this great company and seen the organization evolve and succeed. I am proud of Vista Outdoor's people, brands, portfolio and products, and I am confident in Vista Outdoor's future. I wish the Company's valued employees and customers all the best."
Michael Callahan BiographyCallahan, 67, has more than 40 years of experience in the sporting goods industry, and has served as Lead Independent Director of Vista Outdoor since the Company spun off from ATK in February 2015. He has been the President and Chief Executive Officer of Aspen Partners, a Utah-based consultant to the outdoor sporting industry, since 2008. From 1990 until his retirement in 2008, Callahan served in various merchandising, marketing, management and senior executive positions with Cabela's, Inc., most recently as Senior Vice President Business Development & International Operations where he was responsible for M&A and spearheaded Cabela's expansion into Canada. Callahan is a member of the Board of the Midway USA Foundation and formerly served as a member of the Board of Bushnell Outdoor Products, Chairman of the Congressional Sportsmen's Foundation and Vice Chairman of the Outdoor Business Council of the US Sportsmen's Alliance.

History[edit]
Alliant Techsystems (ATK), entered the ammunition and outdoor products business in 2001. ATK grew through acquisitions and a surge in demand for ammunition for police, hunting, and other private uses.[4]
In December 2014, regulators were informed that Vista Outdoor had signed an agreement for a $350 million secured loan with a term of five years and a $400 million revolving line of credit. Proceeds were partially used to pay down debt.[4] ATK and Orbital filed a joint proxy statement and prospectus describing the share issuance with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 17, 2014. The same month, the Department of Justice granted approval to the merger and spinoff.[2][5]
ATK spun-off Vista Outdoor upon closing its merger with Orbital Sciences and became Orbital ATK on February 9, 2015. Anyone holding ATK common stock at the end of the business day on February 2, 2015 received two shares of Vista Outdoor common stock. Eligible shareholders had their brokerage account credited or received a book-entry account statement reflecting their ownership. Vista Outdoor was thus initially 100% owned by ATK shareholders. Vista Outdoor stock traded on a "when-issued" basis from January 29, 2015 to February 9, 2015. It began "regular way" trading on the New York Stock Exchange on February 10, 2015 under the ticker symbol "VSTO." No payment or action of any kind was required of shareholders. This transaction was conducted on a tax-free basis. U.S. shareholders generally did not have to recognize a gain or loss for federal tax purposes.[1][6][7]
On February 25th, 2016, BRG Sports announced its acceptance of a $400-million cash and earn-out deal to sell its "Action Sports" business to Vista Outdoor. Vista gained control of the Bell Sports, Giro, Blackburn, and C-Preme brands.[8]
Financial results[edit]
For fiscal year 2015, Vista Outdoor reported earnings of $79.5 million or $1.25 per share on $2.08 billion in revenue. [9]
In a January 11, 2017 press release, Vista Outdoor disclosed that it expected to record "a material asset impairment charge in its hunting and shooting accessories reporting unit" for the third quarter of its fiscal year 2017. Vista reported that "the Company's preliminary analysis indicates the impairment charge will be in the range of $400 million to $450 million." [10]
Brands and subsidiaries[edit]
Vista Outdoor's brands and subsidiaries include those listed in detail below as well as the following: Alliant Powder,[11]American Eagle, Bell, Blackburn, Blazer, Cébé, Champion Targets, C-Preme, Fusion, Final Approach, Gold Tip Arrows, Hoppe's, Outers, Primos, Serengeti, Speer, Tasco, Uncle Mike's, and Weaver Optics. Most of Vista's brands are associated with shooting and hunting. The company also makes gear for camping, hiking, skiing, and biking such as flashlights, headlamps, lanterns, helmets, goggles, GPS locators, etc.[2][12]
Bushnell[edit]
Main article: Bushnell Corporation

Also knowns as Bushnell Outdoor Products, Bushnell specializes in optics and imaging. Its products include binoculars, spotting scopes, telescopes, night vision equipment, GPS devices, laser rangefinders, riflescopes, holographic weapon sights, game cameras, and other high-end optical equipment. It also sells Bollé Performance Eyewear ski goggles and sunglasses and Serengeti Eyewear all-purpose sunglasses. David P. Bushnell founded Bushnell Corporation in 1948 during his service in the Allied-occupied Japan. In 1999, Bushnell was acquired by private equity firm Wind Point Partners. In 2007, Bushnell was acquired by MidOcean Partners, another private equity firm, which acquired it in a leveraged buyout. In 2008, Bushnell acquired the assets of Simmons Outdoor Corporation from Meade Instruments. ATK announced its acquisition of Bushnell on September 5, 2013 for $985 million in cash, subject to post-closing adjustments.[13][14]
CCI[edit]
Main article: CCI (ammunition)
Cascade Cartridge, usually called CCI Ammunition, is based in Lewiston, Idaho. In its infancy, CCI made centerfire primers for government use. As of March 2015, it mainly manufactures rimfire ammunition but also makes centerfire handgun ammunition, primers for reloading and industrial purposes, and shotgun shells. CCI was founded in 1951 by Dick Speer, brother of Speer Bullets founder Vernon Speer. CCI was previously known as the Speer Ammunition Company.[15][16]

Federal Cartridge, usually styled Federal Premium, is located in Anoka, Minnesota. Federal Premium manufactures finished shotshell, centerfire, and rimfire ammunition, as well as powder, primer, and shell casings.[17]
Jimmy Styks[edit]
Kyle Reeves and Jeremy Wilkens founded Jimmy Styks in 2009 in Huntington Beach, California. In July 2015, Vista Outdoor announced its intent to purchase Jimmy Styks for $40 million upfront with additional payments to the founders, who are staying with the company, triggered by meeting financial targets over the next three years. Jimmy Styks makes stand-up paddle boards and accessories. It will be integrated into Vista Outdoor's outdoor products division. This purchase price is multiple of about 5.5 times the expected 2015 calendar year EBITDA.[18]
In January 2016, Vista Outdoor announced that it would use its relationships with retailers to expand the number of stores that offer Jimmy Styks products.[19]

Leadership[edit]
Mark W. DeYoung[edit]
Mark W. DeYoung is Vista Outdoor's chairman and CEO. Before heading Vista Outdoor, DeYoung was President and CEO of Alliant Techsystems (ATK) from 2010 to 2015. During his tenure, ATK completed acquisitions of Savage Arms and Bushnell. In 2015, DeYoung led the transaction that spun-off ATK's sporting goods business to create Vista Outdoor and merged ATK's aerospace and defense units with Orbital Sciences forming Orbital ATK. DeYoung previously headed ATK's Armament Systems group, the company's largest business. Under DeYoung, this unit expanded into new markets and increased its revenue from $600 million in fiscal year 2003 to $2.1 billion in fiscal year 2010.[13][20][21]
DeYoung started his career with Hercules Aerospace in Salt Lake City, Utah in 1985. He held numerous management positions at Hercules in its solid rocket motor and composite structures businesses. After Hercules was acquired by ATK in 1995, DeYoung continued to advance and held roles in finance, operations, composite structures, human resources, and munitions. DeYoung earned an undergraduate degree in business at Weber State University, in Ogden, Utah. He holds an MBA from Westminster College in Salt Lake City, Utah where he taught management and finance and was named "Adjunct Professor of the Year." DeYoung is also a member of Orbital ATK's board of directors.[21][22]
Operations[edit]
Vista Outdoor decided to station its headquarters in Utah after the company applied for and received targeted tax credits from the Utah state government. The company thus capitalized on Utah's goal of recruiting global brand businesses from six strategic economic clusters: outdoor products, life sciences, aerospace/defense, financial services, energy, and software/information technology. In its application, Vista Outdoor said it would invest about $10 million in a new facility where about 90 highly-paid employees would work. Counting medical benefits, these employees will be paid about $125 million over a seven-year period. Utah economic development officials expect about $6.7 million in new tax revenue from the project over this period.[23]
Although its corporate headquarters is in Utah, the leadership teams for individual brands will remain in the locations where products are designed and developed.[2][24][25] Vista Outdoor has about 5,800 employees worldwide, with 4,000 in the United States. The company has manufacturing and support facilities spread over 11 U.S. states, Puerto Rico, Mexico, and Canada. It has sales and sourcing operations in Mexico, Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Asia.[1][25] For example, 1,200 of Vista Outdoor's employees staff an ammunition factory in Lewiston, Idaho.[26]
In June 2015, Vista announced that it would build its new corporate headquarters at Station Park in Farmington City, Utah. As of June 2015, construction was expected to begin during the summer of the same year with completion expected in the middle of 2016. Station Park is a mixed-use development next to a commuter rail station.[27]
In January 2016, Vista opened a factory in American Fork, Utah to manufacture Gold Tip and Bee Stinger archery products.[28] The new factory is significantly larger than the facility it replaced. The additional space is being used for increased research and development, improved production processes, and better employee amenities.[29]

History[edit]
Alliant Techsystems (ATK), entered the ammunition and outdoor products business in 2001. ATK grew through acquisitions and a surge in demand for ammunition for police, hunting, and other private uses.[4]
In December 2014, regulators were informed that Vista Outdoor had signed an agreement for a $350 million secured loan with a term of five years and a $400 million revolving line of credit. Proceeds were partially used to pay down debt.[4] ATK and Orbital filed a joint proxy statement and prospectus describing the share issuance with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 17, 2014. The same month, the Department of Justice granted approval to the merger and spinoff.[2][5]
ATK spun-off Vista Outdoor upon closing its merger with Orbital Sciences and became Orbital ATK on February 9, 2015. Anyone holding ATK common stock at the end of the business day on February 2, 2015 received two shares of Vista Outdoor common stock. Eligible shareholders had their brokerage account credited or received a book-entry account statement reflecting their ownership. Vista Outdoor was thus initially 100% owned by ATK shareholders. Vista Outdoor stock traded on a "when-issued" basis from January 29, 2015 to February 9, 2015. It began "regular way" trading on the New York Stock Exchange on February 10, 2015 under the ticker symbol "VSTO." No payment or action of any kind was required of shareholders. This transaction was conducted on a tax-free basis. U.S. shareholders generally did not have to recognize a gain or loss for federal tax purposes.[1][6][7]
On February 25th, 2016, BRG Sports announced its acceptance of a $400-million cash and earn-out deal to sell its "Action Sports" business to Vista Outdoor. Vista gained control of the Bell Sports, Giro, Blackburn, and C-Preme brands.[8]
Financial results[edit]
For fiscal year 2015, Vista Outdoor reported earnings of $79.5 million or $1.25 per share on $2.08 billion in revenue. [9]
In a January 11, 2017 press release, Vista Outdoor disclosed that it expected to record "a material asset impairment charge in its hunting and shooting accessories reporting unit" for the third quarter of its fiscal year 2017. Vista reported that "the Company's preliminary analysis indicates the impairment charge will be in the range of $400 million to $450 million." [10]
Brands and subsidiaries[edit]
Vista Outdoor's brands and subsidiaries include those listed in detail below as well as the following: Alliant Powder,[11]American Eagle, Bell, Blackburn, Blazer, Cébé, Champion Targets, C-Preme, Fusion, Final Approach, Gold Tip Arrows, Hoppe's, Outers, Primos, Serengeti, Speer, Tasco, Uncle Mike's, and Weaver Optics. Most of Vista's brands are associated with shooting and hunting. The company also makes gear for camping, hiking, skiing, and biking such as flashlights, headlamps, lanterns, helmets, goggles, GPS locators, etc.[2][12]
Bushnell[edit]
Main article: Bushnell Corporation

Also knowns as Bushnell Outdoor Products, Bushnell specializes in optics and imaging. Its products include binoculars, spotting scopes, telescopes, night vision equipment, GPS devices, laser rangefinders, riflescopes, holographic weapon sights, game cameras, and other high-end optical equipment. It also sells Bollé Performance Eyewear ski goggles and sunglasses and Serengeti Eyewear all-purpose sunglasses. David P. Bushnell founded Bushnell Corporation in 1948 during his service in the Allied-occupied Japan. In 1999, Bushnell was acquired by private equity firm Wind Point Partners. In 2007, Bushnell was acquired by MidOcean Partners, another private equity firm, which acquired it in a leveraged buyout. In 2008, Bushnell acquired the assets of Simmons Outdoor Corporation from Meade Instruments. ATK announced its acquisition of Bushnell on September 5, 2013 for $985 million in cash, subject to post-closing adjustments.[13][14]
CCI[edit]
Main article: CCI (ammunition)
Cascade Cartridge, usually called CCI Ammunition, is based in Lewiston, Idaho. In its infancy, CCI made centerfire primers for government use. As of March 2015, it mainly manufactures rimfire ammunition but also makes centerfire handgun ammunition, primers for reloading and industrial purposes, and shotgun shells. CCI was founded in 1951 by Dick Speer, brother of Speer Bullets founder Vernon Speer. CCI was previously known as the Speer Ammunition Company.[15][16]
Federal Premium[edit]
Main article: Federal Cartridge

Federal Cartridge, usually styled Federal Premium, is located in Anoka, Minnesota. Federal Premium manufactures finished shotshell, centerfire, and rimfire ammunition, as well as powder, primer, and shell casings.[17]
Jimmy Styks[edit]
Kyle Reeves and Jeremy Wilkens founded Jimmy Styks in 2009 in Huntington Beach, California. In July 2015, Vista Outdoor announced its intent to purchase Jimmy Styks for $40 million upfront with additional payments to the founders, who are staying with the company, triggered by meeting financial targets over the next three years. Jimmy Styks makes stand-up paddle boards and accessories. It will be integrated into Vista Outdoor's outdoor products division. This purchase price is multiple of about 5.5 times the expected 2015 calendar year EBITDA.[18]
In January 2016, Vista Outdoor announced that it would use its relationships with retailers to expand the number of stores that offer Jimmy Styks products.[19]

Leadership[edit]
Mark W. DeYoung[edit]
Mark W. DeYoung is Vista Outdoor's chairman and CEO. Before heading Vista Outdoor, DeYoung was President and CEO of Alliant Techsystems (ATK) from 2010 to 2015. During his tenure, ATK completed acquisitions of Savage Arms and Bushnell. In 2015, DeYoung led the transaction that spun-off ATK's sporting goods business to create Vista Outdoor and merged ATK's aerospace and defense units with Orbital Sciences forming Orbital ATK. DeYoung previously headed ATK's Armament Systems group, the company's largest business. Under DeYoung, this unit expanded into new markets and increased its revenue from $600 million in fiscal year 2003 to $2.1 billion in fiscal year 2010.[13][20][21]
DeYoung started his career with Hercules Aerospace in Salt Lake City, Utah in 1985. He held numerous management positions at Hercules in its solid rocket motor and composite structures businesses. After Hercules was acquired by ATK in 1995, DeYoung continued to advance and held roles in finance, operations, composite structures, human resources, and munitions. DeYoung earned an undergraduate degree in business at Weber State University, in Ogden, Utah. He holds an MBA from Westminster College in Salt Lake City, Utah where he taught management and finance and was named "Adjunct Professor of the Year." DeYoung is also a member of Orbital ATK's board of directors.[21][22]
Operations[edit]
Vista Outdoor decided to station its headquarters in Utah after the company applied for and received targeted tax credits from the Utah state government. The company thus capitalized on Utah's goal of recruiting global brand businesses from six strategic economic clusters: outdoor products, life sciences, aerospace/defense, financial services, energy, and software/information technology. In its application, Vista Outdoor said it would invest about $10 million in a new facility where about 90 highly-paid employees would work. Counting medical benefits, these employees will be paid about $125 million over a seven-year period. Utah economic development officials expect about $6.7 million in new tax revenue from the project over this period.[23]
Although its corporate headquarters is in Utah, the leadership teams for individual brands will remain in the locations where products are designed and developed.[2][24][25] Vista Outdoor has about 5,800 employees worldwide, with 4,000 in the United States. The company has manufacturing and support facilities spread over 11 U.S. states, Puerto Rico, Mexico, and Canada. It has sales and sourcing operations in Mexico, Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Asia.[1][25] For example, 1,200 of Vista Outdoor's employees staff an ammunition factory in Lewiston, Idaho.[26]
In June 2015, Vista announced that it would build its new corporate headquarters at Station Park in Farmington City, Utah. As of June 2015, construction was expected to begin during the summer of the same year with completion expected in the middle of 2016. Station Park is a mixed-use development next to a commuter rail station.[27]
In January 2016, Vista opened a factory in American Fork, Utah to manufacture Gold Tip and Bee Stinger archery products.[28] The new factory is significantly larger than the facility it replaced. The additional space is being used for increased research and development, improved production processes, and better employee amenities.[29]

FARMINGTON, Utah, July 10, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Vista Outdoor Inc. (NYSE:    VSTO) announced today that Chairman and CEO Mark DeYoung is retiring from the Company and the Board of Directors, effective immediately. Michael Callahan, Vista Outdoor's Lead Independent Director, has been named Interim Chairman and CEO. 
The Board of Directors is conducting a search for a permanent CEO and has retained a leading executive search firm to assist in the process. The Board intends to consider both internal and external candidates for the position.













                Michael Callahan, Interim Chairman and CEO, Vista Outdoor
              

 
 



"On behalf of the Board and the entire Vista Outdoor team, I'd like to thank Mark for his service and many contributions to the Company," said Michael Callahan. "Mark led the creation of the company that became Vista Outdoor, directed it through its successful spin-off from ATK, and grew it into a diversified global leader in outdoor recreation. Given the opportunities and challenges that come with significant change in our industry, and the likelihood that Mark would elect to retire at the end of his employment agreement, the Board and Mark mutually determined that now is the time for a new leader to guide Vista Outdoor in its next phase of growth. Therefore, we collectively agreed it was appropriate for Mark to accelerate his retirement plans and for us to begin the search for his replacement.  
"I'm pleased to step into the role of Interim Chairman and CEO to help support a smooth transition of leadership while the Board conducts a thorough search for the Company's next CEO. I look forward to working with the Company's excellent team as we remain committed to providing our customers with innovative and high-quality products. We will also maintain our focus on expanding our brands' e-commerce presence, reducing inventory, and driving continuous improvement. Vista Outdoor is well positioned to capitalize on the significant growth opportunities in the outdoor recreation industry, and the Board and I are excited about our future."
Callahan added, "We recently completed the first quarter of our Fiscal Year 2018 and, while we will not report results until August 10, the company had a strong quarter that positions us well to deliver on our full-year financial guidance."
"After a long and rewarding career, it is now time for me to move on to the next phase of my life," said DeYoung. "Vista Outdoor is the culmination of a vision focused on creating a world-leading outdoor recreation company. It has been a rewarding experience to have led this great company and seen the organization evolve and succeed. I am proud of Vista Outdoor's people, brands, portfolio and products, and I am confident in Vista Outdoor's future. I wish the Company's valued employees and customers all the best."

He has been the President and Chief Executive Officer of Aspen Partners, a Utah-based consultant to the outdoor sporting industry, since 2008. From 1990 until his retirement in 2008, Callahan served in various merchandising, marketing, management and senior executive positions with Cabela's, Inc., most recently as Senior Vice President Business Development & International Operations where he was responsible for M&A and spearheaded Cabela's expansion into Canada.

Vista Outdoors shares rise as chairman, CEO retires
Vista Outdoors Inc.  shares rose in the extended session Monday after the outdoor sports and recreation products maker announced the retirement of Chairman and Chief Executive Mark DeYoung. Vista Outdoor shares rose 4% to $23.15 after hours. The company said independent board member Michael Callahan will serve as interim chairman and CEO effective immediately while it conducts an internal and external executive search.

Moody's downgrades Vista Outdoor further into junk territory
Moody's Investors Service downgraded Vista Outdoor Inc.'s  rating to Ba3 from Ba2 on Tuesday, sending it further into junk territory, on concerns about the company's weak operating performance. The outlook on the rating is still negative, meaning Moody's could downgrade it again in the medium term.  "A challenging retail market and weak demand for recreational firearms and accessories is pressuring revenue and margins," said Kevin Cassidy, senior credit officer at Moody's. The company's credit metrics have deteriorated as a result and debt/EBITDA is currently around 4 times, he said. Moody's is expecting leverage to increase to about 4.5 times by March of 2018 as revenue and earnings continue to falter. The negative outlook reflects "the uncertainty over when gun and ammunition demand trends will stabilize and when Vista's operating performance will improve," said Cassidy. Visto shares were down 1.4%, and have fallen 43% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained 8%.

Demand for guns and ammunition collapsed after Trump election, says Vista Outdoor

Corrected            
CORRECTED: Vista Outdoor profit and sales tumble on slumping demand for guns and ammunition
Shares of Vista Outdoor Inc.  tumbled 15% in premarket trade Thursday, after the company posted much weaker-than-expected profit for its fiscal fourth quarter and said demand for guns and ammunition has collapsed since the November election. The company said it had net income of $857,000, or 2 cents a share, in the quarter, down sharply from $37.3 million, or 61 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Adjusted per-share earnings came to 3 cents, way below the 18 cents FactSet consensus. Sales fell to $578.8 million from $612.3 million, ahead of the FactSet consensus of $565 million. "We are experiencing unprecedented decline in demand for ammunition and firearms following the presidential election and softness in the retail environment," Chief Executive Mark DeYoung. "These impacts have manifested themselves in our results." The company is addressing the issue by expanding its e-commerce capabilities, cutting staff, reducing inventory and streamlining operations, he said. "We have also negotiated a long-term agreement with Orbital ATK for the supply of ammunition products produced at the Lake City Army Ammunition Plant through September 2020," said DeYoung. "This new agreement sustains our leadership position in providing these products to the shooting sports market." The company has also amended financial covenants in its credit agreement. Vista Outdoor is expecting fiscal 2018 sales to range from $2.36 billion to $2.42 billion and EPS to range from $1.10 to $1.30. The FactSet consensus is for EPS of $1.74 and sales of $2.43 billion. Shares have fallen 44% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained 7%.

History[edit]
Alliant Techsystems (ATK), entered the ammunition and outdoor products business in 2001. ATK grew through acquisitions and a surge in demand for ammunition for police, hunting, and other private uses.[4]
In December 2014, regulators were informed that Vista Outdoor had signed an agreement for a $350 million secured loan with a term of five years and a $400 million revolving line of credit. Proceeds were partially used to pay down debt.[4] ATK and Orbital filed a joint proxy statement and prospectus describing the share issuance with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 17, 2014. The same month, the Department of Justice granted approval to the merger and spinoff.[2][5]
ATK spun-off Vista Outdoor upon closing its merger with Orbital Sciences and became Orbital ATK on February 9, 2015. Anyone holding ATK common stock at the end of the business day on February 2, 2015 received two shares of Vista Outdoor common stock. Eligible shareholders had their brokerage account credited or received a book-entry account statement reflecting their ownership. Vista Outdoor was thus initially 100% owned by ATK shareholders. Vista Outdoor stock traded on a "when-issued" basis from January 29, 2015 to February 9, 2015. It began "regular way" trading on the New York Stock Exchange on February 10, 2015 under the ticker symbol "VSTO." No payment or action of any kind was required of shareholders. This transaction was conducted on a tax-free basis. U.S. shareholders generally did not have to recognize a gain or loss for federal tax purposes.[1][6][7]
On February 25th, 2016, BRG Sports announced its acceptance of a $400-million cash and earn-out deal to sell its "Action Sports" business to Vista Outdoor. Vista gained control of the Bell Sports, Giro, Blackburn, and C-Preme brands.[8]
Financial results[edit]
For fiscal year 2015, Vista Outdoor reported earnings of $79.5 million or $1.25 per share on $2.08 billion in revenue. [9]
In a January 11, 2017 press release, Vista Outdoor disclosed that it expected to record "a material asset impairment charge in its hunting and shooting accessories reporting unit" for the third quarter of its fiscal year 2017. Vista reported that "the Company's preliminary analysis indicates the impairment charge will be in the range of $400 million to $450 million." [10]
Brands and subsidiaries[edit]
Vista Outdoor's brands and subsidiaries include those listed in detail below as well as the following: Alliant Powder,[11]American Eagle, Bell, Blackburn, Blazer, Cébé, Champion Targets, C-Preme, Fusion, Final Approach, Gold Tip Arrows, Hoppe's, Outers, Primos, Serengeti, Speer, Tasco, Uncle Mike's, and Weaver Optics. Most of Vista's brands are associated with shooting and hunting. The company also makes gear for camping, hiking, skiing, and biking such as flashlights, headlamps, lanterns, helmets, goggles, GPS locators, etc.[2][12]
Bushnell[edit]

Also knowns as Bushnell Outdoor Products, Bushnell specializes in optics and imaging. Its products include binoculars, spotting scopes, telescopes, night vision equipment, GPS devices, laser rangefinders, riflescopes, holographic weapon sights, game cameras, and other high-end optical equipment. It also sells Bollé Performance Eyewear ski goggles and sunglasses and Serengeti Eyewear all-purpose sunglasses. David P. Bushnell founded Bushnell Corporation in 1948 during his service in the Allied-occupied Japan. In 1999, Bushnell was acquired by private equity firm Wind Point Partners. In 2007, Bushnell was acquired by MidOcean Partners, another private equity firm, which acquired it in a leveraged buyout. In 2008, Bushnell acquired the assets of Simmons Outdoor Corporation from Meade Instruments. ATK announced its acquisition of Bushnell on September 5, 2013 for $985 million in cash, subject to post-closing adjustments.[13][14]
CCI[edit]
Main article: CCI (ammunition)
Cascade Cartridge, usually called CCI Ammunition, is based in Lewiston, Idaho. In its infancy, CCI made centerfire primers for government use. As of March 2015, it mainly manufactures rimfire ammunition but also makes centerfire handgun ammunition, primers for reloading and industrial purposes, and shotgun shells. CCI was founded in 1951 by Dick Speer, brother of Speer Bullets founder Vernon Speer. CCI was previously known as the Speer Ammunition Company.[15][16]

Federal Cartridge, usually styled Federal Premium, is located in Anoka, Minnesota. Federal Premium manufactures finished shotshell, centerfire, and rimfire ammunition, as well as powder, primer, and shell casings.[17]
Jimmy Styks[edit]
Kyle Reeves and Jeremy Wilkens founded Jimmy Styks in 2009 in Huntington Beach, California. In July 2015, Vista Outdoor announced its intent to purchase Jimmy Styks for $40 million upfront with additional payments to the founders, who are staying with the company, triggered by meeting financial targets over the next three years. Jimmy Styks makes stand-up paddle boards and accessories. It will be integrated into Vista Outdoor's outdoor products division. This purchase price is multiple of about 5.5 times the expected 2015 calendar year EBITDA.[18]
In January 2016, Vista Outdoor announced that it would use its relationships with retailers to expand the number of stores that offer Jimmy Styks products.[19]

Leadership[edit]
Mark W. DeYoung[edit]
Mark W. DeYoung is Vista Outdoor's chairman and CEO. Before heading Vista Outdoor, DeYoung was President and CEO of Alliant Techsystems (ATK) from 2010 to 2015. During his tenure, ATK completed acquisitions of Savage Arms and Bushnell. In 2015, DeYoung led the transaction that spun-off ATK's sporting goods business to create Vista Outdoor and merged ATK's aerospace and defense units with Orbital Sciences forming Orbital ATK. DeYoung previously headed ATK's Armament Systems group, the company's largest business. Under DeYoung, this unit expanded into new markets and increased its revenue from $600 million in fiscal year 2003 to $2.1 billion in fiscal year 2010.[13][20][21]
DeYoung started his career with Hercules Aerospace in Salt Lake City, Utah in 1985. He held numerous management positions at Hercules in its solid rocket motor and composite structures businesses. After Hercules was acquired by ATK in 1995, DeYoung continued to advance and held roles in finance, operations, composite structures, human resources, and munitions. DeYoung earned an undergraduate degree in business at Weber State University, in Ogden, Utah. He holds an MBA from Westminster College in Salt Lake City, Utah where he taught management and finance and was named "Adjunct Professor of the Year." DeYoung is also a member of Orbital ATK's board of directors.[21][22]
Operations[edit]
Vista Outdoor decided to station its headquarters in Utah after the company applied for and received targeted tax credits from the Utah state government. The company thus capitalized on Utah's goal of recruiting global brand businesses from six strategic economic clusters: outdoor products, life sciences, aerospace/defense, financial services, energy, and software/information technology. In its application, Vista Outdoor said it would invest about $10 million in a new facility where about 90 highly-paid employees would work. Counting medical benefits, these employees will be paid about $125 million over a seven-year period. Utah economic development officials expect about $6.7 million in new tax revenue from the project over this period.[23]
Although its corporate headquarters is in Utah, the leadership teams for individual brands will remain in the locations where products are designed and developed.[2][24][25] Vista Outdoor has about 5,800 employees worldwide, with 4,000 in the United States. The company has manufacturing and support facilities spread over 11 U.S. states, Puerto Rico, Mexico, and Canada. It has sales and sourcing operations in Mexico, Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Asia.[1][25] For example, 1,200 of Vista Outdoor's employees staff an ammunition factory in Lewiston, Idaho.[26]
In June 2015, Vista announced that it would build its new corporate headquarters at Station Park in Farmington City, Utah. As of June 2015, construction was expected to begin during the summer of the same year with completion expected in the middle of 2016. Station Park is a mixed-use development next to a commuter rail station.[27]
In January 2016, Vista opened a factory in American Fork, Utah to manufacture Gold Tip and Bee Stinger archery products.[28] The new factory is significantly larger than the facility it replaced. The additional space is being used for increased research and development, improved production processes, and better employee amenities.[29]

Vista Outdoor decided to station its headquarters in Utah after the company applied for and received targeted tax credits from the Utah state government. The company thus capitalized on Utah's goal of recruiting global brand businesses from six strategic economic clusters: outdoor products, life sciences, aerospace/defense, financial services, energy, and software/information technology. In its application, Vista Outdoor said it would invest about $10 million in a new facility where about 90 highly-paid employees would work. Counting medical benefits, these employees will be paid about $125 million over a seven-year period. Utah economic development officials expect about $6.7 million in new tax revenue from the project over this period.[23]
Although its corporate headquarters is in Utah, the leadership teams for individual brands will remain in the locations where products are designed and developed.[2][24][25] Vista Outdoor has about 5,800 employees worldwide, with 4,000 in the United States. The company has manufacturing and support facilities spread over 11 U.S. states, Puerto Rico, Mexico, and Canada. It has sales and sourcing operations in Mexico, Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Asia.[1][25] For example, 1,200 of Vista Outdoor's employees staff an ammunition factory in Lewiston, Idaho.[26]
In June 2015, Vista announced that it would build its new corporate headquarters at Station Park in Farmington City, Utah. As of June 2015, construction was expected to begin during the summer of the same year with completion expected in the middle of 2016. Station Park is a mixed-use development next to a commuter rail station.[27]
In January 2016, Vista opened a factory in American Fork, Utah to manufacture Gold Tip and Bee Stinger archery products.[28] The new factory is significantly larger than the facility it replaced. The additional space is being used for increased research and development, improved production processes, and better employee amenities.[29]

History[edit]
Alliant Techsystems (ATK), entered the ammunition and outdoor products business in 2001. ATK grew through acquisitions and a surge in demand for ammunition for police, hunting, and other private uses.[4]
In December 2014, regulators were informed that Vista Outdoor had signed an agreement for a $350 million secured loan with a term of five years and a $400 million revolving line of credit. Proceeds were partially used to pay down debt.[4] ATK and Orbital filed a joint proxy statement and prospectus describing the share issuance with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 17, 2014. The same month, the Department of Justice granted approval to the merger and spinoff.[2][5]
ATK spun-off Vista Outdoor upon closing its merger with Orbital Sciences and became Orbital ATK on February 9, 2015. Anyone holding ATK common stock at the end of the business day on February 2, 2015 received two shares of Vista Outdoor common stock. Eligible shareholders had their brokerage account credited or received a book-entry account statement reflecting their ownership. Vista Outdoor was thus initially 100% owned by ATK shareholders. Vista Outdoor stock traded on a "when-issued" basis from January 29, 2015 to February 9, 2015. It began "regular way" trading on the New York Stock Exchange on February 10, 2015 under the ticker symbol "VSTO." No payment or action of any kind was required of shareholders. This transaction was conducted on a tax-free basis. U.S. shareholders generally did not have to recognize a gain or loss for federal tax purposes.[1][6][7]
On February 25th, 2016, BRG Sports announced its acceptance of a $400-million cash and earn-out deal to sell its "Action Sports" business to Vista Outdoor. Vista gained control of the Bell Sports, Giro, Blackburn, and C-Preme brands.[8]
Financial results[edit]
For fiscal year 2015, Vista Outdoor reported earnings of $79.5 million or $1.25 per share on $2.08 billion in revenue. [9]
In a January 11, 2017 press release, Vista Outdoor disclosed that it expected to record "a material asset impairment charge in its hunting and shooting accessories reporting unit" for the third quarter of its fiscal year 2017. Vista reported that "the Company's preliminary analysis indicates the impairment charge will be in the range of $400 million to $450 million." [10]
Brands and subsidiaries[edit]
Vista Outdoor's brands and subsidiaries include those listed in detail below as well as the following: Alliant Powder,[11]American Eagle, Bell, Blackburn, Blazer, Cébé, Champion Targets, C-Preme, Fusion, Final Approach, Gold Tip Arrows, Hoppe's, Outers, Primos, Serengeti, Speer, Tasco, Uncle Mike's, and Weaver Optics. Most of Vista's brands are associated with shooting and hunting. The company also makes gear for camping, hiking, skiing, and biking such as flashlights, headlamps, lanterns, helmets, goggles, GPS locators, etc.[2][12]
Bushnell[edit]
Main article: Bushnell Corporation

Also knowns as Bushnell Outdoor Products, Bushnell specializes in optics and imaging. Its products include binoculars, spotting scopes, telescopes, night vision equipment, GPS devices, laser rangefinders, riflescopes, holographic weapon sights, game cameras, and other high-end optical equipment. It also sells Bollé Performance Eyewear ski goggles and sunglasses and Serengeti Eyewear all-purpose sunglasses. David P. Bushnell founded Bushnell Corporation in 1948 during his service in the Allied-occupied Japan. In 1999, Bushnell was acquired by private equity firm Wind Point Partners. In 2007, Bushnell was acquired by MidOcean Partners, another private equity firm, which acquired it in a leveraged buyout. In 2008, Bushnell acquired the assets of Simmons Outdoor Corporation from Meade Instruments. ATK announced its acquisition of Bushnell on September 5, 2013 for $985 million in cash, subject to post-closing adjustments.[13][14]
CCI[edit]
Main article: CCI (ammunition)
Cascade Cartridge, usually called CCI Ammunition, is based in Lewiston, Idaho. In its infancy, CCI made centerfire primers for government use. As of March 2015, it mainly manufactures rimfire ammunition but also makes centerfire handgun ammunition, primers for reloading and industrial purposes, and shotgun shells. CCI was founded in 1951 by Dick Speer, brother of Speer Bullets founder Vernon Speer. CCI was previously known as the Speer Ammunition Company.[15][16]

Federal Cartridge, usually styled Federal Premium, is located in Anoka, Minnesota. Federal Premium manufactures finished shotshell, centerfire, and rimfire ammunition, as well as powder, primer, and shell casings.[17]
Jimmy Styks[edit]
Kyle Reeves and Jeremy Wilkens founded Jimmy Styks in 2009 in Huntington Beach, California. In July 2015, Vista Outdoor announced its intent to purchase Jimmy Styks for $40 million upfront with additional payments to the founders, who are staying with the company, triggered by meeting financial targets over the next three years. Jimmy Styks makes stand-up paddle boards and accessories. It will be integrated into Vista Outdoor's outdoor products division. This purchase price is multiple of about 5.5 times the expected 2015 calendar year EBITDA.[18]
In January 2016, Vista Outdoor announced that it would use its relationships with retailers to expand the number of stores that offer Jimmy Styks products.[19]

Leadership[edit]
Mark W. DeYoung[edit]
Mark W. DeYoung is Vista Outdoor's chairman and CEO. Before heading Vista Outdoor, DeYoung was President and CEO of Alliant Techsystems (ATK) from 2010 to 2015. During his tenure, ATK completed acquisitions of Savage Arms and Bushnell. In 2015, DeYoung led the transaction that spun-off ATK's sporting goods business to create Vista Outdoor and merged ATK's aerospace and defense units with Orbital Sciences forming Orbital ATK. DeYoung previously headed ATK's Armament Systems group, the company's largest business. Under DeYoung, this unit expanded into new markets and increased its revenue from $600 million in fiscal year 2003 to $2.1 billion in fiscal year 2010.[13][20][21]
DeYoung started his career with Hercules Aerospace in Salt Lake City, Utah in 1985. He held numerous management positions at Hercules in its solid rocket motor and composite structures businesses. After Hercules was acquired by ATK in 1995, DeYoung continued to advance and held roles in finance, operations, composite structures, human resources, and munitions. DeYoung earned an undergraduate degree in business at Weber State University, in Ogden, Utah. He holds an MBA from Westminster College in Salt Lake City, Utah where he taught management and finance and was named "Adjunct Professor of the Year." DeYoung is also a member of Orbital ATK's board of directors.[21][22]

Vista Outdoor decided to station its headquarters in Utah after the company applied for and received targeted tax credits from the Utah state government. The company thus capitalized on Utah's goal of recruiting global brand businesses from six strategic economic clusters: outdoor products, life sciences, aerospace/defense, financial services, energy, and software/information technology.

Counting medical benefits, these employees will be paid about $125 million over a seven-year period. Utah economic development officials expect about $6.7 million in new tax revenue from the project over this period.[23]
Although its corporate headquarters is in Utah, the leadership teams for individual brands will remain in the locations where products are designed and developed.[2][24][25] Vista Outdoor has about 5,800 employees worldwide, with 4,000 in the United States. The company has manufacturing and support facilities spread over 11 U.S. states, Puerto Rico, Mexico, and Canada. It has sales and sourcing operations in Mexico, Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Asia.[1][25] For example, 1,200 of Vista Outdoor's employees staff an ammunition factory in Lewiston, Idaho.[26]
In June 2015, Vista announced that it would build its new corporate headquarters at Station Park in Farmington City, Utah.

Leadership[edit]
Mark W. DeYoung[edit]
Mark W. DeYoung is Vista Outdoor's chairman and CEO. Before heading Vista Outdoor, DeYoung was President and CEO of Alliant Techsystems (ATK) from 2010 to 2015. During his tenure, ATK completed acquisitions of Savage Arms and Bushnell. In 2015, DeYoung led the transaction that spun-off ATK's sporting goods business to create Vista Outdoor and merged ATK's aerospace and defense units with Orbital Sciences forming Orbital ATK. DeYoung previously headed ATK's Armament Systems group, the company's largest business. Under DeYoung, this unit expanded into new markets and increased its revenue from $600 million in fiscal year 2003 to $2.1 billion in fiscal year 2010.[13][20][21]
DeYoung started his career with Hercules Aerospace in Salt Lake City, Utah in 1985. He held numerous management positions at Hercules in its solid rocket motor and composite structures businesses. After Hercules was acquired by ATK in 1995, DeYoung continued to advance and held roles in finance, operations, composite structures, human resources, and munitions. DeYoung earned an undergraduate degree in business at Weber State University, in Ogden, Utah. He holds an MBA from Westminster College in Salt Lake City, Utah where he taught management and finance and was named "Adjunct Professor of the Year." DeYoung is also a member of Orbital ATK's board of directors.[21][22]
Operations[edit]
Vista Outdoor decided to station its headquarters in Utah after the company applied for and received targeted tax credits from the Utah state government. The company thus capitalized on Utah's goal of recruiting global brand businesses from six strategic economic clusters: outdoor products, life sciences, aerospace/defense, financial services, energy, and software/information technology. In its application, Vista Outdoor said it would invest about $10 million in a new facility where about 90 highly-paid employees would work. Counting medical benefits, these employees will be paid about $125 million over a seven-year period. Utah economic development officials expect about $6.7 million in new tax revenue from the project over this period.[23]
Although its corporate headquarters is in Utah, the leadership teams for individual brands will remain in the locations where products are designed and developed.[2][24][25] Vista Outdoor has about 5,800 employees worldwide, with 4,000 in the United States. The company has manufacturing and support facilities spread over 11 U.S. states, Puerto Rico, Mexico, and Canada. It has sales and sourcing operations in Mexico, Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Asia.[1][25] For example, 1,200 of Vista Outdoor's employees staff an ammunition factory in Lewiston, Idaho.[26]
In June 2015, Vista announced that it would build its new corporate headquarters at Station Park in Farmington City, Utah. As of June 2015, construction was expected to begin during the summer of the same year with completion expected in the middle of 2016. Station Park is a mixed-use development next to a commuter rail station.[27]
In January 2016, Vista opened a factory in American Fork, Utah to manufacture Gold Tip and Bee Stinger archery products.[28] The new factory is significantly larger than the facility it replaced. The additional space is being used for increased research and development, improved production processes, and better employee amenities.[29]

History[edit]
Alliant Techsystems (ATK), entered the ammunition and outdoor products business in 2001. ATK grew through acquisitions and a surge in demand for ammunition for police, hunting, and other private uses.[4]
In December 2014, regulators were informed that Vista Outdoor had signed an agreement for a $350 million secured loan with a term of five years and a $400 million revolving line of credit. Proceeds were partially used to pay down debt.[4] ATK and Orbital filed a joint proxy statement and prospectus describing the share issuance with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 17, 2014. The same month, the Department of Justice granted approval to the merger and spinoff.[2][5]
ATK spun-off Vista Outdoor upon closing its merger with Orbital Sciences and became Orbital ATK on February 9, 2015. Anyone holding ATK common stock at the end of the business day on February 2, 2015 received two shares of Vista Outdoor common stock. Eligible shareholders had their brokerage account credited or received a book-entry account statement reflecting their ownership. Vista Outdoor was thus initially 100% owned by ATK shareholders. Vista Outdoor stock traded on a "when-issued" basis from January 29, 2015 to February 9, 2015. It began "regular way" trading on the New York Stock Exchange on February 10, 2015 under the ticker symbol "VSTO." No payment or action of any kind was required of shareholders. This transaction was conducted on a tax-free basis. U.S. shareholders generally did not have to recognize a gain or loss for federal tax purposes.[1][6][7]
On February 25th, 2016, BRG Sports announced its acceptance of a $400-million cash and earn-out deal to sell its "Action Sports" business to Vista Outdoor. Vista gained control of the Bell Sports, Giro, Blackburn, and C-Preme brands.[8]
Financial results[edit]
For fiscal year 2015, Vista Outdoor reported earnings of $79.5 million or $1.25 per share on $2.08 billion in revenue. [9]
In a January 11, 2017 press release, Vista Outdoor disclosed that it expected to record "a material asset impairment charge in its hunting and shooting accessories reporting unit" for the third quarter of its fiscal year 2017. Vista reported that "the Company's preliminary analysis indicates the impairment charge will be in the range of $400 million to $450 million." [10]
Brands and subsidiaries[edit]
Vista Outdoor's brands and subsidiaries include those listed in detail below as well as the following: Alliant Powder,[11]American Eagle, Bell, Blackburn, Blazer, Cébé, Champion Targets, C-Preme, Fusion, Final Approach, Gold Tip Arrows, Hoppe's, Outers, Primos, Serengeti, Speer, Tasco, Uncle Mike's, and Weaver Optics. Most of Vista's brands are associated with shooting and hunting. The company also makes gear for camping, hiking, skiing, and biking such as flashlights, headlamps, lanterns, helmets, goggles, GPS locators, etc.[2][12]

OVERLAND PARK, Kansas -Champion Traps and Targets,  makers of interactive and challenging target systems, announced that the 2017 Tom Knapp Memorial Scholarships were awarded to Sandra Gaylord of California and Grace Larson of Wisconsin during a ceremony at the recent National 4-H Shooting Sports Championships in Nebraska.
      

        The scholarship program was created to honor legendary exhibition shooter Tom Knapp, who passed away in April 2013. Champion Traps and Targets teamed with the National 4-H Shooting Sports Committee to create the Tom Knapp Memorial Scholarship. Tom Knapp was a long time ambassador for both Champion and Federal Premium Ammunition, and was included in licensed products from Champion. With the support of Knapp's wife, Colleen, Champion extended his licensed products program to fund an endowed scholarship that will award $2,500 each to two National 4-H Ambassadors per year.
      

        'Tom was a tireless advocate for the shooting sports, and we are happy that these scholarships awarded in his name go to young people who are also role models in the shooting sports,' said Ryan Bronson, Director of Conservation for Champion Traps and Targets. 'We look forward to seeing the impact Sandra and Grace make on the world.'
      

        Applicants for the scholarship are required to be 4-H Shooting Sports Ambassadors with a 3.0 or higher GPA, and be enrolled in an accredited college or university. 
      

        Champion is a Vista Outdoor brand. For more information, visit www.championtarget.com

Vista Outdoors shares rise as chairman, CEO retires
Vista Outdoors Inc.  shares rose in the extended session Monday after the outdoor sports and recreation products maker announced the retirement of Chairman and Chief Executive Mark DeYoung. Vista Outdoor shares rose 4% to $23.15 after hours. The company said independent board member Michael Callahan will serve as interim chairman and CEO effective immediately while it conducts an internal and external executive search.

Moody's downgrades Vista Outdoor further into junk territory
Moody's Investors Service downgraded Vista Outdoor Inc.'s  rating to Ba3 from Ba2 on Tuesday, sending it further into junk territory, on concerns about the company's weak operating performance. The outlook on the rating is still negative, meaning Moody's could downgrade it again in the medium term.  "A challenging retail market and weak demand for recreational firearms and accessories is pressuring revenue and margins," said Kevin Cassidy, senior credit officer at Moody's. The company's credit metrics have deteriorated as a result and debt/EBITDA is currently around 4 times, he said. Moody's is expecting leverage to increase to about 4.5 times by March of 2018 as revenue and earnings continue to falter. The negative outlook reflects "the uncertainty over when gun and ammunition demand trends will stabilize and when Vista's operating performance will improve," said Cassidy. Visto shares were down 1.4%, and have fallen 43% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained 8%.

Demand for guns and ammunition collapsed after Trump election, says Vista Outdoor

Corrected            
CORRECTED: Vista Outdoor profit and sales tumble on slumping demand for guns and ammunition
Shares of Vista Outdoor Inc.  tumbled 15% in premarket trade Thursday, after the company posted much weaker-than-expected profit for its fiscal fourth quarter and said demand for guns and ammunition has collapsed since the November election. The company said it had net income of $857,000, or 2 cents a share, in the quarter, down sharply from $37.3 million, or 61 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Adjusted per-share earnings came to 3 cents, way below the 18 cents FactSet consensus. Sales fell to $578.8 million from $612.3 million, ahead of the FactSet consensus of $565 million. "We are experiencing unprecedented decline in demand for ammunition and firearms following the presidential election and softness in the retail environment," Chief Executive Mark DeYoung. "These impacts have manifested themselves in our results." The company is addressing the issue by expanding its e-commerce capabilities, cutting staff, reducing inventory and streamlining operations, he said. "We have also negotiated a long-term agreement with Orbital ATK for the supply of ammunition products produced at the Lake City Army Ammunition Plant through September 2020," said DeYoung. "This new agreement sustains our leadership position in providing these products to the shooting sports market." The company has also amended financial covenants in its credit agreement. Vista Outdoor is expecting fiscal 2018 sales to range from $2.36 billion to $2.42 billion and EPS to range from $1.10 to $1.30. The FactSet consensus is for EPS of $1.74 and sales of $2.43 billion. Shares have fallen 44% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained 7%.
