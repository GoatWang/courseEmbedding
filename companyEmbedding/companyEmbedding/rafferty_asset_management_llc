Direxion Launches New S&P 500® Bear ETF
Jun 8 16
Direxion announced it has added a new ETF to its existing lineup of inverse ETFs. The new Fund allows tactical managers to hedge against downturns in the S&P® 500. The Direxion Daily S&P 500® Bear 1X Shares seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses, of 100% of the inverse of the performance of the S&P 500® Index. Like all inverse ETFs, this Fund is intended only for traders with an understanding of the risks associated with seeking inverse investment results, and who plan to actively monitor and manage their positions. There is no guarantee the Fund will meet its objective.

BOSTON, Dec. 14, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- The Board of Trustees of the Direxion Shares ETF Trust has decided to liquidate and shutter three exchange-traded funds ("Funds") based on the recommendation of Rafferty Asset Management, LLC, the Trust's advisor. 
(Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20100701/NY29766LOGO)
Due to the Funds' inability to attract sufficient investment assets, Rafferty believes they cannot continue to conduct their business and operations in an economically efficient manner. As a result, the Board concluded that liquidating and shuttering the Funds would be in the best interests of the Funds and their shareholders.
The Trust will close the following funds: Direxion Large Cap Insider Sentiment Shares (INSD), Direxion S&P 1500 DRRC Index Volatility Response Shares (VSPR) and Direxion S&P Latin America 40 DRRC Index Volatility Response Shares (VLAT).
Shares of the Funds will stop trading on the NYSE Arca, Inc., and will no longer be open to purchase by investors, at the close of regular trading on January 18, 2013. Shareholders may sell their holdings in the Funds prior to the closing date, and those transactions are subject to customary brokerage charges. Between the closing date and the liquidation date, shareholders may only be able to sell their shares to certain broker-dealers and there is no assurance that there will be a market for the Funds during that time period.  
On January 25, 2013, the Funds will liquidate their assets and distribute cash pro rata to shareholders who have not previously redeemed or exchanged their shares. These payments are taxable and will include any accrued capital gains and dividends. Each Fund's net asset value will reflect the costs of closing the Fund as calculated on the liquidation date. The Funds will close when the distributions are complete.
The process of closing down and liquidating the Funds' portfolios, scheduled to take place between January 18, 2013 and January 25, 2013, will result in the Funds not tracking their underlying indexes and experiencing an increase in cash holdings. These developments may not be consistent with each Fund's investment objective and strategy.
For more information about the liquidation and termination process, please contact Direxion at 800-851-0511.
For more information about Direxion, please contact James Doyle at 973-850-7308 or jdoyle@jcprinc.com. 
About Direxion 
Direxion Funds and Direxion Shares, managed by Rafferty Asset Management, LLC, offer leveraged index funds, ETFs and alternative-class fund products for investment advisors and sophisticated investors who seek to effectively manage risk and return in both bull and bear markets. Founded in 1997, the company has approximately $7 billion in assets under management as of 9/30/12. The company's business model is built on continuous product innovation, exceptional customer service and a commitment to building strategic relationships with distribution partners. For more information, please visit www.direxionfunds.com or www.direxionshares.com. 
There is no guarantee that the funds will achieve their objectives. 
For more information on all Direxion Shares daily leveraged ETFs, go to www.direxionshares.com, or call us at 866.476.7523.
The ETFs are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by sophisticated investors who understand leverage risk, consequences of seeking daily leveraged investment results and intend to actively monitor and manage their investments. Due to the daily nature of the leverage employed, there is no guarantee of amplified long-term returns. Past performance is not indicative of future results. 
An investor should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of Direxion Shares carefully before investing. The prospectus and summary prospectus contains this and other information about Direxion Shares. Download a prospectus and summary prospectus at www.direxionshares.com. The prospectus and summary prospectus should be read carefully before investing.
Risks:Investing in the funds may be more volatile than investing in broadly diversified funds. The use of leverage by a fund increases the risk to the fund. The more a fund invests in leveraged instruments the more the leverage will magnify gains or losses on those investments. There is no assurance that the Funds will achieve their objectives and an investment in a Fund could lose money. No single Fund is a complete investment program. The Funds are not designed to, and will not necessarily, track the underlying index or benchmark over a longer period of time. One cannot invest directly in an index.
An investment in the Funds involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. The Funds are non-diversified and include concentration risk that results from the Funds' investments in a particular industry or sector which can increase volatility. The use of derivatives such as futures contracts, forward contracts, options and swaps are subject to market risks that may cause their price to fluctuate over time. The Fund does not attempt to, and should not be expected to, provide returns which are a multiple of the return of the Index for periods other than a single day. For other risks including correlation, leverage, compounding, market volatility and specific risks regarding each sector, please read the prospectus.

        August 27, 2009.
        
          AGENCY:
Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”).
ACTION:
Notice of an application to amend a prior order under section 6(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (“Act”) granting an exemption from sections 2(a)(32), 5(a)(1), 22(d), 22(e) and 24(d) of the Act and rule 22c-1 under the Act, and under sections 6(c) and 17(b) of the Act for an exemption from sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(2) of the Act.

Applicants: Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Adviser”) and Direxion Shares ETF Trust (“Trust”).

Summary of Application: Applicants request an order to amend a prior order that permits: (a) Series of an open-end management investment company to issue shares (“ETS”) redeemable in large aggregations only (“Creation Units”); (b) secondary market transactions in ETS to occur at negotiated prices; (c) dealers to sell ETS to purchasers in the secondary market unaccompanied by a prospectus, when prospectus delivery is not required by the Securities Act of 1933; (d) certain series to pay redemption proceeds, under certain circumstances, more than seven days after the tender of ETS for redemption; and (e) certain affiliated persons of the series to deposit securities into, and receive securities from, the series in connection with the purchase and redemption of Creation Units (“Prior Order”).[1] 
           Applicants seek to amend the Prior Order to: (a) Provide greater operational flexibility to the existing and future series of the Trust (“Funds”); (b) expand the category of Funds designed to correspond to the return of an underlying securities index (“Underlying Index” and such Funds, the “Conventional Funds”) to include Funds that seek to match the performance of an Underlying Index primarily focused on United States equity securities that apply a strategy referred to as 130/30 (“130/30 Funds”); (c) supersede the definition of Leveraged Funds and Inverse Funds in the application on which the Prior Order was issued (“Prior Application”); (d) delete the relief granted in the Prior Order from section 24(d) of the Act and revise the Prior Application accordingly; and (e) amend the terms and conditions of the Prior Application with respect to certain disclosure requirements.

Filing Dates: The application was filed on December 17, 2008, and amended on February 13, 2009, June 3, 2009 and July 20, 2009.

Hearing or Notification of Hearing: An order granting the requested relief will be issued unless the Commission orders a hearing. Interested persons may request a hearing by writing to the Commission's Secretary and serving applicants with a copy of the request, personally or by mail. Hearing requests should be received by the Commission by 5:30 p.m. on September 21, 2009, and should be accompanied by proof of service on applicants, in the form of an affidavit or, for lawyers, a certificate of service. Hearing requests should state the nature of the writer's interest, the reason for the request, and the issues contested. Persons who wish to be notified of a hearing may request notification by writing to the Commission's Secretary.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained via the Commission's Web site by searching for the file number, or an applicant using the Company name box, at http://www.sec.gov/​search/​search.htm or by calling (202) 551-8090.

Applicants' Representations:

1. The Trust is an open-end management investment company registered under the Act and organized as a Delaware statutory trust. The Trust offers series that operate pursuant to the Prior Order. The Adviser, which is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”), or an entity controlled by or under common control with the Adviser will serve as investment adviser to each Fund.
2. Applicants request relief that would provide greater operational flexibility to the Funds by permitting: (a) The Funds to enter into short positions in the component securities comprising the relevant Underlying Index (“Component Securities”); (b) each Conventional Fund to invest at least 80% of its total assets (exclusive of collateral held for purposes of securities lending) in Component Securities and/or investments that have economic characteristics that are substantially identical to the economic characteristics of Component Securities; and (c) Leveraged Funds (defined below) to determine what percentage, if any, of its total assets to invest in Component Securities. Applicants state this greater operational flexibility will provide the Funds with the ability to pursue more cost-effective techniques in seeking to achieve their investment objectives. “Leveraged Funds” are Funds that seek a specified multiple, up to 300%, of the performance of an Underlying Index Start Printed Page 45496and “Inverse Funds” are Funds that seek a specified multiple, up to 300%, of the inverse performance of an Underlying Index.
3. Applicants also seek to amend the terms and conditions of the Prior Application to provide that all representations and conditions contained in the Prior Application that require a Fund to disclose particular information in the Fund's prospectus (“Prospectus”) and/or annual report shall be effective with respect to the Fund until the time that the Fund complies with the disclosure requirements adopted by the Commission in Investment Company Act Release No. 28584 (Jan. 13, 2009) (“Summary Prospectus Rule”). Applicants state that such amendment is warranted because the Commission's amendments to Form N-1A with regard to exchange-traded funds as part of the Summary Prospectus Rule reflect the Commission's view with respect to the appropriate types of prospectus and annual report disclosures for an exchange-traded fund.
4. Applicants also seek relief to introduce Conventional Funds that will be 130/30 Funds. Applicants state that in general, “130/30” strategies: (a) establish long positions in securities such that total long exposure amounts to approximately 130% of net assets; and (b) simultaneously establish short positions in other securities such that total short exposure amounts to approximately 30% of net assets. Each 130/30 Fund will hold at least 80% of its total assets (exclusive of collateral held for purposes of securities lending) in the Component Securities that are specified for the long positions and could invest up to 20% in such Component Securities, cash equivalents or other securities. The 130/30 Funds would also enter into financial instruments to obtain any remaining 50% long and 30% short positions dictated by its Underlying Index. The 130/30 Funds will provide full portfolio disclosure so that the intraday value of a 130/30 Fund can accurately be calculated, market participants will be able to understand the principal investment strategies of the 130/30 Funds, and informed trading of 130/30 Funds' ETS may occur. The creation and redemption process for the 130/30 Funds will be the same as for the existing Leveraged Funds in that Creation Units of 130/30 Funds will generally be purchased and redeemed for a basket of in-kind securities and cash, or solely cash.
5. Applicants believe that the requested relief continues to meet the necessary exemptive standards.

Applicants' Legal Analysis:

1. Section 6(c) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt any person, security or transaction, or any class of persons, securities or transactions, from any provision of the Act, if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act.
2. Applicants seek to amend the Prior Order to delete the relief granted from section 24(d) of the Act. Applicants state that the deletion of the exemption from section 24(d) that was granted in the Prior Order is warranted because the adoption of the Summary Prospectus Rule should supplant any need by a Fund to use a product description (“Product Description”). The deletion of the relief granted with respect to section 24(d) of the Act from the Prior Order will also result in the deletion of related discussions in the Prior Application, revision of the Prior Application to delete references to Product Description including in the conditions, and the deletion of condition 4 of the Prior Order.

Applicants' Conditions:

Applicants agree that any amended order granting the requested relief will be subject to the same conditions as those imposed by the Prior Order except for condition 4 which will be deleted. All representations and conditions contained in the application and the Prior Application that require a Fund to disclose particular information in the Fund's Prospectus and/or annual report shall remain effective with respect to the Fund until the time that the Fund complies with the disclosure requirements adopted by the Commission in Investment Company Act Release No. 28584 (Jan. 13, 2009).

Rafferty Asset Management Closing Inverse Equity ETF






Jun 21, 2016, 5:43pm EDT














NEW YORK, June 21, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- The Board of Trustees of the Direxion Shares ETF Trust has decided to liquidate and close the Direxion Daily Total Market Bear 1X Shares (TOTS) ("the Fund") based on the recommendation of Rafferty Asset Management, LLC, the Trust's advisor.

Due to the Fund's inability to attract sufficient investment assets, Rafferty believes they cannot continue to conduct their business and operations in an economically efficient manner. As a result, the Board concluded that liquidating and closing the Fund would be in the best interest of the Fund and its shareholders.
Shares of the Fund will stop trading on the NYSE Arca, Inc., and will no longer be open to purchase by investors, at the close of regular trading on July 15, 2016 ("the Closing Date"). Shareholders may sell their holdings in the Fund prior to July 15, 2016, and those transactions may be subject to customary brokerage charges. Between July 18, 2016 and July 22, 2016 (the "Liquidation Date"), shareholders may only be able to sell their shares to certain broker-dealers and there is no assurance there will be a market for the Fund during that time period. Between the Closing Date and the Liquidation Date, the Fund will be in the process of closing down and liquidating its portfolio. This process will result in the Fund increasing its cash holdings and, as a consequence, not tracking its underlying index, which may not be consistent with the Fund's investment objective and strategy.
On or about the Liquidation Date, the Fund will liquidate its assets and distribute cash pro rata to all remaining shareholders who have not previously redeemed or exchanged their shares. These distributions are taxable events. In addition, these payments to shareholders will include accrued capital gains and dividends, if any. As calculated on the Liquidation Date, the Fund's net asset value will reflect the costs of closing the Fund. Once the distributions are complete, the Fund will terminate.
For more information about the liquidation and termination process, please contact Direxion at 866-476-7523. For media inquiries, please contact James Doyle at 973-850-7308 or jdoyle@jconnelly.com. 
About Direxion:
Direxion builds bold products for investors who want more than the status quo. Our index-based products deliver directional options, magnified exposure, and long-term, rules-based strategies. Founded in 1997, the company has approximately $9.8 billion in assets under management as of March 31, 2016.

There is no guarantee that the funds will achieve their objectives. 
For more information on all Direxion Shares daily leveraged and inverse ETFs, go to direxioninvestments.com, or call us at 866-476-7523.
The ETFs are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand the risks associated with seeking daily inverse investment results, and intend to actively monitor and manage their investments. Due to the daily nature of the inverse investment strategies employed, there is no guarantee of long-term inverse returns. Past performance is not indicative of future results. 
An investor should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of Direxion ETFs carefully before investing. The prospectus and summary prospectus contains this and other information about Direxion ETFs. Download a prospectus and summary prospectus at direxioninvestments.com. The prospectus and summary prospectus should be read carefully before investing.
Risks:
An investment in the ETFs involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. The ETFs are non-diversified and include risks associated with concentration risk that results from the Funds' investments in a particular industry or sector which can increase volatility. The use of derivatives such as futures contracts, forward contracts, options and swaps are subject to market risks that may cause their price to fluctuate over time. The Fund does not attempt to, and should not be expected to, provide returns which are a multiple of the return of the Index for periods other than a single day. For other risks including correlation, compounding, market volatility and specific risks regarding each sector, please read the prospectus.
Distributor: Foreside Fund Services, LLC.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the Public Reference Branch, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F Street, NE., Washington DC 20549-1520, telephone (202) 551-5850. 
Applicants' Representations 
1. The Trust is an open-end management investment company registered under the Act and organized as a Delaware statutory trust. The Trust is authorized to offer an unlimited number of series (the “Funds”). The Adviser is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”). The Trust will initially offer thirty-two series (“Initial Funds”) with different types of investment objectives as further described below.[1] 
           Applicants may offer additional Funds in the future (“Future Funds” and included in the term Funds).[2] 
           Each Fund will be advised by the Adviser. The Adviser may enter into subadvisory agreements with additional investment advisers to act as subadvisers to the Trust and any of the Funds. Any subadviser to the Trust or a Fund will be registered under the Advisers Act. A broker-dealer registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) will act as the distributor and principal underwriter of each Fund's Creation Units of ETS (“Distributor”).
2. The Funds will seek daily investment results, before fees and expenses, that: (a) Correspond to the return of particular foreign equity indices (“Underlying Foreign Indices”), domestic equity indices (“Underlying Domestic Indices”) or fixed income securities indices (“Underlying Fixed Income Indices” together with the Underlying Foreign Indices and the Underlying Domestic Indices, the “Underlying Indices”) [3] 
           (such Funds are referred to as the “Conventional Funds”); (b) provide up to 400% of the return of their Underlying Indices (“Leveraged Funds”); or (c) provide up to 400% of the inverse performance of their Underlying Indices (“Inverse Funds”).[4] 

3. Conventional Funds and Leveraged Funds based on Underlying Domestic Indices will invest at least 95% and 80%, respectively, of their total assets in the equity securities contained in the relevant Underlying Domestic Index. Conventional Funds and Leveraged Funds based on Underlying Fixed Income Indices will invest at least 80% of their total assets in the securities that comprise the relevant Underlying Fixed Income Index. Conventional Funds and Leveraged Funds based on Underlying Foreign Indices will invest at least 80% of their total assets in the equity securities contained in the relevant Underlying Foreign Index and depositary receipts representing such securities.[5] 

4. Additionally, the Funds may invest in short-term debt instruments that meet the definition of “Eligible Security” in rule 2a-7 under the Act (“Money Market Instruments”), and in futures contracts, options, equity caps, collars and floors, swap agreements, forward contracts, and reverse repurchase agreements (collectively, “Financial Instruments”) in order to meet their investment objectives. The Inverse Funds will only invest in Financial Instruments and Money Market Instruments; they will not invest in the component securities of their Underlying Indices. 
5. A Conventional Fund will utilize either a replication or representative sampling strategy. A Conventional Fund using a “replication” strategy will invest in substantially all of the Component Securities in its Underlying Index in approximately the same proportions as in the Underlying Index. A Conventional Fund using a representative sampling strategy will invest in some, but not all, of the relevant Component Securities. The Adviser will seek to achieve the investment objectives of the Leveraged Funds and the Inverse Funds by using a mathematical model that takes into account a variety of specified criteria, the most important of which are: (a) The net assets in each Fund's portfolio at the end of each trading day; (b) the amount of required exposure to the Underlying Index; and (c) the positions in equity and fixed income securities, Financial Instruments and Money Market Instruments at the beginning of each trading day. On each day that a Fund is required to be open under section 22(e) of the Act (“Business Day”) the full portfolio holdings of each Fund will be disclosed on the website of the Trust and/or the Exchange on which ETS are primarily listed (“Primary Listing Exchange”). The portfolio holdings information disclosed each Business Day will form the basis for that Fund's net asset value (“NAV”) calculation as of 4:00 pm Eastern Time that day and will reflect portfolio trades made on the immediately preceding Business Day. Intra-day values of each Underlying Domestic Index and Underlying Foreign Index will be disseminated every 15 seconds throughout the trading day. The value of Underlying Fixed Income Indices will be calculated and published once per day. 
6. Applicants expect that each Conventional Fund will have an annual tracking error of less than 5% over the course of the year (excluding the impact of expenses and interest, if any) to the performance of its Underlying Index. For Leveraged Funds and Inverse Funds, applicants expect a tracking error of less than 5% over the course of a year (excluding the impact of expenses and interest, if any) to the specified multiple or inverse multiple, respectively, of the performance of the relevant Underlying Index. 
7. Each Fund will issue Creation Units of approximately 25,000 to 100,000 ETS. Applicants expect the initial offering price of a Creation Unit to be a minimum of $1 million. All orders to purchase Creation Units must be placed on a Business Day with the Distributor by or through a party that has entered into a participant agreement with the Distributor (an “Authorized Participant”). An Authorized Participant must be either (a) a broker-dealer or other participant in the continuous net settlement system of the National Securities Clearing Corporation, a clearing agency that is registered with the Commission, or (b) a participant in the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) system. The Distributor also will be responsible for delivering the Prospectus to those persons purchasing Creation Units and for maintaining records of the orders Start Printed Page 54181and acknowledgements of acceptance for orders. 
8. Creation Units of Conventional and Leveraged Funds generally will be purchased and redeemed in exchange for an “in-kind” transfer of securities (“In-Kind Payment”) and cash. Inverse Funds will generally be purchased and redeemed entirely for cash because of the limited transferability of Financial Instruments.[6] 
           An investor making an In-Kind Payment will be required to transfer to the Trust a “Deposit Basket” consisting of: (a) A basket of securities consisting of some or all of the securities in the relevant Underlying Index or other securities selected by the Adviser to correspond to the performance of the Underlying Index (the “Deposit Securities”); and (b) a “Balancing Amount.” The Balancing Amount will be equal to the differential, if any, between the total aggregate market value of the Deposit Securities, or in the case of redemptions, the Redemption Securities (defined below), and the NAV per Creation Unit.[7] 
           An investor purchasing or redeeming a Creation Unit from a Fund will be charged a fee (“Transaction Fee”) to prevent the dilution of the interests of the remaining shareholders resulting from the Fund incurring costs in connection with the purchase and redemption of the Creation Units.[8] 
           The maximum Transaction Fee and any variations or waivers of the Transaction Fee will be disclosed in the prospectus for ETS (“Prospectus”) and the method of determining the Transaction Fees will be disclosed in the Prospectus and/or statement of additional information (“SAI”). 
9. Persons purchasing Creation Units from a Fund may hold the ETS or sell some or all of them in the secondary market. ETS of the Funds will be listed on an Exchange and trade in the secondary market in the same manner as other exchange-traded funds. It is expected that one or more Exchange member firms will act as a specialist (“Exchange Specialist”) or market maker (“Market Maker”) and maintain a market on the Primary Listing Exchange for ETS. The price of ETS traded on an Exchange will be based on a current bid/offer market. The initial trading price for ETS of each Fund will fall in the range of $50 to $250. Transactions involving the sale of ETS in the secondary market will be subject to customary brokerage commissions and charges. 
10. Applicants expect that purchasers of Creation Units will include institutional and retail investors, arbitrageurs, traders, financial advisors, portfolio managers and other market participants.[9] 
           An Exchange Specialist or Market Maker, in providing for a fair and orderly secondary market for ETS, also may purchase or redeem Creation Units for use in its market-making activities. Applicants expect that the market price of ETS will be disciplined by arbitrage opportunities created by the ability to purchase or redeem Creation Units at their NAV, which should ensure that the market price of ETS at or close to 4 p.m. stays close to the NAV on that Business Day.
11. ETS will not be individually redeemable. ETS will only be redeemable in Creation Units through the Distributor, which will act as the Trust's agent for redemption. To redeem, an investor must accumulate enough ETS to constitute a Creation Unit. An investor redeeming a Creation Unit of a Conventional or Leveraged Fund generally will receive an In-Kind Payment of securities published by the Trust's index receipt agent (the “Redemption Securities”), the Balancing Amount in effect on the date a request for redemption is made, minus any Transaction Fee. 
12. Applicants state that in accepting Deposit Securities and satisfying redemptions with Redemption Securities,[10] 
           the relevant Funds will comply with the federal securities laws, including that the Deposit Securities and Fund Securities are sold in transactions that would be exempt from registration under the Securities Act.[11] 
           As a general matter, the Deposit Securities and Redemption Securities will correspond pro rata to the securities held by each Conventional Fund and Leveraged Fund, but Redemption Securities received on redemption may not always be identical to Deposit Securities deposited in connection with the purchase of Creation units for the same day. 
13. Applicants state that neither the Trust nor any Fund will be advertised, marketed or otherwise held out as a “mutual fund.” The term “mutual fund” will not be used in the Prospectus except to compare and contrast the Trust or a Fund with conventional mutual funds. In all marketing materials where the features or methods of obtaining, buying, or selling Creation Units are described or where there is reference to redeemability, applicants will include a prominent statement to the effect that individual ETS are not redeemable except in Creation Units. The same approach will be followed in connection with reports and other communications to shareholders, as well as any other investor education materials issued or circulated in connection with ETS. The Trust will provide copies of its annual and semi-annual shareholder reports to DTC participants for distribution to beneficial holders of ETS. 
Applicants' Legal Analysis 
1. Applicants request an order under section 6(c) of the Act for an exemption from sections 2(a)(32), 5(a)(1), 22(d), 22(e), and 24(d) of the Act and rule 22c-Start Printed Page 541821 under the Act, and under sections 6(c) and 17(b) of the Act for an exemption from sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(2) of the Act. 
2. Section 6(c) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt any person, security or transaction, or any class of persons, securities or transactions, from any provision of the Act, if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. 
Sections 5(a)(1) and 2(a)(32) of the Act 
3. Section 5(a)(1) of the Act defines an “open-end company” as a management investment company that is offering for sale or has outstanding any redeemable security of which it is the issuer. Section 2(a)(32) of the Act defines a redeemable security as any security, other than short-term paper, under the terms of which the owner, upon its presentation to the issuer, is entitled to receive approximately his proportionate share of the issuer's current net assets, or the cash equivalent. Because ETS will not be individually redeemable, applicants request an order that would permit the Trust to issue ETS that are redeemable in Creation Units only. Applicants state that investors may purchase ETS of a Fund in Creation Units and redeem Creation Units from the Trust. Applicants further state that because the market price of ETS will be disciplined by arbitrage opportunities, investors should be able to sell ETS in the secondary market at or close to 4:00 p.m. on a Business Day at prices that do not vary substantially from the NAV on that Business Day. 
Section 22(d) of the Act and Rule 22c-1 Under the Act 
4. Section 22(d) of the Act, among other things, prohibits a dealer from selling a redeemable security, which is currently being offered to the public by or through a principal underwriter, except at a current public offering price described in the prospectus. Rule 22c-1 under the Act generally requires that a dealer selling, redeeming or repurchasing a redeemable security do so only at a price based on its NAV. Applicants state that secondary market trading in ETS will take place at negotiated prices, not at a current offering price described in a Fund's Prospectus as required by section 22(d) of the Act, and not at a price based on NAV as required by rule 22c-1 under the Act. Applicants request an exemption under section 6(c) from these provisions. 
5. Applicants assert that the concerns sought to be addressed by section 22(d) of the Act and rule 22c-1 under the Act with respect to pricing are equally satisfied by the proposed method of pricing ETS. Applicants maintain that while there is little legislative history regarding section 22(d), its provisions, as well as those of rule 22c-1, appear to have been intended to (a) prevent dilution caused by certain riskless-trading schemes by principal underwriters and contract dealers, (b) prevent unjust discrimination or preferential treatment among buyers, and (c) ensure an orderly distribution of investment company shares by eliminating price competition from dealers offering shares at less than the published sales price and repurchasing shares at more than the published redemption price. 
6. Applicants believe that none of these purposes will be thwarted by permitting ETS to trade in the secondary market at negotiated prices. Applicants state that (a) secondary market trading in ETS does not directly involve Trust assets and (b) to the extent different prices exist during a given trading day, or from day to day, such variances occur as a result of third-party market forces, such as supply and demand, not as a result of unjust or discriminatory manipulation. Therefore, applicants assert that secondary market transactions in ETS will not lead to discrimination or preferential treatment among purchasers. Finally, applicants contend that the proposed distribution system will be orderly because competitive forces in the marketplace will ensure that the difference between the market price of ETS and their NAV remains narrow. 
Section 24(d) of the Act 
7. Section 24(d) of the Act provides, in relevant part, that the prospectus delivery exemption provided to dealer transactions by section 4(3) of the Securities Act does not apply to any transaction in a redeemable security issued by an open-end investment company. Applicants seek relief from section 24(d) to permit dealers selling ETS in the secondary markets to rely on the prospectus delivery exemption provided by section 4(3) of the Securities Act.[12] 

8. Applicants state that secondary market investors will regard ETS in a manner similar to other securities, including closed-end fund shares that are listed, bought and sold on an Exchange. Applicants note that shares of closed-end fund investment companies are sold in the secondary market unaccompanied by a prospectus. 
9. Applicants contend that ETS, as a listed security, merit a reduction in the compliance costs and regulatory burdens resulting from the imposition of prospectus delivery obligations in the secondary market. Because ETS will be exchange-listed, prospective investors will have access to several types of market information about ETS. Applicants state that information regarding market price and volume will be continually available on a real-time basis throughout the day from the relevant Exchange, automated quotation systems, published or other public sources or on-line information services. Applicants expect that the previous day's closing price and volume information for ETS also will be published daily in the financial section of newspapers. In addition, the Trust expects to maintain a website that includes quantitative information updated on a daily basis, including, for each Fund, daily trading volume, the NAV and the reported closing price. The website will also include, for each Fund, a calculation of the premium or discount of the reported closing price against NAV, and data in chart format displaying the frequency distribution of discounts and premiums of the reported closing price against the NAV, within appropriate ranges, for each of the four previous calendar quarters. 
10. Applicants will make available for distribution to secondary market purchasers of ETS a product description (“Product Description”) that describes, in plain English, the Trust, relevant Fund and its ETS. Applicants state that, Start Printed Page 54183while not intended as a substitute for a Prospectus, the Product Description will contain information about ETS that is tailored to meet the needs of investors purchasing ETS in the secondary market. The Product Description will also disclose the potential for deviation over time between the return of the Leveraged Funds or Inverse Funds and the multiple return of the corresponding Underlying Index and provide an example of this deviation in returns over time in the same manner as in the Prospectus. 
Section 22(e) 
11. Section 22(e) of the Act generally prohibits a registered investment company from suspending the right of redemption or postponing the date of payment of redemption proceeds for more than seven days after the tender of a security for redemption. Applicants state that settlement of redemptions for Funds based on Underlying Foreign Indices (“Foreign Funds”) is contingent not only on the settlement cycle of the United States market, but also on delivery cycles in local markets for underlying foreign securities held by the Foreign Funds. Applicants state that local market delivery cycles for transferring Redemption Securities to redeeming investors, coupled with local market holiday schedules, will, under certain circumstances, require a delivery process longer than seven calendar days for Foreign Funds. Applicants request relief under section 6(c) of the Act from section 22(e) to allow Foreign Funds to pay redemption proceeds up to 14 calendar days after the tender of a Creation Unit for redemption. Except as disclosed in the relevant Foreign Fund's Prospectus, Product Description and/or SAI, applicants expect that each Foreign Fund will be able to deliver redemption proceeds within seven days.[13] 
           With respect to future Foreign Funds, applicants seek the same relief from section 22(e) only to the extent that circumstances similar to those described in the application exist. 
12. Applicants state that section 22(e) was designed to prevent unreasonable, undisclosed and unforeseen delays in the payment of redemption proceeds. Applicants assert that the requested relief will not lead to the problems that section 22(e) was designed to prevent. Applicants state that the SAI will disclose those local holidays (over the period of at least one year following the date of the SAI), if any, that are expected to prevent the delivery of redemption proceeds in seven calendar days, and the maximum number of days needed to deliver the proceeds for each Foreign Fund. Applicants are not seeking relief from section 22(e) with respect to Foreign Funds that do not effect creations and redemptions of Creation Units in-kind. 
Sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(2) of the Act 
13. Section 17(a) of the Act generally prohibits an affiliated person of a registered investment company, or an affiliated person of such a person (“Second-Tier Affiliate”), from selling any security to or purchasing any security from the company. Section 2(a)(3) of the Act defines “affiliated person” to include (a) any person directly or indirectly owning, controlling or holding with power to vote 5% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the other person, (b) any person 5% or more of whose outstanding voting securities are directly or indirectly owned, controlled or held with the power to vote by the other person, and (c) any person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by or under common control with the other person. Section 2(a)(9) of the Act provides that a control relationship will be presumed where one person owns more than 25% of another person's voting securities. 
14. Applicants request an exemption from section 17(a) of the Act pursuant to sections 17(b) and 6(c) of the Act to permit persons to effectuate in-kind purchases and redemptions with a Fund when they are affiliated persons of the Fund or Second-Tier Affiliates solely by virtue of one or more of the following: (a) Holding 5% or more, or more than 25%, of the outstanding ETS of one or more Funds; (b) having an affiliation with a person with an ownership interest described in (a); or (c) holding 5% or more, or more than 25%, of the shares of one or more other registered investment companies (or series thereof) advised by the Adviser or an entity, controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Adviser. 
15. Section 17(b) of the Act authorizes the Commission to exempt a proposed transaction from section 17(a) of the Act if evidence establishes that the terms of the transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned, and the proposed transaction is consistent with the policies of the registered investment company and the general provisions of the Act. Applicants assert that no useful purpose would be served by prohibiting these types of affiliated persons from purchasing or redeeming Creation Units through “in-kind” transactions. The deposit procedures for both in-kind purchases and in-kind redemptions of Creation Units will be the same for all purchases and redemptions. Deposit Securities and Redemption Securities will be valued in the same manner as the securities held by the Funds. Therefore, applicants state that in-kind purchases and redemptions will afford no opportunity for the affiliated persons described above to effect a transaction detrimental to other holders of ETS. Applicants also believe that in-kind purchases and redemptions will not result in self-dealing or overreaching of the Fund. 
Applicants' Conditions 
Applicants agree that any order of granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions: 
1. The Prospectus and Product Description will clearly disclose that, for purposes of the Act, ETS are issued by the Funds and the acquisition of ETS by investment companies is subject to the restrictions of section 12(d)(1) of the Act, except as permitted by an exemptive order that permits registered investment companies to invest in a Fund beyond the limits in section 12(d)(1), subject to certain terms and conditions, including that the registered investment company enter into an agreement with the Fund regarding the terms of the investment. 
2. As long as the Trust operates in reliance on the requested order, the ETS will be listed on an Exchange. 
3. Neither the Trust nor any Fund will be advertised or marketed as an open-end investment company or a mutual fund. The Prospectus will prominently disclose that ETS are not individually redeemable shares and will disclose that the owners of ETS may acquire those ETS from a Fund and tender those ETS for redemption to a Fund in Creation Units only. Any advertising material that describes the purchase or sale of Creation Units or refers to redeemability will prominently disclose that ETS are not individually redeemable, and that owners of ETS may acquire those ETS from a Fund and tender those ETS for redemption to a Fund in Creation Units only. 
4. Before a Fund may rely on the order, the Commission will have approved, pursuant to rule 19b-4 under the Exchange Act, an Exchange rule or an amendment thereto, requiring Exchange members and member organizations effecting transactions in Start Printed Page 54184ETS to deliver a Product Description to purchasers of ETS. 
5. The Trust's Web site, which will be publicly accessible at no charge, will contain the following information, on a per ETS basis, for each Fund: (a) The prior Business Day's NAV and the reported closing price, and a calculation of the premium or discount of such price against such NAV; and (b) data in chart format displaying the frequency distribution of discounts and premiums of the daily closing price against the NAV, within appropriate ranges, for each of the four previous calendar quarters (or the life of the Fund, if shorter). In addition, the Product Description for each Fund will state that the Trust's Web site has information about the premiums and discounts at which the ETS have traded. 
6. The Prospectus and annual report for each Fund also will include: (a) The information listed in condition 5(b), (i) in the case of the Prospectus, for the most recently completed year (and the most recently completed quarter or quarters, as applicable) and (ii) in the case of the annual report, for the immediately preceding five years (or the life of the Fund, if shorter); and (b) the following data, calculated on a per ETS basis for one, five and ten year periods (or life of the Fund, if shorter), (i) the cumulative total return and the average annual total return based on NAV and closing price, and (ii) the cumulative total return of the relevant Underlying Index. 
7. The requested relief to permit ETF operations will expire on the effective date of any Commission rule under the Act that provides relief permitting the operation of index-based exchange-traded funds and exchange-traded funds that seek to return a multiple, the inverse or an inverse multiple of an index.

The Prospectus will also state that an Authorized Participant that is not a “Qualified Institutional Buyer” as defined in rule 144A under the Securities Act will not be able to receive, as part of a redemption, restricted securities eligible for resale under rule 144A.

        Back to Citation
      


12.
     Applicants state that they are not seeking relief from the prospectus delivery requirement for non-secondary market transactions, such as transactions in which an investor purchases ETS from the Funds or an underwriter. Applicants further state that each Fund's Prospectus will caution broker-dealers and others that some activities on their part, depending on the circumstances, may result in their being deemed statutory underwriters and subject them to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the Securities Act. For example, a broker-dealer firm and/or its client may be deemed a statutory underwriter if it takes Creation Units after placing an order with the Distributor, breaks them down into the constituent ETS, and sells those ETS directly to customers, or if it chooses to couple the creation of a supply of new ETS with an active selling effort involving solicitation of secondary market demand for ETS. Each Fund's Prospectus will state that whether a person is an underwriter depends upon all of the facts and circumstances pertaining to that person's activities. The Prospectus also will state that dealers who are not “underwriters” but are participating in a distribution (as contrasted to ordinary secondary market trading transactions), and thus dealing with ETS that are part of an “unsold allotment” within the meaning of section 4(3)(C) of the Securities Act, would be unable to take advantage of the prospectus delivery exemption provided by section 4(3) of the Securities Act.

    Rafferty Asset Management Closing Three Leveraged ETFs  





+ Share 



 
 


NEW YORK—September 25, 2015—The Direxion Shares ETF Trust has decided to liquidate and close the Direxion Daily 7-10 Year Treasury Bull 2X Shares (Ticker: SYTL), Direxion Daily Mid Cap Bull 2X Shares (Ticker: MDLL) and Direxion Daily Basic Materials Bull 3X Shares (Ticker: MATL) exchange-traded funds (“the Funds”) based on the recommendation of Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”), the Funds’ Sponsor.
Due to the Funds’ inability to attract sufficient investment assets, Rafferty believes the Funds cannot continue to conduct their business and operations in an economically efficient manner. As a result, Rafferty concluded that liquidating and closing the Funds would be in the best interests of the Funds and their shareholders.
Shares of the Funds will stop trading on the NYSE Arca, Inc., and will no longer be open to purchase by investors, after the close of regular trading on October 20, 2015. Shareholders may sell their holdings in the Funds prior to October 20, 2015, and those transactions may be subject to customary brokerage charges. Between October 21, 2015 and October 27, 2015, shareholders may only be able to sell their shares to certain broker-dealers and there is no assurance that there will be a market for the Funds during that time period.
On or about October 27, 2015, the Funds will liquidate their assets and distribute cash pro rata to shareholders who have not previously redeemed or exchanged their shares. These payments are taxable and will include any accrued capital gains and dividends. The Funds’ net asset values will reflect the costs of closing the Funds as calculated on the liquidation date. The Funds will close when the distributions are complete.
The process of closing down and liquidating the Funds’ portfolios, scheduled to take place between October 21, 2015 and October 27, 2015, will result in the Funds not tracking their underlying indexes and experiencing an increase in cash holdings. These developments may not be consistent with the Funds’ investment objectives and strategies.
For more information about the liquidation and termination processes, please contact Direxion Investments at 800-851-0511. For media inquiries, please contact James Doyle at 973-850-7308 or jdoyle@jcprinc.com.

There is no guarantee that the funds will achieve their objectives.

The ETFs are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by sophisticated investors who understand leverage risk, consequences of seeking daily leveraged investment results and intend to actively monitor and manage their investments. Due to the daily nature of the leverage employed, there is no guarantee of amplified long-term returns. Past performance is not indicative of future results.
An investor should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of Direxion ETFs carefully before investing. The prospectus and summary prospectus contains this and other information about Direxion ETFs. Download a prospectus and summary prospectus at direxioninvestments.com. The prospectus and summary prospectus should be read carefully before investing.
Risks: An investment in the ETFs involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. The ETFs are non-diversified and include risks associated with concentration risk that results from the Funds’ investments in a particular industry or sector which can increase volatility. The use of derivatives such as futures contracts, forward contracts, options and swaps are subject to market risks that may cause their price to fluctuate over time. The Funds do not attempt to, and should not be expected to; provide returns which are a multiple of the return of their Indexes for periods other than a single day. Utilizing foreign currency forward contracts to hedge foreign currency positions does not eliminate the impact of the movements in the value of non-U.S. currencies and securities but rather establishes a fixed rate of exchange for a future point in time. Exchange rates can be volatile and may change quickly and unpredictably in response to both global and economic conditions in a geographic region. For other risks including leverage, correlation, compounding, market volatility, shorting for the Bear Funds, and specific risks regarding each sector, please read the prospectus.
