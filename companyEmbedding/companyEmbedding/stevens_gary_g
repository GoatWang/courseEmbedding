What is the Washington Warranty Deed?



Title to real property in Washington can be transferred by a real estate deed. Every deed in this state is required to be in writing, signed by the party bound by it, and acknowledged by the party before someone authorized to take acknowledgments of deeds (RCW 64.04.020). A warranty deed can be in substantially the form offered in the Revised Code of Washington 64.04.030, without express covenants. This type of deed, when duly executed, is considered to be a conveyance in fee simple to the grantee, his or her heirs, and assigns with covenants on the part of the grantor that (1) at the time of the making and delivery of such deed, the grantor was lawfully seized of an indefeasible estate in fee simple in and to the premises described in the deed, and had good right and full power to convey the same, (2) that the property was free from all encumbrances, and (3) that the grantor warrants to the grantee, his or her heirs and assigns, the quiet and peaceable possession of such premises and will defend the title thereto against all persons who may lawfully claim the same (RCW 64.04.030).  The grantor’s after-acquired title in the land that has been sold and conveyed will pass to the grantee in a warranty deed (RCW64.04.070). A warranty deed is commonly used in a transaction where the buyer wants assurances as to the title of the property. 

The acknowledgment of a warranty deed can be taken in Washington before a justice or clerk of the Supreme Court, before a judge or clerk of the court of appeals, a judge of the superior court or qualified court commissioner thereof, a county auditor, or a qualified notary public (RCW 64.08.010). The acknowledgment of a warranty deed for lands situated in Washington may be taken in any other state before any person authorized to take acknowledgments of deeds by the laws of such state, but unless the acknowledgment is taken before a commissioner appointed by the governor, or before the clerk of a court of record of such state, or before a notary public or other officer having a seal of office, the deed should be accompanied by a certificate of acknowledgment under the seal of said court attached to the deed (RCW 64.08.020). The officer taking acknowledgments of a warranty deed within this state shall also certify the act by a certificate of acknowledgment that is written on or attached to the deed (RCW 64.08.050). 

A warranty deed that has been acknowledged by the person executing it and is properly certified can be recorded in the office of the county auditor in the county where the property is located. A warranty deed that is not recorded will be void as against a subsequent purchaser or mortgagee in good faith and for a valuable consideration from the same vendor and his or her heirs or devisees, of the same real property or portion thereof, whose conveyance is first duly recorded. A deed is considered recorded the moment it is filed for record (RCW 65.08.070).

Each state has

										you use must meet statutory

												format. In addition, many 
												counties add requirements for 
												margins, paper size, property

												in accordance with both the 
												county and state standards, 
												there may be additional fees 
												charged for recording or the

Washington Real Estate Deed Forms


The use of real estate deeds in the state of Washington is authorized by RCW 64.04.010, which states that “every conveyance of real estate, or any interest therein, and every contract creating or evidencing any encumbrance upon real estate, shall be by deed.” Furthermore, a real estate deed has to be in writing, signed by the grantor or other party bound by it, and acknowledged by the grantor before an officer who is authorized to take acknowledgments of deeds (RCW 64.04.020).

Individuals of legal age, as well as corporations, have the legal capacity to hold or acquire property in this state, which gives them the legal authority to convey the same to a grantee who in turn has legal authority to receive real property. In Washington State, an alien may hold and acquire land, any rights to land, or interest in land by purchase, devise, or descent; and can also convey, mortgage, and devise the same with the same effect as if the alien were a native citizen of the state of Washington or the United States (64.16.005). A conveyance of real estate or interest in real estate is facilitated through the use of a real estate deed, the commonly used forms of which in Washington are warranty deeds and quitclaim deeds. Property rights, as well as the owner’s right to dispose of his or real property, are determined by the manner in which the property is held. 

The grantor to the real estate deed is required to sign and have his or her signature acknowledged by a person authorized to take acknowledgments. When the acknowledgment is certified as required by law, the instrument may be recorded in the recording office in the county where the property is located (RCW 65.08.070). In Washington, county auditors are responsible for recording real property instruments. The officer taking acknowledgements shall certify the same by a certificate written on or attached to the real estate deed. If an instrument is acknowledged in a state other than Washington, it must be accompanied by an attached certificate from the clerk of a court of record from the county wherein the acknowledgement was taken, unless the out-of-state acknowledgment was taken before a commissioner appointed by the governor, before the clerk of a court of record, or before a notary public having a seal of office. (RCW 64.08.020). Aside from acknowledgements, real estate deeds must meet additional statutory requirements, as outlined in RCW 65.04.045, in order to be recorded.

Every conveyance in Washington that is not recorded is void as against any subsequent purchaser or mortgagee in good faith and for a valuable consideration from the same vendor, of the same real property or any portion of it whose conveyance is first duly recorded. (RCW 65.08.070).  Conveyances must be recorded in order to be valid against third parties. The order of recording determines the priority of instruments against subsequent purchasers of the same real property. Recording a document gives constructive notice of its contents.

Washington Warranty Deed Form


Title to real property in Washington can be transferred by a real estate deed. Every deed in this state is required to be in writing, signed by the party bound by it, and acknowledged by the party before someone authorized to take acknowledgments of deeds (RCW 64.04.020). A warranty deed can be in substantially the form offered in the Revised Code of Washington 64.04.030, without express covenants. This type of deed, when duly executed, is considered to be a conveyance in fee simple to the grantee, his or her heirs, and assigns with covenants on the part of the grantor that (1) at the time of the making and delivery of such deed, the grantor was lawfully seized of an indefeasible estate in fee simple in and to the premises described in the deed, and had good right and full power to convey the same, (2) that the property was free from all encumbrances, and (3) that the grantor warrants to the grantee, his or her heirs and assigns, the quiet and peaceable possession of such premises and will defend the title thereto against all persons who may lawfully claim the same (RCW 64.04.030).  The grantor’s after-acquired title in the land that has been sold and conveyed will pass to the grantee in a warranty deed (RCW64.04.070). A warranty deed is commonly used in a transaction where the buyer wants assurances as to the title of the property. 

The acknowledgment of a warranty deed can be taken in Washington before a justice or clerk of the Supreme Court, before a judge or clerk of the court of appeals, a judge of the superior court or qualified court commissioner thereof, a county auditor, or a qualified notary public (RCW 64.08.010). The acknowledgment of a warranty deed for lands situated in Washington may be taken in any other state before any person authorized to take acknowledgments of deeds by the laws of such state, but unless the acknowledgment is taken before a commissioner appointed by the governor, or before the clerk of a court of record of such state, or before a notary public or other officer having a seal of office, the deed should be accompanied by a certificate of acknowledgment under the seal of said court attached to the deed (RCW 64.08.020). The officer taking acknowledgments of a warranty deed within this state shall also certify the act by a certificate of acknowledgment that is written on or attached to the deed (RCW 64.08.050). 

A warranty deed that has been acknowledged by the person executing it and is properly certified can be recorded in the office of the county auditor in the county where the property is located. A warranty deed that is not recorded will be void as against a subsequent purchaser or mortgagee in good faith and for a valuable consideration from the same vendor and his or her heirs or devisees, of the same real property or portion thereof, whose conveyance is first duly recorded. A deed is considered recorded the moment it is filed for record (RCW 65.08.070).
