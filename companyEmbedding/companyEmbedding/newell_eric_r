GLASTONBURY, Conn., Aug. 8, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- William H. W. Crawford, IV, President and Chief Executive Officer of Rockville Bank and Rockville Financial, Inc. (Nasdaq:RCKB), today announced that the Company has promoted Eric R. Newell of New Haven, Conn. to Executive Vice President, Head of Treasury and Corporate Strategy.

	A photo accompanying this release is available at http://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/prs/?pkgid=20321

	Newell previously held the title of Senior Vice President, Director of Treasury with Rockville Bank. In addition to continuing to lead Rockville's Treasury Department, he will now take on another top role of working closely with Bill Crawford on corporate strategy.

	Newell joined Rockville Bank in May 2011 as Vice President, Treasury Officer before being promoted to Senior Vice President in 2012. Over the past two years, he has been responsible for managing Rockville's Treasury Department, including liquidity, interest rate risk and management of the investment portfolio. Newell's leadership has led to enhanced budgeting and financial reporting within the Company and modeling capital deployment opportunities.

	Newell came to Rockville Bank after serving as Assistant Vice President and Special Situations Research Analyst for AllianceBernstein, L.P. in New York, New York. He also worked for Fitch Ratings in New York and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation "FDIC" in Rocky Hill, Conn.

	"In just the short time Eric has been with Rockville Bank, he has been an integral part of the Company's recent successful financial performance, gained the respect and admiration of his colleagues on the Rockville Bank Team and proven to be a knowledgeable industry leader who our investors and analysts have come to rely on for expert insight about the Company," Crawford said. "Eric's financial acumen, strategic counsel and decision-making and perpetual energy to make our Company profitable is the reason why he deserves to be a part of Rockville Bank's Executive Team."

	"Over the past several months I've enjoyed working for a bank that has achieved record earnings, created 100 new jobs and recruited some of the best talent in the banking industry to join the Company. Unquestionably, it's a great opportunity for me to work closely with Bill and the rest of the Executive Team. But more importantly, the enhanced responsibilities I am taking on rounds out a team that has vast experience in helping banks of all sizes be profitable. In the end, it's the strategic decisions we make that ensure Rockville Bank customers enjoy a first-class banking experience while our investors realize a return on their investment," Newell said.

	Newell earned Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Arts degrees in Finance and Marketing from Northeastern University's School of Business Administration. He is a member of the CFA Institute and Hartford CFA Society and holds certifications as a CFA Charterholder and FDIC Commissioned Bank Examiner.

	Newell is based in Glastonbury, Conn. at Rockville Bank's Administrative Offices.
