Products and Markets[edit]
The company’s focus is to create and produce better working oils than those currently available on the commercial marketplace.[8][9] The company’s first product was Heavy Duty Oil Stabilizer,[8] followed by aftermarket products, including:

Heavy Duty Oil Stabilizer, a pure petroleum multi-use oil supplement for controlling noise, heat and wear in manual transmissions and differentials
Upper Cylinder Fuel Lubricant, marketed as delivering an extra half mile to the gallon savings for both gasoline and diesel
Power Steering Stop-Leak, developed to address maintenance issues in rack and pinion steering mechanisms
Lucas Transmission Fix[10]

According to David Portalatin, an NPD industry analyst, Lucas Oil accounts for nearly all of the segment’s recent growth and is the leading brand in the oil additives segment.[11] The company continues to expand internationally. Current markets include Canada, Latin America, Europe, Asia, Australia, and most recently, the Middle East.[11][12]
Motorsports[edit]

Many shows include expanded pre- and post-race footage, additional interviews, and background content.[19] The service is available through the LucasOilRacing.TV website for smartphones and tablets, as well as Roku, Amazon Fire TV, Android TV, XBox One and Xbox 360.[20]

The company is a sponsor of several NASCAR, H1 Unlimited, NHRA and IndyCar events.[27] In 2005, Lucas Oil founded the Lucas Oil Late Model Dirt Series. Since 2011, it owns the cable network MAVTV, which under its purview went from a male-focused network with a lowbrow point of view to a leading motorsports network.
On February 28, 2006, it was announced that Lucas Oil had purchased the naming rights to the Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, Indiana, for $120 million over 20 years.[28][29] The facility opened in 2008 and is the home field for the NFL's Indianapolis Colts. Other events that have or will be held at the stadium include the 2010 NCAA Men's Basketball Final Four, the 2009 NCAA Men's Basketball Regional Finals, Super Bowl XLVI (February 5, 2012), the 2015 NCAA Men's Basketball Final Four, the 2016 NCAA Women's Basketball Final Four, and every Drum Corps International World Championship since 2009.
In 2009, Lucas Oil founded the short course off-road racing series Lucas Oil Off Road Racing Series. In March 2012, Lucas Oil extended their title sponsorship of the AMA Motocross series.[30]
Since 2011, Lucas Oil has been a main sponsor of the Professional Bull Riders (PBR) association.[31]
At the time he purchased the mansion of Conseco co-founder Stephen Hilbert, Forrest Lucas stated, "I can justify it by having this as a corporate retreat for my employees and for my customers."[32]

Protect the Harvest is considered a corporate front group by the nonprofit Center for Food Safety.[38]
Charlotte Lucas Remarks[edit]
In October 2014, Lucas Oil co-founder and executive vice president Charlotte Lucas posted to her Facebook page: "I’m sick and tired of minorities running our country! As far as I’m concerned, I don’t think that atheists (minority), muslims  [sic] (minority) nor any other minority group has the right to tell the majority of the people in the United States what they can and cannot do here. Is everyone so scared that they can’t fight back for what is right or wrong with his country?" The posting was later deleted.[39] Charlotte Lucas issued an apology for the post stating, "I apologize to everyone for the insensitive comments posted on my Facebook account. My comments did not reflect my personal views about any individual or minority group, only my frustration that our government system sometimes seems out of balance. We live in a great country, but the agenda for our elected officials is too often dictated by special interest groups. My comments did not reflect my true feelings, and I am sorry for anyone who may have been offended." [40]
Subsequent to Mrs. Lucas's remarks, Robert Patison, general counsel for Lucas Oil Products, issued a statement on behalf of the company: "We provide significant financial support for a broad range of organizations that serve the needs of veterans, women, other minority groups, and disadvantaged individuals throughout the United States. Fairness and equality are core values of our company."[41]
On Lucas Oil letterhead, Forrest Lucas published a newspaper advertisement apologizing for his wife's remarks, writing "Her words were hurtful to many and disappointing to all."[42]
In an interview, Mr. Lucas said that he did not believe that the incident involving his wife would cause any harm to his company's relationship with the Colts.[43]

Charlotte Lucas Remarks[edit]
In October 2014, Lucas Oil co-founder and executive vice president Charlotte Lucas posted to her Facebook page: "I’m sick and tired of minorities running our country! As far as I’m concerned, I don’t think that atheists (minority), muslims  [sic] (minority) nor any other minority group has the right to tell the majority of the people in the United States what they can and cannot do here. Is everyone so scared that they can’t fight back for what is right or wrong with his country?" The posting was later deleted.[39] Charlotte Lucas issued an apology for the post stating, "I apologize to everyone for the insensitive comments posted on my Facebook account. My comments did not reflect my personal views about any individual or minority group, only my frustration that our government system sometimes seems out of balance. We live in a great country, but the agenda for our elected officials is too often dictated by special interest groups. My comments did not reflect my true feelings, and I am sorry for anyone who may have been offended." [40]
Subsequent to Mrs. Lucas's remarks, Robert Patison, general counsel for Lucas Oil Products, issued a statement on behalf of the company: "We provide significant financial support for a broad range of organizations that serve the needs of veterans, women, other minority groups, and disadvantaged individuals throughout the United States. Fairness and equality are core values of our company."[41]
On Lucas Oil letterhead, Forrest Lucas published a newspaper advertisement apologizing for his wife's remarks, writing "Her words were hurtful to many and disappointing to all."[42]
In an interview, Mr. Lucas said that he did not believe that the incident involving his wife would cause any harm to his company's relationship with the Colts.[43]

Charlotte Lucas Remarks[edit]
In October 2014, Lucas Oil co-founder and executive vice president Charlotte Lucas posted to her Facebook page: "I’m sick and tired of minorities running our country! As far as I’m concerned, I don’t think that atheists (minority), muslims  [sic] (minority) nor any other minority group has the right to tell the majority of the people in the United States what they can and cannot do here. Is everyone so scared that they can’t fight back for what is right or wrong with his country?" The posting was later deleted.[39] Charlotte Lucas issued an apology for the post stating, "I apologize to everyone for the insensitive comments posted on my Facebook account. My comments did not reflect my personal views about any individual or minority group, only my frustration that our government system sometimes seems out of balance. We live in a great country, but the agenda for our elected officials is too often dictated by special interest groups. My comments did not reflect my true feelings, and I am sorry for anyone who may have been offended." [40]
Subsequent to Mrs. Lucas's remarks, Robert Patison, general counsel for Lucas Oil Products, issued a statement on behalf of the company: "We provide significant financial support for a broad range of organizations that serve the needs of veterans, women, other minority groups, and disadvantaged individuals throughout the United States. Fairness and equality are core values of our company."[41]
On Lucas Oil letterhead, Forrest Lucas published a newspaper advertisement apologizing for his wife's remarks, writing "Her words were hurtful to many and disappointing to all."[42]
In an interview, Mr. Lucas said that he did not believe that the incident involving his wife would cause any harm to his company's relationship with the Colts.[43]

Forrest Lucas is a founder of Protect the Harvest, a nonprofit organization which opposes "the radical animal rights movement” and particularly the Humane Society of the United States, which it calls "a wealthy and successful attack group".[35] Lucas said in 2012 that he had invested over $600,000 in the organization.[36] Its stated goals include educating the public about animal agriculture, and preventing the passing of legislative or market-initiated bans on particular production practices.[37]
Protect the Harvest is considered a corporate front group by the nonprofit Center for Food Safety.[38]
Charlotte Lucas Remarks[edit]
In October 2014, Lucas Oil co-founder and executive vice president Charlotte Lucas posted to her Facebook page: "I’m sick and tired of minorities running our country! As far as I’m concerned, I don’t think that atheists (minority), muslims  [sic] (minority) nor any other minority group has the right to tell the majority of the people in the United States what they can and cannot do here. Is everyone so scared that they can’t fight back for what is right or wrong with his country?" The posting was later deleted.[39] Charlotte Lucas issued an apology for the post stating, "I apologize to everyone for the insensitive comments posted on my Facebook account. My comments did not reflect my personal views about any individual or minority group, only my frustration that our government system sometimes seems out of balance. We live in a great country, but the agenda for our elected officials is too often dictated by special interest groups. My comments did not reflect my true feelings, and I am sorry for anyone who may have been offended." [40]
Subsequent to Mrs. Lucas's remarks, Robert Patison, general counsel for Lucas Oil Products, issued a statement on behalf of the company: "We provide significant financial support for a broad range of organizations that serve the needs of veterans, women, other minority groups, and disadvantaged individuals throughout the United States. Fairness and equality are core values of our company."[41]
On Lucas Oil letterhead, Forrest Lucas published a newspaper advertisement apologizing for his wife's remarks, writing "Her words were hurtful to many and disappointing to all."[42]
In an interview, Mr. Lucas said that he did not believe that the incident involving his wife would cause any harm to his company's relationship with the Colts.[43]

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
