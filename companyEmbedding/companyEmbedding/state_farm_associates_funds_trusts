Message to Shareholders of State Farm Associates’ Funds Trust 
 
Dear Fellow Shareholders, 
Thank you for investing with State Farm Mutual Funds®. Enclosed is the Annual Report for the 12-month period ended November 30, 2007. In this report you will find management’s discussion of investment philosophy and process for each of the Funds offered by the Trust, factors that affected each Fund’s performance over the 12-month period, and benchmark index comparisons that are designed to put that performance into context. 
I’m happy to report that all four Funds had positive total returns for the 12-month period ended November 30, 2007. Of course, the financial market each Fund invested in influenced the Fund’s performance. 
Equity markets (as represented by the large cap S&P 500 Index) produced positive total returns of 7.72% for the 12-month period ended November 30, 2007, supported by growth in overall corporate earnings and gross domestic product (GDP), as well as a steady employment environment.1 However, investors were confronted by a significant level of volatility throughout the period. Many factors, both positive and negative, contributed to the volatility, including continuing weakness in the housing market, lackluster consumer spending, higher energy prices, and actions by the Federal Reserve. A primary contributor to the volatility, however, was driven by concerns of rising defaults on sub-prime mortgages (those made to the riskiest borrowers). With the increase in sub-prime mortgage defaults, many lenders tightened their lending requirements during the summer months of 2007 which, at the time, prompted fears of a “credit crunch” that could potentially cause adverse ripple effects to the overall economy. In response to these issues, as well as other economic factors, the Federal Reserve reduced the Federal Discount Rate by 0.50% in August followed by subsequent reductions to the Federal Funds Rate of 0.50% in September and 0.25% in October, respectively. 
Bond markets, as represented by the 10-year U.S. Treasury Bond yield, also advanced during the 12-month period ended November 30, 2007 as all the uncertainty surrounding the sub-prime mortgage issues and resulting credit tightening helped spur a flight to quality, driving prices on U.S. Treasuries higher and rates lower. The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasuries rose from 4.43% in December 1, 2006 to a peak of 5.26% on June 12, 2007 before declining 129 basis points to end at 3.97% on November 30, 2007. Short-term yields experienced an even more dramatic move down with 2-year U.S. Treasuries declining 206 basis points from a peak of 5.10% on June 14, 2007 to 3.04% on November 30, 2007.2 
Also included for your review are audited financial statements and a complete list of portfolio holdings to help you further understand the Funds you own. We encourage your review and consideration of this entire report. Thank you for your continued investment in State Farm Mutual Funds®. 
Sincerely, 
 
Phillip G. Hawkins 
Vice President 
State Farm Investment Management Corp.

State Farm Growth Fund Management’s Discussion of Fund Performance 
 
Overview 
Describe the Fund’s investment objective and philosophy. 
The State Farm Growth Fund is managed with a long-term investment orientation. Our investment process is based on a rigorous fundamental analysis of companies. We focus on risk, as well as the potential for reward. We look for well-managed companies with a niche or business specialty that serves an appropriately-sized market opportunity. We prefer companies with a strong customer focus and a history of prudent financial decisions. We also believe that dividends are an important part of an investment’s total return and therefore prefer companies that pay a regular dividend. While we are conscious of how the Fund’s portfolio differs from our broad-based benchmark, the S&P 500 Index, we don’t make decisions based upon the Index. 
Describe the relevant market environment as it related to the Fund for the reporting period. 
The market environment was influenced by numerous factors including: rising commodity prices, a weakening U.S. dollar relative to other major currencies, a continued slow down in the housing market, rising concerns of defaults on sub-prime mortgages, and the Federal Reserve’s decision to lower the Federal Funds Rate. 
Rising oil prices continued to be a factor throughout the year. Oil prices began the period at approximately $63/barrel and touched highs of over $98/barrel in mid-November before slipping to below $89/barrel by the end of November 2007, albeit still up over 40% for the 12-month period. 
The U.S. dollar fell against the 13-nation Euro during the period amid concerns over the health of the U.S. economy, stoked by the sub-prime credit crisis. For the period December 2006 through November 2007, the U.S. dollar fell approximately 11% to $1.47/Euro. Versus the British pound, the U.S. dollar fell over 4% during the period to $2.06/£. 
With the rising concerns of defaults on U.S. sub-prime mortgages and the general tightening of credit, the Federal Reserve responded to market conditions with two rate cuts during the latter months of 2007. At the September 2007 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, the Fed cut the Federal Funds Rate by 0.50% from 5.25% to 4.75%, citing its intention to forestall adverse effects from the financial markets disruptions caused by the housing correction. In late October, the Fed again reduced the Federal Funds Rate, this time by 0.25% to 4.50%. As of November 30, 2007, the Federal Funds Rate of 4.50% is down 0.75% from December 2006. 
Despite these factors, the 12-month total return for the S&P 500 Index was 7.72% for the period ended November 30, 2007. Corporate earnings per share grew modestly while price/earnings valuations for the S&P 500 Index companies expanded slightly.

How did the Fund perform during the reporting period? 
For the 1-year period ended November 30, 2007, the State Farm Growth Fund had a total return of 13.65% after expenses and with dividends reinvested, compared to a 7.72% return for the S&P 500 Index. The line graph below provides additional perspective on the Fund’s long term results. 
 
The performance data quoted above represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate and Fund shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Recent performance may be less than the figures shown.

These figures do not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder would pay on Fund distributions or the redemption of Fund shares. 
Performance Analysis 
What factors helped and hindered performance during the reporting period? 
Companies in the State Farm Growth Fund from the Oil and Gas and Mining and Metals industries performed relatively well. The Fund’s overall largest holding, ExxonMobil (6.13% of net assets) was also one of the biggest contributors to the Fund’s return, gaining over 16% for the reporting period. Some of the other large holdings in the Oil and Gas industry that were positive contributors for the Fund include: Chevron (2.45% of net assets) up 21%, BG Group (1.76% of net assets) up 56%, and Bill Barrett Corp. (1.05% of net assets) up 23%. In total, exposure to the Oil and Gas industry was 14.93% of Fund net assets, up from 13.54% at December 1, 2006. 
Within Mining and Metals, Rio Tinto (2.79% of net assets) was the best performing stock in the Fund’s portfolio with a price increase of over 117%. During the year, the United Kingdom based mining and minerals company completed the acquisition of the Canada based aluminum manufacturer Alcan. In addition, BHP Billiton (0.82% of net assets) performed well with a price increase of over 74%. Both companies continued to benefit from cyclical increases in demand for their products. 
Also contributing to the Fund’s positive results were several holdings in Computers, Electronic/Electrical Manufacturing, Chemicals, and Consumer & Marketing industries. Within the Computers and Electronic/Electrical Manufacturing industries, Hewlett-Packard (4.06% of net assets) and Intel Corp. (1.66% of net assets) posted gains of 30% and 22%, respectively. Among the Chemicals holdings, Sigma-Aldrich (3.81% of net assets) experienced a price gain of 38% while Air Products & Chemicals (2.16% of net assets) stock improved 43%. In Consumer & Marketing, the Fund achieved a positive price gain in Procter & Gamble (3.39% of net assets) of 18%. Additionally, Nokia Corp. (1.22% of net assets) and Coca-Cola (1.68% of net assets) posted gains of 95% and 33%, respectively.

Other stocks represented in the top ten holdings of the Fund that had positive returns during the year include: Johnson & Johnson (4.42% of net assets), General Electric (3.88% of net assets), Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. (3.33% of net assets), and Microsoft (2.86% of net assets), which posted price gains of 3%, 9%, 4% and 14%, respectively. 
Several companies within the Banks (6.02% of net assets) and Financial Services (1.50% of net assets) industries experienced stock price declines, which detracted from Fund performance during the year. Citigroup was among the Fund’s largest detractors with a price decline of over -25% before being completely sold from the Fund. Citigroup reported asset write downs related to sub-prime mortgages. Also, Wells Fargo & Co. (2.25% of net assets), Bank of America (1.27% of net assets), Wachovia Corp. (1.24% of net assets) and Popular Inc. (0.44% of net assets) declined -8%, -14%, -21%, and -46%, respectively. Another detractor from returns was HNI Corp. (1.38% of net assets) which declined -22% during the period. HNI Corp. was negatively impacted by a decline in sales at its fireplace products division caused by the U.S. housing market weakness. 
The State Farm Growth Fund’s portfolio turnover over the past 12 months was 4.33%, which is consistent with the Fund’s investment philosophy and approach. The majority of the turnover was due to the Fund’s sale of Biomet, Inc., which was acquired by a private equity group for cash during the year. Biomet was a top holding of the Growth Fund prior to the sale. There were 80 holdings in the Fund totaling over $3.8 billion in assets at the end of the report period compared to 81 holdings and approximately $3.4 billion in assets one-year earlier. As highlighted in the Fund’s investment objective – we feel that a company’s dividend policy is an important component in the analysis and selection of securities for the State Farm Growth Fund. From January 1, 2007 through November 30, 2007, 54 of the stocks in the portfolio, accounting for over 72% of the Fund’s net assets, increased their dividends. 
Given the performance analysis above, what factors should shareholders take into consideration when reviewing the Fund’s performance? 
We are long-term investors who spend a lot of time getting to know companies and the people who run them. We seek to understand the company’s long term strategies as well as the competitive advantages and risks inherent in them. When we invest in a company, it is normally our intention to maintain that investment for a very long period of time. Our investment strategy generally is not influenced by short term factors. Our philosophy sometimes will result in periods when the Fund’s performance trails that of the market. We define risk as the permanent loss of investment capital. We believe this philosophy has produced competitive returns versus the benchmark over a long period of time.

State Farm Balanced Fund Management’s Discussion of Fund Performance 
 
Overview 
Describe the Fund’s investment objective and philosophy. 
The State Farm Balanced Fund is invested in a combination of stocks and bonds in the pursuit of long-term growth of principal with an element of current income. Historically, the portfolio has maintained an asset allocation profile of approximately 60% equity and 40% fixed income. The equity allocation is managed with a conservative bias that favors large capitalization companies that we believe are well managed with a niche or business specialty. The fixed income component invests in high quality U.S. government and corporate bonds primarily of intermediate maturity, with the goal of providing shareowners with current income in addition to some protection from equity market volatility. We tend to maintain a long term buy-and-hold philosophy with both the stock and bond investments of the Fund. 
Describe the relevant market environment as it related to the Fund for the reporting period. 
The market environment was influenced by numerous factors including: rising commodity prices, a weakening U.S. dollar relative to other major currencies, a continued slow down in the housing market, rising concerns of defaults on sub-prime mortgages, and the Federal Reserve’s decision to lower the Federal Funds Rate. 
Rising oil prices continued to be a factor throughout the year. Oil prices began the period at approximately $63/barrel and touched highs of over $98/barrel in mid-November before slipping to below $89/barrel by the end of November 2007, albeit still up over 40% for the 12-month period. 
The U.S. dollar fell against the 13-nation Euro during the period amid concerns over the health of the U.S. economy, stoked by the sub-prime credit crisis. For the period December 2006 through November 2007, the U.S. dollar fell approximately 11% to $1.47/Euro. Versus the British pound, the U.S. dollar fell over 4% during the period to $2.06/£. 
With the rising concerns of defaults on U.S. sub-prime mortgages and the general tightening of credit, the Federal Reserve responded to market conditions with two rate cuts during the latter months of 2007. At the September 2007 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, the Fed cut the Federal Funds Rate by 0.50% from 5.25% to 4.75%, citing its intention to forestall adverse effects from the financial markets disruptions caused by the housing correction. In late October, the Fed again reduced the Federal Funds Rate, this time by 0.25% to 4.50%. As of November 30, 2007, the Federal Funds Rate of 4.50% is down 0.75% from December 2006. 
Bond markets, as represented by the 10-year U.S. Treasury Bond yield, advanced during the 12-month period ended November 30, 2007 as the uncertainty surrounding sub-prime mortgage issues and the resulting credit tightening helped spur a flight to quality, driving prices on U.S. Treasuries higher and rates lower. The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasuries rose from 4.43% on December 1, 2006 to a peak of 5.26% on June 12, 2007 before declining 129 basis points to end at 3.97% on November 30. Short-term yields experienced an even more dramatic move down with 2-year U.S. Treasuries declining 206 basis points from a peak of 5.10% on June 14, 2007 to 3.04% on November 30, 2007.

How did the Fund perform during the reporting period? 
For the 1-year period ended November 30, 2007, the State Farm Balanced Fund had a total return of 11.49% with dividends reinvested and after expenses. The total return of the all equity benchmark S&P 500 Index was 7.72% with dividends reinvested, while the fixed income benchmark Lehman Brothers Intermediate Government/Credit Index had a total return of 6.68% over the same time period. The line graph below provides additional perspective on the Fund’s long term results.

Performance Analysis 
What factors helped and hindered performance during the reporting period? 
Equity portion of the Fund (approximately 60% of net assets throughout the period) 
Companies in the State Farm Balanced Fund from the Oil and Gas and Mining and Metals industries performed relatively well. The Fund’s overall largest holding, ExxonMobil (2.98% of total net assets) was also one of the biggest contributors to the Fund’s return, gaining over 16% for the reporting period. Some of the other large holdings in the Oil and Gas industry that were positive contributors for the Fund include: Chevron (1.89% of total net assets) up 21%, Royal Dutch Shell (1.32% of total net assets) up 15%, and BG Group (0.40% of total net assets) up 56%. In total, exposure to the Oil and Gas industry totaled 7.97% of Fund total net assets, up slightly from 7.35% at December 1, 2006. 
Within Mining and Metals, Rio Tinto (2.56% of total net assets) was the best performing stock in the Fund’s portfolio with a price increase of over 117%. During the year, the United Kingdom based mining and minerals company completed the acquisition of the Canada based aluminum manufacturer Alcan. The company continued to benefit from cyclical increases in demand for its products. 
Also contributing to the Fund’s positive results were several holdings in Computers, Electronic/Electrical Manufacturing, Chemicals, and Consumer & Marketing industries. Within the Computers and Electronic/Electrical Manufacturing industries, Hewlett-Packard (2.88% of total net assets) and Intel Corp. (1.15% of total net assets) posted gains of 30% and 22%, respectively. Among the Chemicals holdings, Sigma-Aldrich (1.93% of total net assets) experienced a price gain of 38% while

Air Products & Chemicals (1.70% of total net assets) stock improved 43%. In Consumer & Marketing, the Fund achieved a positive price gain in Procter & Gamble (2.64% of total net assets) of 18%. Additionally, Reuters Group (1.12% of total net assets) posted a gain of 40%. 
Other stocks represented in the top ten equity holdings of the Fund that had positive returns during the year include: Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. (2.55% of total net assets), General Electric (2.28% of total net assets), and Johnson & Johnson (2.11% of total net assets), which posted price gains of 4%, 9%, and 3%, respectively. 
Several companies within the Banks (4.03% of total net assets) and Financial Services (1.18% of total net assets) industries experienced stock price declines, which detracted from Fund performance during the year. Citigroup was among the Fund’s largest detractors with a price decline of over -25% before being completely sold from the Fund. Citigroup reported asset write downs related to sub-prime. Also, Wachovia Corp. (1.05% of total net assets), Popular Inc. (0.25% of total net assets), Wells Fargo & Co. (1.81% of total net assets), and Bank of America (0.72% of total net assets) declined -21%, -46%, -8%, and -14%, respectively. Another detractor from returns was Pfizer (1.70% of total net assets) which declined -14% during the period. 
Turnover in the equity portion of the State Farm Balanced Fund’s portfolio over the past 12 months was 5.95%, which is consistent with the Fund’s investment philosophy and approach. The majority of the turnover was due to the Fund’s sale of Biomet, Inc., which was acquired by a private equity group for cash during the year. Biomet was a top equity holding of the State Farm Balanced Fund prior to the sale. There were 77 holdings in the equity portion of the State Farm Balanced Fund, totaling over $847 million in assets at the end of the report period compared to 80 holdings and approximately $785 million in assets one-year earlier. As highlighted in the Fund’s investment objective, we feel a company’s dividend policy is an important component in the analysis and selection of stocks for the portfolio. From January 1, 2007 through November 30, 2007, 53 of the stocks in the portfolio, accounting for over 72% of the equity portion of the Fund’s net assets, increased their dividends. 
Fixed Income portion of the Fund (approximately 40% of net assets throughout the period) 
An intermediate maturity structure continues to be the investment orientation with 74.6% of the fixed income securities (representing 34.6% of total net assets) maturing 3-10 years out. These securities were pretty evenly split between U.S Treasury securities (14.75% of total net assets) and corporate bonds (18.86% of total net assets). From a credit rating standpoint, once you get beyond the AAA-rating of the U.S. Treasury bonds and certain corporate bonds (47.4% of fixed income assets), the remaining corporate fixed income portfolio was invested in single A-rated debt (28.3% of fixed income assets), AA-rated bonds (15.0% of fixed income assets), BBB-rated bonds (7.7% of fixed income assets), and a small allocation to BB to CCC-rated bonds (1.61% of fixed income assets), which are bonds that were downgraded to below investment grade status sometime after purchase. 
The value of the Fund’s fixed income portfolio increased as interest rates declined. However, while the Fund’s fixed-income investment orientation towards intermediate-maturity bonds provided positive total returns during the period, longer-maturity bonds performed relatively better over the entire 12-month period ended November 30. In addition, higher quality bonds outperformed relative to lower quality bonds, especially during the latter half of the year. That being said, the Fund’s fixed-income investment orientation of investing in intermediate-term, higher quality bonds helped to provide more stability and better serve as a buffer to the volatility from the equity portion of the State Farm Balanced Fund throughout the year. The duration of the State Farm Balanced Fund’s bond portfolio at the end of November 2007 stood at 4.1 years, which is up from 3.9 years on December 1, 2006. Duration is a statistical calculation that measures a bond’s (or in this case, a bond portfolio’s) price sensitivity relative to general movements in interest rates. The slightly higher duration provided a modest positive effect to performance as interest rates declined in the intermediate part of the yield curve towards the end of the reporting period. 
Given the performance analysis above, what factors should shareholders take into consideration when reviewing the Fund’s performance? 
The Fund is designed and managed as a balanced fund that blends both stocks and bonds together in one convenient investment. Given that structure, performance for the Fund over the long term will typically (but not always) fall somewhere in between the return of a stock index like the S&P 500 Index and a bond index like the Lehman Brothers Intermediate Government/Credit Index.

State Farm Interim Fund Management’s Discussion of Fund Performance 
 
Overview 
Describe the Fund’s investment objective and philosophy. 
The State Farm Interim Fund is managed in a fashion that seeks to achieve over a period of years, the highest yield possible that is consistent with low price volatility. When managing the Fund, we are generally buy-and-hold investors who focus primarily on U.S. Government obligations. General investment practice within the Fund is to maintain a portfolio with approximately equal amounts maturing over the next six years. While the Fund may invest in debt securities of varying maturities, it is structured with a maturity and interest rate risk (duration) profile that is consistent with its benchmark, the Lehman Brothers 1-5 Year U.S. Treasury Index. 
Describe the relevant market environment as it related to the Fund for the reporting period. 
From December 2006 through the middle of June 2007, yields on U.S. Treasuries moved modestly higher as the Federal Reserve maintained a neutral stance on interest rate policy and left the Fed Funds Rate unchanged at 5.25%. However, during the summer months of 2007, both the equities and bond markets became increasingly more volatile. Investors were confronted with numerous economic events including a continuing weakness in the housing market, higher energy prices, and tightening credit as rising defaults on U.S. sub-prime mortgages prompted lenders to implement more restricted lending requirements. 
In the wake of these events and increasing concerns of a potential “credit crunch”, the demand for U.S. Treasuries across all maturities increased as investors began to seek out relatively less risky assets. The Federal Reserve responded to market conditions with two Fed Funds Rate cuts during the latter months of 2007. At the September 2007 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, the Fed elected to cut the Fed Funds Rate by 0.50% from 5.25% to 4.75%, citing its intention to forestall adverse effects from the financial markets disruptions caused by the housing correction. In late October the Fed reduced the Fed Funds Rate by another 0.25% to 4.50%, which is where the rate ended as of November 30, 2007. As always, it is unknown what future actions the Fed may take regarding the Fed Funds Rate. 
Yields on U.S. Treasuries peaked in mid-June 2007 and, by the end of November, had fallen to levels below the yields at the beginning of the reporting period. The yield on the 30-year U.S. Treasury Bond rose from 4.54% on December 1, 2006 to a peak of 5.35% on June 12, 2007 before declining 95 basis points to end at 4.40% on November 30, 2007. Meanwhile, yields on short- and intermediate-maturity U.S. Treasuries moved down more substantially during the latter half of 2007. The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasuries rose from 4.43% on December 1, 2006 to a peak of 5.26% on June 12, 2007 before declining 129 basis points to end at 3.97% on November 30, 2007. Short-term yields experienced the most dramatic move down with 2-year U.S. Treasuries declining 206 basis points from a peak of 5.10% on June 14, 2007 to 3.04% on November 30, 2007. 
Overall, for the 12-month period ended November 30, 2007, longer-maturity U.S. Treasuries outperformed relative to both short- and intermediate-maturity U.S. Treasuries.

How did the Fund perform during the reporting period? 
For the 1-year period ended November 30, 2007, the State Farm Interim Fund had a total return of 7.13% with dividends reinvested and after expenses, compared to a return of 7.71% for the Lehman Brothers 1-5 Year U.S. Treasury Index. The line graph below provides additional perspective on the Fund’s long term results.

Performance Analysis 
What factors helped and hindered performance during the reporting period? 
The value of the Fund’s U.S. Treasury Notes increased as interest rates declined. However, while the Fund’s orientation towards short- and intermediate-maturity notes provided positive total returns during the period, longer-maturity U.S. Treasuries performed relatively better over the entire 12-month period ended November 30, 2007. As mentioned earlier, the Fund maintains generally equal amounts of exposure across a six-year maturity spectrum. As bonds mature, they are reinvested in U.S. Treasury Notes at prevailing interest rate levels. The duration of the State Farm Interim Fund at the end of November 2007 stood at 2.1 years which is down from 2.3 years on December 1, 2006. Duration is a statistical calculation that measures a bond’s (or in this case, a bond fund’s) price sensitivity relative to general movements in interest rates. The slightly lower duration reduced somewhat the positive effect to performance associated with declining interest rates. 
Given the performance analysis above, what factors should shareholders take into consideration when reviewing the Fund’s performance? 
Given its investment objective of high current income consistent with low price volatility, the Fund is designed to be a stable, low risk element of a diversified portfolio. As interest rates fall, bond prices rise and vice versa. If the Federal Reserve continues to lower the Fed Funds Rate, this activity could increase total returns (interest plus price gains). Conversely, if the Fed raises the Fed Funds Rate, this activity could reduce total returns.

State Farm Municipal Bond Fund Management’s Discussion of Fund Performance 
 
Overview 
Describe the Fund’s investment objective and philosophy. 
The State Farm Municipal Bond Fund seeks as high a rate of income exempt from federal income taxes as is consistent with prudent investment management. Income may be subject to state and local taxes and (if applicable) the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT). In managing the Fund, we focus on high credit quality bonds with an investment philosophy that seeks to provide competitive total returns, while managing for tax efficiency within the municipal bond asset class over the long run. 
The municipal bond market, while relatively small in total assets compared to the taxable market, is very broad by number of issuers. As a result, we believe that fundamental research and professional management is critical to success. While we diversify the maturity spectrum of the bonds within the portfolio, we tend to favor the intermediate maturity range for the bulk of the Fund’s assets. In doing so, we seek to maintain a fairly consistent duration and interest rate exposure relative to the Fund’s benchmark – the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index. 
Describe the relevant market environment as it related to the Fund for the reporting period. 
From December 2006 through June 2007, municipal bond yields across the maturity spectrum rose while bonds posted modest total returns. However, during the summer months of 2007, both the equities and bond markets became increasingly more volatile. Investors were confronted with numerous economic events, including a continuing weakness in the housing market, higher energy prices, and tightening credit as rising defaults on U.S. sub-prime mortgages prompted lenders to implement more restricted lending requirements. 
In the wake of these events and increasing concerns of a potential “credit crunch”, the Federal Reserve responded to market conditions with two Fed Funds Rate cuts during the latter months of 2007. At the September 2007 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, the Fed elected to cut the Fed Funds Rate by 0.50% from 5.25% to 4.75%, citing its intention to forestall adverse effects from the financial markets disruptions caused by the housing correction. In late October, the Fed reduced the Fed Funds Rate by another 0.25% to 4.50%, which is where the rate ended as of November 30, 2007. As always, it is unknown what future actions the Fed may take regarding interest rates. 
Due primarily to the changes in the municipal bond market yield curve, short maturity bonds outperformed intermediate maturities, which in turn outperformed long maturity bonds over the 1-year reporting period. From a credit standpoint, higher credit quality bonds outperformed low quality bonds over the reporting period. 
Overall, at current interest rate levels, 20-year AAA-rated municipal bonds provide 95% of the yield available from taxable 20-year U.S. Treasuries1. This comparison may be used as a general gauge within the industry to determine the relative attractiveness of municipal securities. Thus, municipal bonds have recently offered yields close to those of comparable Treasury bonds but with federal income tax-free interest.

Performance Analysis 
What factors helped and hindered performance during the reporting period? 
As short and intermediate interest rates were declining more substantially than longer-term interest rates during the last five months of the reporting period, the Fund’s short and intermediate maturity orientation was a benefit with 74.9% of total investments in bonds maturing within 12 years versus 51.70% for the benchmark as of November 30, 2007. In addition, the Fund ended November 2007 with 25.1% of total investments in bonds maturing between 12-22 years, with no bonds in the portfolio having maturities over 22 years. As a result, the Fund was positioned to benefit from a decline in interest rates, especially during a period when yields on short and intermediate bond maturities declined more than long maturities. The modified duration of the State Farm Municipal Bond Fund at the end of November 2007 stood at 4.35 years, which is up from 4.09 years on December 1, 2006. Modified duration is a statistical calculation that measures a bond’s (or in this case, a bond fund’s) price sensitivity relative to general movements in interest rates. The slightly higher duration also contributed somewhat to the positive effect to performance associated with declining interest rates. 
The Fund also maintained a high quality credit orientation throughout the reporting period and ended November 2007 with over 73% of total investments in municipal bonds rated Aa1 or higher by Moody’s Investor Services. Over the reporting period, higher quality municipal credits outperformed low quality credits. Combined, the difference in maturity structure between the Fund and benchmark, along with the Fund’s higher credit quality orientation than the benchmark played a role in the Fund’s relative outperformance versus the benchmark during the reporting period. 
As highlighted earlier, the objective of the Fund is to seek as high a rate of income exempt from federal income taxes as is consistent with prudent investment management. The Fund has been invested with a bias towards high-credit quality, short and intermediate maturity bonds under the belief that lower-credit quality, long maturity bonds have not provided enough additional yield to compensate for the higher risk and volatility. 
The number of individual bonds held in the portfolio increased over the reporting period from 206 to 259 bonds. Turnover for the reporting period was 13.02%. California remained the largest single state of investment within the Fund at 8.84% of net assets. Notable changes to the portfolio included increased purchases of general obligation bonds in Kansas and California. However, the majority of the changes to the portfolio were the result of the normal process of reinvesting short-term maturities. 
Given the performance analysis above, what factors should shareholders take into consideration when reviewing the Fund’s performance? 
The State Farm Municipal Bond Fund seeks a high level of income exempt from federal income tax through investment in a diversified portfolio of high quality bonds. We utilize a long-term philosophy seeking to provide competitive total returns relative to the municipal bond asset class while managing for tax efficiency.

Expense Example (unaudited) 
 
As a shareholder of a Fund, you incur ongoing costs, including management fees and other Fund expenses. The Example in the following table is intended to help you understand your ongoing costs (in dollars) of investing in a Fund and to compare these costs with the ongoing costs of investing in other mutual funds. 
The Example is based on an investment of $1,000 invested at the beginning of the period and held for the entire period June 1, 2007 through November 30, 2007. 
Actual Expenses 
The first line under each Fund name in the table below provides information about actual account values and actual expenses. You may use the information in this line, together with the amount you invested, to estimate the expenses that you paid over the period. Simply divide your account value for a Fund by $1,000 (for example, an $8,600 account value divided by $1,000 = 8.6), then multiply the result by the number in the first line under the heading entitled “Expenses Paid During Period” for the applicable Fund to estimate the expenses you paid on your account for that Fund during this period. If your account has multiple Fund positions, add up the results calculated for each Fund position within your account to estimate the expenses you paid on your total account value. A potential $25 low balance fee is not included in the expenses shown in the table. This fee may be charged to an account (other than a SEP IRA, SIMPLE IRA or an account held under other employer-sponsored qualified retirement plans) if the balance of the account falls below $1,000 at the close of business on the first business day in November, unless the account was opened on or after January 1 within the same year. You should consider any low balance fee you incurred when estimating the total ongoing expenses paid over the period and the impact of this fee on your ending account value. This additional fee has the effect of reducing investment returns. 
Hypothetical Example for Comparison Purposes 
The second line under each Fund name in the table below provides information about hypothetical account values and hypothetical expenses based on the Fund’s actual expense ratio and an assumed rate of return of 5% per year before expenses, which is not the Fund’s actual return. The hypothetical account values and expenses may not be used to estimate the actual ending account balance or expenses you paid for the period. You may use this information to compare the ongoing costs of investing in the Fund and other funds. To do so, compare this 5% hypothetical example with the 5% hypothetical examples that appear in the shareholder reports of the other funds. A potential $25 low balance fee is not included in the expenses shown in the table. This fee may be charged to an account (other than a SEP IRA, SIMPLE IRA or an account held under other employer-sponsored qualified retirement plans) if the balance of the account falls below $1,000 at the close of business on the first business day in November, unless the account was opened on or after January 1 within the same year. You should consider any low balance fee that you incurred when estimating the total ongoing expenses paid over the period and the impact of this fee on your ending account value. This additional fee has the effect of reducing investment returns. 
Please note that the expenses shown in the table are meant to highlight your ongoing costs only. Therefore, the second line under each Fund name in the table is useful in comparing ongoing costs only, and will not help you determine the relative total costs of owning different funds, including those that have transactional costs, such as sales charges (loads), redemptions fees, or exchange fees.

Board Review of the Continuation of the Investment Advisory Agreement 
At a meeting of the Board of Trustees (the “Board”) of State Farm Associates’ Funds Trust (“Associates’ Funds Trust”) held on June 15, 2007, all of the Trustees present, including those Trustees present who were not interested persons of Associates’ Funds Trust, as defined by Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Independent Trustees”), considered whether to approve the continuation of the Investment Advisory and Management Services Agreement between State Farm Investment Management Corp. (“SFIMC”) and Associates’ Funds Trust (the “Advisory Agreement”), including an amendment to such agreement to provide that the Associates’ Funds Trust will pay investment management and advisory fees to SFIMC on a monthly, rather than quarterly basis. 
In considering whether to approve the continuation of the Advisory Agreement, the Independent Trustees were assisted in their review by independent legal counsel who, prior to the June 15, 2007 meeting, sent to SFIMC a request for information to be provided to the Board in connection with the Board’s consideration of continuing the Advisory Agreement. SFIMC provided materials to the Board responding to that request prior to the meeting, including a fund-by-fund profitability analysis on each series of the Associates’ Funds Trust (each a “Fund” and collectively the “Funds”). SFIMC also provided the Board with additional information that SFIMC believed would be useful to the Board in evaluating whether to approve continuation of the Advisory Agreement. The Board also received a report prepared by Morningstar, Inc., an independent fund tracking organization (the “Morningstar Report”), relating to the performance and expenses of each of the Funds prior to the June 15th meeting. In addition, the Board received and reviewed a memorandum from the legal counsel to Associates’ Funds Trust and its Independent Trustees regarding their responsibilities (particularly the Independent Trustees’ responsibilities) in considering whether to approve continuation of the Advisory Agreement. 
The Independent Trustees conducted a preliminary review of all this material on May 29, 2007 at a separate meeting, during which management of Associates’ Funds Trust expanded on those materials, responded to specific questions from the Independent Trustees, and then produced enhanced materials to the Board at the June 15th meeting in response to additional, specific requests. As part of the Board’s consideration of whether to approve the continuation of the Advisory Agreement, the Independent Trustees met outside the presence of SFIMC management and were advised by their independent legal counsel. 
Investment Performance 
The Board considered the performance of each Fund. Among other things, the Board examined the year-to-date, one-, three-, five- and ten-year performance of each Fund as compared to the performance of one or more benchmark indexes and a peer group of funds with comparable investment objectives, investment strategies, asset size and no-load structures (“Peer Funds”). Regarding the performance of the State Farm Interim Fund and the fixed income portion of the State Farm Balanced Fund, the Board noted that they had been advised that the management of those portfolios has been effected in a conservative fashion, and therefore relative performance has lagged over the three- and five-year periods ended March 31, 2007. 
The Board further considered the information contained in the Morningstar Report relating to the overall performance of the Funds, including against each Fund’s benchmark and/or index and with the performance of the Fund’s Peer Funds. After extensive discussion of this and other performance information, the Board concluded that the investment performance of the Funds over the periods reviewed was acceptable. 
Fees and Expenses 
The Board examined the fee structure and expense ratio of each Fund, including in comparison to Peer Funds. The Board also considered SFIMC’s profitability in serving as investment adviser to Associates’ Funds Trust, noting that SFIMC earned a modest profit per Fund in managing the Associates’ Funds Trust. The Board considered the effect, if any, on shareholders that would result from the proposal to change the fee payment schedule to a monthly basis. Based upon these factors, the Board concluded that each Fund’s advisory fee (including pursuant to the proposed revised payment schedule) was reasonable and appropriate for the shareholders of each Fund. 
Nature, Extent and Quality of Services 
The Board considered the nature, extent and quality of the advisory services provided by SFIMC to the Funds. The Board considered the make-up, education and experience of the SFIMC teams responsible for managing the Funds, and concluded that SFIMC’s investment management teams have a satisfactory, long-term track record in managing the Funds. After considering this information, the Board concluded that SFIMC had more than sufficient resources and expertise to continue to manage the Funds, and that given its past experience, SFIMC would be able to continue to provide satisfactory services to Associates’ Funds Trust. 
The Board next discussed whether SFIMC derives any other direct or indirect benefits from serving as investment adviser to the Funds. SFIMC discussed the various ancillary services that it provides the Funds, including serving as transfer agent, and its

affiliate, State Farm VP Management Corp., serving as the Funds’ underwriter. SFIMC explained to the Board that neither SFIMC nor State Farm VP Management Corp. receives fees from Associates’ Funds Trust for providing those services. SFIMC indicated to the Board that it was not aware of any other ancillary or other benefits that SFIMC (and its affiliates) receive from Associates’ Funds Trust, particularly because SFIMC does not execute securities trades on behalf of the Funds through an affiliated broker-dealer. The Board concluded that the lack of any material ancillary, or so-called “fallout,” benefits enables SFIMC to manage assets of the Funds in a manner that appears to be free of conflicts of interest. 
The Board next discussed the extent to which economies of scale will be realized as each Fund grows and whether each Fund’s fee levels reflect economies of scale for the benefit of the Fund. SFIMC explained to the Board that economies of scale occur when a mutual fund’s expenses per unit, such as per dollar invested in the fund, decreases as the fund increases in size. One way a mutual fund company achieves economies of scale is to lower the average cost per unit by spreading fixed costs over a larger asset base. SFIMC advised the Board that, as the Funds grow, each Fund’s fixed costs will be spread over a larger asset base, so a Fund’s fee levels will reflect economies of scale for the benefit of the Fund as the Fund grows. The Board also noted that the Advisory Agreement includes breakpoints, which lead to economics of scale for Fund shareholders as assets increase. 
Based on the Trustees’ deliberations and their evaluation of the information provided by SFIMC, the Board, including all of the Independent Trustees present at the Board meeting, unanimously approved the continuation of the Advisory Agreement for all Funds through June 30, 2008.

STATE FARM ASSOCIATES’ FUNDS TRUST 
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 



1.
Investment Objective 
The State Farm Associates’ Funds Trust (the “Trust”) has four separate investment portfolios (each a “Fund” and together, the “Funds”). Each Fund has its own investment objective, investment policies, restrictions, and attendant risks. 
The State Farm Growth Fund (the “Growth Fund”) seeks long-term growth of capital which may be supplemented by income. The Growth Fund seeks to achieve this objective by investing at least 80% of its assets in common stocks and other income producing equity securities. 
The State Farm Balanced Fund (the “Balanced Fund”) seeks long-term growth of principal while providing some current income. The Balanced Fund seeks to achieve its objective by investing approximately 60% of its assets in common stocks, and ordinarily limits its common stock investments to no more than 75% of total assets. The Balanced Fund ordinarily invests at least 25% of its total assets in fixed income securities. The Balanced Fund invests in fixed income securities to provide relative stability of principal and income. 
The State Farm Interim Fund (the “Interim Fund”) seeks the realization over a period of years of the highest yield consistent with relatively low price volatility. The Interim Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective through investment in high quality debt securities with short and intermediate-term maturities. 
The State Farm Municipal Bond Fund (the “Municipal Bond Fund”) seeks as high a rate of income exempt from federal income taxes as is consistent with prudent investment management. The Municipal Bond Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective through investment primarily in a diversified selection of municipal bonds with maturities of one to seventeen years. The Municipal Bond Fund normally invests so that either (1) at least 80% of the Fund’s net investment income is exempt from regular federal income tax or (2) at least 80% of the Fund’s net assets are invested in securities that produce income exempt from regular federal income tax. 
 



2.
Significant accounting policies 
The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the Funds in the preparation of their financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). 
Securities valuation 
Investments are stated at market value. Stocks traded on securities exchanges, or in the over-the-counter market in which transaction prices are reported, are valued at the last sales prices on the day of valuation or, if there are no reported sales on that day, at the last reported bid price for the day. Stocks traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market are valued at the NASDAQ Official Closing Price. Long-term debt securities and U.S. Treasury bills are generally valued using quotations provided by an independent pricing service. Short-term debt securities with remaining maturities of 60 days or less (other than U.S. Treasury bills) are generally valued on an amortized cost basis, which approximates market value. Short sales are valued at market value. 
Portfolio securities that are primarily traded on foreign securities exchanges (“foreign securities”) are generally valued at the closing values of such securities on the respective exchange where each security is primarily traded. In the event that State Farm Investment Management Corp. (“SFIMC”), the Trust’s investment adviser, determines that a market quotation for a foreign security held by a Fund is not reliable because of events or circumstances that have occurred between the time of the market quotation and the time as of which the security is to be fair valued (“subsequent event”), the security is valued at fair value in accordance with procedures established by the Trust’s Board of Trustees. A subsequent event might include company-specific developments, a development that might affect an entire market or region, a potentially global development or a significant change in one or more U.S. securities indexes. If a security is valued at “fair value,” that value may be different from the last quoted market price. 
Securities not valued as described above, and securities for which market prices are not readily available or are considered unreliable, are fair valued pursuant to procedures established by the Trust’s Board of Trustees. Fair value, as a general principle, means the value a Fund might reasonably expect to receive upon sale of that security. These fair value procedures require SFIMC to obtain bid price quotations from brokers or dealers in the securities. If SFIMC cannot obtain a quotation for the security or if SFIMC believes the quotation does not represent the security’s fair value, then SFIMC will determine the security’s fair value in its reasonable judgment. 
In making a fair value judgment, SFIMC may use different methodologies, including multiple of earnings, multiple of book value, discount from market of a similar freely traded security or, for debt securities, yield to maturity. Other factors SFIMC may consider in determining fair value for a security include, but are not limited to, fundamental analytical data relating to the security, the nature and duration of any restrictions on disposition of the security, the last traded price of the security, significant global or regional events such as political unrest, natural disasters, and war, and significant movements in major market indices, exchange traded funds, index futures or other financial instruments in the U.S. or other markets.

STATE FARM ASSOCIATES’ FUNDS TRUST 
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
 
Securities transactions and investment income 
For financial reporting purposes, security transactions are accounted for on trade date (date the order to buy or sell is executed) and dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date. Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis, and includes amortization of premiums and discounts on fixed income securities. Realized gains and losses from security transactions are reported on an identified cost basis. 
Securities purchased on a “when-issued” basis 
The Municipal Bond Fund may purchase municipal bonds on a “when-issued” basis. Delivery and payment for these securities may be a month or more after the purchase date, during which time such securities are subject to market fluctuations. The Municipal Bond Fund identifies and holds specific liquid assets with a market value at least equal to the amount of the when-issued purchase commitments in order to ensure that it can meet those commitments. It is possible that the securities will never be issued and the commitment cancelled. At November 30, 2007, the Municipal Bond Fund had commitments of $14,304,503 (representing 3.07% of net assets) for when-issued securities. 
Fund share valuation 
Fund shares are sold and redeemed on a continuous basis at net asset value. The net asset value per share is determined daily on each day the New York Stock Exchange is open, except that a Fund need not compute a net asset value on any day when no purchase or redemption order has been received by the Fund. The net asset values are determined as of the close of regular session trading on the New York Stock Exchange (usually 3:00 p.m. Central time). The net asset value per share is computed by dividing the total value of a Fund’s investments and other assets, less liabilities, by the number of Fund shares outstanding. 
Federal income taxes, dividends and distributions to shareholders 
It is the Funds’ policy to comply with the special provisions of Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and, in the manner provided therein, to distribute substantially all of their taxable income, including any net realized gain on sales of investments, reportable for federal income tax purposes. The Funds intend to comply with this policy and, accordingly, no provision for federal income taxes has been made. 
As of November 30, 2007, aggregate securities holdings’ unrealized gains and losses based on cost for federal income tax purposes for the Funds were as follows:

The differences between the cost of investments for federal income tax purposes and the cost of investments reflected on the Schedules of Investments are primarily related to the timing of recognition of gains and losses and investment income. 
The Interim Fund and Municipal Bond Fund declare dividends daily equal to each Fund’s respective net investment income. Prior to April 30, 2007, these amounts were distributed at the end of each calendar quarter. Beginning April 30, 2007, these amounts are distributed on the last business day of each month. 
Net realized gains on sales of investments, if any, are distributed annually after the close of a Fund’s fiscal year. Dividends and distributions payable to shareholders are recorded by the respective Fund on the ex-dividend date. 
On December 19, 2007, the Growth Fund declared an ordinary income dividend of $0.665 per share and a capital gain dividend of $2.08204 per share to shareholders of record on December 18, 2007 (reinvestment date December 19, 2007). 
On December 19, 2007, the Balanced Fund declared an ordinary income dividend of $0.96 per share and a capital gain dividend of $1.74103 per share to shareholders of record on December 18, 2007 (reinvestment date December 19, 2007). 
On December 19, 2007, the Municipal Bond Fund declared a capital gain dividend of $0.01562 per share to shareholders of record on December 18, 2007 (reinvestment date December 19, 2007).

The Growth Fund utilized $921,622 and $18,999,262 of capital loss carryover due to expire in 2011 and 2012, respectively, to offset realized capital gains in 2007. The Interim Fund had a capital loss carryover of $884,533 that expired in 2007 and was reclassified from accumulated net realized gain (loss) to paid in capital on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. 
As of November 30, 2007, in accordance with federal tax regulations the components of distributable earnings on a tax basis were as follows:

The timing and characterization of certain income and capital gain distributions are determined annually in accordance with federal income tax regulations which may differ from GAAP. These differences may be primarily due to differing treatment for futures contracts, the recognition of net realized losses, the timing of fund distributions, expiring capital loss carryovers, and foreign currency transactions. As a result, net investment income and net realized gain or loss on investment transactions for a reporting period may differ from distributions during such period. 
Accordingly, each Fund may periodically make reclassifications among certain capital accounts without impacting its net asset value. As of November 30, 2007, these reclassifications were as follows:

Foreign currency translation 
Investment securities and other assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing foreign exchange rates at period end. Purchases and sales of investment securities and income and expense items denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing foreign exchange rates on the respective dates of transactions. That portion of realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments that results from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates is not separately disclosed but is included with realized and unrealized gains and losses on investment securities. 
Expenses 
Expenses arising in connection with a specific Fund are allocated to that Fund. Common Trust expenses are allocated between the Funds in proportion to each Fund’s relative net assets. 
Use of estimates 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U. S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
Commitments and contingencies 
In the normal course of business, the Trust enters into contracts on behalf of the Funds that may contain provisions for general indemnifications. Each Fund’s maximum exposure under these indemnification provisions is unknown, as this would involve future claims that may be made against each Fund that are not known at this time. However, based on past experience, the Funds believe the risk of loss from these indemnification provisions is improbable. 
New accounting pronouncements 
In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” (FIN 48). FIN 48 provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized, measured, presented and disclosed in the financial statements. FIN 48 requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the Funds’ tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are “more-likely-than-not” of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold would be recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. Adoption of FIN 48 is required for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and is to be applied to all open tax years as of the effective date. The Trust’s management has completed a review of FIN 48 and has determined that no tax liability is required and no additional disclosures are needed as of November 30, 2007. 
In addition, in September 2006, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157 “Fair Value Measurements” (SFAS 157) was issued and is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for determining fair value, and requires expanded disclosure on fair valuation in the Trust’s financial statements. As of November 30, 2007, the Trust’s management does not believe the adoption of SFAS 157 will impact how the Trust values each Fund’s portfolio securities.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
To the Shareholders and 
Board of Trustees of the State Farm Associates’ Funds Trust 
We have audited the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities, including the schedules of investments, of the State Farm Growth Fund, State Farm Balanced Fund, State Farm Interim Fund, and State Farm Municipal Bond Fund (the “Funds”), comprising the State Farm Associates’ Funds Trust, as of November 30, 2007, and the related statements of operations for the year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the five years in the period then ended. These financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of the Funds’ management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based on our audits. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Funds’ internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds’ internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and financial highlights, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of November 30, 2007, by correspondence with the custodian and brokers or by other appropriate auditing procedures where replies by brokers were not received. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of each of the Funds at November 30, 2007, the results of their operations for the year then ended, the changes in their net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the five years in the period then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
