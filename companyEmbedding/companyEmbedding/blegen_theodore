Theodore 
                    C. Blegen
                        by Carlton C. Qualey (Volume 21: Page 3)

To the good fortune of the Norwegian-American 
                  Historical Association, Theodore C. Blegen served as managing 
                  editor for its publications until his resignation in 1960. During 
                  the thirty-five years that he held this post, forty-one volumes 
                  were issued. The credit roster of the association lists many 
                  names, but Dean Blegen�s will, by common consent, head it, for 
                  he set the standards of selection and of editorial work. That 
                  these publications rank high in the field of immigration history 
                  is a matter of general agreement among scholars. In the writings 
                  put out by some immigrant-American historical societies, the 
                  variance in quality is apparent. Much of their product is colored 
                  by attempts to demonstrate the pre-eminence of special national 
                  stocks in American history. Anyone who is aware of the pressure 
                  groups that exist within the Norwegian element in America will 
                  recognize the significance of Dean Blegen�s achievement. His 
                  independence from control by sectarian and filio-pietistic elements 
                  among the Norwegian Americans, his diplomatic ability, which 
                  carried the day in many a difference of opinion, and his devotion 
                  to high standards of historical scholarship enabled him to create 
                  for the Norwegian-American Historical Association a remarkable 
                  reputation as a learned society.
To those who discount background as an important factor [4] 
                    in conditioning character, I would direct attention to the 
                    Blegen family of Augsburg College, Minneapolis, and of Saga 
                    Hill, Lake Minnetonka. The affection and intellectual discipline 
                    that characterized the home of a classical scholar were supplemented 
                    during vacations in that remarkable extension of the Augsburg 
                    faculty community at Lake Minnetonka, called Saga Hill. Theodore 
                    Blegen has himself described this summer colony in a charming 
                    article in Minnesota History. {1} The intellectual competition 
                    afforded by a father who was a professor, by a mother who 
                    had been a successful businesswoman before her marriage in 
                    a day when such a career was unusual, by two sisters and three 
                    brothers (one of whom is an eminent classical archaeologist), 
                    and by faculty neighbors and their children must have contributed 
                    to "bending the twig" toward a scholarly career. 
                    To this gifted family environment was added a rugged physical 
                    inheritance.
Dean Blegen�s undergraduate studies at Augsburg College and 
                    at the University of Minnesota were followed by graduate work 
                    at Minnesota that led to a doctorate in history. He did high-school 
                    teaching at Fergus Falls, Minnesota, and at Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 
                    then served an apprenticeship under Solon J. Buck at the Minnesota 
                    Historical Society in the arts of editing and meticulous research. 
                    He succeeded to the position of superintendent of the historical 
                    society and taught at Hamline and Minnesota universities, 
                    eventually becoming a full professor at the latter. A Guggenheim 
                    fellowship year in Norway, 1928�29, proved stimulating and 
                    productive. Dean Blegen�s career reached one of its peaks 
                    in his election to the presidency of the Mississippi Valley 
                    Historical Association in 1943. From 1940 to 1960 he served 
                    as dean of the graduate school in the University of Minnesota. 
                    [5] 
Clara Woodward Blegen, a woman in her own way as able as 
                    her husband, has accompanied him in all his efforts during 
                    his adult years, bearing two handsome children, Theodore and 
                    Margaret. Those who know the Blegens realize full well how 
                    significant she has been in her husband�s career. It has been 
                    a fortunate partnership.
Although Theodore Blegen�s deanship increasingly took up 
                    his time after 1940, he continued as an active and productive 
                    historian, notably in his direction of the publication program 
                    of the Norwegian-American Historical Association, in important 
                    service on the executive council of the Minnesota Historical 
                    Society, in consultative functions for other state historical 
                    organizations, and, during World War II, in editing the GI 
                    Roundtable Pamphlets issued by the Historical Service Board 
                    of the American Historical Association for the Information 
                    and Education Division of the army. From 1940, however, his 
                    energies and genius were devoted primarily to building up 
                    the Minnesota graduate school, to serving the university on 
                    innumerable committees and in countless capacities, to giving 
                    major service to the Association of American Universities 
                    and to the Land Grant College Association, and to consultation 
                    on graduate education in New York and other states. He has 
                    received recognition in the form of honorary degrees from 
                    Hamline University, Carleton, St. Olaf, Luther, and Augustana 
                    (Rock Island) colleges, and the University of Oslo, Norway.
For recreation, Theodore Blegen has turned to folk ballads, 
                    Sherlock Holmes, golf, fishing in northern Minnesota, and 
                    stimulating conversation at the university faculty�s Campus 
                    Club. {2} [6] 
It would be difficult to determine in which field Dean Blegen 
                    has made his most significant contribution. On January 29�30, 
                    1960, the University of Minnesota and its department of history 
                    honored him with a conference on immigration history, attended 
                    by scholars in that field from all parts of the United States 
                    and from Norway. It was a well-deserved tribute. The area 
                    chosen might easily have been Minnesota history, or, even 
                    more appropriately, graduate education. But the field closest 
                    to his heart was probably immigrant history, especially that 
                    of the Norwegian Americans. His own two basic volumes, Norwegian 
                    Migration to America, are generally considered model studies 
                    in the field.
Dean Blegen�s contributions to publication, as well as his 
                    fields of major activities, can be classified thus: state 
                    and local history, immigration history, and educational policy. 
                    A list of his works in Norwegian-American history appears 
                    at the conclusion of this discussion, and so this need not 
                    be a bibliographical article. Even at this short perspective, 
                    however, some estimate may be attempted.
His long service for the Minnesota Historical Society made 
                    it inevitable that he contribute to the field of state and 
                    local history. In an eloquent essay entitled "Inverted 
                    Provincialism," he refutes those who depreciate local 
                    studies. "This inverted provincialism considered itself 
                    urbane and cosmopolitan. It was little interested in the values 
                    of folk culture. It rejected the near-at-hand as local and 
                    insignificant. It cultivated the faraway, without fully understanding 
                    it because it did not understand the near-at-hand, without 
                    sensing, too, that the faraway may in its inner meaning be 
                    near-at-hand. Imitative because it lacked self-confidence, 
                    inverted provincialism in many instances established molds 
                    and patterns for our educational and institutional development 
                    that have been hard to break. . . . In history it devoted 
                    itself to the polite and reputable themes. It lifted its eyebrows 
                    at those who turned aside from the Monroe Doctrine, the tariff, 
                    and presidential administrations to find life and blood and 
                    significance [7] in social and cultural themes, whether on 
                    national, regional, or local levels." After pointing 
                    to numerous manifestations of growing interest in folk studies 
                    and regional history, Blegen concludes: "And so I come 
                    back to the matter of knowing ourselves � the key word of 
                    the Greek philosophers � and the society in which we live, 
                    without self-deception and with confidence as we look to the 
                    future. In such knowing, starting with community and homeland, 
                    we have the basis for knowing the universal." {3}
In the field of "grass roots history," Blegen�s 
                    contributions have been notable. They are so many that it 
                    is difficult to select the most important, but few would question 
                    inclusion of the classic essay, "The �Fashionable Tour� 
                    on the Upper Mississippi." Here he brings to vivid life 
                    the era of the Mississippi panoramas: the travel movies of 
                    the mid-nineteenth century, which promoted steamboat tours 
                    to the Upper Mississippi region, and the people who took the 
                    tour and told about it. At this writing, the best brief histories 
                    of Minnesota are those done by Theodore Blegen. A masterpiece 
                    of succinctness is the essay in the World Book Encyclopedia; 
                    and his Building Minnesota, although directed to high-school 
                    students, is the best short history for general readers as 
                    well. The files of Minnesota History contain numerous examples 
                    of Blegen�s skill in lifting the ordinary into proper perspective. 
                    His leadership in the state and local fields and his teaching 
                    of Minnesota history brought to print innumerable studies. 
                    {4} 
The centennial of the coming of the first shipload of Norwegian 
                    immigrants to America led directly in 1925 to the organization, 
                    on October 6 of that year, of the Norwegian-American Historical 
                    Association. Theodore C. Blegen became [8] managing editor, 
                    and with the strong co-operation of the novelist O. E. Rølvaag 
                    and of other Norwegian-American leaders, he issued the first 
                    publication in 1926: volume 1 of Studies and Records. To date, 
                    twenty volumes in this series have appeared; it contains articles, 
                    documents, translated immigrant letters, and bibliographical 
                    essays, forming a vast kaleidoscopic picture of the coming 
                    of Norwegians to America. Five volumes in a Travel and Description 
                    Series were issued, including travel accounts and frontier 
                    reminiscences and letters. Sixteen special publications, including 
                    Blegen�s two studies of Norwegian immigration, complete this 
                    impressive list. In addition, many of his articles were contributed 
                    to other state and national historical publications in the 
                    field of immigration history, and two of his volumes were 
                    issued by the University of Minnesota Press. One of these 
                    was Norwegian Emigrant Songs and Ballads, in which Professor 
                    Martin B. Ruud was Blegen�s collaborator. It contains the 
                    immortal "Oleana" ballad, now increasingly popular. 
                    The other volume is one of the few collections of immigrant 
                    letters conveniently available, Land of Their Choice: The 
                    Immigrants Write Home. {5} 
In the latter volume, Blegen expressed most clearly and effectively 
                    his views on immigrant history, notably in the brilliant first 
                    chapter. He writes: "The immigrant�s image of America, 
                    portrayed with a thousand details in letters, is interesting 
                    not only as a record of what was thus transmitted directly 
                    to vast numbers of people in Europe in the nineteenth century, 
                    but also as a propelling force in emigration itself. There 
                    has been all too often an air of impersonality in accounts 
                    of American immigration. The coming of thirty millions of 
                    people was a movement of such magnitude that, to many, it 
                    has seemed futile to try to disengage personalities from the 
                    mass. Many writers have forgotten the individual man in the 
                    surging complex of international circumstances. World forces 
                    pushed people out of their accustomed environment; world [9] 
                    forces pulled them westward with magnetic power. But the pivot 
                    of human motion is individual life. Migration was a simple 
                    individual act � a decision that led to consequences �and 
                    the �America letters� were a dynamic factor, perhaps the most 
                    effective single factor, in bringing discontent to a focus 
                    and into action." {6} 
In the field of immigration history, Blegen�s reputation 
                    will probably rest most solidly on his Norwegian Migration 
                    to America, 1825�1860, and Norwegian Migration to America: 
                    The American Transition. {7} Much of the material was collected 
                    during his Guggenheim fellowship year in Norway. The first 
                    volume emphasizes the background in Norway of the beginnings 
                    and early decades of emigration. Blegen�s concern is with 
                    economic and social conditions. The book contains a skillful 
                    linking of expulsive factors in Norway and attractive conditions 
                    in America, effective use of illustrative letters and newspaper 
                    information, and exciting chapters on emigrant gold seekers 
                    and emigrant songs and poems. It is a model study of its kind. 
                    In the second and longer volume, Blegen deals with the problems 
                    of acculturation in the United States. The distribution of 
                    settlement, the impact of the frontier on the immigrant, the 
                    dynamics of religious change, the problems of communication 
                    presented by the contact of Norwegian and English, education 
                    issues, immigrant newspapers, slavery and Norwegian immigrants, 
                    the migration of culture, and almost innumerable aspects of 
                    Norwegian-American life are presented. The book gives a vivid 
                    cross-sectional analysis of an immigrant-American nationality 
                    group in process of transition from the old-country culture, 
                    through the Norwegian-American phase, toward a new amalgamation 
                    that is still in process in the American population.
Apart from the immense amount of factual material presented 
                    in Blegen�s total output, his principal contribution is methodological. 
                    Starting with the premise of thoroughness of [10] historical 
                    training, indefatigability in research, and boundless enthusiasm 
                    and drive, Blegen proceeds to demonstrate the importance of 
                    artistic presentation. It is not enough to collect and to 
                    record. It is necessary to re-create. To do this it is essential 
                    to bring the reader into the world of the immigrant, and the 
                    best way to do this is to repeat for him the words of the 
                    immigrants themselves. They were common folk, untrained in 
                    literary expression, but often possessed of an artlessness 
                    of description and sincerity of sentiment that carried their 
                    own message. Certainly these people were their own best spokesmen, 
                    and Blegen recognized this and let them speak. Blegen enjoys 
                    writing and experimenting with words. In the truest sense 
                    he is a creative writer.
It was appropriate that Theodore Blegen should round out 
                    his career as dean of the graduate school of his own beloved 
                    University of Minnesota. The key to his conception of the 
                    character of this position lies in his definition of scholarship, 
                    on which we are fortunate to have his views, expressed in 
                    the last year of his deanship. In a talk delivered in 1959 
                    and entitled, "Some Thoughts on the Nature and Meaning 
                    of Scholarship," Dean Blegen gave this definition: "Scholarship 
                    means quality and excellence applied to studies, training, 
                    ideas, and problems." He went on to list its characteristics: 
                    curiosity, patience, imagination, endurance, and freedom. 
                    He concluded by pointing out its relevance to individual fulfillment 
                    and to social welfare: "In speaking of scholarship as 
                    a double resource �a resource for us in our individual lives 
                    and for the society of which we are a part � I want to strike 
                    as hard as I can at the idea that scholarship is just an abstraction 
                    or an ivory-tower concept, remote from everyday life. Measurable 
                    excellence in learning is the heart of scholarship, and it 
                    is of vital concern to everybody. From home to business and 
                    profession, from politics and community affairs to church 
                    and schooling, from reading to recreation � everywhere, we 
                    as people and citizens must draw upon knowledge and understanding, 
                    on memory [11] and reasoning � if we are to play our roles 
                    in life well and richly." {8} 
At the conference on immigration history, January 30, 1960. 
                    Dean Blegen responded to tributes with the following valedictory 
                    to his university and in fact to all institutions of higher 
                    education:
"What a fascinating place, adventure, career, and life 
                    is a great university! A university with its range across 
                    a hundred important sciences and arts; its probing researches; 
                    its teaching of youth in the successive waves of generations; 
                    its informed interweaving of past and future; its basic and 
                    applied service to state and country and world; its intoxicating 
                    play of ideas; its controversies and troubles and triumphs; 
                    its comradeship and warmth as a community of scholars!" 
                    {9} 
To these eloquent closing words, it seems appropriate to 
                    add an injunction given him by the famous author of Giants 
                    in the Earth, O. E. Rølvaag: "Only the best is 
                    good enough." This has been Theodore Blegen�s creed.

Background[edit]
Theodore Christian Blegen was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota to Anna Regine (1854-1925) and John H. Blegen (1851-1928), both of whom had emigrated from Lillehammer, Norway. His father was a professor at Augsburg College in Minneapolis and played a central role in the Norwegian Lutheran Church in America. He was the younger brother of noted archaeologist, Carl Blegen.[2]
During World War II, he directed the National Historical Service, preparing materials for the U.S. Army's G.I. Roundtable. Blegen’s undergraduate studies at Augsburg College B.A. (1910) were followed by graduate work at the University of Minnesota M.A. (1915), Ph.D. (1925) that led to a doctorate in history. In 1928, he was a Guggenheim Fellow and studied in Norway. [3]

              Dant, Sara. “Making Wilderness Work: Frank Church and the American Wilderness Movement.” Pacific Historical Review 77, No. 2 (May 2008): 237-272. Argues that Church was not only at the vanguard of the evolving definition of wilderness in America but also established a viable process for designating wilderness areas.

Assesses the introduction of domesticated reindeer to Alaska by the missionary Sheldon Jackson, ostensibly for the benefit of native communities. Explores new ground with a compelling narrative and a keen sense for the complexities of the interaction between Native Alaskans, do-gooding Anglo-Americans, and the shifting economy of the far north.

 Theodore 
            C. Blegen Award

 














  





              Theodore C. Blegen
American historian Theodore 
              C. Blegen was one of the founders of the Forest History Society 
              (FHS). His vision and dedication to FHS never waned from the time 
              of its inception in 1946 until his death in 1969. To honor the significant 
              contributions of Blegen to the Society, FHS established the Theodore 
              C. Blegen Award in 1973. The award recognizes the best scholarship 
              in the fields of forest and conservation history published in a 
              journal not produced by the Forest History Society.



 


Theodore C. Blegen
                (1891-1969)
                Source: FHS Photo Collection












Biographical 
          Sketch
Theodore Blegen was born 
          on 16 July 1891 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. During World War II he directed 
          the National Historical Service, preparing materials for the U.S. Army's 
          G.I. Roundtable. In 1928-29 he was a Guggenheim Fellow and studied in 
          Norway. He served as a professor of history at Hamline University, was 
          superintendent of the Minnesota Historical Society, and was elected 
          president of the Mississippi Valley Historical Association (Organization 
          of American Historians).
Blegen was dean of the University 
          of Minnesota's graduate school when he conceived of a plan for systematically 
          collecting and preserving the sources of forest history in the Lakes 
          States. He began seeking funds to support the project, and industry 
          representatives such as the Weyerhaeuser family of St. Paul, Minnesota, 
          and Tacoma, Washington, heeded the call. The Forest Products History 
          Foundation (Forest History Society) resulted from this initial effort 
          to preserve the history of the American forest products industry.
Blegen was a director or 
          corporate member of the Society from its inception in 1946 until his 
          death. He served two terms as president, was elected a Fellow of the 
          Society in 1963, and for more than twenty years served on the Society's 
          executive committee. Upon hearing of his passing away on 18 July 1969 
          after a long illness, FHS executive director Elwood R. Maunder urged 
          the FHS Board of Directors to establish a memorial endowment fund to 
          carry on Blegen's support for young scholars of American history who 
          research, write, and publish studies relating to forest history. The 
          Society's Theodore C. Blegen Award was 
          thus born.

Background[edit]
Theodore Christian Blegen was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota to Anna Regine (1854-1925) and John H. Blegen (1851-1928), both of whom had emigrated from Lillehammer, Norway. His father was a professor at Augsburg College in Minneapolis and played a central role in the Norwegian Lutheran Church in America. He was the younger brother of noted archaeologist, Carl Blegen.[2]
During World War II, he directed the National Historical Service, preparing materials for the U.S. Army's G.I. Roundtable. Blegen’s undergraduate studies at Augsburg College B.A. (1910) were followed by graduate work at the University of Minnesota M.A. (1915), Ph.D. (1925) that led to a doctorate in history. In 1928, he was a Guggenheim Fellow and studied in Norway. [3]
Career[edit]
Blegen did high-school teaching at Fergus Falls, Minnesota, and at Milwaukee, Wisconsin, then served an apprenticeship at the Minnesota Historical Society in the arts of editing and meticulous research. He succeeded to the position of superintendent of the historical society. Blegen was a professor of history (1920–1927) at Hamline University in St. Paul, after which he moved to the University of Minnesota (1927–1939) where he was later dean of the graduate school (1940–1960).[4]
In 1925, Blegen was appointed the first managing editor of the Norwegian-American Historical Association. He was elected president of the Organization of American Historians in 1943. His career with the Minnesota Historical Society began in 1922. He served on the executive council and was superintendent until 1939. He returned to the Society as a research fellow in 1960 after his retirement from teaching. He was also one of the founders of the Forest History Society. He served two terms as president, was elected a Fellow of the Society in 1963, and for more than twenty years served on the Society's executive committee. The Forest History Society initiated the Theodore C. Blegen Award in 1972.[5][6]
Blegen received recognition in the form of honorary degrees from Hamline University, Carleton College, St. Olaf College, Luther College, and Augustana College. Blegen was made honorary doctor at the University of Oslo, 1938. He was a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters from 1946 and The Royal Norwegian Society from 1954.

Background[edit]
Theodore Christian Blegen was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota to Anna Regine (1854-1925) and John H. Blegen (1851-1928), both of whom had emigrated from Lillehammer, Norway. His father was a professor at Augsburg College in Minneapolis and played a central role in the Norwegian Lutheran Church in America. He was the younger brother of noted archaeologist, Carl Blegen.[2]
During World War II, he directed the National Historical Service, preparing materials for the U.S. Army's G.I. Roundtable. Blegen’s undergraduate studies at Augsburg College B.A. (1910) were followed by graduate work at the University of Minnesota M.A. (1915), Ph.D. (1925) that led to a doctorate in history. In 1928, he was a Guggenheim Fellow and studied in Norway. [3]
Career[edit]
Blegen did high-school teaching at Fergus Falls, Minnesota, and at Milwaukee, Wisconsin, then served an apprenticeship at the Minnesota Historical Society in the arts of editing and meticulous research. He succeeded to the position of superintendent of the historical society. Blegen was a professor of history (1920–1927) at Hamline University in St. Paul, after which he moved to the University of Minnesota (1927–1939) where he was later dean of the graduate school (1940–1960).[4]
In 1925, Blegen was appointed the first managing editor of the Norwegian-American Historical Association. He was elected president of the Organization of American Historians in 1943. His career with the Minnesota Historical Society began in 1922. He served on the executive council and was superintendent until 1939. He returned to the Society as a research fellow in 1960 after his retirement from teaching. He was also one of the founders of the Forest History Society. He served two terms as president, was elected a Fellow of the Society in 1963, and for more than twenty years served on the Society's executive committee. The Forest History Society initiated the Theodore C. Blegen Award in 1972.[5][6]
Blegen received recognition in the form of honorary degrees from Hamline University, Carleton College, St. Olaf College, Luther College, and Augustana College. Blegen was made honorary doctor at the University of Oslo, 1938. He was a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters from 1946 and The Royal Norwegian Society from 1954. In 1950 he was knighted into the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav. Blegen Hall on the University of Minnesota Twin Cities Campus is named after Theodore C. Blegen.The research papers of Dr. Blegen was located in the University Archives, University of Minnesota. The Minnesota Historical Society also has a collection of Theodore C. Blegen papers.[7][8][9]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
