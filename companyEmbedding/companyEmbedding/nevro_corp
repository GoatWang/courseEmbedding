Understanding Chronic Pain and How to Treat It
what is chronic Pain?
Chronic pain is a recurring, debilitating kind of pain that lasts for three months or longer. It affects roughly 1.5 billion people worldwide and is most commonly located in the back. It can also affect the arms, legs, head and other locations.
        
The source of chronic pain is often difficult to determine. It can be associated with an illness, accident, or even injury to nerves, causing false pain signals that feel very real. That’s why it’s so difficult to manage. In some patients, chronic pain also appears without any explanation at all.
        
Chronic pain is different from acute pain, which commonly results from injury or surgery and heals with time.
        




Living With Chronic Pain
The idea of "living with chronic pain" is more of a resignation for most patients. Because the pain is so restrictive to their everyday life, longtime chronic pain patients often find themselves depressed, withdrawn from friends and family, and reliant on others for even the simplest daily activities.
        
Many patients try everything from physical therapy and medications to invasive surgeries, only to have their pain return or even made worse by the side effects of those treatments.
        




treatments of chronic pain
Many patients spend years in painful trial and error with treatments that seek a single way to manage their chronic pain. But chronic pain is unique to each individual. That’s why treatment needs to be tailored to the needs, desires and circumstances of each patient.
        
Initially, physicians may recommend physical therapy and lifestyle modifications; however, for many patients these approaches are not adequate. Corrective surgery, injections, pain pumps, nerve ablation and medications may also be prescribed, although these therapies also have mixed results. 
Another option, spinal cord stimulation (SCS), was first introduced in 1967. It works to relieve pain by delivering mild electrical pulses to the spinal cord to mask the transmission of abnormal pain signals traveling along the spinal cord to the brain. The pulses are delivered by small electrodes placed near the spinal cord that connect to a compact battery-powered generator, which is implanted under the skin.
          
        In clinical trials and in practice, traditional SCS has demonstrated relief for leg pain; however, sustained relief of back pain has been uncommon.
          
        All these traditional norms were upended with the FDA approval of Nevro’s HF10™ therapy. HF10 therapy is the next-generation spinal cord stimulation device. It is just as safe as traditional systems, but also offers long-term relief for both back pain AND leg pain. It also has none of the driving or sleep restrictions typical of traditional SCS.
        




What does the FDA Say About HF10 THERAPY?
In May 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration approved Nevro’s HF10 therapy as a treatment for chronic pain. It is the only SCS system to ever receive a superiority designation from the FDA for both chronic back pain and leg pain.
        
To put this new therapy to the test, Nevro carried out the first-ever randomized, controlled clinical trial to compare the relative effectiveness of HF10 therapy to traditional SCS. The study followed 156 patients using HF10 therapy or traditional SCS for 24 months to measure how many patients responded to treatment and their levels of pain relief.
        
Results from the clinical study showed that nearly twice as many patients achieved dramatic relief from back pain and leg pain with HF10 therapy as with traditional SCS. The study also demonstrated that eight out of ten patients with severe back or leg pain, who used HF10 therapy, experienced significant pain relief.
          
        Finally, the HF10 therapy patients also showed greater improvement in overall function – so these patients can more easily return to the activities they enjoyed before the pain started.

True Innovation Transforms More Lives.













Nevro is a medical device company headquartered in Redwood City, California. We have developed HF10™ therapy, an innovative, evidence-based neuromodulation platform for the treatment of chronic pain.
We started with a simple mission to help more patients suffering from chronic pain. At each stage of development, our research was subject to the highest levels of scientific rigor, resulting in a new therapy that has advanced the state of spinal cord stimulation (SCS).
 We explored beyond traditional SCS frequencies (40–60 Hz) in search of better therapeutic outcomes. Combining high frequency at 10 kHz with a unique waveform and a specific treatment algorithm resulted in HF10 therapy: a paresthesia-free treatment proven to provide more pain relief to more patients in more pain areas.1
The Nevro® Senza® SCS System received CE mark in 2010, TGA approval in 2011, FDA approval in 2015, and is commercially available in Europe, Australia, and the United States.

How to choose this product





An implantable neurostimulator provides neuronal or nerve stimulation through an electrode. It consists of a battery connected to wires leading directly to the area to be stimulated. The unit is put in place surgically.
Applications
Indications for use of these devices include epilepsy, Parkinson's disease and pain.
Technologies
Deep brain stimulators are linked directly to a specific cerebral area via electrodes. They are widely used to treat epilepsy, trembling due to Parkinson' s disease and other motor problems. Those acting on the nerves stimulate or block certain nerve pathways such as the vagus nerve or those transmitting pain signals. Medullary stimulation is used primarily for analgesic purposes.

True Innovation Transforms More Lives.













Nevro is a medical device company headquartered in Redwood City, California. We have developed HF10™ therapy, an innovative, evidence-based neuromodulation platform for the treatment of chronic pain.
We started with a simple mission to help more patients suffering from chronic pain. At each stage of development, our research was subject to the highest levels of scientific rigor, resulting in a new therapy that has advanced the state of spinal cord stimulation (SCS).
 We explored beyond traditional SCS frequencies (40–60 Hz) in search of better therapeutic outcomes. Combining high frequency at 10 kHz with a unique waveform and a specific treatment algorithm resulted in HF10 therapy: a paresthesia-free treatment proven to provide more pain relief to more patients in more pain areas.1
The Nevro® Senza® SCS System received CE mark in 2010, TGA approval in 2011, FDA approval in 2015, and is commercially available in Europe, Australia, and the United States.

Board Whores Edition I
Back pain device maker Nevro jumps after $126M IPO tops targets
Nevro, a startup waiting for approval of a device to treat back pain, had a strong debut on Wall Street Thursday after raising $126 million in an IPO that priced higher than expected.
Shares of the Menlo Park company led by CEO Michael DeMane rose nearly 40 percent on their first day on the NYSE, where they traded with the symbol of NVRO.
That’s a huge raise and risk for a product that’s not yet approved by the FDA. We saw earlier this year Johnson & Johnson’s Mentor abandon Purtox a product they told physicians would be available pending FDA approval since 2009 it never did get approved and they sold it off this year. But we also saw earlier this year that Johnson & Johnson’s Ethicon’s Gynecare  had a company paid physician consultant who also sat in the FDA panel that reviewed Johnson & Johnson Ethicon Gynecare products, oddly  those products have 36,000 cases in state federal court currently (70,000 all device makers).

Nevro Corp. Investors as of 11/6/2014
So maybe Nevro has some inside knowledge the rest of us don’t regarding the approval of their product.  VC’s usually want a quick return on investment so this will be an interesting case study to follow as Nevro’s product approval isn’t expected according to some in the industry until 2016.  Having worked many device startups I’d not recommend working for one that doesn’t have the FDA approval for at least one (if not their main) product.
UPDATED: May 8, 2015   Nevro Receives FDA Approval for Senza® Spinal Cord Stimulation System Delivering HF10™ Therapy PRNews
Nevro Corp. (NYSE: NVRO), a medical device company that is providing innovative evidence-based solutions for the treatment of chronic pain, today announced that it has received approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its Senza spinal cord stimulation (SCS) system. Nevro also announced that it will now be releasing financial results for the first quarter of 2015 before market open on Monday, May 11, 2015. The Company will be hosting a conference call beginning at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss both the FDA approval and first quarter operating results onMonday, May 11, 2015, in place of the conference call previously scheduled in the afternoon of the same day.
The Senza SCS system, which delivers Nevro’s proprietary HF10 therapy, is indicated as an aid in the management of chronic intractable pain of the trunk and/or limbs, including unilateral or bilateral pain associated with failed back surgery syndrome, intractable low back pain and leg pain.
FDA Med Device Approval means the company can legally sell the device
not the same as
CMS Approval Code is what’s necessary for hospitals/doctors to bill for the procedure
A Med Device startup is only successful if providers and facilities can get reimbursed 
Those unfamiliar with the industry the FDA approval means the company is legally able to start selling and promoting the device in the U.S markets; however, that does not mean the startup will immediately start generating revenue. It means that reps can start selling to doctors/hospitals and quickly try and get users as a means to satisfy investors.  Doctors/hospitals however will likely only use a product once they know they’ll be reimbursed for it via CMS code (or Medicare/Medicaid ) which is different than FDA approval; and, what $80 million startup Sonitus founder and CEO Amir Abolfathi arrogantly found out the hard way.
“We were a full-blown commercial company, and at the peak we had 85 employees and a commercial team of 25 people,” he says, with a lingering tone of disbelief. “In our first year of real commercialization we had $4.2 million in revenue and we were on track to do $8 [million] to $10 million this year, but we had to shut the company down.” Sonitus Medical’s founder and CEO, Amir Abolfathi, talked with MD+DI in mid-March describing the turn of events at the company he founded back in 2006 in San Mateo.
“There are really three pillars that I was taught when I started my career, and I thought that if you impact one of these pillars you are going to get rewarded—make the product cheaper, make the product safer, make the product more effective,” says Abolfathi in a phone interview. “We took a prevalent surgical treatment into the office where we reduced the cost by half and we significantly impact patient safety because there was no surgery involved and we made it more effective.”
It’s interesting to note that Sonitus’ VP of Sales and Marketing from 2011 until 2104 was  Patrick (Pat) Fabian who was was recently indicted on 18 counts for federal fraud when he was Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ) Ethicon’s Acclarent’s VP of Sales and Marketing from, startup in 2007 through the JNJ acquisition in 2010 and beyond until 2011.
This is not necessarily an indictment of any wrongdoing though but risky! This is definitely one to watch along with the players as some may seem familiar:

Nevro Corp. Board of Directors as of 11/6/2014
UPDATED: July 1, 2015

Nevro Corp. Board of Directors as of 7/1/2015
Peter T. Bisgaard a Partner at Novo Venture (the company is an investor in Nevro Corp) appears to have been replaced on the Board by Lisa Earnhardt of Intersect ENT.  Except according to PRNewswire 

In connection with Ms. Earnhardt’s appointment, Nathan B. Pliam, MD, PhD, Venture Partner at Bay City Capital, stepped off the Board of Directors at Nevro. “Nick has been an integral part of Nevro since its early days,” said Michael DeMane, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “We are thankful for his contributions as a veteran in the venture space and medical device investment leader.”

A lot of movement on a young Board.  March 2, 2015 Brad H. Vale PhD, DVM of Johnson & Johnson Development Corporation (apparently now Innovation)-Retired Head and took the place of Peter T. Bisgaard a Partner at Novo Venture & Nathan Pliam of Bay City Capital (two investors in the company) stepped off the board less than a year of the company going public.  Some will say that’s normal after the IPO and it can but-but it’s much more interesting who they added and why.

Chart above from:
Startup funding:NEA ExploraMed Acclarent Johnson&
 Johnson/JJDC Ethicon






According to Who Got Funded John Nehra of NEA was also at one point on the Board of Directors of Nevro Corp., Neotract Inc., Moximed Inc. as well as a Director of the Incubator Exploarmed IV LLC and Exploramed Nc6 InC-not to be confused with Exploarmed, Exploramed II or Explormed III the incubator that gave rise to Acclarent, Neotract Inc., and Moximed Inc:

Confused yet? Tough to think that might not be by design, right? Remember the trigger for a case study for The Sociopathic Business Model™  is inconsistent & contradictory language to action and name changes to distance from possible unethical and or illegal activity.
It’s not uncommon to have a VC on the Board of a startup to watch over their investment; but, does it become a conflict of interest when one person is part of all three: the Incubator/the Startups/ and Venture Capital?  It’s been stated on this site before that the startup industry does not feel they are as regulated by the goverment (SEC, CMS, FDA, USDOJ) and are therefore willing to take greater risks at bending the law for personal gain.
We’ve also seen it with large regulated industries such as automotive GM and Toyota specifically that supports the startup industries assertion-it took the feds long enough to catch on in a regulated industry-how long will it take for them to catch on in an under-regulated industry?
GM CEO Mary Barra: 15 Employees Terminated: PR Spin Unspun | KILLING MY CAREER
Those who execute the unethical and illegal plans (employees) devised by executives at a company employing tactics from The Sociopathic Business Model™ are initially accomplices who always end up victims. The problem is that the worker bees (accomplices turned victims) take the fall for fraud while the executives are free to encourage, replicate and reward unethical and illegal behavior.
John Nehra

Nehra is no longer on the Nevro Corp. Board according to their website.
Nehra is back on the Neotract Board according to their website.
Nehra is still on the Moximed Inc. Board according to their website.

UPDATED: Neotract updated their Board of Directors (as of 11/7/2014) William M. (Bill) Facteau is back on with a cut and paste from his Earlense bio and another name that’s familiar is added back to the Board, John Nehra who was previously missing.
Wonder why all the changes in the Board?

RELEASED TODAY November 10, 2014:
Medical device company NeoTract gets a bureaucratic lift
When a device is given a code from CMS as  Neotract has it means they can now bill Medicare & Medicaid and the private insurance companies follow the CMS lead but at higher payment rates.  This is what makes or breaks a startup.  Unlike Nevro who is still awaiting FDA approval (but managed to raise $126 Million IPO), Neotract had FDA approval and now has CMS code approval.
The CMS decision is important for NeoTract, company President and CEODave Amerson said, because roughly seven of every 10 men with BPH are Medicare age. Therefore, he said, the decision allows those men greater access to UroLift. BiotechSF
Phew! Glad they were able to make sure all the “Gods” were back on the Board before the big announcement today.  And from USA Today 6/12/2006 from another William (Bill) Facteau company:

In 2006 he was just good old Bill Facteau and now he’s William M. Facteau. Is this a possible name change to distance from unethical and or illegal activity? 

But in the haste of cut and paste Mr. Facteau’s bio on the Neotract Board,  states redundantly that he’s on the Neotract Board, but so do all the other Board memebers sit on the Neotract Board but it’s missing from their bios on the Neotract Board website. Splitting hairs or splitting shells?

Nevro Corp. Just Tumbled By As Much As 12% -- Here's Why
For a second straight quarter, Nevro's bottom-line results miss by a mile. 











                Sean Williams
            

                (TMFUltraLong)



            
            May 9, 2017 at 3:22PM
            
            





What happened
Shares of Nevro (NYSE:NVRO), a medical device developer and manufacturer with a specific focus on providing relief to chronic-pain sufferers, tumbled as much as 12% on Tuesday following the release of its first-quarter earnings results after the closing bell on Monday. As you can probably surmise, the results didn't pass muster with Wall Street or investors.
So what 
For the quarter, Nevro generated $68.4 million in sales, which was a 64% increase over the prior-year quarter. The vast majority of this growth came domestically, with 80% sales growth in the U.S. and a more modest 30% sales growth in international markets. Growth was due to the ongoing uptake of the Senza Spinal Cord Stimulation system.

In terms of its bottom line, the company wound up reporting a $13.1 million loss from operations, or $0.50 per share, which was significantly wider than the $9 million it lost in the first quarter of 2016. Operating expenses look to be the culprit, with an increase in headcount pushing operating expenses higher by 70% to $59.4 million in the first quarter of 2017.
Comparatively, Wall Street was anticipating $68.7 million in sales, so this was more or less in line with what the company delivered, but a much narrower loss of $0.26 per share. In other words, Nevro missed the bottom line by a mile.
If there is some solace, the company reaffirmed its full-year sales guidance of $310 million to $320 million, which is in line with where Wall Street's consensus currently has the company pegged. The primary worry here is that rising operating expenses may lead to steeper losses than analysts had realized.
As the icing on the cake, investment firm B. Riley cut Nevro's rating to "neutral" from "buy" right around the opening bell this morning.

Now what 
This was actually a pretty decent and expected quarter for a company that's only now beginning to really ramp up sales of its lead pain control device. While the growth rate of its Senza system will slow as we move forward, sales growth is still expected to remain in the double-digits through 2020. That could be alluring for investors seeking growth stocks.
However, the past two earnings reports, which has Nevro has missed on its loss per share estimate by a very wide margin, are also evidence that a growing company can produce wider-than-expected losses as it attempts to build its personnel and marketing staff to make its product great over the long run. These are hiccups that investors deal with from time to time with growth stocks.
Personally, I like the product and the growth behind the product, but I'm leery of Nevro given its rising expenses. Even with recurring profitability expected by 2019, it could be many, many years before Nevro's valuation makes sense on the basis of its forward P/E ratio -- or even its PEG ratio. With that being said, I'd monitor the company's progress from the safety of the sidelines.

About Nevro Corp. (NYSE:NVRO)
Nevro Corp. is a global medical device company. The Company focuses on providing products that improve the quality of life of patients suffering from chronic pain. The Company has developed and commercialized the Senza spinal cord stimulation (SCS) system, an evidence-based neuromodulation platform for the treatment of chronic pain. Its HF10 therapy is designed to deliver neuromodulation solutions for treating chronic pain. HF10 therapy enables patients to achieve sustained pain relief without paresthesia, thus enabling its patients to avoid the uncomfortable shocking or jolting sensations commonly associated with paresthesia. HF10 therapy relies on consistent anatomical lead placement. As of December 31, 2016, it was investigating the use of HF10 therapy to address additional indications, such as chronic upper limb and neck pain, painful neuropathies and non-surgical refractory back pain. The Senza system is approved to create electrical impulses from 2 hertz (Hz) to 10,000 Hz.

What are analysts saying about Nevro Corp. stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Nevro Corp. stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Nevro Corp. is a medical device company. It engages in developing and commercializing a neuromodulation platform for the treatment of chronic pain. The Company provides pain relief to the customers suffering from low back pain and types of chronic pains. Nevro has developed and commercialized the Senza (R) spinal cord stimulation (SCS) system for the treatment of chronic pain. Senza, HF10, Nevro and the Nevro logo are trademarks of the company. Nevro Corp. is headquartered in Menlo Park, California.   " (6/3/2017)
2. Northland Securities analysts commented, "The widely awaited release of Boston Scientific's ACCELERATE Study data on the Q4 call today, was a downer. Strangely enough, the company stated on its call that it "would continue enrolling patients in the trial, expects enrollment to finish by end of FY17, and data release by mid-2018." Suffice it to say, the anti-climax will be perceived as something being off in the ACCELERATE Study, hence being positive for Nevro."The analyst speculated that something is off in the ACCELERATE study, causing a delay in datarelease. Here are some thoughts / questions:Is Boston Sci increasing the sample size in the trial ?Was there a sub-group analysis done and investigators realized that the bellcurve on lead placements was not on T8 - T10 locations, hence pain relief was sub-optimal? Will there now be more anatomical placement on T8 - T10 with its HF arm? In essence, is Boston Sci converging on Nevro's "secret sauce" (2/2/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Nevro Corp. (NYSE:NVRO) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Hold Rating, 8 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.89)Consensus Price Target: $103.89 (18.24% upside)
