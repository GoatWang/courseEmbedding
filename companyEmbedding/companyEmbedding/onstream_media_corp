	Item 1.01         


	Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement










	Item 2.01         


	Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets






	As previously disclosed, on March 27, 2007 we completed the acquisition of the assets, technology and patents pending of privately owned Auction Video, Inc., a Utah corporation, and Auction Video Japan, Inc., a Tokyo-Japan corporation (collectively, Auction Video). Subsequent to this acquisition, we began pursuing the final approval of the patent pending application and in March 2008 retained the law firm of Hunton & Williams to assist in expediting the patent approval process and to help protect rights related to proprietary Onstream technology. In April 2008, we revised the original patent application primarily for the purpose of splitting it into two separate applications (the Original Applications), which, while related, would be evaluated separately by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).


	The patents address live streaming of audio and/or video from multiple devices to a storage location, such as the Internet or cloud, and the ability to access and retrieve the audio and/or video to multiple devices, whereby the content is not stored on the device. In our 10-Q as of June 30, 2016 and for the nine months then ended, filed by us on October 28, 2016, we set forth the status of these patents pending, including related patents that were subsequently issued to us, and we hereby incorporate that information by reference.





	On February 28, 2017, we entered into a Patent Purchase Agreement (the Agreement) with Mr. Eriya Unten, a resident of Japan and an unrelated third-party (the Buyer), for our sale of U.S. Patents (Nos. 9,161,068 and 9,467,728) and related U.S. Patent Applications (Nos. 14/843,457 and 15/255,416), which sale includes our entire right, title and interest in such Patents and the rights, if any, to the related Patent Applications, the causes of action to sue for infringement thereof, and any other legal rights entitled by the original owner of the Patents and Patent Applications under the law. In accordance with the Agreement, the total purchase price is a minimum of $40.0 million and a maximum of $80.0 million, to be paid to the parties as set forth below:





	1)    $1.0 million of the purchase price has been received by us, in the form of a non-refundable deposit. $200,000 of the deposit was received by us on February 1, 2017 and the $800,000 balance was received by us on February 28, 2017. This deposit was received pursuant to a February 2017 letter of intent between us and the Buyer. Although the letter of intent outlined significant aspects of the patent sale, it was contingent, among other things, on the execution of a Revenue Distribution Agreement, which execution was effective on February 24, 2017 and is discussed in further detail below. The letter of intent was replaced by the Agreement.





	2)    An additional $39.0 million payment against the purchase price is due on or before March 31, 2017. In the event this amount is not paid by that date, we have agreed to grant Buyer a 60 day extension but no later than May 31, 2017 to meet the purposes of obtaining and closing bank financing in connection with the transaction and in which case we have agreed with Buyer to modify the payment schedule in an updated Agreement. The Agreement states that the general 30 day cure period provided in the Agreement for all other defaults shall not apply to this extension. Thus, in the event that the Buyer does not make the payment within the extended time period, we will have the right to cancel the Agreement and retain the non-refundable deposit. Once an escrow agreement is finalized between the parties, the documents assigning the Patents and Patent Applications to the Buyer will be placed in escrow and will be transferred from escrow to the Buyer once this $39.0 million is paid into escrow. 50% of this amount, or $19.5 million, will be paid to us from escrow and the other 50% will be paid to the Former Owners. These amounts will be adjusted to allow for reimbursement of any additional patent related expenses to the extent allowed by the Distribution Agreement.


	 




	 


	3)    Additional contingent purchase price is payable, calculated as 25% of any excess of certain defined revenues received by the Buyer and related to the Patents and Patent Applications over $40.0 million, provided such additional purchase price will not exceed $40.0 million. Buyer is obligated to keep accurate records in this regard and we have the right to inspect such records, with the costs of any such inspection, including, but not limited to, any costs incurred for our accountant(s) and/or attorney(s), shall be borne by the Buyer in the event that errors or omissions are found. Also, in such case, adjustments shall not prejudice our rights to seek any appropriate remedies, including any rights to terminate the Agreement.


	 


	All of the costs incurred by us in connection with the Patents and the Patent Applications have been expensed on our books and therefore the carrying value of the Patents and the Patent Applications was zero on our most recently reported balance sheet dated June 30, 2016, as well as of the current date.





	The Agreement grants us a worldwide, irrevocable, fully paid-up, royalty-free, perpetual, non-exclusive past release and future license related to the Patents and Patent Applications.





	As the time of our March 2007 acquisition of Auction Video, we granted certain of the former owners of the assets of Auction Video, Inc. (Former Owners) an interest in proceeds that we might receive under certain circumstances in connection with the acquired patents pending. Effective February 24, 2017 we entered into a Revenue Distribution Agreement (Distribution Agreement) with those Former Owners, which by its terms superseded and replaced that previous interest. As provided by the Distribution Agreement, we paid $408,908 of the $1.0 million non-refundable deposit to the Former Owners, which included $30,000 for the reimbursement of estimated previously incurred patent related expenses. The remaining $591,092, which included the reimbursement of $212,184 of our previously incurred patent related expenses, was retained by us and utilized for working capital. Per the Distribution Agreement, 50% of all future purchase price installments received by us will be payable to the Former Owners, after reimbursement of any additional patent related expenses to the extent allowed by the Distribution Agreement.





	Under the terms of the Distribution Agreement, the Former Owners have agreed that if we find it necessary to agree to modification(s) of the Agreement, we may do so at our sole discretion and judgement. The Former Owners have also agreed that in the instance of a modification to the Agreement, that the schedule of payments outlined above may change and that payments to the Former Owners under the Distribution Agreement are completely subject to receipts from the Agreement, which receipts we do not guarantee will occur and which receipts we are not obligated to pursue.





	The above summary is qualified in its entirety by the contents of the transaction documents, which are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2 to Item 9.01 of this Form 8-K and which are incorporated herein by reference.




	 



	 



	Our receipt of additional purchase price funds beyond the $1.0 million non-refundable deposit already received is subject to risks and uncertainties that include, but are not limited to, Buyers ability to fund its obligation under the Agreement, including but not limited to its ability to obtain any necessary financing, the impact of any applicable U.S., Japanese or other government regulations affecting the Agreement, any changes in the status of the Patents or Patent Applications and/or the impact of any actions resulting from this announcement.


	See Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements below.






	From any future purchase price amounts received by us, and after paying amounts due to the Former Owners under the Distribution Agreement, we are obligated to repay the following notes payable, in the following priority:





	1)    $300,000 (estimate) - Line of Credit Arrangement (over advance portion only) - repayable from funds exceeding the first $1.0 million of purchase price





	2)     $750,000 - Rockridge and Sigma Notes - repayable from funds exceeding the first $2.0 million of purchase price





	3)    $770,000 - Fuse Note, Intella2 Investor Notes, Working Capital Notes, J&C Note and Subordinated Notes - $455,000 repayable from funds exceeding the first $3.0 million of purchase price and $315,000 repayable from funds exceeding the first $5.0 million of purchase price

SWOT Analysis
SWOT, which stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats, is an analytical framework that identifies the internal and external factors that are favorable and unfavorable for a company.

Enhanced SWOT Analysis
Enhanced SWOT is a 3×3 grid that arranges strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats into one scheme:

How to use the strengths to take advantage of the opportunities?
How to use the strengths to reduce likelihood and impact of the threats?
How to overcome the weaknesses that obstruct taking advantage of the opportunities? 
How to overcome the weaknesses that can make the threats a reality?

Upon answering these questions a company can develop a project plan to improve its business performance.

PESTEL Analysis
PESTEL (also termed as PESTLE) is an ideal tool to strategically analyze what influence different outside factors – political, economic, sociocultural, technological, environmental and legal – exert on a business to later chart its long term targets.
Being part of the external analysis when carrying out a strategic assessment or performing a market study, PESTEL gives an overview of diverse macro-environmental factors that any company should thoughtfully consider. By perceiving these outside environments, businesses can maximally benefit from the opportunities while minimizing the threats to the organization.
Key Factors Examined by PESTEL Analysis:

Political – What opportunities and pressures are brought by political bodies and what is the degree of public regulations’ impact on the business?
Economic – What economic policies, trends and structures are expected to affect the organization, what is this influence’s degree?
Sociological – What cultural and societal aspects will work upon the demand for the business’s products and operations?
Technological – What impact do the technological aspects, innovations, incentives and barriers have on the organization?
Environmental – What environmental and ecological facets, both locally and farther afield, are likely to predetermine the business?
Legal – What laws and legislation will exert influence on the style the business is carried out?


IFE, EFE, IE Matrices
The Internal Factor Evaluation matrix (IFE matrix) is a strategic management tool helping audit or evaluate major weaknesses and strengths in a business’s functional areas. In addition, IFE matrix serves as a basis for identifying and assessing relationships amongst those areas. The IFE matrix is utilised in strategy formulation.
The External Factor Evaluation matrix (EFE matrix) is a tool of strategic management that is typically utilised to assess current market conditions. It is an ideal instrument for visualising and prioritising the threats and opportunities a firm is facing.
The essential difference between the above mentioned matrices lies in the type of factors incorporated in the model; whilst the latter is engaged in internal factors, the former deals exceptionally with external factors – those exposed to social, political, economic, legal, etc. external forces. 
Being a continuation of the EFE matrix and IFE matrix models, the Internal External matrix (IE matrix) rests upon an investigation of external and internal business factors integrated into one suggestive model. 

Porter Five Forces Analysis
The Porter’s five forces analysis studies the industry of operation and helps the company find new sources of competitive advantage. The analysis surveys an industry through five major questions:

What composes a threat of substitute products and services?
Is there a threat of new competitors entering the market?
What is the intensity of competitive rivalry?
How big is the bargaining power of buyers?
How significant is the bargaining power of suppliers?


VRIO Analysis
VRIO stands for Value, Rarity, Imitability, Organization. This analysis helps to evaluate all company’s resources and capabilities and bring them together into one aggregate table that includes:

Tangible resources
Financial
Physical
Technological
Organizational

Intangible resources
Human
Innovation and Creativity
Reputation

Organizational capabilities

The result of the analysis gives a clear picture of company’s competitive and economic implications, answering the questions if the resources mentioned above are:

Valuable?
Rare? 
Costly to imitate? 
Organized properly?
