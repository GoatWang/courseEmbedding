590shares532553Adding weight to the argument that the materials space is one of the most interesting aspects of 3D printing, a new company has recently entered the additive manufacturing industry. 
Chromatic 3D Materials LLC of Maple Grove, Minnesota has raised $175,000 of a $200,000 financing goal. Leading the new 3D printing materials company is CEO Cora Leibig.
Biochemicals and Premier League Football
Around this time last year Leibig was employed as Chief Operating Officer at Segetis, a venture capital backed company producing levulinic acid derivatives. The assets of Segetis, including 50 patents, were acquired earlier this year by GF Biochemicals: an Italian company started, in secret, by former Arsenal midfielder Mathieu Flamini.

According to GF Biochemicals’ website levulinic acid is “recognized by the US Department of Energy as one of the top biobased platform chemicals of the future.” The company continue to explain that the material is an “incredibly versatile building block for chemicals and materials derived directly from biomass.”
Leibig’s former company gained prominence in the previous decade and was among the initial wave of enterprises focusing on sustainable sources, or renewable, chemicals.
GF Biochemicals expect the market for levulinic acid to grow from current levels of approximately 10,000 tons per year to 1.5 million tons a year during the next five years.

Emerging from stealth mode
Chromatic 3D Materials are at the pre-revenue stage and have a minimal online presence.
However, with a PhD in Chemical Engineering from the University of California, an MS in Chemical Engineering Practice from MIT plus more than a decade with The Dow Chemical Company, Leibig brings heavyweight chemical knowledge and experience to the young enterprise.
Founded in January this year, Chromatic 3D Materials are focused on “Developing high performance materials for all major 3D printing platforms. These materials will advance 3D printing from prototype to industrial, functional applications.”
Furthermore, Leibig is named as inventor on nearly 60 patents related to material science and chemistry, with this there is an expectation that when Chromatic emerge from stealth mode, it will be with a bang.
For now 3DPI will be watching closely and keep readers informed of any updates.





 
Michael Petch
Michael Petch is the editor-in-chief at 3DPI and the author of several books on 3D printing. He is a regular keynote speaker at technology conferences where he has delivered presentations such as 3D printing with graphene and ceramics and the use of technology to enhance food security. Michael is most interested in the science behind emerging technology and the accompanying economic and social implications.

Instead of being satisfied with a drab washroom, give it new life by adding everything from inexpensive bath mats and towels to an oversize tub or trendy vessel sink. Here's how to make your dreary room sparkle with just a few updated bathroom products. More

Make your bath accessories shine.Because your space always has a few constant fixtures (shower, tub, toilet and sink), the accessories are what make the room truly unique. If you’re a matchy-matchy type, you can get a corresponding tissue box, tray, soap dispenser and trash can, but make sure to include other designs for variation. For a bit of luxury, include a towel warmer, a makeup mirror and even an armchair or stool for lounging. And, of course, bright towels and bath mats, plus a shower curtain, if your shower needs one, are musts.Add some color with unique bath materials.Much like in the kitchen, washroom materials are often neutral colors, so try something new by opting for colorful surfaces. Give your vanity countertop a facelift by going green, blue or yellow, and use a multicolored mosaic tile backsplash to liven up your sink or shower wall. Instead of going with a neutral tile floor, dare to be bold with patterned tile or a textured stone.Go for the bathroom remodel.Sometimes your washroom is beyond repair, and no number of colorful mats or cutesy tissue boxes will do the trick. Instead, think about a major revamp by adding a new shower, tub, sink and vanity. Although individual preferences take precedence, pedestal tubs, double sinks and walk-in showers are always popular options. If you’re looking to go big, many contemporary showers now have multiple showerheads, including a rain showerhead and handheld showerhead, and vessel sinks and makeup vanities are always elegant additions.Or make minor changes to your bath design.If a remodel doesn’t fit into your budget, there are several small things you can do to freshen up your  bathroom. Changing the wall color, towels and shower curtain is an easy way to make a big impact. To make an old washroom feel less retro, you can always switch out old towel racks, cabinet hardware, faucets, lighting, medicine cabinets and mirrors for newer, trendier models. You can even enhance your shower by replacing a dingy old showerhead with a more high-tech version.

However, when you’re choosing a kitchen backsplash or  tile flooring, try not to put aesthetic at the top of your list. It can be tempting to choose  tiles based on style and then look at other characteristics after that; but if the quality isn’t fit for your desired use, chances are they will chip and wear in no time, losing the original aesthetic value.

Is it a high traffic or use area? Is it outdoors? Will it be exposed to moisture on a regular basis? Knowing the location, and the type of wear and tear that product will experience is absolutely vital before making any type of design decision. Some common floor and wall tile materials include: Ceramic: This is a great choice for any area that’s exposed to moisture (bathrooms and kitchens), outside elements (entryways and patios), or a lot of foot traffic. It’s a highly durable material and typically treated with an abrasive to prevent slips, making it well suited to be a floor tile. While ceramic tile is definitely a pricier option, it will wear extremely well, with no fading and high resistance to tread wear. Just make sure there are no flaws in the glaze, and if they are unglazed you’ll need to seal them so they become stain resistant.Porcelain: Porcelain is often chosen as a tile material because like it’s extremely dense, very hard and resistant to wear and moisture (even more so than ceramic). Porcelain tiles make excellent flooring, and can be designed to imitate other natural materials to allow for all sorts of non-traditional designs in bathroom and kitchens. (For example, putting hardwood in a bathroom is not recommended, but using tile that looks like wood can help you achieve the same look with little to no maintenance). Make sure that porcelain tiles are rated by the Porcelain Enamel Institute. Rating range from one to five, with one and two being strictly for walls and countertops, and three to five for floors.Glass: The smooth, glossy finish of glass tile makes it ideal to accent any space. It’s extremely watertight, so water or moisture permeating the surface is not an issue. It also doesn’t stain, fade or scratch easily, so it works well as kitchen backsplash tile or shower tile. Glass is also weatherproof, making it the perfect pool tile. Glass is often a recycled or reclaimed material, so if you’re environmentally conscious this may be the way to go.Granite, Marble, Slate and Other Natural Stone: These tiles are extremely durable and hard. They are more on the expensive side, and often require some type of treatment to seal and/or maintain them, so be aware of what’s involved before purchasing them. What’s the best shape and size for tile backsplash or flooring?The size and shape of your tile partly depends on the look you’re going for. You can achieve a very different ambiance by using small or large tiles, or by combining both. For a cleaner, more modern look, stick to mid- to large-sized tiles in traditional shapes, such as rectangular subway tile. For something more interesting, you can use smaller sizes and geometric shapes, like hexagonal or circular penny tile. Don’t be afraid to mix shapes and sizes in the same color for a visually layered look. Be sure to consider the shape and of the surface you’ll be laying the tile on. Is it a flat, rectangular space or an angular/curved space? Smaller designs will be easier to cut and fit to odd shaped spots, as they tend to be more forgiving. Larger slabs can be quicker to lay and can require less grout and maintenance, but can look odd if they require trimming or aren’t laid out properly.United StatesUnited StatesUnited KingdomAustraliaDeutschlandFranceРоссия日本ItaliaEspañaDanmarkSverigeIrelandSingaporeNew ZealandIndiaCOMPANYAbout HouzzIn the NewsPress InfoCareersContact UsTerms & PrivacyCopyright & TrademarkEXPLORE HOUZZButtons & BadgesMobile AppsAdvertiseFor ProfessionalsSell on HouzzWrite a ReviewFAQsCONNECT WITH USHouzz BlogTwitterFacebookGoogle+YouTubeRSSUnited KingdomAustraliaDeutschlandFranceРоссия日本ItaliaEspañaDanmarkSverigeIrelandSingaporeNew ZealandIndia© 2017 Houzz Inc.
