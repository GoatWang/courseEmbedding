Flagship Ventures Closes $537 million for its Fifth Fund

		  Up-sized Fund for Cambridge Venture Firm Focused on Healthcare and Sustainability

						 from   Flagship Ventures 











 
















































 

 




















 


CAMBRIDGE, Mass., March 26, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Flagship Ventures, a leading venture capital and venture creation firm focused on innovations in healthcare and sustainability, announced it has raised $537 million for Flagship Ventures Fund V, its largest fund since its founding in 2000. The new investment brings Flagship's aggregate funds under management to $1.4 billion.
Fund V will continue Flagship's strategy of venture creation through VentureLabs™, Flagship's innovation foundry, and early-stage venture investing in therapeutics, health technologies and sustainability - specifically in the energy, water, and agriculture/nutrition sectors. 
"We closed this fund with nearly twice the amount of capital we had initially sought, and in record time," said Dr. Noubar Afeyan, senior managing partner and chief executive officer of Flagship Ventures. "The strong interest from new and existing Limited Partners is a meaningful endorsement of our unique approach."
Flagship is unique in originating and launching its own startups through VentureLabs, where it discovers and develops disruptive ideas as a foundation for first-in-class companies. Flagship Ventures also funds companies based on breakthrough science and technology originating outside the firm. Flagship's goal is to realize returns from entrepreneurial innovation by building companies based on cutting-edge technology with the potential to solve significant global problems.
Dr. Afeyan added, "With this fund, we will accelerate our process of creating companies through VentureLabs, and we anticipate expanding our team and launching as many as five new companies a year going forward."
Flagship's previous fund, Fund IV, totaled $269 million and was raised in 2010. In the past 24 months, Flagship has had eight successful initial public offerings, including Receptos (RCPT), Agios Pharmaceuticals (AGIO), Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals (TTPH) and Acceleron Pharma (XLRN). In addition, a number of game-changing companies have emerged from VentureLabs such as Moderna Therapeutics, which is pioneering messenger RNA Therapeutics™, and Seres Health, which is developing microbiome therapeutics. 
"Our strong track record of recent exits underscores our approach to identifying and growing companies that have the ability to bring innovative therapeutics and technologies to market," said Dr. Afeyan. "Our business model has proven resilient to changing market conditions and continues to deliver superior returns to our Limited Partners."
As part of launching the new fund, Flagship announced that Douglas Cole, M.D., has been promoted to managing partner and David Berry, M.D. Ph.D., has been promoted to general partner. Dr. Cole has led investments in Agios Pharmaceuticals, CombinatoRx (ZLCS), Concert Pharmaceuticals (CNCE), Editas Medicine, Receptos, Quanterix, Syros Pharmaceuticals and Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals. Dr. Berry has led several investments and is a co-founder of portfolio companies Joule Unlimited, Eleven Biotherapeutics (EBIO), Seres Health, and Pronutria Biosciences.
"Doug and David have made significant contributions to Flagship and we are pleased to promote them within our organization," said Dr. Afeyan. "Their technical, organizational and business insights have created substantial value for our investors."
About Flagship Ventures

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60) 

DAYS





      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):
Starting Quarter

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
