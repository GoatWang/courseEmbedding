                    This is a quiet community located north of Tampa, but has easy access to all the big city has to offer, now that the new Suncoast parkway (toll road) is completed. This town provides affordable housing , good schools and city services, easy access  to beaches, great dining and entertainment venues. Located approximately 25 miles north of downtown Tampa, many who work in the city commute daily with no problem, but find Springhill to offer some relief from the hustle and bustle of the big city.

Money Magazine recently said it best, "One thing to remember about Rochester is that it has the sophistication of a larger metro area, but not the congestion or the complications." Named "Best Small City" in America by the nationally recognized magazine, Rochester merges a cosmopolitan atmosphere with Midwestern hospitality giving convention attendees a most memorable experience. Selling a home does not have to be an emotionally charged event for you and your family. People should remember that they are selling a home and not selling the memories. I feel privileged to help friends and families with the real estate process. After all, the home represents one of your largest assets. I work hard to make sure that my marketing is well executed, and that my sellers are well informed of the status of their listing in the marketing process, as well as the current market conditions.
