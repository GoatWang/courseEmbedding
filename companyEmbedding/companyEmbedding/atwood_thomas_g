Thomas G. Atwood Jr.













                    
                    Thomas Atwood Jr was born in Colorado Springs, Colorado.  His love of writing was kindled early when his father gave him a copy of The Legends of King Arthur as an Easter present.  These presents continued every year and he would devour them all.  Soon he was developing further adventures for the characters to go on.  When his high school teachers encouraged him to pursue writing, he embarked on a journey that would result in Dauntless, his debut novel.
