Wouldn't bring my dog to this guy!!!Was this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted June 5, 2016 1Staff 1Punctuality 1Helpfulness 1KnowledgeI've had appointments with him but have not met him!! As he over books and u spend hours waiting and finally walk out!! It's terrible!!!Was this rating useful? 2 flag | Submitted November 6, 2014 5Staff 3Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeDr. Chiang is well known outside of Matheson by his colleagues. How many Drs do you know who can get his patients into a specialist within a 24 hour span. The 2 negative comments I saw on this site are hard to beleive. One person's comments are completely incorrect and unfounded. The other sounds like an extreme exageration - swelling the size of a basketball? Why would people try to upset a respected Doctor's reputation without cause or reason. Shame on you.Was this rating useful? 1 flag | Submitted August 29, 2011 5Staff 5Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeDr. Chiang has been a God Send to the people of Northern Ontario. His concern is directed to the needs and care of his patients. Dr. Chiang investigates the cause of his patien's problems rather than just prescribe drugs to solve the problem. Dr. Chiang is held in the highest regards by all his patients and deserves only the highest rating possible.Was this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted August 3, 2011 3Staff 1Punctuality 1Helpfulness 1KnowledgeDoctor" Chiang is my worst nightmare.A while ago I was the victim of a horrific chainsaw accident which nearly severed my leg altogether.I was rushed to the nearest E.R. in Matheson (around 1:30 p.m.)Miraculously "doctor" Chiang took a look at my leg and sent me home without treatment !!!!He asked me to come back at 7:00 p.m. No X ray,not even a pain killer. When I was brought back,he didn't request Xrays or other tests and proceeded to suture my wound.As this injury was obviously beyond his competence he should have sent me immediately to another hospital,My leg got swollen like a basket-ball and he admitted me to hospital without further tests etc..Thank God a replacement doctor sounded the alarm, immediately X rayed my leg and shipped me to Timmins where I underwent emergency surgery.They saved my leg but I am in pain and lack mobility.Dr.Chiang is totally incompetent and extremely arogant.He shouldn't hold a medical licence for he is a danger for the public.I would rate him -1Was this rating useful? 2 flag | Submitted July 26, 2011 4Staff 1Punctuality 4Helpfulness 4KnowledgeHe's a good doc,he just took on way too many patients...I feel rushed when I go there...Was this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted May 18, 2011 5Staff 5Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeAmazing, excellent doctor! If anyone has negative words towards this doctor they should remove there comment from this site. He deserves nothing but good things said. He is the absolute best! I had him as a doctor for over 10 years, and have moved South. Miss you Dr. Chiang, no doctor can take your place!Was this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted February 28, 2011 5Staff 4Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeDr.Chiang is a very caring doctor with always a smile on his face.No small problem is ever too much problem for him to be attentive to and cares about you as an individual.He will see you no matter what.You may have to wait but that is nothing if you are concerned about your problem.He works endless hours but I have never heard a word about it.We hope he will always stay in our community as long as we need him in our life time .We realize he needs a break every so often so don't begrudge him a wknd off.His staff is excellent too and cares about everyone.Thanks,Dr. Chiang for your excellent care and concern for all of us.Was this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted February 15, 2011 5Staff 4Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeDr. Chiang is an efficient doctor who cares for his patients.

For example, a doctor may improperly diagnose, treat or medicate outside the standard of medical care. The three types of malpractice are: a settlement, an arbitration award, or a judgment.If my doctor has malpractice history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact the quality of care you receive. Claim settlements and arbitration awards may occur for a variety of reasons, which should not necessarily reflect negatively on the doctor's professional competence or conduct.You may want to use this information to start a discussion with the doctor about his or her history and specific ability to provide healthcare for you.How far back does Healthgrades malpractice history go?Healthgrades reports details of a doctor’s malpractice history when the doctor has at least one closed medical malpractice claim within the last five years, even if he or she no longer practices in that state.For which states does Healthgrades collect malpractice history?Healthgrades collects malpractice information from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia. If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact your quality of care. Sometimes multiple states report the same claim. If a provider practices in a state where data is unavailable, please reach out to your local state legislature to help make this data publicly available.0SanctionsNo sanctions history found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What is a sanction or disciplinary actionWhat is a sanction or disciplinary action?A sanction, also known as a disciplinary action, is an action taken to punish or restrict a doctor who has demonstrated professional misconduct. Sanctions may be imposed by a state medical board, professional medical licensing organization, or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.If my doctor has sanction history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a sanction, it does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor-quality doctor. Some sanctions are not related to medical care, and involve a doctor’s finances or administrative activities. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, we recommend that you evaluate the doctor’s sanction information and determine how severe or relevant you think the sanction cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades sanction history go?Healthgrades reports state and federal sanctions from the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect sanction history?Healthgrades collects sanction history from all 50 U.S. states. Physicians with a disciplinary action in one state may move to another state where they have a clean record. Since Healthgrades painstakingly compiles disciplinary action information from all 50 states, Healthgrades website will show if a physician has a disciplinary action in more than one state.0Board ActionsNo board actions found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What are board actionsWhat are board actions?Board actions are non-disciplinary actions imposed upon a doctor based on a complaint investigation. A patient or medical colleague may file a complaint with that state medical board or professional licensing organization, which then investigates the complaint. Board actions are intended to ensure that a doctor is able to perform safe medical and health care tasks.Types of non-disciplinary actions include an advisory letter, a corrective action agreement, a limitation or restriction on the medical or healthcare tasks a doctor can perform, or a voluntary agreement by the doctor not to practice. A board action can also include a termination of a corrective action agreement or voluntary agreement, which allows the doctor to return to full practice.If my doctor has a board action, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a board action, it means he or she has had a non-disciplinary action imposed upon him or her. It does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor quality doctor. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, evaluate the doctor's board action information and determine how severe or relevant you think the cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades non-disciplinary board action history go?Healthgrades reports non-disciplinary board action history from for the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect non-disciplinary board actions?Healthgrades collects non-disciplinary board actions from all 50 U.S. states.Conditions TreatedDr. Chiang does not have any conditions listed.
