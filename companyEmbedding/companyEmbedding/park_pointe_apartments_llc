He turned that passion for student success into the company he runs today. It’s a passion we all share. In fact, most of the management team first joined the company as students working at ACC communities.

Apartments for rent in California
One of the largest and most populous states in the country, California is full of notable cities, popular attractions, natural beauty and so much more. For those searching for California apartments for rent, you have hundreds of options to choose from.

Find a California apartment for rent in Sacramento, the Capital, or rent an apartment near the beautiful Pacific Ocean beaches in San Diego. Explore the vineyards of northern California, get caught up in the excitement of Disney Land, or experience the glitz of Hollywood. From the north to the south, you can find an apartment near great attractions, restaurants, shops and natural features in the state of California. 

Education is also a major attraction for California apartment residents. The University of California offers several campuses in San Diego, Berkeley, San Francisco, Los Angeles and more. University of Southern California, California State University and many other institutions provide excellent opportunities for higher education as well. 

California is a large state and covers a wide range of natural features including mountains, beaches, lakes, forests, state parks and rivers. These natural sites allow residents to experience a variety of outdoor activities including skiing, surfing, hiking, biking, fishing, swimming and more. And, known for its mild climate and beautiful seasons, California offers its apartment dwellers the opportunity to enjoy the outdoors all year long. Several popular parks and forests are spread across the state including the Mojave National Preserve, Death Valley National Park, Yosemite National Park and Lassen National Forest.

If you like sports and the outdoors, California won't disappoint. Whether you make it out to a game or watch it on TV in the comfort of your California apartment, you'll have a team to watch every season. The Angels, Dodgers and the A's provide MLB action in the spring and summer, and the Lakers offer basketball fans a team to cheer on. Hockey is also on hand with the Anaheim Ducks, and the Oakland Raiders offer entertainment on Sundays and Mondays. And with collegiate sports in addition to the professional teams, you'll be hard pressed to find time to keep up with all of California's sports.

If you find yourself California dreaming, start your apartment search on ApartmentGuide.com. Find detailed listings of California apartments for rent, explore neighborhoods and learn more about moving to your new apartment in the Moving Center on

Eaves by Avalon



                                I lived here for 3 years and enjoy every moment! At 11pm the pipes from upstairs leaked into my apartment so bad that my hallway rug  was soaked. We put out an emergency request and maintenence came within 20 minutes. They completed the work in 10 min. 

I also had issues with outside maintenence vehicles parked in my neighbors and my parking spots while we are out to work. The front office handled it in a very professional manner where we come home early at times and i can park in my assigned stall.

Neighborhood - Rancho San Diego








Rancho San Diego






Residents of Rancho San Diego, California, enjoy a warm Mediterranean climate with mild winters. The neighborhood is one of the easternmost suburbs of San Diego - located 19 miles east of downtown and bordered by the Cuyamaca Mountains on the eastern margin. Close proximity to this mountain range provides residents with unfettered access to the California wilderness, which offers an abundance of recreational opportunities. Cuyamaca College sits in the middle of the neighborhood and has given rise to many restaurants and shopping opportunities.
