Four Oaks Bank names new CEO

Ayden R. Lee Jr., who has been at the helm of Four Oaks Bank for more than three decades, is stepping down as CEO of the Johnston County financial institution at the end of this month.
Lee, who will remain as executive chairman of the bank, will be succeeded as CEO by David H. Rupp, currently president and chief operating officer. It will be the third promotion for Rupp since he joined the bank 12 months ago. He previously was retail banking and mortgage vice president at VantageSouth Bank from 2012 to 2014 and was CEO of Greystone Bank from 2009 to 2011.
Four Oaks, which has 13 branches, announced the “management transition plan” aproved by its board of directors on Monday.
Lee, 66, said in a phone interview that Rupp was viewed as a potential CEO from the day he joined the bank.
“He’s done a great job in the various roles here,” Lee said. “Each one of them, he was very successful, very effective.”




To be CEO, “you have to have the right analytical tools and good communication skills,” t Lee said. “He has all of those.”
Lee has been CEO since he joined the bank in 1980. He took on the role of chairman in 2006; he also was president until April, when Rupp was promoted to that role.
“I have enjoyed the almost 35 years,” Lee said. “It has gone by quickly. I have been surrounded by good people on the board, good staff members.”
Lee said he anticipates working fewer hours in his new role but will remain engaged with the bank. The bank’s announcement said he “will provide, among other things, strategic, governance, shareholder relations and risk management support and oversight” to the bank.
Founded in 1912, last year Four Oaks raised $24 million from investors to shore up its finances, something it had been trying to do for several years in the wake of the recession.



In the first quarter Four Oaks reported net income of $978,000, down from $1.4 million a year ago.
Shares of the bank’s corporate parent, Four Oaks Fincorp, were trading at $1.48, up 2 cents, Tuesday morning. Shares are down 3 percent this year but are well above their 52-week low of $1.11.

Robert (Bob) Brown Lee, Jr, 59 of Ayden, NC, left his temporary home on Thursday, January 22 and is now in his eternal home where he was ready to meet Jesus face to face. He was born on July 4th, 1955. Bob was raised in Robersonville, NC and graduated from Robersonville High School in 1973. He attended Pitt Community College and received an Associates Degree in Electronics. His goal was to receive his BS degree from East Carolina University in Industrial Technology and was just a few hours short of obtaining it when he was stricken with cancer in 2011. Bob worked at Buehler Motor in Kinston from 1976 until it closed and then continued his career at Bosch Siemens, INC (BSH) in New Bern, NC until April 2014. Bob loved life and being outdoors. He was a dedicated Pirate fan in all sports but especially loved ECU football. He loved being on or near the water, the mountains in the Fall and snow skiing in the winter. Bob was known to be able to accomplish anything he wanted to do. If it could be fixed or done, Bob could do it! His family was his number one love. He always put them and others before himself. He was preceded in death by his parents, R.B.Lee & Louise Pittman Lee of Robersonville, NC. He is survived by his wife of 35 years, Nancy Barfield Lee of the home. Daughters, Amy Layden Lyerly & husband Dwayne Lyerly of Holly Springs, NC. Paige Lee MacGovern & husband Michael (Mac) MacGovern of Willow Spring, NC. Grandchildren, Ava Claire Lyerly, Asher Hayes Lyerly and Quinn Marie MacGovern. He was their "Bob Bob", and he loved each one of them dearly. He is also survived by his sister, Brooks Buck & husband Coy of Winterville, NC and brother, Street Lee & wife Sherri of Largo, Florida. Also, surviving are many nieces and nephews, aunts & uncles, cousins, extended family and friends that have all been what he called his "angels" during his fight with cancer. Up until his last breath, he was always saying, "thank you." Bob was so appreciative of everything that was done for him. We will forever be grateful for The Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center at Duke and staff for their dedication and care for Bob, Nancy and their girls. The family requests their privacy at the home during this time and will be available at the home of Chris & Vickie Singleton (Nancys sister) 1667 Dunn Family Road, Kinston, NC. There will be a celebration of Bobs life for family and friends Saturday, January 24 at 6:30 at the Ayden Christian Church Family Life Center, 462 2nd Street Ayden, NC. Bobs brain will be donated to The Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center at Duke for further research on his type of tumor, Glioblastoma Multiforme. In lieu of flowers, memorials can be made in his memory to one of his favorite charities, Stop Hunger Now, to provide funding for a meal packaging event held in his honor. Stop Hunger Now, 615 Hillsboro Street, Raleigh, NC 27603.

History
The Bank of Four Oaks was chartered in June of 1912, in Four  Oaks, North Carolina, where the Bank’s headquarters remain today.  With a capital investment of $10,000, B. B.  Adams was elected the bank’s first President, followed by J. W. Sanders in 1927  and W. J. Lewis in 1928.  Mr. Lewis  helped guide the Bank through the Great Depression of the early 1930’s.  The Bank of Four Oaks was the 134th  bank allowed to reopen after the “Banking Holiday” declared by President  Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933.   In 1937,  R. C. Canaday became President.  He was  followed by M. S. “Bill” Canaday in 1970.   In 1980, Ayden R. Lee, Jr. was hired as the Bank’s Casher and Chief  Executive Officer and in 1989 Mr. Lee was named President of the Bank.  As the Bank began to open offices outside of  Four Oaks, and with further plans for expansion, it was also in 1989 that The  Bank of Four Oaks became Four Oaks Bank.
In March of 2015, David H. Rupp was appointed President of  Four Oaks Bank and in July of 2015, Mr. Rupp was also named Chief Executive  Office and continues to serve in both capacities.
Four  Oaks Bank currently operates twelve full-service offices located in Benson,  Clayton, Dunn, Four Oaks, Fuquay-Varina, Garner, Holly Springs,  Raleigh, Smithfield, Wallace and Zebulon.   The Bank also operates Loan Production Offices in Apex and Raleigh.

Timeless Lee Jeans for Women
Take part in a legend with our diverse selection of Lee Jeans for women—they’ve been making fine denim for over a hundred years, so they know exactly what they’re doing. From the fabric to the construction, Lee jeans are made with longevity and style in mind. Do yourself a favor and check out the results of this hard-earned heritage, including pants, shorts, and all types of denim that come in every style and wash under the sun!

Grab a pair of classic-fit jeans that both flatter your figure while keeping you comfy all day long. If you’re wanting to give those new boots a whirl around town, be sure to pick up a pair of dark indigo bootcut jeans to complement them. For looking hip and edgy, there’s nothing quite like a pair of skinny cut jeans with just the right amount of distressing for that lived-in look—then wear them with one of your sweet new infinity scarves and a pair of aviator sunglasses to complete your outfit!

Lee collection doesn’t stop a jeans. They have an exciting selection of cargo pants, trousers, and chinos. Their trousers and essential chinos are flattering cuts that will look great on any shape. They are the both work well for numerous occasions. The chinos in particular are excellent for casual events too!

Lee has over 100 years of stylish excellence under their belt. You won’t regret getting yourself a pair of Lee pants for women!

A must for every man’s arsenal: a few reliable pairs of jeans that have a classic look with a modern flair and a great fit. Lee jeans for men provide high-quality pants for anyone looking to add denim durability and unbeatable style to their everyday look. Keep loose and stay comfortable with the freeing forms of relaxed or bootcut jeans. More of a traditionalist? Stick with what you know and look great in a pair of straight or slim fit pants. Take advantage of extra pocket space with a trusty set of carpenter jeans. Too hot for long pants? Get the same quality you’re used to with a bit less length. From cargo shorts to flat-front shorts—and denim to khaki, Lee shorts give you an attractive summer style and a great way to stay cool. Whether you’re shopping for weekday work attire or weekend casual, our Lee jeans and pants will give you a classic look for a lot less.
