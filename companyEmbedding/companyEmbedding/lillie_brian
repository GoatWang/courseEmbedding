Brian Lillie Path From CIO To Chief Customer Officer At Equinix.
Peter High: Brian, you are the Chief Customer Officer and Executive Vice President of Technology Services at Equinix.
credit: Equinix Equinix Chief Customer Officer Brian Lillie Brian Lillie: I started my career in the Air Force.
For instance, it was the combination of talking to customers on the IT side, through the Equinix-on-Equinix program, and then talking to them on the Engineering side and exploring product enhancements and new products, that led to cloud exchange with companies like, Amazon, Microsoft, and others.
High: The chief customer role is probably unfamiliar to a lot of people.
That is the vision of the chief customer officer, to create a reliable customer experience.
I did an interview a few years back where I said that everyone who works for me will become a CIO.
I am proud of Milind and the other CIOs in Silicon Valley that used to work for me; that number is going to grow in the near future.
Lillie: There are, what I call, “The Four Pillars of Excellence.” They are the four cornerstones for building a career and a company: operational, transformational, innovational, and organizational.
Innovating on a business need makes a difference, and the business will appreciate it.

 Author: Peter High / Source: Forbes 
Brian Lillie set his sights on the becoming a chief information officer early in his career, and he carefully planned the moves necessary to get there. He determined he would lead each of the functions that make up a traditional IT department. Through his beginnings in technology at the Air Force, to time spent at Silicon Graphics, and then at Verisign, he gathered the necessary experiences. Then he took a left turn and spent a year getting a master’s degree in Management from Stanford Graduate School of Business. When he came back to Verisign, it was as Vice President of Global Sales Operations. Through this experience, he gained invaluable customer-centric experience and insights.
When Lillie joined Equinix in 2008, he finally realized his dream, becoming CIO, but he made this role a much more customer-centric one than is typical. As a $3.6 billion leader in the global colocation datacenter space, the company’s customers are often CIOs and their IT teams. As such, he was able to serve as a empathetic peer to his company’s customers, while also making the case for the use of Equinix’s offering. He also established an Equinix-on-Equinix program, ensuring that his team was the first and best customer of the company, making his team’s insights sharper when working with customers.
In September 2016, Lillie was promoted to chief customer officer and executive vice president of Technology Services. In that role, he leads the Global Customer Success Organization, which includes Global Customer Care, Global Customer Experience, Global Customer Process, and Global Technology Services, including IT and Interconnection Product Engineering. In many ways, this role was simply a continuation of what he had already been doing.
Now he has a CIO reporting to him, and as such he has had a chance to reflect further on the nature of the role and what separates those who succeed in it versus those who do not. He has defined “Four Pillars of Excellence,” which he believes to be the four cornerstones for building a career as a CIO. He believes CIOs must be operational, transformational, innovational, and organizational. He covers all of the above and more in depth in this interview, and more.

To read through past interview with executives from companies like Waste Management, Biogen, Allstate, Aetna, Marsh & McLennan, and BMO Financial Group, please visit this link.

Peter High: Brian, you are the Chief Customer Officer and Executive Vice President of Technology Services at Equinix. Your current role is interesting, as is the path that led you to it. Can you share a few highlights from the journey you took, how you managed your career, and the goals that led you to where you are today?

Equinix Chief Customer Officer Brian Lillie

Equinix Chief Customer Officer Brian Lillie
Brian Lillie: I started my career in the Air Force. I was an officer for almost a decade. My last two jobs in the Air Force, as a commander of a communications squadron and as a captain in a mission control center operating satellites, prepared me well for IT. My first civilian job was as the network manager at Silicon Graphics (SGI). In this position, I gained both communications infrastructure and international experience because after a while with the company I moved to Switzerland and ran IT infrastructure for Europe for two years. At this point in my career, a mentor told me that a strong CIO should have experience in every box on the org chart. I have used this advice to guide my career.
When I came back to the U.S. with SGI, I transitioned into apps. When I joined Verisign as VP of IT, I picked up apps and infrastructure, and worked on integrating acquisitions. During this time, I thought I wanted to become a CEO, so I took a year off and attended the Stanford Graduate School of Business where I earned a master’s degree in management. After I earned my degree and came back to Verisign, I knew that I wanted to get in on the business side. The CEO was reorganizing the company and asked me to organize the sales force, along with a colleague. Ultimately, this led to me running Global Sales Operations.
When I knew it was time for a change, I took six months off, drove around the country with my family, and ultimately landed at Equinix as CIO. They were rapidly growing and needed a CIO to scale the company’s systems with the business. Equinix is a phenomenally good place to work.I want it to be my last place. Once I got the CIO role under control and had a solid team, I started adding to my remit. I picked up product engineering, that is the technology part of my job. Last fall, I took on the chief customer role to get in front of and roll up our new Global Customer Organization.
High: You started on a standard CIO path, which is to say you sat in all the different chairs in IT, presumably on the past to becoming a CIO. Instead, you rounded out your experience in a way that few CIOs have by pursuing a graduate degree to increase your business acumen, as well as by spending a period in Sales, which gave you deeper customer-centric experience. How did those experiences color your thinking about what could be achieved in the role of CIO?
Lillie: The previous experiences helped me because it is not enough, to just be good enough. IT 101 is making sure stuff is running and backed up, but that is not good enough for a CIO, that is the chief technology mechanic role. You can choose to be a chief technology mechanic or a back office CIO, or you can choose to be a front office CIO and make a difference for your employees and customers.
In a tech company like Equinix, demonstrating that you are the best user of your own technology is one of the surest ways to become a front office CIO. In part, I do this by using a great program that I wish I had invented. Mark Sunday, when he was the CIO of Siebel, developed a program he called Siebel-on-Siebel. When I got this job, I adapted the program and created Equinix-on-Equinix. We use it to implement systems for the organization, both for on-premise and cloud systems. The program allows us to show how we do what we do, how we save money, how we grow the company, and how we scale. Equinix, is a midcap company, so are a lot of companies we sell to, this makes Equinix on Equinix particularly useful for us. Some of our best products have come from Equinix-on-Equinix. Performance Hub is a great example. We implemented network hubs inside Equinix for Equinix long before they were productized as a structured architecture and became a partner-supported model.

As a CIO, my goals are to enable employees and our customers via technology, and to help the organization sell and market those capabilities. The Equinix-on-Equinix program is a tool we use to support and empathize with CIOs we work with. I can say to them, “Look I have been there too. I get it. Here is what we did.” We are humble about it, too. We share not only our successes, but also our failures. I will say, “Hey, try not to do this or that. We did it, and man it hurts.”
High: Related to that, in your organization, IT is everywhere. Is it fair to say that one of the ways you add value is by connecting with your ultimate…

Brian R Lillie's Experience
Title: 
               Company: Hostetter Supply Co Inc
Job Details
               Hostetter Supply Co., Inc. was founded in 1928 by Paul R. Hostetter to service general contractors in South Central Pennsylvania, selling masonry supplies, tools, lawn and garden, and paints and stains. The company added several lines including redwood furniture, fireplace equipment, refractory material, toilet partitions and accessories. The company began a change of direction in the 1980's, deleting most of the old product lines and concentrating on Division 10 Specialties. New product lines introduced to our mix included metal and plastic lockers, plastic toilet partitions, fire extinguishers and cabinets, cubicle track, entrance mats, plus corner guards and handrail. Hostetter Supply is now recognized as a leader in South Central PA for Division 10 Specialties, taking pride to provide competitive prices and second to none customer service. The company is currently under the leadership of Michael and David Hostetter, grandsons of the founder.

Lillie's Q


        Lillie’s Q was recognized by Food & Wine Magazine as “The Best New BBQ Restaurant in the Country”.
Each sauce was created by Lillie’s Q founder/chef Charlie McKenna, who has won numerous awards on the competition barbeque circuit, including the top prize at Memphis In May - which is widely regarded as the world championship of BBQ.

Each of Lillies' all natural sauces and rubs pay homage to the deep-rooted barbeque traditions of specific Southern regions and is the culmination of three generations of Southern style barbeque mastery.

Take Your Team To The Next Level!—Effective Motorsports Marketing, Part 1Specialized motorsports marketing agencies and logistics services have helped elevate racing to one of the most sought-after sports venues for corporate advertising dollars. Here’s the first part of a two-part series describing how they can help you enhance your image and secure sponsorship opportunities.By Virginia DeMossRacing is far from a passive sport, yet that’s the way many teams continue to present themselves to potential sponsors, according to the experts who spend their working lives in the heady, high-powered world of motorsports marketing, bringing companies with cash and products to sell together with race teams, tracks, and series.“A lot of drivers think a sponsorship is putting a logo on your car, and it’s far more than that,” said George Elliott of Elliott Marketing Group, Matthews, North Carolina, which handles racing programs and promotions for large companies like Nestle. “The biggest problem I have when I work with a new driver is that they don’t have an understanding of their role in helping a sponsor. If he is spending, say, a million dollars, what is he going to get for that million dollars? He doesn’t need a car going around in circles.”The key to successful sponsorships, or what might more appropriately be called partnerships these days, is “activation,” according to Brian Lillie at eCreative Group, Independence, Iowa, whose full-service marketing agency focuses on “activating” fans at grassroots tracks around the country. He is also CEO of Three Wide Media, which owns the racing magazines Dirt Late Model, Flat Out, and Dirt Modified.Lillie, who has frequently given seminars to dirt track racers, agreed with Elliott: “The biggest thing I would tell teams looking for sponsorship is to stay away from trying to sell a logo going around in circles on a race car. That’s what everybody is trying to sell: ‘Where do you want to be on my car, and this many people will see it?’ I guess I would call the logo on the car passive marketing: You just put it out there and hope it works. You could sponsor Dale Earnhardt Jr., but unless you activate around it, it’s not going to work.”As Lillie described it, “Activation marketing is the art of interacting and directly connecting with a fan or consumer. You’re trying to do something to create a reaction from them. It can be as simple as couponing, where you’re actually putting something into their hands. There are a thousand different things you can do with activation...it’s just getting them to interact with you and making a direct connect.”Dodge is one of eCreative’s clients, and the agency is working with Dodge dealers around the country to produce interactive events at dirt tracks. “We activate the fans by setting them up with test drives on the track, prize giveaways, and things like that. It’s a direct connect where we’re actually trying to touch people, get their information, let them touch the product and learn about it in a fun atmosphere.”When we spoke, Lillie had just returned from a very successful weekend event at a small speedway with about 1000 fans in attendance. “We did it with the local Dodge dealer and we gave 100 test drives on the track after the races,” he said. “It was just phenomenal.”In Lillie’s opinion, “Teams should be looking for advertisers rather than sponsors. Sponsors shouldn’t expect much, and advertisers expect returns, and that’s one of the things that a lot of the local teams don’t realize. They may know it, but I think they just don’t know what they need to do to give an actual return on investment.”Fortunately, there is plenty of help out there. As the racing market has grown in size and sophistication, the number of specialized motorsports marketing agencies and logistics services has kept pace. Big or small, your team, track, series, or racing business can realize its full potential with the guidance of a good agency. To that end, we took a closer look at some of the most popular players in this arena and also elicited their advice for those seeking successful long-term financial partnerships.Bringing In Big BrandsIn its 30th year in business, Atlanta, Georgia-based Championship Group specializes in providing sponsorship development and consulting directly to large corporations. The company works in the full gamut of sports, from stick and ball to the Olympics. Just a few of the companies Championship has brought into racing are Unilever, M&M Mars, Hershey, Georgia-Pacific, and Sue Bee Honey. It has also worked with major race tracks, teams, and series such as IRL.“We work as a strategic marketing resource directly on the client side to determine what type of sponsorship program is the correct fit,” explained Ardy Arani. “What are the business objectives of the program? What are the budget parameters? What are the timing and geographic parameters? Based on that, and depending on a lot of different factors, we make the appropriate recommendation, act to negotiate and secure rights, manage programs, and enable the client to analyze and ultimately justify his decision in quantifiable marketing terms. The program is measured against the objectives going in, to determine how it’s succeeding and what, if any, changes or expansion may be required going forward.”With the huge array of sports venues open to sponsors, we asked Arani why a corporation might choose racing over all the rest.“When a CEO asks why he should consider a racing sponsorship, I say, ‘The answer to that is not because you like it or someone on your board likes it. The reason to look at it is because the people you do business with, whether it’s the consumer or a trade partner, are interested in it. That’s really where you look for the interest level. We’re not there to talk about his personal passion; we’re there to talk in extremely specific marketing terminology about why these types of programs work. And racing, as a whole, offers a lot of flexibility that many other sports don’t.“For example, let’s say I want to have a big star quarterback endorse my product,” Arani continued. “That type of program does not get me any access to that quarterback during the event that he’s competing in; it does not give me a platform to advertise on that person’s uniform or do anything in the stadiums, and so on. Racing is very much an open door, where a company can come in and very seamlessly put together programs that involve exposure, branding, access to an athlete, access to a venue. Racing remains unmatched in its ability to provide a very multi-faceted sponsorship platform that you don’t see in the stick and ball arena, and I think that’s why a lot of companies continue to use it.”Owing to the economy, Arani has seen the sponsorship landscape in motorsports change over the past few years, leading to a growing trend at all levels of the industry. “We started years ago doing programs with major teams where we would bring in companies as partial sponsors,” he said. “Now you’re seeing that model really becoming the norm, where companies will carve up their primary sponsorship, so they have two or three of them rotating over the course of a season. While motorsports is still appealing for sponsors, I think the concept of one company coming in and completely underwriting the budget for a team is not as robust as it once was. It takes a lot more creativity these days to put these types of programs together.”Octagon, located in the Charlotte, North Carolina, suburb of Huntersville, represents sponsors’ interests in the full gamut of professional and high-profile amateur sports. The company has 60 offices worldwide, 1000 employees, and specialists in virtually every sport. About 90 percent of its Charlotte business is motorsports related.Octagon’s biggest client in motorsports is Sprint. “When it was Nextel, we helped them broker the deal with NASCAR,” noted Mark Coughlin. “We continue to represent Sprint/Nextel in everything they do, on and off the race track, not only with their NASCAR program, but all of their other sports,” he said, adding that other clients include Bank of America, Home Depot, and AllState.Because the company has expertise in many sports, “We try to be property or sport agnostic,” said Coughlin. “We talk to the brand management team and the senior management of the company to try to find out what they’re trying to achieve by being involved in any form of sports or entertainment, and then try to pair them up with the right sport. Some people want brand exposure, and for others who already have very high levels of brand awareness, it may be more about trying to win the loyalty of the fan base. We help companies understand why fans are fans of any particular sport, and create brand equity by showing that same kind of passion and emotion for the things that drew those fans to the sport in the first place. The one constant is that we push clients to put a stake in the ground and determine what success looks like, what they’re trying to achieve out of it, and set up a measuring system so we understand what works and what doesn’t work when we’re working on activation programs.”Speaking of the appeal to sponsors of NASCAR racing in particular, Coughlin pointed to the long season, the positive attributes of the fan base, and the series’ “national footprint” compared to other sports platforms. “The New York Yankees might be the most popular baseball team in the world, but the majority of their fan base is in and around the Tri-State area. NASCAR, while it still has a very strong hold in the Southeast, also has a good following nationally, and some pretty fervent pockets in certain areas of the country, as well.”Coughlin, who ran Valvoline’s racing program for 11 years, had some advice for all racers, including those in grassroots series.“No matter what kind of company you’re approaching, you’ve got to think concretely about how they can definitively improve their business situation by becoming involved with you, whether you’re willing to put your car out in front of their business in order to create some foot traffic into the store, or you can help them build relationships. In the motor oil space, I used to ask people, ‘Who is your main sponsor? Do they have a fleet of vehicles? And what kind of lubricants are they using in those vehicles?’ You have to think about who you are making your approach to, and see if you can connect the dots with the people you have existing relationships with, because everybody’s always interested in relationship building and new business generation. At the end of the day, that’s what it’s all about.”Show Me the MoneyJust Marketing International, Zionsville, Indiana, also serves the corporate side of the sport, with 150 employees in five countries. “Our clients are the LGs, the UPSes, the Johnny Walkers,” said Zak Brown. “We put together their sponsorship programs and help them manage them, run their hospitality, the show cars, the promotions, the strategic consulting.”Big agencies are attracting major investment into motorsports, prompting Brown to say, “With the amount of money at stake, and how complicated the sport can be, people need expert consultation to help make sure they spend their money right and get out of it what they planned on. All of that sponsorship money has driven the need for expert agencies to help companies operate within the sport.”On the flip side, he said many teams could really use professional help in managing their sponsorships. “They’re not usually set up to manage sponsors and come up with ideas and campaigns to service them,” he said.But he had some sage advice for getting and, more importantly, keeping sponsors. “Just be very focused,” he suggested. “I get a lot of solicitations from racing teams where it’s clear that they haven’t done enough homework, or they wouldn’t have proposed certain things that clearly aren’t fits or that don’t make sense. First and foremost, is finding out what the company needs and trying to build a solution to that, which is not always easy. “It’s really all about sponsor satisfaction and whether they’re achieving their goals,” continued Brown. “It’s important that you understand what they’re trying to get out of a sponsorship and work very hard to deliver against those specific objectives. Usually, it ties back to increased sales, and companies are much more sophisticated in measuring the impact of promotions on sales. But they also put value on business-to-business opportunities, where they might be able to conduct business at the track, or make introductions at the track that shorten the sales cycle. A sponsor might have half a dozen goals they’re trying to accomplish through racing.”Brown also advised that it’s important “to chase a lot of people. You get a lot of no’s to get one yes. And you’ve got to make sure that you’re pretty buttoned-up, because sponsors get so many presentations sent to them. You’ve kind of got 10 seconds to grab their attention, so you’ve got to make sure that it’s about them and not about you. Just as an example, ‘Look how many trophies I won last year is not what’s going to get someone at LG excited; what’s going to get them excited is something they open that tells them immediately how you’re going to help them sell a lot of flat-screen TVs.”Elliott agreed that it’s about helping the sponsor achieve an ROI (return on investment), and suggested that the driver’s role may even entail such things as courses in public speaking. “They need to learn how to represent their sponsorship effectively; they need to understand what their sponsors promote and sell, and they’ve got to believe in it. A lot of young drivers don’t understand that; they just think, ‘Well, gee, this guy would want to sponsor me because I’ve won a few races. They think they’re owed the sponsorship, and it’s really vice versa: the sponsor is owed a performance. They’re investing in you because they expect a return on that investment. If you give them a return, they’ll stick with you. If they don’t, it’s a sign that you’re not working for the sponsor.”Speaking of the appeal of the racing market to sponsors, Elliott said, “We’re talking a fan base of over one-third of the adult population of the United States. And the amazing thing about race fans is that it doesn’t matter what their household income is, they’re going to buy the brand name products that sponsor and support their favorite sport.”Offering 25 years of action and motorsports experience, expertise and an understanding of power sports and its customers, Performance Branding, under the umbrella of the Haro Design Group in Cardiff, California, has worked with many well-known brands in the power sports and motorsports world, noted Bob Haro.“Brands like International Speedway Corporation, Richard Childress Racing, Michael Waltrip Racing, Ducati Motor Holdings, Yamaha Motor Corporation, Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca and AMA Pro Racing, just to name a few, have come to trust us for how we think and what we deliver to their brands,” he added.Performance Branding is a boutique design, marketing and branding agency, dedicated to designing and delivering high-quality work that builds the brand and moves the business forward. “We listen to our customers’ needs and business challenges in order to build a smart and effective marketing or branding solution that not only fits those objectives, but also meets their budget requirements,” Haro explained.For race teams looking for sponsorship, Haro suggested having a professional marketing package in both a hard copy and a digital email-ready format that is clear and concise in its image and message so that the person you are pitching understands what you have to offer them quickly and easily without having to explain every detail. “These marketing tools are typically talking pieces that you can use to catch a potential sponsor’s interest and use when you have a face-to-face meeting to expand on the presented concepts in more detail,” he noted.Once a deal has been inked, Haro advises to constantly update and continue to market your driver’s or team’s progress and achievements so that sponsors know the value that you are bringing to them. “Provide a quarterly newsletter or monthly press updates on the team or drivers’ efforts and achievements, showing press received in magazines, online or on TV,” Haro added. “Absolutely have a website and update the content and keep it fresh and interesting. You must constantly build value for the racing service that you are providing sponsors and for the sponsorship dollars they are spending with you.”For even more advice about how to get the most from sponsorship dollars, please visit the Performance Racing Industry website next month for part two of this article. 



      Sponsorship goes beyond putting a decal on a race car, which the professional race teams understand, and often deliver a quality program to their sponsors. However, this doesn’t mean that grassroots racers can’t give their sponsors plenty more than they expect. Going above and beyond what the sponsor expects often brings huge results to these race teams, where even a several-thousand dollar sponsorship deal can make a difference.    The key to successful sponsorships, or what might more appropriately be called partnerships these days, is “activation,” according to Brian Lillie at eCreative Group. As Lillie described it, “Activation marketing is the art of interacting and directly connecting with a fan or consumer. You’re trying to do something to create a reaction from them. It can be as simple as couponing, where you’re actually putting something into their hands. There are a thousand different things you can do with activation...it’s just getting them to interact with you and making a direct connect.” For example, Dodge is one of eCreative’s clients, and the agency is working with Dodge dealers around the country to produce interactive events at dirt tracks, such as this one.
