Letter to Participants
  
 
 
 
 
 
  


 n  DEAR PARTICIPANT, A more optimistic tone characterized the financial markets in the second quarter of 2003. In fact, it was the best quarter in 4 1/2 years for both the U.S. stock market and markets outside the United States, even as the long-standing bond market rally persisted.   The market rallies were very welcome after the long bear market. In general, investors should
expect both good and bad markets within any extended time span. Good financial planning takes this into account by diversifying your portfolio with an asset allocation that is appropriate to your stage in life and your tolerance for the possibility
of loss.   A financial professional can help you create a complete picture of the
potential demands on your resources. Moreover, financial professionals are familiar with the long-term returns and historical volatility of various asset classes. Together, you and your financial professional can plan an investment program that
takes into account your reasons for investing, the time you have to reach your goals, and the amount of risk you feel comfortable assuming.   On behalf of Prudential Financial, I would like to thank you for your confidence in our products. We look forward to continuing to serve your investment needs.
  Sincerely,   
 David R. Odenath, Jr. Chairman, The Prudential Series Fund, Inc.

 Portfolios inception date: 08/1982.    1 Past performance cannot guarantee comparable future results. The Account performance results are after the deduction of all expenses and contract charges including investment management and administrative fees, but not including the
effect of any sales charges. All total returns are for the periods indicated and are calculated based on changes in unit values. Investment return and principal value of the Account will fluctuate resulting in a value which may at any time,
including the time of the withdrawal of the cash value, be more or less than the total principal investment made. Six-month returns are not annualized.    2 For current yields on the Money Market Account, please call (800)
458-6333. An investment in the Account is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. It is possible to lose money by investing in the Account.    3 S&P 500 Index is an unmanaged, market value-weighted index of 500 stocks generally representative of the broad stock market.    4 The Citigroup 3-Month Treasury Bill Index is an index whereby
equal dollar amounts of three-month Treasury bills are purchased at the beginning of each of three consecutive months. As each bill matures, all proceeds are rolled over or reinvested in a new three-month bill. The income used to calculate the
monthly return is derived by subtracting the original amount invested from the maturity value.    5 Lipper (VIP) Funds Averages are calculated by Lipper Analytical Services, Inc., and reflect the investment return of certain
portfolios underlying variable life and annuity products. These returns are net of investment fees and fund expenses, but not product charges.     Investors cannot invest directly in a market index or average.    Source: Prudential Investments LLC and Lipper Inc. with the exception of Citigroup 3-Month Treasury Bill Index (Citigroup).

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF  VCA-10   


Note 1:
 
General  The Prudential Variable Contract Account-10
(VCA-10 or the Account) was established on March 1, 1982 by The Prudential Insurance Company of America (Prudential) under the laws of the State of New Jersey and is registered as an open-end, diversified
management investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. VCA-10 has been designed for use by employers (Contract-holders) in making retirement arrangements on behalf of their employees
(Participants). The investment objective of the Account is long-term growth of capital. The Accounts investments are composed primarily of common stocks. Although variable annuity payments differ according to the investment
performance of the Account, they are not affected by mortality or expense experience because Prudential assumes the expense risk and the mortality risk under the contracts.   


Note 2:
 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  Securities
Valuation:    Securities listed on a securities exchange are valued at the last sale price on such exchange on the day of valuation or, if there was no sale on such day, at the mean between the last reported bid and ask
prices, or at the last bid price on such day in the absence of an asked price. Securities traded via Nasdaq are valued at the official closing price provided by Nasdaq. Securities that are actively traded in the over-the-counter market, including
listed securities for which the primary market is believed by Prudential Investments LLC (PI or Manager), in consultation with the subadviser(s); to be over-the-counter, are valued by an independent pricing agent or principal
market maker. Options on securities and indices traded on an exchange are valued at the mean between the most recently quoted bid and asked prices on such exchange. Futures contracts and options thereon traded on a commodities exchange or board of
trade are valued at the last sale price at the close of trading on such exchange or board of trade or, if there was no sale on the applicable commodities exchange or board of trade on such day, at the mean between the most recently quoted bid and
asked prices on such exchange or board of trade or at the last bid price in the absence of an asked price. Any security for which a reliable market quotation is unavailable is valued at fair value by a Valuation Committee appointed by the
Accounts Committee Members.    Investments in mutual funds are
valued at their net asset value as of the close of the New York Stock Exchange on the date of the valuation.    Short-term investments which mature in more than 60 days are valued based on current market quotations. Short-term investments having maturities of 60 days or less
are valued at amortized cost which approximates market value. Amortized cost is computed using the cost on the date of purchase, adjusted for constant accretion of discount or amortization of premium to maturity.    Securities Transactions and Net Investment
Income:    Securities transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains (losses) on sales of securities are calculated on the identified cost basis. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date and interest
income is recorded on the accrual basis. Net investment income and realized and unrealized gain (losses) (other than administrative fees) are allocated to the Participants and Prudential on a daily basis in proportion to their respective ownership
in VCA-10. Expenses are recorded on the accrual basis which may require the use of certain estimates by management.    Options:    The Fund may either purchase or write options in order to hedge against adverse market movements or fluctuations in value
caused by changes in prevailing interest rates with respect to securities which the Fund currently owns or intends to purchase. The Funds principal reason for writing options is to realize, through receipt of premiums, a greater current return
than would be realized on the underlying security alone. When the Fund purchases an option, it pays a premium and an amount equal to that premium is recorded as an asset. When the Fund writes an option, it receives a premium and an amount equal to
that premium is recorded as a liability. The asset or liability is adjusted daily to reflect the current market value of the option.    If an option expires unexercised, the Fund realizes a gain or loss to the extent of the premium received or paid. If an option is exercised, the premium received or
paid is an adjustment to the proceeds from the sale or the cost of the purchase in determining whether the Fund has realized a gain or loss. The difference between the premium and the amount received or paid on effecting a closing purchase or sale
transaction is also treated as 


a realized gain or loss. Gain or loss on purchased options is included in net realized gain or loss on investment
transactions. Gain or loss on written options is presented separately as net realized gain or loss on written options.    The Fund, as writer of an option, may have no control over whether the underlying securities may be sold (called) or purchased (put). As a result, the Fund bears
the market risk of an unfavorable change in the price of the security underlying the written option. The Fund, as purchaser of an option, bears the risk of the potential inability of the counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts.
   Written options involve elements of both market and credit risk in
excess of the amounts reflected in the Statements of Assets and Liabilities.    Federal Income Taxes:    The operations of VCA-10 are part of, and are taxed with, the operations of Prudential. Under the current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, Prudential does not expect to incur
federal income taxes on earnings of VCA-10 to the extent the earnings are credited under the Contracts. As a result, the Unit Value of VCA-10 has not been reduced by federal income taxes.   


Note 3:
 
Investment Management Agreement and Charges  The Account has a
management agreement with PI. Pursuant to this agreement, PI has responsibility for all investment advisory services and supervises the subadvisers performance of such services. PI has entered into a subadvisory agreement with Jennison
Associates LLC (Jennison). The subadvisory agreement provides that Jennison will furnish investment advisory services in connection with the management of the Account. PI pays for the services of Jennison.    A daily charge, at an effective annual rate of up to 1.00% of the current value of the
Participants equity in VCA-10, is charged to the Account. Up to three quarters of the charge (0.75%) paid to Prudential, is for administrative expenses not provided by the annual account charge, and one quarter (0.25%), paid to PI, is for
investment management services. Prudential may impose a reduced Administrative Fee where warranted by economies of scale and the expense characteristics of the employer, association or trust to which Prudential has issued a Contract.    Prudential, PI and Jennison are indirect, wholly-owned subsidiaries of Prudential
Financial, Inc.    An annual account charge of not more than $30 is
deducted from the account of each Participant, if applicable, at the time of withdrawal of the value of all of the Participants accounts or at the end of the fiscal year by cancelling Units.    A deferred sales charge is imposed upon that portion of certain withdrawals which
represents a return of contributions. The charge is designed to compensate Prudential for sales and other marketing expenses. The maximum deferred sales charge is 7% on contributions withdrawn from an account during the first year of participation.
After the first year of participation, the maximum deferred sales charge declines by 1% in each subsequent year until it reaches 0% after seven years. No deferred sales charge is imposed upon contributions withdrawn for any reason after seven years
of participation in the Program. For the six months ended June 30, 2003 and the year ended December 31, 2002, Prudential has advised the Account that it has received deferred sales charges of $691 and $4,859 respectively, imposed upon certain
withdrawals from the Account.   


Note 4:
 
Purchases and Sales of Portfolio Securities  For the six months ended
June 30, 2003, the aggregate cost of purchases and the proceeds from sales of securities, excluding short-term investments, were $58,499,077 and $66,019,105, respectively.    Investment in the Core Funds:    The Account invests in the Taxable Money Market Series (the
Series), a portfolio of Prudential Core Investment Fund, pursuant to an exemptive order received from the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Series is a money market mutual fund registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940,
as amended, and managed by PI. During the six months ended June 30, 2003, the Account earned $47,732, from the Series by investing its excess cash in the Series. 




Note 5:
 
Unit Transactions  The number of Accumulation Units issued and redeemed
for the six months ended June 30, 2003 and the year ended December 31, 2002, respectively, are as follows:   


 
  
Six MonthsEndedJune 30, 2003

)



 Net decrease
  
(1,402,893
)
 
(2,811,950
)


  


Note 6:
 
Net Increase (Decrease) In Net Assets Resulting from Surplus Transfers  The increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from surplus transfers represents the net increase to/(reductions from) Prudentials investment in the Account. This increase (decrease) includes reserve adjustments for mortality and
expense risks assumed by Prudential.   


Note 7:
 
Participant Loans  Loans are considered to be withdrawals from the
Account from which the loan amount was deducted, though they are not considered a withdrawal from the MEDLEY Program. Therefore, no deferred sales charge is imposed upon them. The principal portion of any loan repayment, however, will be treated as
a contribution to the receiving Account for purposes of calculating any deferred sales charge imposed upon any subsequent withdrawal. If the Participant defaults on the loan, for example by failing to make required payments, the outstanding balance
of the loan will be treated as a withdrawal for purposes of the deferred sales charge. The deferred sales charge will be withdrawn from the same Accumulation Accounts, and in the same proportions, as the loan amount was withdrawn. If sufficient
funds do not remain in those Accumulation Accounts, the deferred sales charge will be withdrawn from the Participants other Accumulation Accounts as well.   
Withdrawals, transfers and loans from VCA-10 are considered to be withdrawals of contributions until all of the Participants contributions to the Account
have been withdrawn, transferred or borrowed. No deferred sales charge is imposed upon withdrawals of any amount in excess of contributions.    For the six months ended June 30, 2003, $360,968 in participant loans were withdrawn from VCA-10 and $222,655 of principal and interest was repaid to VCA-10. For
the year ended December 31, 2002, $1,017,654 in participant loans were withdrawn from VCA-10 and $494,468 of principal and interest was repaid to VCA-10. Loan repayments are invested in Participants account(s) as chosen by the Participant,
which may not necessarily be VCA-10. The initial loan proceeds which are being repaid may not necessarily have originated solely from VCA-10. During the six months ended June 30, 2003, Prudential has advised the Account that it received $4,707 in
loan origination fees. The participant loan principal and interest repayments are included in purchase payments and transfers in within the Statement of Changes in Net Assets.
