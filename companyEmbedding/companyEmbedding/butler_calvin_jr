Generation One
1. Calvin J.1 Butler 
was born on 2 Nov 1812 NC.1 
He married 1st Martha J. Hicks, 
daughter of Elijah Hicks and Patience 
Bennett, on 2 Nov 1836 in TN; she was b. 16 Jan 1823 in TN.2 
He married 2nd Cynthia B. 
Donaldson, daughter of Moses M. Donaldson and Lydia Dodson, on 27 Oct 1868 in 
Fayette Co. IL (his 2nd, her 3rd of 6; 2 ch.; mar. by Jas. J. Hicks JP)3; 
she was b. 1833 in IL; she d. aft. 1910 and was buried Oconee Mound cem., Oconee, 
Shelby, IL, probably as Cynthia Hamilton. Calvin's estate was probated between 
1873 and 1874 Fayette, IL (he died 
intestate; son Aaron G. was appointed administrator of estate).4 
He died at home on 3 May 1873 near Ramsey,, 
Fayette, IL, at age 60.5

Calvin's middle name sometimes 
given as John, but there was never proof of this; it is more likely that it is 
Jones, and that Calvin J. Butler is named after Dr./Gen. Calvin Jones of NC and 
TN (also see Atlas 
J. Butler file; Atlas Jones was a brother of Dr./Gen. Calvin Jones, and a 
number of boys with NC connections are named after these two Jones brothers; 
there are several instances where there was both a Calvin and an Atlas in the 
same family, and often both had the middle name of Jones).  Note that 
Calvin J. Butler had a relative named Atlas 
J. Butler, Calvin J. Butler named his youngest son Atlas Jones Butler, and that son named a son Calvin Jones Butler.  Also, despite 
published statements to the contrary, he was never known as John Calvin Butler, 
J. C. Butler, or J. Butler - the transposition of his first and middle names or 
his initials has no basis in known public or family records and was simply a 
guess by researcher Allen Pendergraft. 
One or two wives prior to Martha 
Hicks are sometimes reported, but these earlier marriages have no basis in fact 
and not included here, although they have unfortunately found their way into 
published works and internet files; these additional marriages were also guesses 
by Allen Pendergraft, based on (1) an erroneous interpretation of the 1850 
census of Carroll Co. TN (William 
J. Butler and his new bride Susan Crow were enumerated in the household of 
Calvin Butler in 1850, but neither William J. nor Susan were children of Calvin 
Butler as Pendergraft supposed) and (2) the middle names of some of Calvin's 
children, supposed by Pendergraft to be surnames of earlier wives.  
Although Martha J. Hicks married Calvin J. Butler at an unusually young age, the 
fact is that Martha's mother was widowed with several young daughters and no 
known sons, and I believe that early marriage of all her daughters was condoned 
if not encouraged. For additional discussion of these points, click here. 

Most of the dates for Calvin and 
his family apparently came from the Bible of his daughter Malinda, now lost. His 
birth year is shown as 1812 as is usually seen in family records; some sources 
give the birth year as 1808 or 1810, but these earlier dates are thought to be 
errors conveniently made to allow for supposed earlier (but nonexistent) 
marriages. In the censuses of 1850, 1860, and 1870, his age is given as 40, 50, 
and 59, resp., so perhaps he was b. late 1810 rather than 1812. 
He was a farmer.  The 
location of some of his land in Carroll Co. TN can be determined from deeds in 
Carroll Co. TN and the following information: 


In 1858, Isaac Williams owned land in 18th 
  dist. Carroll Co. TN adj. Calvin Butler, described as follows: beginning at an 
  elm in William Taylor's line, then east with Calvin Butler line to Indian 
  Creek, then down said creek to the mouth of Bush Branch then up said branch to 
  the beginning 45 A. more or less.  Isaac Williams willed this land to his

Calvin owned other land in 
Carroll Co. as well; he sold that land and moved near Ramsey, Fayette, IL ca. 1865. Calvin and his 2nd wife Cynthia 
owned land located W 1/2 SW1/4 SE1/4 sec 24 
T8N R1W in Fayette, IL jointly with George W. and Elizabeth Jones of Macoupin 
Co. IL, which they sold to Richard H. Gray on 18 Jan 1872; CJB had bought 15 A. 
of this 20 from Gray in 1867 (note that a Richard Gray is bur. in one of the old 
Casey cems. in Fayette Co., IL, along with Samuel Casey and Otto G. Casey). At 
his death on 3 May 1873, Calvin owned property E 1/2 SE 1/4 sec 24 (80A., south 
40 in cultivation) and E pt SW 1/4 SE 1/4 sec 24 (20 A. in cult.) of T8N 
R1W Hurricane tsp.,, Fayette, IL; note that 
in 1877, Calvin's son Aaron owned 70 A. out of this 80 A., that is the NE 
1/4 SE 1/4 sec 24 T8N R1W and the adjacent eastern 3/4 of SE 1/4 SE 1/4 T8N 
R1W; the remaining 10 A. being then owned by C. G. Mathewson. In 1870 census, he 
was enum. in Hurricane tsp., Fayette, IL (Calvin J. Butler 59 NC, Cynthia B. 36 
IL, Malinda 15 TN, Irving C. 9 TN, Martha A. 1 IL, and also Persely (Presley?) 
Pruett 19 male (prob. son of Calvin's second wife Cynthia Donaldson and her 
first husband James W. Pruett).
The siblings, if any, and 
parents of Calvin J. Butler are unknown at this time, despite any published 
material to the contrary.  I am aware of the book "The Descendants of 
Thomas Pincerna..." by Judge E. Butler; the notes of Allen Pendergraft and 
Robert Allen in the Huntingdon, TN genealogical library; and various other 
sources - all of which list various sets of parents for Calvin without any 
substantiating proof.  Family letters, autograph books, and inscriptions on 
photographs state that the children of Calvin J. Butler were cousins of the 
children of Seymour Spencer Butler, Atlas J. Butler, and Marvel Butler; the 
latter three were brothers and sons of James Butler and Susannah Spencer.  
The exact relationship between this James Butler family and Calvin J. Butler is 
unknown.  If you have any new information which might help identify 
Calvin's family connections, please contact Bob Butler. 
The other five husbands of 
Calvin J. Butler's second wife Cynthia B. Donaldson have been 
determined. All six marriage dates are found in the IL State Marriage Index as listed below.

Children of Calvin 
J.1 Butler and Martha J. Hicks all b. Buena Vista, Carroll, TN, were as follows: 



2. i. Elijah 
  J.2, b. 6 Oct 1837; m. Louisa Jane 
  Poland. 

3. ii. Aaron 
  Greenberry, b. 1 Jan 1839; m. Vin Cynthia Jane Casey; 
  m. Meca Luvena Sanders. 

4. iii. Enoch 
  Riley, b. 25 Nov 1840; m. Martha Alice Thornton; 
  m. Mrs. Jennie Evans. 

iv. Mary E.; b. 23 May 
  1843; m. Benjamin 
  Armistead Sanders, son of James Sanders and Martha W. Butler, 20 Sep 1860; d. 10 Aug 1886 at age 43. She 
  and Benjamin Armistead Sanders lived in household of Furmon C. Sanders,, Carroll, TN 
  on 19 Oct 1860.  She and Benjamin Armistead Sanders 
  did not live in IL at time of Calvin Butler's death in 1873. Note there is 
  also a Mary E. Butler d. 23 Sep 1893 aged 31Y 10M 9D, bur. Raymond cem. Mont. 
  Co. IL, relationship unknown.   

5. v. Joel 
  A., b. 21 Jan 1846; m.Frances Rogers; m. Elizabeth H. (--?--). 

6. vi. Harriet 
  J., b. 1 Jan 1849; m. John Hamilton Merriman. 

7. vii. Nancy 
  Jane, b. 25 Dec 1851; m. Andrew J. Coffee. 

viii. Malinda Caroline; b. 22 Jan 1855 (or 8 Feb 1855 per obituary); d. 
  16 Feb 1935 Fillmore tsp.,, Montgomery, 
  IL, at age 80 (heart failure; at home of niece Mrs. James Alexander (Sarah 
  Louisa Butler, dau. of Malinda's brother Aaron G. Butler));6 
  bur. 18 Feb 1935 Fillmore 
  cem., Fillmore, Montgomery, IL. She was also known as Aunt Lindy. She never 
  married. 
Some of the few available clues to the 
  mystery of the parents and siblings (if any) of Malinda's father Calvin J. 
  Butler are the following: 1.  She and Homer S. 
  Butler were cousins per Malinda's obituary; this cousin relationship could 
  result in a number of different ways: (1) a relationship between Malinda's 
  father Calvin Butler and Homer Butler's grandfather William S. Butler; or (2) 
  by marriage through her brother Aaron Butler's wife's cousin Louisa McCaslin, 
  Homer Butler's mother. 2.  She and Nancy Leanna 
  Hicks were cousins per Malinda's obituary; this cousin relationship could 
  result in a number of different ways: (1) through Malinda's mother Martha 
  Hicks, whose father Elijah Hicks was the brother of Claiborne Hicks, the 
  grandfather of Leanna (Hicks) Cole (making them 2nd cousins); or (2) through 
  Lurena Butler, wife of Claiborne Hicks, who could be related to Malinda's 
  father Calvin Butler (no proof of this). 3.  She and Gholston Ward Butler (son of Marvel 
  Butler) were cousins; when GWB lived in Carroll, TN, he signed Malinda's autograph book "your cousin 
  Ghalston W. Butler" 10 Oct 1884 while Malinda was visiting there with her 
  cousin P. G. Donaldson.7
4.  She and Garvin Bell Butler (son of Atlas 
  J. Butler) were cousins; when GBB lived in Huntingdon, Carroll, TN, he signed Malinda's 
  autograph book "your cousin G. B. Butler, Huntingdon Tenn" 23 Dec 1884 while 
  Malinda was visiting there with her cousin P. G. Donaldson.7
5.  A letter from Clark Seymore Butler (son of Seymore Spencer 
  Butler) to Aaron G. Butler (son of Calvin J. Butler) dated 10 Mar 1884 exists 
  in which Clark calls Aaron "cousin". 6.  Photographs of members of 
  other Butler families of Carroll Co. TN have been in the possession of 
  descendants of Calvin J. Butler for many years; it is doubtful that these 
  photographs would have come into the possession of the Butlers in Illinois 
  unless there was some sort of relationship between the two.

  8. x. Irvin 
  C., b. 21 Aug 1860; d. 22 Jun 1936 at age 75; m. Minnie M. 
  Steel. 
  xi. Calvin M.; b. 9 Mar 1863; d. 3

  Aug 1869; m. Charles W. Hinton.
  10. ii. Atlas

Some family records suggest that Calvin J. Butler and Cynthia B. Donaldson had a third child Lottie L. b. 31 Jan 1871 Vandalia, Fayette, IL, d. 9 Sep 1949 Vandalia, Fayette, IL, but this is not yet verified by other known records.
Generation Two
2. Elijah J.2 Butler (Calvin1) 
was buried Poland family cem. near Ramsey,, 
Fayette, IL. He was born on 6 Oct 1837 Buena Vista, Carroll, TN. He married Louisa Jane Poland, daughter 
of John J. Poland Jr. and Catherine 
Nave, on 4 Nov 1860 Ramsey, 
Fayette, IL (her 1st; 1 ch. known. Belle Davidson records say mar. 1862).8 
He died on 12 Jun 1867 East Fork tsp.,, 
Montgomery, IL, at age 29 (or may have d. in Fayette Co).  He was a Baptist 
minister. 
Children of Elijah J.2 Butler and Louisa Jane 
Poland were: 


11. i. Elijah 
  Oliver3, b. 18 Jul 1867 IL; 
  m. Malinda Catherine Diamond.  
3. Aaron Greenberry2 BUTLER (Calvin1Butler) 
was born on 1 Jan 1839 Buena Vista, Carroll, TN (erroneously given as 1 Jan 1838 in some 
sources). He married Vin Cynthia Jane Casey on 26 Mar 1863 Montgomery, IL. He married Meca Luvena Sanders, daughter 
of Elza Creel Sanders and Sarah Ann 
Sturgeon, in Oct 1910. He died on 31 Mar 1923 Fillmore, Montgomery, IL, at age 84. He was 
buried on 1 Apr 1923 Casey cem., Fillmore 
tsp.,, Montgomery, IL. 
He was a farmer Fillmore 
tsp.,, Montgomery, IL. He owned property a farm in sec11 and sec12 of 
T8NR2W Fillmore tsp.,, Montgomery, IL. He 
was county sheriff between 1878 and 1882 Montgomery, IL.  He purchased real estate paid 1865 taxes on 
40 A. SW 1/4 SW 1/4 sec. 8 T8N R1W located Hurricane tsp.,, Fayette, IL, on 3 Feb 1866, but this property was 
not part of his Fillmore tsp. holdings and it is not yet known how Aaron 
acquired this land or what became of it. 
He and Clark Seymore Butler were cousins per 
10 Mar 1884 ltr. from CSB to AGB. 
Notes on the possible source of his middle name Greenberry: 
1.  A son by the name of Green Butler is attributed to Thomas E. Butler 
by Robert Allen, who says that Green Butler d. ca. 1838.  If this Green 
Butler's middle name was Berry, or Green was short for Greenberry, then it could 
provide a reason for why Aaron Greenberry Butler, born the year following the 
death of Green Butler, came by his middle name.  Thomas E. Butler and Basil 
and Elizabeth Billingsley administered the estate of Green Butler (Carroll 
County Minutes of the Court, Feb. 5, 1838). Green Butler's widow was named as 
Zetha (possibly Zetha Province, but no mar. record available), under 
guardianship of James and Andrew Province and Thomas Hamilton, no children 
mentioned.  1830 and 1840 census data for Thomas E. Butler supports a son 
b. betw. 1825 and 1830, but not earlier than approx. 1825; this would require 
Green to have mar. Zetha at age 13 and then d. immediately (if the census is 
wrong, then, based on Thomas E. Butler's birthyear of 1805, Green could have 
been born a few years earlier than 1825, but probably not earlier than 
1820).  More data is required to determine the relationship between Thomas 
E. and Green Butler. 2.  The given name Greenberry or simply Green is 
common in the American south; often men named Green had the middle name Berry, 
or Green was short for Greenberry. 2.  In particular, note a Green Berry Spencer - several Butlers appear to have been named 
aftergiven names from the Spencer family. Seymore and Clark are other examples 
of Spencer names used later by Butler families, thought to be relations. 
3.  The given name may be taken from the surname Greenberry, 
specifically Col. Nicholas Greenberry/bury who was Keeper 
of the Great Seal and Judge of the High Court of Chancery in England. He came to 
America on the ship "Constant Friendship" in 1674 and had at least one son and 
three daughters; one daughter Katherine married Col. Henry Ridgely, son of Col. 
Henry Ridgely of Devonshire, England; the latter was the brother of William 
Ridgely (an ancestor of Aaron G. Butler's wife Vin Cynthia Jane Casey), another 
dau. mar. a Scarbrough, and the other two ch. need further research. 4. The 
given name may be taken from the surname Granberry/bury, also found in NC and VA 
records. 
Children of Aaron Greenberry2 BUTLER and Vin 
Cynthia Jane Casey all b. Fillmore tsp.,, 
Montgomery, IL, were as follows: 


i. John 
  Riley3; b. 26 Jan 1864; d. 15 Sep 1864 Montgomery, IL.  Note he and John Riley Boyd and another John Riley 
  Butler  have same name. 

12. ii. Charles 
  Franklin, b. 14 Jan 1866; m. Emma L. Herren; 
  m. Ella Holloway. 

13. iii. Oren 
  Jones, b. 19 Jul 1869; m. Cara Etta Harvey. 

14. iv. Sarah 
  Louisa, b. 17 May 1872; m. James John Alexander. 
  

v. Nellie Myrtle; b. 1 
  Sep 1882 (A. G. Butler Bible record says b. 7 Sep 1882, d. 23 May 1890, 
  disagreeing with the public record and other data);9 
  d. 25 May 1890 IL, at age 7 (cause of death: epilepsy 
  after contracting measles; the printed remembrance card provided by the family 
  also gives the death date as 25 May 1890).9.  
  Some records give name as Nellie Marie, but a transcription of the Aaron 
  Butler Bible record gives Nellie Myrtle. 
There were no children of Aaron Greenberry2 
BUTLER and Meca Luvena Sanders. 
4. Enoch Riley2 Butler (Calvin1) 
was born on 25 Nov 1840 Buena Vista, Carroll, TN. He married Martha Alice Thornton on 29 Mar

He was born about 1866 in IL. She lived 1918 in Fillmore, Montgomery, IL.
There were no children of Enoch Riley2 Butler 
and Mrs. Jennie Evans. 
5. Joel A.2 BUTLER 
(Calvin1Butler) 
died TN. He was born on 21 Jan 1846 Buena Vista, Carroll, TN and died after 1918, 
possibly before 1920. He married Frances Rogers, daughter of Elisha M. Rogers 
and Dianna Boyd, on 5 Jan 1868 Carroll, TN (by Willoughby Pugh M.G.); she was b. 1851 in MS, 
probably Tippah Co. MS. He married Elizabeth (Lizzie) H. (--?--) ca. 
1897; she was b. ca. 1861 in TN. 
Although some sources give a death 
date of Jun 1887, Joel (with 2nd wife Elizabeth H. and dau. Mamie I.) is enum. 
in 1910 census of Carroll Co. TN (dist. 24), and the obituary of his brother 
Enoch states Joel alive in 1918; there were two other Joel Butlers in the 
county, hence the confusion.
He and wife Frances Rogers 
were enum. with her mother on the census of 1870, dist. 14, no. 12: Zianna 
(i.e., Dianna) Rogers 53 NC, Enos Rogers 16 MS, Sarah Rogers 11 MS, Joel Butler 
24 TN, Frances Butler 19 MS, Elisha Butler 1 TN, Judith Boyd 79 NC.  He 
appeared on the census of 1880 Hanson, Hopkins, KY (p. 342B: J. A. Butler farmer 34 TN NC IL, 
Francis wife 29 TN TN TN, E. C. son 11 TN TN TN, Ed. G. son 7 IL TN TN, B. L. 
dau 3 KY TN TN). He lived in Sep 1884 Maple Creek, Carroll, TN (signed sister Malinda Butler's autograph 
book).7 
He appeared on the census of 1900 Carroll, TN (1900, e.d. 133, p. 7 has wife Lizzie H. b. Dec 1860 
TN).  He appeared on the census of 1910, Carroll, TN (1910, dist. 24, e.d. 
41, p. 10: Joel A. Butler 64 TN, Elizebeth H. (wife) 49 TN, Mamie I. (dau.) 12 
TN). He lived in 1918 Westport, Carroll, TN.12  
He could not be located in the 1920 census of TN; it is not known whether he had 
died before that time or was living elsewhere. 
Children of Joel A.2 BUTLER and Frances Rogers 
were as follows: 


16. i. Elisha 
  Calvin3, b. 8 Jan 1869 TN; 
  m. Josephine C. Parham. 

ii. Edmond G.; b. 1873 IL. 
  He may be the Ed Butler who was subject of two photos in possession of 
  Aaron Butler descendants: (1) photo marked "Eddie Butler and wife", no other 
  markings, and (2) photo marked "daughters of Ed Butler" (2 girls), 
  photographer Darnell, Dyersburg, Tenn.  Note 1900 census of Carroll Co. 
  TN lists Eddie E. Butler b. Nov 1871 TN, wife Alba M. b. Oct 1880 AR, no ch., 
  per transcription of dist. 18 Buena Vista, house no. 1; also note in 1910 
  soundex Gibson Co. TN (e.d. 46, sh. 10) E. G. Butler 38 IL, wife Alba 29 AR, 
  daus. Ruth 9 and Francis 4 (bplace not stated, could be AR). Both enumerations 
  probably apply to Edmond G. Butler; perhaps the two daughters enum. in 1910 
  are the same two girls pictured in the photograph noted above. Also note a 20 
  Jan 1908 letter from Joel Butler's sister Malinda Butler to her niece Sarah 
  (Butler) Alexander which states "Edd Butler's wife had her leg taken off", 
  possibly referring to Edmond G. Butler's wife Alba.   

iii. B. L. (daughter); b. 1877 KY. 

iv. Florence; b. 25 Jun 1880 
  in TN; d. 27 Apr 1968 at General Hospital,, Carroll, TN; mar. Seaborn C.

She died on 27 Jan 1887 at age 38.15

Children of Harriet J.2 BUTLER and John Hamilton

  1871 IL; d. circa 1898 (d. age 27). 

iii. James N.; b. 
  1874 IL.  Are James N. and Norris Merriman same person? 

iv.  2 
  infants?  2 ch. apparently d. young; could these two be the Louis S. age 
  3 and Martha M. age 7/12 enum. with family in 1880? Note that these two were 
  noted in census as "no relation"; perhaps they were adopted. 
7. Nancy Jane2 BUTLER (Calvin1Butler) 
was buried Glendale 
cem., Fillmore, Montgomery, IL. She was born on 25 Dec 1851 Buena Vista, Carroll, TN. 
She married Andrew

v. Roy Edward; 
  m. Anna M. (--?--) (3 
  ch. in 1910); b. 1879. Either Ted d. bef. 1880, or "Ted" and Roy Edward Coffee are same person, or Ted was missed in 1880

He lived in 1890 Sioux City, Woodbury, IA. He and Minnie M. 
Steel lived before 1906 The Palms, Los Angeles, CA, now part of Culver City (The Palms was a station on the 
electric railway system in Los Angeles Co., about 12 miles from both downtown 
Los Angeles and Venice Beach; "The Palms" post office was just west of Culver 
City at the junction of Venice Blvd. and Motor Ave.). He was a real estate agent 
and also sold insurance in 1908 in The Palms, Los Angeles, CA. An article in the Los Angeles Examiner 
of 11 Aug 1907 notes the opening of a bank in Palms at a temporary location in 
"the I.C. Butler block." He and a grandniece Hazel Alice 
Butler (granddau. of his brother Enoch Butler) are included in a photo taken 
circa 1922 at Dinuba, CA at the home of Oren J. Butler (grandson of Irvin's

Oren's 2 oldest grandchildren Robert O. and Clayel O. Butler, Hazel Butler's 
husband James O. Butler (no relation), Bessie Lamb (girlfriend of Oren's son Aaron), and Oren's distant cousin William F. McCaslin. .

  1898 (age 7 in 1906, 12 in 1910 census, 20 in 1920 census);7 
  d. 10 Jan 1954 (requires verification).  Some records give his name as 
  Fred; no other son is known, so Fred and Harold are prob.

Generation Three
11. Elijah Oliver3 Butler (Elijah2, 
Calvin1) 
was born on 18 Jul 1867 IL (or b. 1865? Possibly b. 
Carroll Co. TN, but family should have been in IL by the time of his birth). 
He married Malinda 
Catherine Diamond, daughter of Samuel Stewart Diamond 
and Sabra Jane Grigg, on 14 Sep 1891 Fayette, IL (6 ch.; mar. record has Linnie C. 
Diamond, but her middle name is seen as Kathryn in some later data).20 
He died on 27 Sep 1925 at age 58. 
He was a Baptist minister.  He was called Oliver Butler in 
petition of Aaron G. Butler for letters of administration of estate of Calvin J. 
Butler in 1873, and often went by the name of Oliver.  He lived lived 
variously in Alton and Assumption, IL; in Saguache, Hooper, Alamosa, Trinidad,

However, note also that a preacher Elijah Oliver was performing marriages in 
Itawamba Co. MS (1850 census of Itawamba Co. has Elijah Oliver 38 TN merchant, 
wife Mary 37 TN, 8 ch); and an Elijah Oliver m. Polly Hicks, 15 Aug 1800 Surry

13. Oren Jones3 Butler (Aaron2BUTLER, 
Calvin1Butler) 
was born on 19 Jul 1869 Fillmore tsp.,, 
Montgomery, IL. He married Cara Etta Harvey on 26 Feb 1890 Montgomery, IL.23 
He died on 1 Jun 1924 North Dinuba, Tulare, CA, at age 54 (3 pm at home; enteritis and 
diarrhea were the immediate cause, although those were probably due to food 
poisoning (botulism). Oren became sick on May 23 and was in great pain until he 
died a week later; there were reportedly at least 10 other similar cases in the 
area at the same time, but the cause was not determined with certainty).24 
He was buried on 3 Jun 1924 Smith Mt. 
cem.,, Tulare, CA (stone says Ora J.; he often went by the name Ora, although 
his name was Oren).24

He was a farmer. He moved to CA, in Nov 1912 
from IL, and lived in Santa Monica, not far from his uncle Irvin Butler, a real estate/insurance agent in Palms, Los Angeles, CA. Oren came to CA with about $40,000 and first bought property at Paris 
Ranch, with the idea of raising alfalfa. The developers told him that the money 
he borrowed to buy the land and equipment would easily be paid back in a year or 
two. This was not the case; the market for alfalfa was not as it was represented 
to be, and Oren lost the land, equipment, and most of his money. The family always believed 
that they had been fleeced by shady developers. It was probably about 
1914 when Oren relocated to Dinuba, Tulare Co., CA; the reason Dinuba was chosen 
may have been because a cousin William Franklin McCaslin was already living 
there. Between 1919 and 1921, he worked at a cigar and tobacco store, in 
addition to farming.  His home burned 14 Nov 1923, the fire having been 
caused by an oil heater; the family lost almost all their possessions in the 
fire, but Oren saved his mother-in-law Mary Jane (Blackburn) Harvey who had 
fallen in the burning home while trying to retrieve a feather bed.  About 
Mar 1924 Oren and his son Guy and cousin "Frank" McCaslin became partners in a 
gasoline filling station in North Dinuba; McCaslin ran the Dinuba (CA) Ice Company circa 1913, and photographs indicate that 
Oren Butler and his son Guy both worked in that business about that time. 
Oren's namesake is not known; however, perhaps he could be named 
after Orrin Hulin b. 1788 or his son Orrin/Oran Hulin b. 
1817, or perhaps Oren Hearne, all residents of Montgomery Co. NC. The origin of 
his middle name Jones is also not known, although Jones may have been the middle 
name of Oren's grandfather Calvin J. Butler.  Also note an Orren Jones 23 
TN, Malinda 18 TN, Mary 63 VA in 1850 census of Hickman Co. TN (this is Orren 
Alston Jones, son of Alston Jones of Hickman Co. TN, the county where the Hicks 
ancestors of Oren Jones Butler lived for a time before most of them moved to 
Fayette Co. IL). 
Children of Oren Jones3 Butler and Cara Etta 
Harvey were as follows: 


24. i. Gladys 
  Vivian4, b. 26 Jan 1891 Hillsboro, Montgomery, IL; m. James Foster Elam.

  He never married. He served in the U.S. Army during WWI..

Montgomery, IL. She married James John Alexander, son of John Joseph 
Alexander and Sarah Kirk, on 25 Dec 1890 Montgomery, IL (7 ch).25 
She died on 21 Jan 1947 10 am,,,, at age 74. She was also known as Eliza.  Her namesake is not known; there were several people 
named Sarah L. Butler around this time.

of Andrew E. DeShane and Mary 
Margaret Grisham, on 11 Jul 1889 at the 
home of Andrew DeShane,, Montgomery, IL (mar. by P. G. Donaldson, wit. F. M. 
Stokes, L. A. Stokes).26 
He died on 7 Nov 1937 Lakeport, Lake, CA, at age 70. 
Albert C. Butler and family moved to OK by 
covered wagon circa 1895.  Because Washita Co. is just north of Kiowa Co., 
it is possible that Albert C. Butler moved to OK about the same time that his 
aunt and uncle Andrew J. Coffee and Nancy (Butler) Coffee 
moved to Kiowa Co. On 27 Apr 1909 he was elected Police Judge for city of 
Cordell, Washita, OK; term was 2 years starting 1 May 1909, but Albert C. 
apparently moved to AZ before or shortly after his term of office 
started . He appeared on 
the census of 1910 in Light judicial 
dist.,, Cochise, AZ (1910, Light dist., no 20: Albert C. Butler 42 IL farmer, 
Laura E. 41 IL, Paul P. 18 IL well drill engr., Jessie V. f 16 IL, Enoch Y. 14 
OK, Walter E. 10 OK, Alice H. 8 OK, Laurence R. 6 OK, Donald D. 1 6/12 OK). He 
lived in 1918 Light judicial dist.,, 
Cochise, AZ (there was a town called Light at one time - its location is as 
follows: at the junction of 666 (from Willcox to Douglas) and 181, head east on 
181 about 12 miles to an old two-story building on the south side of the highway 
(this building was once a grocery store operated by the Gail Price family ca. 
1947). The town of Light was about 2 miles straight north of this old store; in 
2005 there was little or nothing left of the town.). He lived Jun 1924 
in Kerman, Fresno, CA (Albert stated in a 10 Jun 1924 letter to his cousin Sarah 
Louisa "Eliza" (Butler) Alexander that he had moved to CA for his health, and 
intended to sell his property in AZ and buy a place in CA; the primary purpose 
of the letter was to tell Eliza that he and his family had been wired of her 
brother Oren Butler's death and had driven the 45 miles from Kerman to Dinuba to 
be with Oren's family and attend his funeral). 
Children of Albert Clark3 Butler and Laura Ethel

was born on 8 Jan 1869 TN. He married Josephine C. Parham on 20 Apr 1897 
Montgomery, IL (2 known ch). He died on 9 May 1951 at age 82. 
About Mar 1891 he (i.e., "Prof. E. 
C. Butler") moved from Carroll, TN to Nokomis, Montgomery, IL. He may have been 
living in Alamosa Co. CO ca. 1919-1922; a Mrs. E. C. Butler, a Josephine P. 
Butler, and a Charlene Butler witnessed several marriages in Alamosa Co. during 
that time, but that these are Elisha's wife and daughter has not been verified.
