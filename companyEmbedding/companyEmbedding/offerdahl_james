                  Bazaarvoice is a Software as a Service (SaaS) company that turns social media into social commerce for the world's best global brands by enabling authentic customer-powered marketing. We achieve that by first letting consumers create and share ratings, reviews, questions, answers, and stories about products and brands on client websites. We then syndicate that content across the Web and through the channel to reach shoppers wherever they are. This customer-generated content has a tremendously positive influence on purchase decisions. It is also rich with customer intelligence, which we analyze and provide to our clients so they can make real-time, information-based decisions that affect all aspects of their business — marketing, product R&D, and operations. This strategy of putting customers at the center of your business helps you achieve measurable results across your entire enterprise. Brett Hurt, Vice Chairman, and Brant Barton, General Manager of Media Solutions, founded Bazaarvoice in 2005. Headquartered in Austin, the company has offices in Amsterdam, London, Munich, New York, Paris, San Francisco, Stockholm, and Sydney.
