 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Plains All American Pipeline Announces Changes to Board of Directors
                                In Connection with Ownership Changes in General Partner

(Houston – December 23, 2010) Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. (NYSE: PAA) today
                              announced changes to the board of directors of its general partner. Such changes are related to
                              the previously announced agreement to transfer 50.1% of its general partner interest that was
                              substantially consummated today. Two new directors were appointed to the board of PAA’s general partner and two existing directors stepped down from the board.
Joining the board are Vicky Sutil and John Raymond. Ms. Sutil was appointed as the
                              board representative for Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) and Mr. Raymond was
                              appointed as the board representative for EMG Investment, LLC. Stepping down from the board
                              are Geoff McKay, the designated director for Vulcan Energy Corporation, an affiliate of Vulcan
                              Capital (“Vulcan”), and Arthur L. Smith, an at large director. The size of the board remains
                              unchanged at eight directors. Vulcan remains PAA’s largest common unit holder and Mr.
                              McKay will act as a board observer for Vulcan. Separately, PAA Natural Gas Storage, L.P.
                              (NYSE:PNG) announced that Mr. Smith has joined the board of PNG’s general partner.
 Ms. Sutil is Senior Manager, Corporate Development, for Occidental Petroleum
                              Corporation (Oxy), where she has led and worked on a variety of international and domestic oil
                              and gas acquisitions. Her prior positions at Oxy have included Manager, Financial Planning and
                              Analysis, and Senior Business Analyst. Before joining Oxy in 2000, Ms. Sutil worked for ARCO
                              Products Company as a Business Analyst for the Refining and Retail Marketing divisions, and
                              Senior Project Manager for the Refining Division. Earlier, she held a variety of engineering
                              positions at Mobil Oil Corporation. Ms. Sutil has been Oxy’s designated board observer since
                              acquiring its initial interest in PAA’s general partner in 2008.
 Mr. Raymond is an owner and founder of The Energy and Minerals Group (EMG), a
                              diversified natural resource private equity fund manager with over $2.5 billion under
                              management, and has been Managing Partner and CEO since EMG’s inception in 2006.
                              Previous to that time, Mr. Raymond held leadership positions with various energy companies,
                              including President and CEO of Plains Resources Inc., the predecessor entity for Vulcan Energy
                              Corporation, President and Chief Operating officer of Plains Exploration and Production
                              Company and Director of Development for Kinder Morgan, Inc. Mr. Raymond has been a direct
                              or indirect owner of PAA’s general partner since 2001 and served on the board of PAA’s general
                              partner from 2001 to 2005.
 “We welcome John Raymond back to the board and Ms. Sutil as a full participating
                              member of the board,” said Greg L. Armstrong, PAA’s Chairman and CEO. “We want to thank Geoff McKay for his diligent service on PAA’s board and look forward to our continued
                              association in his board observer role. We also express our appreciation to Art Smith for his
                              valuable contributions since joining PAA’s board in 1999 and we are pleased that we will have
                              the continued benefit of Art’s guidance and counsel through his new role as a member of the
                              board of PNG’s general partner.”
