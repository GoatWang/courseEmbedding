About microRNAs 
microRNAs are small RNA molecules, typically 20 to 25 nucleotides in length, that do not encode proteins but instead regulate gene expression. More than 800 microRNAs have been identified in the human genome, and over one-third of all human genes are believed to be regulated by microRNAs.  A single microRNA can regulate entire networks of genes. As such, these molecules are considered master regulators of the human genome.  microRNA expression, or function, has been shown to be significantly altered or dysregulated in many disease states, including oncology, fibrosis, metabolic diseases, immune-inflammatory diseases and HCV. Targeting microRNAs with anti-miRs, chemically modified, single-stranded oligonucleotides, offers a unique approach to treating disease by modulating entire biological pathways and may become a new and major class of drugs with broad therapeutic application.
About Regulus
Regulus Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:RGLS) is a biopharmaceutical company leading the discovery and development of innovative medicines targeting microRNAs. Regulus is uniquely positioned to leverage a mature therapeutic platform that harnesses the oligonucleotide drug discovery and development expertise of Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Isis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which founded the company.   Regulus has a well-balanced microRNA therapeutics pipeline, an emerging microRNA biomarkers platform to support its therapeutic programs, and a rich intellectual property estate to retain its leadership in the microRNA field.  Regulus intends to focus its proprietary efforts on developing microRNA therapeutics for oncology indications and orphan diseases and is currently advancing several programs toward clinical development in 
oncology, fibrosis and metabolic diseases.  Specifically, Regulus is developing RG-012, an anti-miR targeting microRNA-21 for the treatment of Alport syndrome, a life-threatening kidney disease driven by genetic mutations with no approved therapy, and RG-101, a GalNAc-conjugated anti-miR targeting microRNA-122 for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection.  Regulus' commitment to innovation and its leadership in the microRNA field have enabled the formation of strategic alliances with AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi and a research collaboration with Biogen Idec focused on microRNA biomarkers.  In addition, the Company has established Regulus microMarkers™, a research and development division focused on identifying microRNAs as biomarkers of human disease, which is designed to support its therapeutic pipeline, collaborators and strategic partners.

Grint, M.D. as Chief Executive OfficerBusiness WireMay 31, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareSAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--AmpliPhi Biosciences Corporation (NYSE MKT: APHB), a global leader in the development of therapies to treat drug-resistant infections using bacteriophage-based technology, announces the appointment of Paul C. Grint, M.D. as Chief Executive Officer, effective immediately. Dr. Grint has served on the Company’s board of directors since November 2015 and has more than two decades of executive leadership experience in biologics and small molecule development, including the successful development and commercialization of anti-infective products. M. Scott Salka has resigned as CEO and director of AmpliPhi, and will serve as a consultant to the Company during a transition period.Dr. Grint previously served as President and CEO of Regulus Therapeutics Inc., a publicly traded biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of microRNA therapeutics. Prior to Regulus, he was President of Cerexa, Inc., where he was involved with the development of a portfolio of antibiotics for multidrug-resistant infections including ceftaroline and ceftazidime/avibactam combination. He previously served in senior management roles at Forest Research Institute, Kalypsys, Inc., Pfizer Inc., IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation and Schering-Plough Corporation. Dr. Grint is a director of the private biotechnology companies Amplyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Synedgen, Inc. He received his bachelor’s degree from St. Mary’s Hospital in London and his medical degree from St. Bartholomew’s Hospital Medical College at the University of London. He is a Fellow of the Royal College of Pathologists, a member of numerous professional and medical societies, and the author or co-author of more than 50 scientific publications.“The board is delighted that Paul has agreed to take on the role of Chief Executive Officer at this critical time. His extensive experience in product development, clinical trials, drug approvals and anti-infectives will serve AmpliPhi well as our focus transitions to clinical development of phage therapies for patients with serious or life-threatening infections,” said Jeremy Curnock Cook, Chairman of AmpliPhi Biosciences. “The past 12 months have been transformative for AmpliPhi as our bacteriophage therapies have progressed through Phase 1 clinical trials. We have also shown the power of our phage-based approach to treat a critically ill patient with a multidrug-resistant (MDR) infection who faced death, being unresponsive to any commercially available antibiotic. On behalf of the board, I’d like to thank Scott for his many positive contributions to AmpliPhi over the past two years and wish him every success in his future endeavors.”Commenting on his new position, Dr. Grint said, “My passion for innovative science and commercializing therapies that make a difference drew me to AmpliPhi Biosciences as a director, and I am thrilled to be assuming executive leadership of this exciting company. Our phage technology is much-needed in today’s world of antibiotic resistance which, if left unchecked, is projected to result in significant loss of life. AmpliPhi has the opportunity to be a meaningful player in addressing this looming public health crisis.”About Antibiotic ResistanceDecades of misuse and over-use of antibiotics has led to the rise of multidrug-resistant and pan-resistant bacteria, commonly known as “superbugs.” These superbugs threaten to render existing antibiotic therapies useless, potentially thrusting the world into a “post-antibiotic” era where common infections may be life threatening. Hospitals regularly expose vulnerable patients to pathogenic bacteria. According to the World Health Organization, each year hundreds of millions of patients worldwide suffer from infections acquired in a hospital setting. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that drug-resistant bacteria cause at least 2 million infections per year in the U.S. alone, resulting in over 23,000 deaths and many more people die from other conditions that are complicated by antibiotic-resistant infections. The 2016 O’Neill Report commissioned by the UK government projects that the failure to respond to the threat of antibiotic resistance and the rise of superbugs could lead to an estimated 10 million deaths per year from antibiotic-resistant infections worldwide by 2050, with an accumulated global cost of $100 trillion and a 3.5% reduction in global GDP.Read MoreAbout BacteriophagesBacteriophages, or more simply “phages,” are the natural predators of bacteria and are thought to be the most abundant life form on earth. Over eons, phages have evolved an incredible diversity of specialist strains that typically prey upon just one strain of bacteria, enabling phage therapies to precisely target pathogenic bacteria while sparing the beneficial microbiota. Phages can infect and kill bacteria, whether they are antibiotic-resistant or not, and even when they have formed protective biofilms.About AmpliPhi BiosciencesAmpliPhi Biosciences Corporation is a biotechnology company pioneering the development of therapies for antibiotic-resistant infections using bacteriophage-based technology. In May 2017, AmpliPhi announced an additional near-term strategic emphasis on developing precisely targeted and personalized bacteriophage therapies for patients with serious or life-threatening antibiotic-resistant infections. AmpliPhi has reported results from two Phase 1 clinical trials of AB-SA01, one for the treatment of Staphylococcus aureus in chronic rhinosinusitis patients (safety and preliminary efficacy) and one to evaluate the safety of AB-SA01 when administered topically to the intact skin of healthy adults.AmpliPhi recently announced the completion of an underwritten public offering of common stock and common warrants resulting in net proceeds to AmpliPhi of approximately $9.1 million.More information is available at www.ampliphibio.com.Forward-Looking StatementsStatements in this press release that are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements about the potential use of bacteriophages to treat bacterial infections and other potential benefits of phage therapies, the Company’s personalized phage therapies strategy, including the expected benefits therefrom and the Company’s ability to develop targeted and personalized medicines for patients with serious or life-threatening antibiotic-resistant infections, the Company’s ability to advance its research and development programs through partnerships and/or non-dilutive funding, and the regulatory pathway for approval of phage therapies. Words such as “believe,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “expect,” “intend,” “will,” “may,” “goal,” “potential” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, though not all forward-looking statements necessarily contain these identifying words. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in these forward-looking statements are risks and uncertainties associated with AmpliPhi’s business and financial condition and the other risks and uncertainties described in AmpliPhi’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, as filed with the SEC. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this press release.

And Muslims' fears that Israel wants it for their own religious and national purposes are, unfortunately, well grounded.

Tel Aviv wants to wrest control of it back for Israel, because in Jewish religious traditions, the building of the 3rd Temple will herald the beginning of the Messianic age.

Israeli Prime Minister knew that the optics of the metal detectors and forbidding anyone under 50 to worship at Al Aqsa would be horrific; but in his characteristic hubris, he just didn't give a damn.

Through these actions, he may well have lit the flames for yet another intifada; then, he will use this violence as "the justification" to tighten down the screws against Palestinians even more than they are already.

I weep for all those dead and wounded, Jewish, Muslim, and Christian, and those who will die, and be wounded, on all sides; this is an absolute tragedy which could have been averted.

A violent response to these strictures for worshiping at Al Aqsa was precisely the outcome Netanyahu, and the Israeli government wanted to happen.Join the Conversation1 / 5524

Dr. Grint joined Regulus from Cerexa, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Forest Laboratories, Inc., where he served as President and was responsible for the oversight of anti-infective product development.  Prior to joining Cerexa, Inc., Dr. Grint served as Senior Vice President of Research at Forest Research Institute, Inc., Chief Medical Officer at Kalypsys, Inc., and Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer at Zephyr Sciences, Inc., and he also served in similar executive level positions at Pfizer Inc., IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation, and Schering-Plough Corporation.  Dr. Grint received his bachelor's degree from St. Mary's Hospital in London and his medical degree from St. Bartholomew's Hospital Medical College at the University of London.  Dr. Grint is a Fellow of the Royal College of Pathologists, a member of numerous professional and medical societies, and the author or co-author of over fifty scientific publications.
"The discovery of microRNAs in humans is one of the most exciting scientific developments in recent history and I believe that microRNA therapeutics will be a major class of new medicines with broad therapeutic application in many important diseases," said Paul C. Grint, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Regulus.  "I am extremely excited about the clinical potential of targeting microRNAs – the ability to regulate entire pathways by controlling the translation of clusters of genes in disease pathways may prove to be a very powerful way to treat many complex diseases.  To date, Regulus has made tremendous progress in advancing its technology platform and I look forward to working with the accomplished Regulus team to build a meaningful clinical portfolio based on microRNAs."    
About microRNAs 
microRNAs are small RNA molecules, typically 20 to 25 nucleotides in length, that do not encode proteins but instead regulate gene expression. More than 800 microRNAs have been identified in the human genome, and over one-third of all human genes are believed to be regulated by microRNAs.  A single microRNA can regulate entire networks of genes. As such, these molecules are considered master regulators of the human genome.  microRNA expression, or function, has been shown to be significantly altered or dysregulated in many disease states, including oncology, fibrosis, metabolic diseases, immune-inflammatory diseases and HCV. Targeting microRNAs with anti-miRs, chemically modified, single-stranded oligonucleotides, offers a unique approach to treating disease by modulating entire biological pathways and may become a new and major class of drugs with broad therapeutic application.
About Regulus
Regulus Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:  RGLS) is a biopharmaceutical company leading the discovery and development of innovative medicines targeting microRNAs. Regulus is uniquely positioned to leverage a mature therapeutic platform that harnesses the oligonucleotide drug discovery and development expertise of Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Isis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which founded the company.   Regulus has a well-balanced microRNA therapeutics pipeline, an emerging microRNA biomarkers platform to support its therapeutic programs, and a rich intellectual property estate to retain its leadership in the microRNA field.  Regulus intends to focus its proprietary efforts on developing microRNA therapeutics for oncology indications and orphan diseases and is currently advancing several programs toward clinical development in oncology, fibrosis and metabolic diseases.  Specifically, Regulus is developing RG-012, an anti-miR targeting microRNA-21 for the treatment of Alport syndrome, a life-threatening kidney disease driven by genetic mutations with no approved therapy, and RG-101, a GalNAc-conjugated anti-miR targeting microRNA-122 for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection.  Regulus' commitment to innovation and its leadership in the microRNA field have enabled the formation of strategic alliances with AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi and a research collaboration with Biogen Idec focused on microRNA biomarkers.  In addition, the Company has established Regulus microMarkers™, a research and development division focused on identifying microRNAs as biomarkers of human disease, which is designed to support its therapeutic pipeline, collaborators and strategic partners.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/23/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

SAN DIEGO, May 24, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Amplyx Pharmaceuticals today announced the appointment of Paul C. Grint, M.D., to its Board of Directors. Dr. Grint, president and CEO, Regulus Therapeutics, joined Regulus in June 2014 as Chief Medical Officer.  Dr. Grint has over two decades of experience in biologics and small molecule development, including the successful commercialization of products in oncology, anti-infectives and immunology therapeutic areas. 








"Paul is an essential new addition to our Board of Directors, with his wealth of experience in drug development in the anti-infectives space," said Mike Grey, President and CEO of Amplyx Pharmaceuticals. "His insights will be invaluable as we move APX001 into clinical development studying serious fungal infections caused by Candida and Aspergillus, as well as rare, difficult-to-treat molds." 
APX001 is a novel small molecule with a unique mechanism of action. In preclinical studies, the compound showed broad-spectrum activity against infections caused by common species of Candida and Aspergillus, as well as good activity against rare molds. Patients with compromised immune systems due to chemotherapy or other immune-compromising medical treatments are susceptible to these potentially deadly fungal infections. Amplyx is developing both IV and oral formulations of APX001 to address the need for hospital administration, as well as continued dosage after hospital discharge.
"Amplyx has a great combination of a seasoned, successful management team, and a promising drug candidate in a space where there is significant unmet medical need," said Dr. Grint. "It is a pleasure to work with the Amplyx team, and I look forward to advising on clinical development and possible future commercialization of APX001 through my board position." 
About Amplyx PharmaceuticalsAmplyx Pharmaceuticals is developing novel, broad-spectrum antifungal agents for the treatment of life-threatening fungal infections. The company's lead compound, APX001, is expected to enter clinical development in 2016 and has shown broad-spectrum activity in animal models of invasive fungal infection by common species of Candida and Aspergillus, as well as high potency against rare, difficult-to-treat molds. Amplyx has raised $51.5 million in venture capital and received more than $10 million in grants from the National Institutes of Health to support its drug discovery and development efforts. The company's research operations are located at Johnson & Johnson Innovation, JLABS in San Diego, Calif.
