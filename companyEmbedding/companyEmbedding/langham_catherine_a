LEADERSHIPMeet the team


In business since 1988, we have built extraordinary relationships with tens of thousands of people. We are not a company doing great things for other companies; instead we are a team of people providing a great connection between other people and products.
Langham’s people, though, do something else. Our people absorb the tension of callers who have an emergency shipment. Our team solves problems, sometimes in such heroic fashion as to schedule an emergency flight to save the life of a patient awaiting a small vial of an experimental drug. Our people awaken in the middle of the night to respond to a flight delay, so our customers can keep on sleeping.

Catherine A. Langham - Conexus Indiana


























































Board Member
Catherine A. Langham
President, Langham Logistics, Inc.




Co-founder of global logistics firm Langham Logistics, Inc., Cathy Langham focuses on business development, fast-growth strategy, and critical industry issues such as cargo security. She provides her 20+ years of logistics expertise to business leaders in a wide spectrum of industries, including pharmaceutical, food & beverage, automotive, and other industries with complex supply chains.
Prior to launching the company that bears her family name, she was a two-time franchise owner in the transportation industry. She founded Langham with her sister Margaret and their brother John, both of whom continue to be involved in the organization with her. Langham’s third-party logistics company, now 18 years old, has charted double digit growth, expanded its client base around the world, and has grown to over 80 full-time employees.
As a result of her firm’s experience and results, Cathy champions the financial virtues of inbound freight management. Langham argues that most corporations with complex supply chains battle with margin erosion that can be improved inside of the inbound transportation segment of the supply chain.
Langham’s visibility as CEO of a fast-growing woman-owned business enterprise (WBE) earned her firm a visit from U.S. President George W. Bush. In 2005, she accepted a role on the Indiana Economic Development Corporation at the invitation of Governor Mitch Daniels.
Since 9/11, Cathy has taken an increased role in her industry’s discussion of air cargo security, in particular the proactive role that indirect air carriers are taking to keep terrorism out of the sky. She speaks regularly on topics that include entrepreneurial success, small business strategy, and leadership.
As President and CEO, Cathy invests her time three ways: She devotes one-third to clients and prospects, including many Fortune 500 companies. She spends another third with city, state and national business leaders, tackling topics that include economic development, air cargo security, and business growth. She spends the final third of her time working in the day-to-day business, as well as the strategic level in her company.
Cathy is former Chair of the Air Forwarders Association and serves as the Chairperson of the Greater Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce this year.
