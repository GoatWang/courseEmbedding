                                10-position all-numeric identification number assigned by the NPS to uniquely identify a health care provider.

                                Code describing the type of health care provider that is being assigned an NPI. Codes are:

1 = (Person): individual human being who furnishes health care;
2 = (Non-person): entity other than an individual human being that furnishes health care (for example, hospital, SNF, hospital subunit, pharmacy, or HMO).





                                Is Organization Subpart
                            

                                N
                            

                                The "Is the organization a subpart?" question must be answered. If the organization is a subpart, the Parent Organization Legal Business Name (LBN) and Parent Organization Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) fields must be completed. The Parent Organization LBN and TIN fields can only be completed if the answer to the subpart question is Yes.
Many organization health care providers who apply for NPIs are not legal entities themselves but are parts of other organization health care providers that are legal entities (the "parents"). 
Here are three examples of organization health care providers that may be considered subparts and may apply for NPIs if so directed by their "parents": 
(1) The psychiatric unit in a hospital is not a legal entity but is part of the hospital (the "parent"), which is a legal entity. The legal entity must obtain an NPI. The psychiatric unit is an example of a subpart that could have its own NPI if the hospital determines that it should. 
(2) A group practice that is not a sole proprietorship has a main location and could have other offices in different locations, but each office is not a separate legal entity; instead, each office is part of the corporation (the "parent") which is a legal entity. The offices are examples of subparts that could have their own NPIs if the main location determines that they should. 
(3) A pharmacy fills prescriptions for patients whose physicians have prescribed medications for them and may also rent or sell durable medical equipment to patients whose physicians have ordered such equipment for them. Neither the pharmacy line of business nor the DME line of business represent legal entities; instead, both lines of business are part of an organization (the "parent") that is a legal entity. Each line of business represents a different Healthcare Provider Taxonomy or area of specialization that often submits its own electronic claims to health plans. 
The "parent"-we don't know who the parent is in this example-must ensure that each subpart that submits its own claims to health plans has its own NPI.

A field cannot contain all special characters.

NPI Data Monitoring




NPI Monitoring


Did you know that the publicly downloadable NPI database that is used by many websites can be updated on a weekly basis?
Did you know that each NPI record has 329 data items?

Our FREE NPI Monitoring service (up to 2 records) will email you when anything has been modified, added or deleted in any of the 329 data items of all NPI records you want to monitor.
In addition to an emailed notification, if you want a detailed report of what has changed in an NPI record that will let you compare the previous version of the data as well as the current state, you can purchase our NPI Monitoring services.

Remember: This free service will email you when anything has been modified, added or deleted from the selected record but we will not tell you exactly what is different between the current state of NPI 1093794497 and the previous version.

Our subscription service will monitor for you the NPI database and alert you if the data for NPI 1437407681 has been changed and quickly show you exactly what has changed compared to the previous version of the data for the duration of your subscription.

					Some organization health care providers are made up of components that furnish different types of health care or have separate physical locations where health care is furnished. These components and physical locations are not themselves legal entities, but are part of the organization health care provider (which is a legal entity).
					A covered organization provider may decide that its subparts (if it has any) should have their own NPI numbers. If a subpart conducts any HIPAA standard transactions on its own (e.g., separately from its parent), it must obtain its own NPI number.

DefaultShowing 3 ReportLinker reviewsGraeme Y.Review SourceGraeme Y.Validated ReviewReview SourceUnusual to find such good customer service.... would recommendUpdated On June 30, 2017Validated ReviewWhat do you like best?Response to email enquiry-customer care was excellent and not what I expectedWhat do you dislike?That the report linker site only provided broad overview information when It seemed to promise something more specific and tailored. I was unable to preview before I bought the service however once I had paid I was unable to find anything remotely like the search engne had promised. I felt very let down particularly as I had spoken to eport link staff and tried to get a preview. I actually felt a bit duped. My enquiry was followed up and what happened to my request was very unusual, someone actually LISTENED and TOOK OWNERSHIP, I really did not expect this and had written off the fee as a bad experience. I then received a further emaila dn offer to assist. when the member of staff was unable to I was offered a refund. That is going ABOVE and BEYOND. Very well done to REPORT LINKER, this is far better thatn I expected and my respect for your service has been turned aroundRead MoreShare on0 of 0 found this helpful.Helpful?YesNoResponse from Chloé Jacquet of ReportLinkereditDear Graeme,Thank you very much for your comment. I just would like to bring some clarification about our service.
