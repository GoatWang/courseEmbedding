DENVER, CO, March 13, 2015 /CNW/ - Resource Capital Fund IV L.P. ("RCF IV") and Resource Capital Fund V L.P. ("RCF V") are pleased to announce that they have completed a previously announced transaction to refinance all of First Nickel Inc.'s ("First Nickel") outstanding debt obligations (the "Debt Refinancing"), effective March 12, 2015. Pursuant to the Debt Refinancing, RCF IV has acquired in aggregate 624,150,000 common shares of First Nickel in full satisfaction of First Nickel's outstanding obligations under a US$10 million convertible loan facility with RCF IV, which represents a per common share issue price of C$0.02 and a USD – CAD exchange rate of 1:1.2483. 
Additionally, under the Debt Refinancing the principal amount of an existing term loan with RCF V was increased to US$15.5 million (the "RCF V Loan"), and the principal amount of the an existing term loan with West Face Long Term Opportunities Global Master L.P. ("West Face") was increased to US$12.5 million (the "West Face Loan"). The maturity date for both the RCF V Loan and the West Face Loan were extended to December 30, 2016. In connection with the Debt Refinancing, RCF V also received 240,000,000 warrants with an exercise price of C$0.02 per share and an expiry date of December 30, 2016. 
Certain proceeds from the RCF V Loan and the West Face Loan were used to pay out the outstanding balance under a US$18 million revolving credit facility (the "BNS Facility") between First Nickel and The Bank of Nova Scotia. The BNS Facility was subsequently terminated.
RCF IV and RCF V (collectively, "RCF") are under common management by RCF Management LLC. Prior to the Debt Refinancing, RCF owned and controlled 267,059,730 common shares and 50,000,000 warrants with an exercise price of C$0.05 per share, representing approximately 38.1% of the outstanding common shares of First Nickel on an undiluted basis, and approximately 38.2% on a fully diluted basis. RCF now holds an aggregate of approximately 67.2% of the outstanding common shares of First Nickel on an undiluted basis, and approximately 62.5% on a fully diluted basis. 
The securities issued in connection with the Debt Refinancing were acquired for investment purposes. RCF will evaluate its investment in First Nickel from time to time and may, based on such evaluation of market conditions and other circumstances, increase or decrease its shareholdings in First Nickel as circumstances require.
For further information and to obtain a copy of the revised early warning report filed under applicable Canadian securities laws in connection with the transactions hereunder, please see First Nickel's profile on the SEDAR website www.sedar.com or contact:

Resource Capital Fund V L.P. Acquires Shares of First Nickel Inc.

Jan 21, 2013, 16:31 ET
		  		  						
						 from   Resource Capital Fund V L.P. 











 
















































 

 




















 



DENVER, Jan. 21, 2013 /CNW/ - Resource Capital Fund V L.P. ("RCF V") reports that it has entered into a US$5 million loan facility (the "Facility") with First Nickel Inc. ("First Nickel") and acquired 2,495,840 common shares of First Nickel ("Common Shares") as payment of an establishment fee for the Facility. The Facility is
 not convertible into Common Shares. If RCF V elects to receive all of
 the interest due under the Facility over the full term as Common
 Shares, RCF will acquire additional Common Shares valued at
 approximately $600,000, to be priced based on the volume weighted
 average market price for the five days prior to the date the payment is
 due. 


As a result of the transaction noted above, Resource Capital Fund IV
 L.P. ("RCF IV") and RCF V, affiliated entities by way of a common management company
 (RCF Management LLC), will, on a combined basis, own 137,407,846 Common
 Shares, representing approximately 26.2% of the issued and outstanding
 Common Shares of First Nickel and 39.0% on a fully diluted basis
 (assuming conversion of an existing convertible loan between RCF IV and
 First Nickel and exercise of their outstanding warrants, but no
 exercise of any other outstanding securities of First Nickel or payment
 of interest in Common Shares under any loan facility).


The securities were acquired for investment purposes. RCF IV and RCF V
 will evaluate their investment in First Nickel from time to time and
 may, based on such evaluation of market conditions and other
 circumstances, increase or decrease shareholdings in First Nickel as
 circumstances require.


For further information and to obtain a copy of the early warning report
 filed under applicable Canadian securities laws in connection with the
 transactions hereunder, please see First Nickel's profile on the SEDAR
 website www.sedar.com.
