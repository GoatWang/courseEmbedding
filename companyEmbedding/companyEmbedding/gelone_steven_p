Vicuron Pharmaceuticals Inc. is beefing up its management team in anticipation of launching its first product.
Last week, the King of Prussia biopharmaceutical company appointed Jennifer D. Copeland and Steven P. Gelone as senior directors to establish and lead its medical science liaison field force.




 


Copeland and Gelone will be responsible for building and deploying a sales team that will lay the groundwork for the anticipated launch of the company's experimental antifungal agent, Anidulafungin, by conducting physician outreach, medical education and opinion leader development. Gelone will oversee the team in the eastern region of the country, while Copeland will manage the company's western region.
George F. Horner III, Vicuron's president and CEO, said Gelone and Copeland have nearly 30 years of complementary anti-infective research, medical education, training and field force experience.
Horner said he believes the pair's industry knowledge and relationships with key opinion leaders in the company's target markets will enhance the "early adoption and acceptance" of Anidulafungin.
Prior to joining Vicuron, Gelone spent 12 years at Temple University where he worked in anti-infective education, clinical research and patient management. He most recently served as associate professor of pharmacy and assistant professor of medicine, specializing in infectious disease.
Copeland spent more than 13 years at Abbott Laboratories, where she held a variety of posts, including senior manager of medical liaisons for the company's anti-infective franchise. Before joining Abbott, Copeland served as director of medical affairs for the American Cancer Society's Texas division.





Vicuron filed a new drug application for Anidulafungin last year.
The company's other lead product is Dalbavancin, an intravenous antibiotic designed to treat serious Gram-positive infections. Dalbavancin is being tested in phase-III clinical trials.
  New Institute
The Pennsylvania Biotechnology Association launched what it is calling "The Life Sciences Human Capital Institute" to provide programs, research and other resources for chief human resource officers at biotech, pharmaceutical and medical device companies.
In emerging biotechnology companies, association officials said, the executive serving in such a capacity could be the CEO, CFO, general counsel or director of human resources. In larger and more mature companies, the person is typically a senior human resources executive.

Fritz Bittenbender, president of PA Biotech, said the institute will focus its efforts on programs that attract, develop and retain employees for Pennsylvania's life sciences industry, which currently employs more than 66,000 people. Pennsylvania ranks second nationally in pharmaceutical employment, third in biotechnology employment and fourth in medical device employment, according to Bittenbender.
Programs will focus on such areas as organizational values and culture; leadership behaviors and competencies; organizational capabilities; staffing; performance management and rewards; development; succession and transition management; and retention.
"Savvy CEOs are recognizing that without the right work force strategies, it may be impossible to maximize the potential of either their technology or their financial capital," said Dr. David U'Prichard, PA Biotech's chairman.
  New and improved




 


CollaGenex Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Newtown started enrolling patients in a phase-III study testing the effectiveness of Periostat MR for the treatment of adult periodontitis.
Periostat MR is a once-daily formulation of Periostat, the company's lead product, which was approved in 1998 for the treatment of adult periodontitis. More than 3 million prescriptions have been filled for Periostat since its launch.
CollaGenex developed Periostat MR through its partnership with Shire Laboratories, a Maryland-based division of Shire Pharmaceuticals -- a British company that recently announced plans to build its U.S. headquarters at the Chesterbrook Corporate Center in Tredyffrin.
The drug study will involve more than 200 patients. Among the physicians participating in the clinical trial is Alan Polson of the University of Pennsylvania.
Colin Stewart, president and CEO of CollaGenex, said the company anticipates completing its Periostat MR study and seeking approval for the drug in 2005. He said the company expects to get FDA approval and launch the drug's new version in 2006.
  Lab notes
Auxilium Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Norristown, and Paris-based Ipsen entered into a license and distribution agreement for the marketing of Auxilium's Testim testosterone gel. Testim is used to normalize low levels of testosterone in men with hypogonadism, a condition that causes a man's body to produce inadequate amounts of testosterone. Under the terms of the agreement, Ipsen will receive marketing and distribution rights in all countries except the United States, Canada, Mexico and Japan. Auxilium will receive a combination of milestone and royalty payments. Financial details of the arrangement were not disclosed. Testim was developed by Auxilium using a proprietary technology licensed from Bentley Pharmaceuticals Inc. It was launched in the United States in 2003 ... The FDA has accepted Malvern-based Centocor Inc.'s filing of a supplemental biologics license application for Remicade as a first-line therapy, in combination with methotrexate, for rheumatoid arthritis patients. The Remicade and methotrexate combination already has FDA approval as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis in patients who don't respond to methotrexate alone. Remicade also is approved as a treatment for Crohn's disease.

AbstractOBJECTIVETo briefly discuss the changing epidemiology of fungal infections and review currently available agents; provide a review of caspofungin; and discuss its pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, dosing guidelines, safety and efficacy, and role in the treatment of invasive fungal infections as it relates to current antifungal therapy.DATA SOURCESA MEDLINE (1966 to August 2002) database search using key words caspofungin, echino candins, fungal infections, and invasive aspergillosis, was completed to identify relevant articles including reviews, recent studies, treatment guidelines, and data from Merck and Company.STUDY SELECTIONIn vitro studies and all clinical trials were evaluated to summarize the clinical efficacy and safety of caspofungin.DATA SYNTHESISThe incidence of fungal infections is increasing as the population at risk expands. Cost, resistance, and morbidity and mortality are key issues. Adding to the antifungal armamentarium is necessary to address these therapeutic dilemmas. Caspofungin is the first member of a new class of antifungal agents, the echinocandins, to be approved for clinical use. Caspofungin is classified as a glucan synthase inhibitor and represents a class of agents with a novel mechanism of action. Unlike currently available agents (polyenes, pyrimidines, azoles) that exert their effect on the fungal cell membrane, the echinocandins are the first agents to inhibit fungal cell wall synthesis. Caspofungin exhibits activity against Aspergillus spp. and Candida spp., including non-albicans species. Data from clinical trials demonstrate that caspofungin is effective in patients with invasive aspergillosis as well as candida esophagitis. Its Food and Drug Administration–approved indication is limited to invasive aspergillosis refractory to or intolerant of current therapy.CONCLUSIONSCaspofungin has activity against Aspergillus spp. as well as a variety of Candida spp. Clinical data support its usefulness in the treatment of invasive aspergillosis and select candida infections. As additional clinical data become available, it seems likely that the therapeutic role of caspofungin will expand.THIS ARTICLE IS APPROVED FOR CONTINUING EDUCATION CREDIT ACPE UNIVERSAL PROGRAM NUMBER: 407-000-03-001-H01OBJETIVOSe discute brevemente el cambio epidemiológico creciente de infecciones fúngicas y se repasa los agentes actualmente disponibles para el tratamiento de estas infecciones difíciles. También se provee un repaso de caspofungin y se discute su farmacología, farmacocinética, guías de dosificación, seguridad, e eficacia clínica y su rol en el tratamiento de infecciones fúngicas invasores y su relación a otras terapias antifúngicas actuales.FUENTES DE DATOSSe realizó una búsqueda en el banco de datos de MEDLINE para identificar artículos relevantes como repasos, estudios recientes, guías de tratamiento, y datos de la compañía manufacturera Merck & Co.SELECIÓN DE ESTUDIOSSe utilizo estudios in vitro y ensayos clínicos para resumir la eficacia clínica y la seguridad de caspofungin.EXTRACCIÓN DE DATOSSe repaso todos los estudios clínicos disponibles.SÍNTESIS DE DATOSLa incidencia de infecciones fungicidas está aumentando mientras que la población a riesgo también continua ampliándose. El costo, la resistencia, y la morbilidad y mortalidad son factores claves que están asociados a esta enfermedad. Para poder tratar estos dilemas terapéuticos, es necesario que se añada al escenario de agentes antifúngales. Caspofungin es el primer miembro de una clase de agentes antifúngicos, llamados equinocandinas, que fue aprobado para uso clínico. Caspofungin está clasificado como un fármaco inhibidor de la síntesis de glucano y representa una clase de agentes con un mecanismo de acción nueva. A diferencia a los agentes actualmente disponibles (polienos, pirimidinas, azoles) que ejercen sus efectos en la pared celular del hongo, los equinocandinas son los primeros agentes que inhiben la síntesis de la pared celular del hongo. Caspofungin tiene actividad contra aspergillus y cándida, incluyendo especies que no son albicans. Datos de los ensayos clinicos demuestran que caspofungin es efectivo en pacientes con aspergilosis invasora así como candidiasis esofágica. La FDA ha aprobado su uso límite a la aspergilosis invasiva en pacientes que no responden o no toleran terapias antifúngicas tradicionales actuales.CONCLUSIONESCaspofungin tiene actividad contra especies de aspergillus así como una variedad de especies de Cándida. Los datos clínicos apoyan su utilidad en el tratamiento contra la aspergilosis invasora y en infecciones selectas de cándida. Parece que el rol terapéutico de caspofungin pueda expandir cuando resultados de estudios clínicos adicionales estén disponibles.OBJECTIFDécrire brièvement l'épidémiologie des infections fongiques, revoir les agents actuellement disponibles pour leur traitement et faire une revue des données disponibles sur la caspofongine (Cancidas) concernant la pharmacologie du médicament, la pharmacocinétique, la posologie recommandée, l'innocuité, et l'efficacité ainsi que son rôle dans le traitement des infections fongiques invasives par comparaison à la thérapie antifongique actuelle.REVUE DE LITTÉRATUREUne recherche informatisée dans la banque de données MEDLINE a été faite afin d'identifier les articles pertinents incluant les articles de revue, les études les plus récentes, les lignes directrices de traitement, et des données fournies par le fabricant, Merck.SÉLECTION DES ÉTUDESLes études in vitro et les études cliniques ont été retenues pour évaluer l'efficacité clinique et l'innocuité de la caspofongine.SÉLECTION DE L'INFORMATIONToutes les études cliniques disponibles ont été analysées.RÉSUMÉL'incidence des infections fongiques augmente parallèlement à l'expansion de la population à risque. Les coûts, la résistance, la morbidité, et la mortalité liés à ces infections sont des aspects cruciaux à analyser. Des armes nouvelles pour lutter contre ces infections sont nécessaires pour contrôler ce défi thérapeutique. La caspofongine est le premier agent d'une nouvelle classe d'antifongiques, les échinocandines, à avoir été approuvé pour une utilisation clinique. La caspofongine est un inhibiteur de la synthèse des glucanes et représente une classe d'agents possédant un nouveau mécanisme d'action. Contrairement aux agents actuellement disponibles (polyènes, pyrimidines, azoles) qui exercent leur action sur la membrane cellulaire du champignon, les échinocandines sont les premiers agents qui inhibent la synthèse de la β(1,3)-D -glucane, un composant de la paroi cellulaire des champignons. La caspofongine est active contre les espèces d'aspergillus et de candida, incluant les espèces non albicans. Les données issues des études cliniques montrent que la caspofongine est efficace lors d'aspergillose invasive aussi bien que lors d'œsophagite à candida. L'indication approuvée par la FDA se limite à l'aspergillose réfractaire à la thérapie conventionnelle ou lors d'intolérance.CONCLUSIONSLa caspofongine possède une activité contre les espèces d'aspergillus et contre une variété d'espèces de Candida. Les données cliniques supportent son utilité dans le traitement de l'aspergillose invasive et dans certaines infections à candida. Dès que les données seront disponibles, il est à prévoir que le rôle de cet agent dans la thérapie antifongique sera plus grand.ReferencesSection:ChooseTop of pageAbstractEpidemiologyCurrently Available Agent...ChemistryMechanism of ActionSpectrum of ActivityPharmacokineticsDrug InteractionsEfficacySafetyApproved Indication and D...Place in TherapyCost ConsiderationSummaryReferences <<CITING ARTICLES1.
