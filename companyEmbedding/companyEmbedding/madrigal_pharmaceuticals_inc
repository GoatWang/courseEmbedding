Company Overview
Madrigal Pharmaceuticals is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company pursuing novel therapeutics that target a specific thyroid hormone pathway in the liver, which is a key regulatory mechanism common to a spectrum of cardio-metabolic and fatty liver diseases with high unmet medical need.
The Company is developing MGL-3196, the first orally administered, small-molecule, liver-directed, truly β-selective thyroid hormone receptor (THR) agonist. In preclinical and Phase 1 studies, MGL-3196 has demonstrated a broad array of therapeutically beneficial effects, improving components of both metabolic syndrome, such as insulin resistance and dyslipidemia, and fatty liver disease, including lipotoxicity and inflammation.
Based on this initial evidence of broad activity and a favorable safety profile, Madrigal has initiated Phase 2 clinical trials of MGL-3196 for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and familial hypercholesterolemia (FH).

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  The consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read together with our audited financial statements and accompanying notes for year ended December 31, 2016 and the related Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, both of which are included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. Operating results are not necessarily indicative of results that may occur for the full fiscal year or any other future period.  Overview  We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapeutic candidates for the treatment of cardiovascular, metabolic and liver diseases. Our lead product candidate, MGL-3196, is a proprietary, liver-directed, selective thyroid hormone receptor- �, or THR-�, agonist that can potentially be used to treat a number of disease states with high unmet medical need. We are developing MGL-3196 for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, and we have initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial in this indication. We are also developing MGL-3196 for dyslipidemia, particularly genetic dyslipidemias such as familial hypercholesterolemia, or FH, including both homozygous and heterozygous forms of the disease. We have initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial in heterozygous FH (HeFH) patients and we are planning to conduct a proof-of-concept clinical trial in homozygous FH (HoFH) patients. MGL-3196 is a once-daily oral pill that has been studied in four completed Phase 1 trials in a total of 129 subjects. MGL-3196 appeared to be safe and well-tolerated in these trials, which included a single ascending dose trial, a multiple ascending dose trial, and two drug interaction trials with statins.  Basis of Presentation  Research and Development Expenses  Research and development expenses primarily consist of costs associated with our research activities, including the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates. We expense our research and development expenses as incurred. We contract with clinical research organizations to manage our clinical trials under agreed upon budgets for each study, with oversight by our clinical program managers. We account for nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities as expenses when the service has been performed or when the goods have been received. Manufacturing expense includes costs associated with drug formulation development and drug production. We do not track employee and facility related research and development costs by project, as we typically use our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple research and development programs. We believe that the allocation of such costs would be arbitrary and not be meaningful.  Our research and development expenses consist primarily of:  * external expenses paid to clinical trial sites, contract research organizations, laboratories, database software and consultants that conduct clinical trials;  * expenses related to development and production of nonclinical and clinical trial supplies, including fees paid to contract manufacturers;  * expenses related to preclinical studies;  * expenses related to compliance with drug development regulatory requirements; and  * other allocated expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for depreciation of equipment and other supplies.  We expect to continue to incur substantial expenses related to our development activities for the foreseeable future as we conduct our Phase 2 clinical program, manufacturing and toxicology studies. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials, additional drug manufacturing requirements, and later stage toxicology studies such as carcinogenicity studies. Our research and development expenses increased between 2016 and 2017, and we  Table of Contents  expect that our research and development expenses will increase substantially in the future. The process of conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time consuming. The probability of success for each product candidate is affected by numerous factors, including preclinical data, clinical data, competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability. Accordingly, we may never succeed in achieving marketing approval for any of our product candidates.  Completion dates and costs for our clinical development programs as well as our research program can vary significantly for each current and future product candidate and are difficult to predict. As a result, we cannot estimate with any degree of certainty the costs we will incur in connection with the development of our product candidates at this point in time. We expect that we will make determinations as to which programs and product candidates to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program and product candidate on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific success of early research programs, results of ongoing and future clinical trials, our ability to enter into collaborative agreements with respect to programs or potential product candidates, as well as ongoing assessments as to each current or future product candidate's commercial potential.  General and Administrative Expenses  General and administrative expenses consist primarily of management costs, costs associated with obtaining and maintaining our patent portfolio, professional fees for accounting, auditing, consulting and legal services, and allocated overhead expenses.  We expect that our general and administrative expenses may increase in the future as we expand our operating activities, maintain and expand our patent portfolio and incur additional costs associated with being a public company and maintaining compliance with exchange listing and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, requirements. We expect these potential increases will likely include management costs, legal fees, accounting fees, directors' and officers' liability insurance premiums and expenses associated with investor relations.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  Our management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to accrued research and development expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. There have been no significant and material changes in our critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates during the three months ended March 31, 2017, as compared to those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 filed with the SEC on March 31, 2017.  Results of Operations  Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 Compared with Three Months Ended March 31, 2016  Revenues  We had no revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016.  Table of Contents  The following table provides comparative unaudited results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016:   Three Months Ended March 31, Increase / Decrease 2017 2016 $ % (dollars in thousands) Research and Development Expenses $ 4,380 $ 516 3,864 749 % General and Administrative Expenses 1,695 222 1,473 664 % Interest Expense (Income) (76 ) 975 (1,051 ) (108 )% $ 5,999 $ 1,713 4,286 250 %  Research and Development Expenses  Our research and development expenses were $4.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to $0.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Research and development expenses increased in 2017 due primarily to the expenses incurred to conduct and support the two Phase 2 studies for MGL-3196, which commenced in the fourth quarter of 2016 and the first quarter of 2017, respectively. Our increased research and development expenses include a $2.1 million increase in contract research organization costs directly associated with the two Phase 2 studies. These increases also include $0.6 million in compensation expense related to employee hiring that occurred upon and following the consummation of the Merger. We expect our research and development expenses to increase over time as we advance our clinical and preclinical development programs for MGL-3196.  General and Administrative Expenses  Our general and administrative expenses were $1.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to $0.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase in general and administrative expenses in 2017 was primarily due to a $0.9 million increase in compensation expense related to employee hiring that occurred upon and following consummation of the Merger. Additional increases were a result of expenses related to operating a public company. We believe our general and administrative expenses may increase over time as we advance our technology into clinical programs and as a result of our obligations as a public reporting company, both of which will likely result in an increase in our headcount, consulting services and certain overhead needed to support those efforts.  Interest Expense and Income  Our net interest income was approximately $0.1 million, and our net interest expense was $1.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to the conversion of all outstanding promissory notes to equity upon the consummation of the Merger.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  As of March 31, 2017, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $40.1 million. To date, we have funded our operations primarily through the issuance of convertible debt, the proceeds from the Merger, and proceeds from sales of our common stock under our at-the market issuance agreement with Cowen and Company, LLC, or the ATM Program. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2017 will be sufficient to fund our operations past one year from the issuance of these financial statements.  Table of Contents  Our primary uses of capital are, and we expect will continue to be, funding our research efforts and the development of our product candidates, compensation and related expenses, hiring additional staff, including clinical, scientific, operational, financial and management personnel, and costs associated with operating as a public company. We expect to incur substantial expenditures in the foreseeable future for the development and potential commercialization of our product candidates.  We plan to continue to fund losses from operations and capital funding needs through future equity and/or debt financings, as well as potential additional collaborations or strategic partnerships with other companies. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt could result in additional dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in debt service obligations and could result in operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations. We can provide no assurance that financing will be available in the amounts we need or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are not able to secure adequate additional funding, we may be forced to delay, make reductions in spending, extend payment terms with suppliers, liquidate assets where possible, and/or suspend or curtail planned programs. Any of these actions could materially harm our business.  Cash Flows The following table provides a summary of our net cash flow activity: Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 (dollars in thousands) Net cash used in operating activities $ (3,771 ) $ (438 ) Net cash used by investing activities (10,558 ) - Net cash provided by financing activities 3,399 750 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (10,930 ) $ 312  Net cash used in operating activities was $3.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to $0.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016.

Madrigal Pharmaceuticals and Tarveda Therapeutics Announce Exclusive License Agreement for HSP90 Drug Conjugate Oncology Platform




















September 19, 2016 07:30 ET

 | Source: Madrigal Pharmaceuticals, Inc.






- PEN-866 positioned to begin clinical trials in 2017 – - Total potential payments to Madrigal may exceed $249 Million – CONSHOHOCKEN, Pa. and WATERTOWN, Mass., Sept.  19, 2016  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  Madrigal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDGL) and Tarveda Therapeutics, Inc. today announced an exclusive worldwide license agreement providing for the discovery, development and commercialization by Tarveda of products based on Madrigal’s HSP90 Drug Conjugate program, including the lead clinical candidate, PEN-866. Madrigal is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapeutic candidates for the treatment of cardiovascular, metabolic and liver diseases, and Tarveda Therapeutics, Inc., is a biopharmaceutical company discovering and developing Pentarins™ as a new class of targeted anti-cancer medicines to advance the treatment of patients with solid tumors. HSP90 drug conjugates are designed to increase cancer cell killing while reducing collateral damage to normal cells and overcome the challenges of current chemotherapies and other payloads, which are commonly limited by insufficient drug exposure in the tumor and/or systemic toxicities. HSP90 drug conjugates are small-molecule conjugates consisting of an HSP90 targeting molecule joined to an anti-cancer payload via a linker that is optimized for controlled release of the payload inside cancer cells. The conjugate’s sustained anti-tumor effect comes from selectively accumulating and retaining the conjugate and, importantly, its potent payload in tumors. HSP90 drug conjugates contrast with previous HSP90 inhibitors that were designed to only inhibit HSP90. Madrigal acquired the drug conjugate platform via its recent merger with Synta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. The lead HSP90 drug conjugate, PEN-866, is a small-molecule drug conjugate that comprises an HSP90 ligand conjugated to SN-38, the highly-potent, active metabolite of the chemotherapeutic agent irinotecan. PEN-866 binds with high affinity to the intracellular HSP90 target. Once bound to its target, PEN-866 delivers the tumor-killing SN-38 payload. PEN-866 has shown an impressive degree of efficacy and durability of response in multiple preclinical tumor models, including patient-derived xenograft models. Studies demonstrate that SN-38 released from PEN-866 accumulated at high levels within the tumors and was associated with increased and widespread cancer cell death when compared with irinotecan alone. Under the terms of the agreement, Madrigal will receive an upfront payment and is eligible to receive up to an aggregate of $163 million of contingent payments based upon the achievement of specified development, regulatory and sales milestones related to the first HSP90 drug conjugate product developed under the agreement. Madrigal is also eligible to receive a tiered, single-digit royalty based on future worldwide sales of HSP90 drug conjugate products.  Potential development, regulatory and sales milestone payments related to a second HSP90 drug conjugate product would be lower. Tarveda will be responsible for all of the development costs for the HSP90 drug conjugate program. “We are pleased to have completed this important and potentially valuable agreement with Tarveda,” said Paul A. Friedman, M.D., Chairman and CEO of Madrigal.  “This transaction is a key element of Madrigal’s strategy to out-license our novel oncology assets to organizations with the oncology focus and resources to fully exploit the opportunity for product development and commercial success.” The Tarveda team is comprised of seasoned oncology leaders, scientists and drug developers who are taking a novel approach to cancer treatment by creating Pentarins™, which are miniaturized drug conjugates uniquely designed to target, penetrate and eradicate solid tumors. Creating Pentarin drug conjugates that drive efficacy in solid tumors is the core expertise and focus of the team at Tarveda. “Tarveda is developing therapeutics to overcome the limitations of current cancer treatments through our Pentarin platform. Pentarins leverage their miniature size and improved pharmacokinetics to penetrate into solid tumors and cause cancer cell death with highly selective cell surface and intracellular targeting, tuned linkers and potent payloads,” said Drew Fromkin, President and CEO of Tarveda.  “The HSP90 drug conjugate platform with its lead drug candidate PEN-866, which is scheduled to be in the clinic during the first half of 2017, is an ideal fit for our growing Pentarin pipeline of novel oncology therapeutics. The Tarveda pipeline also includes PEN-221, our Pentarin conjugate that binds to the somatostatin cell surface receptor, after which the conjugate’s potent payload is internalized into the cancer cell. PEN-221 is scheduled to enter Phase I trials this year to treat patients with neuroendocrine and small-cell lung cancer tumors. We look forward to advancing both of these novel Pentarin drug candidates into clinical studies in the near term and expanding the Pentarin platform pipeline by developing new conjugates linked to other potent payloads, including challenged but promising payloads being developed by potential pharmaceutical partners.” About Madrigal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Madrigal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a company focused on the development of novel compounds for the treatment of cardiovascular-metabolic diseases and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The Company’s lead candidate, MGL-3196, is an orally administered, small-molecule liver-directed ß-selective THR agonist with high liver uptake for the treatment of NASH and dyslipidemia/hypercholesterolemia including in heterozygous and homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH, HoFH).

Zacks Rank:



 




Style Scores:



NA Value | NA Growth | NA Momentum | NA VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

This is the most exciting time in the history of medicine. Millions of people around the world are benefiting from breakthrough treatments that save, extend and improve life.
Research, technology and genomics are coming together to create a platform that allows researchers to decipher the cause of disease as never before. Each advance opens new doors, new cures, new treatments.
And yet, it’s not enough.
"Today's breakthroughs become tomorrow's medicines." Tweet
Cures don’t appear on a schedule. In search of the unknowable, in search of curing the incurable, there is no one map, no singular template, no predictable milestones.
Finding lifesaving medicines is a life’s work – the work of thousands of researchers who never say never. It's also the work of millions of patients who fight side by side with researchers in the battle for life, against whatever odds they face together.
Now is the time to put the accelerator to the floor. The best is yet to come – like groundbreaking advances in immunotherapy and personalized medicine – where the once impossible is now reality.
Welcome to the future of medicine. Where disease is no match for tenacity. No match for ingenuity. Where together, we go boldly.
Dylan Thomas penned "Do not go gentle into that good night" in 1947, but the sentiment is as timely today as it ever was. Millions of Americans are battling serious illnesses, but they’re not alone in the fight. They have the support of thousands of biopharmaceutical researchers whose lives are dedicated to helping patients go boldly into longer, healthier, and more productive lives.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

PhRMA’s member companies are on the leading edge of personalized medicine development– an area that is transforming health care, improving patient outcomes and creating health system efficiencies. In a new video, Dr. Bernie Zeiher, president of development of Astellas, discusses his excitement around the promise of personalized medicine, which uses diagnostic tools to help assess the medical treatments and procedures that may be best for each patient.
“I am very optimistic about the future because the promise of personalized medicine has begun to be seen,” Dr. Zeiher says in the video. “Now, with more personalized-type therapies, you can test the tumor or test the blood to determine that in fact the person has a particular mutation, and then that will guide which therapy you would choose and it also increases the likelihood that the patient will respond.”
Dr. Zeiher’s enthusiasm reflects the commitment of America’s biopharmaceutical companies to the development of these targeted treatments. Although there were only 13 FDA-approved personalized medicines in 2006, today there are more than 140. Additionally, personalized medicines accounted for more than 25 percent of FDA approvals last year, marking a record year for these innovative therapies.
Cancer is an area where personalized medicines are having a particularly big impact, driving tremendous advances for patients with highly aggressive cancers, like non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In fact, research has shown nearly two-thirds of NSLCs have a genetic mutation that can be more effectively targeted with a personalized medicine.
Thanks to the hard work of biopharmaceutical researchers, like Dr. Zeiher, 42 percent of medications currently in the pipeline have the potential to be personalized. While the science has never been more complex, the future of research is bright with personalized medicine becoming a reality.
