					Full Description



Vascular Biogenics Ltd., incorporated on January 31, 2000, is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company. The Company is focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of treatments for cancer. The Company's program is based on its Vascular Targeting System (VTS) platform technology, which utilizes genetically targeted therapy to destroy newly formed, or angiogenic, blood vessels. Its lead product candidate, VB-111(ofranergene obadenovec), is a gene-based biologic that it is developing for solid tumor indications, with a program for recurrent glioblastoma (rGBM), a form of brain cancer. It also is engaged in conducting a program focusing anti-inflammatory diseases, based on the use of its Lecinoxoid platform technology. Lecinoxoids are a class of small molecules it developed that are structurally and functionally similar to naturally occurring molecules known to modulate inflammation. The lead product candidate from this program, VB-201, is a Phase II-ready molecule that demonstrated efficacy in reducing vascular inflammation in a Phase II sub-study in psoriatic patients with cardiovascular risk.VTS PlatformThe Company's VTS platform technology enables systemic administration of gene therapy to either destroy or promote angiogenic blood vessels. VTS is both tissue- and condition-specific, allowing for targeted and limited gene expression in endothelial cells, the thin layer of cells that lines the interior surface of blood vessels undergoing angiogenesis. Its VTS platform technology comprises three components: a viral vector, a promoter and a transgene. The viral vector is a modified virus that is used as a delivery vehicle to distribute the promoter and the transgene throughout the body. The promoter is its genetically modified promoter, PPE-1-3X, which specifically targets the endothelial cells of angiogenic blood vessels. The transgene is a genetic sequence designed to yield a specific biologic effect, the expression of which is directed by PPE-1-3X.The Company has studied VB-111 in a Phase I all comers trial involving patients with multiple types of metastatic cancer types, including thyroid cancer, neuroendocrine cancer, renal cell carcinoma and lung cancer. In that trial, VB-111 was tolerated and showed a dose- dependent extension in median overall survival across a range of tumor types. Its VTS platform technology enables systemic administration of gene therapy to either destroy or promote angiogenic blood vessels. It has also generated additional product candidates, which utilize the same vector and promoter as in VB-111, and comprise alternative functional transgenes, which include VB-511, an anti-angiogenic candidate; VB-211 and VB-411, which are pro-angiogenic candidates that may be employed for ischemic conditions, such as peripheral vascular disease.Lecinoxoid PlatformThe Company's Lecinoxoid platform technology comprises a family of orally administered small molecules designed to modulate the body's inflammatory response. Lecinoxoids are compounds that are structurally and functionally similar to naturally occurring molecules, known as oxidized phospholipids, which possess immune modulating anti-inflammatory properties, modified to manage stability and activity. Its lead Lecinoxoid-based compound, VB-201, is designed as an oral agent for the control of chronic inflammatory disorders. VB-201 inhibits the CD-14/TLR4 and TLR2 pathways, as well as monocyte migration. The Company has also developed second and third generations of Lecinoxoid product candidates.

VBL Therapeutics Provides Update on Long-Term Survival in Phase 2 Trials of Patients with Multiple Tumor Types
Jun 19 17
VBL Therapeutics provided an update on the long term status and survival of patients from three completed Phase 2 trials, which investigated the company's lead candidate, VB-111,  respectively in recurrent glioblastoma (rGBM), recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and radioiodine refractory differentiated thyroid cancer.  All three trials had previously shown signals of an overall survival benefit for VB-111. The company has continued to follow the survival of patients from these trials. rGBM: In the Phase 2 study in rGBM patients, 12 months survival was 54% in patients who were treated with VB-111 through progression, including an rGBM patient who remains alive with complete response after 38 months, compared to 23% of patients who had limited exposure of a therapeutic dose of VB-111. According a meta-analysis, the 12 months survival on Avastin (bevacizumab) is only 24%. Ovarian Cancer: In the Phase 2 study in recurrent platinum-resistant and refractory ovarian cancer, 53% of patients treated with a therapeutic dose of VB-111 in combination with paclitaxel were alive at 15 months, some of whom remain alive and are on active follow up. No patients in the sub-therapeutic dose were alive at the 15-month timepoint. Thyroid Cancer: In the Phase 2 study in radioiodine refractory differentiated thyroid cancer, 53% of those who received multiple therapeutic doses of VB-111 were alive at 24 months, compared to 33% of those who received a single, sub-therapeutic dose of VB-111. 35% of patients on the therapeutic dose cohort remain alive at 39 to 46 months.

CANCER PIPELINE



Our lead oncology drug candidate VB-111 (ofranergene obadenovec) is the first VTS™-based agent for cancer therapy.
VB-111 is a unique biologic agent that uses a dual mechanism to target solid tumors:

Based on a non-integrating, non-replicating, Adeno 5 vector, it utilizes VBL’s proprietary Vascular Targeting System (VTS™) to target the tumor vasculature for cancer therapy. Unlike anti-VEGF or TKIs, VB-111 does not aim to block a specific pro-angiogenic pathway; instead, it uses an angiogenesis-specific sensor (VBL’s PPE-1-3x proprietary promoter) to specifically induce cell death in angiogenic endothelial cells in the tumor milieu. This mechanism retains activity regardless of baseline tumor mutations or the identity of the pro-angiogenic factors secreted by the tumor and shows activity even after failure of prior treatment with other anti-angiogenics.
Moreover, VB-111 induces specific anti-tumor immune response, which is accompanied by recruitment of CD8 T-cells and apoptosis of tumor cells.

VBL has obtained Fast Track designation for VB-111 in the United States for prolongation of survival in patients with glioblastoma that has recurred following a treatment with standard chemotherapy and radiation; we have also received Orphan Drug designation in both the United States and Europe.
VB-111 successfully demonstrated proof-of-concept and survival benefit in Phase 2 clinical trials in rGBM, thyroid cancer and ovarian cancer.

Preclinical Insights: Preclinical pharmacological and toxicology studies on VB-111 have shown tissue specificity for the tumor tissue, no significant damage to normal non-cancerous tissues or to the normal blood vessels in the body, and a more than 90 percent reduction in metastatic lung cancer model with one injection, as well as similar efficacy in other tumor models.


Phase I “all comers” Clinical Trial: We conducted our Phase 1 “all comers” clinical trial of VB-111 in the United States as an open-label, dose-escalating trial to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of VB-111 in 56 patients with advanced metastatic cancer. The trial was performed at multiple centers and was initiated as a single dose trial. A statistically significant improved overall survival in the VB-111 therapeutic dose cohort as compared to other cohorts was seen. In addition, there was a trend of improvement in the progression free survival rate in response to VB-111 at the therapeutic dose.  Following prolonged stability, a partial response, or both, in several patients after treatment with a single dose, we enrolled patients into two additional dose cohorts who received multiple therapeutic doses of VB-111 in two specific tumor types.
A manuscript detailing our Phase 1 study can be found here: http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/19/14/3996.long


Phase II Clinical Trials: 

rGBM:
VBL’s Phase 2 multi-center study for VB-111 was designed to determine the safety, tolerability and efficacy of VB-111 in patients with rGBM. A total of 46 patients were enrolled in two sequential cohorts. VBL previously reported that the study met the primary endpoint of statistically-significant increase in median overall survival, with 59 weeks in patients treated continuously with VB-111, compared to 32 weeks in patients with only one dose (in median) of VB-111 (p=0.048), both groups having received Avastin upon progression after a short course of VB-111. The 12-Month overall survival was 57% in the VB-111 continuous exposure cohort, compared with only 24% in historical pooled Avastin trials (p=0.03).
At ASCO 2017, VBL presented additional analyses from the Phase 2 study, which demonstrate that tumor growth kinetics was significantly attenuated upon longer treatment with VB-111.
Ovarian Cancer:
In addition, at the 2016 ASCO meeting, VBL reported results from a Phase 1/2 trial of VB-111 in patients with recurrent platinum resistant ovarian cancer.  The data demonstrate a median overall survival of 810 days in the VB-111 therapeutic dose arm, versus 172 days in the low dose arm, a result that was statistically significant. There was also a durable doubling in the response rate, as measured by a reduction in the CA-125 biomarker, compared to historical rates of Avastin® (bevacizumab) plus chemotherapy in ovarian cancer. Durable RECIST responses and disease stabilizations were also observed. An immunotherapeutic effect was also observed in biopsies taken from patients.  The trial was conducted at Massachusetts General Hospital and Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA. VBL is planning to launch a Phase 3 pivotal study in platinum-resistant Ovarian Cancer in the second half of 2017.
Thyroid Cancer:
We also conducted an exploratory Phase 2 clinical trial in the United States as an open-label, dose- escalating trial to assess the safety and efficacy of single or multiple doses of VB-111 in patients with advanced, recently progressive differentiated thyroid cancer that is unresponsive to radioactive iodine.  This trial met its primary endpoint, which was defined as 25% progression-free survival at 6 months (PFS-6), in heavily-pretreated patients with late-stage disease. The primary endpoint of the trial, defined as 6-month progression-free-survival (PFS-6) of 25%, was met with a dose response. Forty-seven percent (47%; 8/17) of patients in the therapeutic-dose cohort reached PFS-6, versus 25% (4/12) in the sub-therapeutic cohort, both groups meeting the primary endpoint. Reduction in tumor measurement after the first dose was seen in 44% (7/16) of patients in the therapeutic-dose cohort, compared to 9% (1/11) in the sub-therapeutic-dose cohort. An overall survival benefit was seen with a tail of more than 40% at 3.7 years for the therapeutic-dose cohort (mOS 684 days). This is similar to historical data for pazopanib* (Votrient®), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor; however, most patients in the VB-111 study had tumors that previously had progressed on pazopanib or other kinase inhibitors.  VB-111 was well-tolerated in this study, with no signs of clinically significant safety issues.
Lung Cancer:
VBL is planning to launch an exploratory study of VB-111 in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor in the second half of 2017.

Phase III Pivotal clinical trial – VBL Therapeutics’ pivotal Phase 3 GLOBE trial of VB-111 in rGBM is ongoing under a special protocol assessment granted by the FDA.

Detailed information on these clinical trials can be found at www.clinicaltrials.gov
VBL’s pivotal Phase 3 GLOBE study in rGBM, comparing VB-111 in combination with Avastin to Avastin alone, is currently being conducted in the US, Canada and Israel.  Enrollment in the study, 256 patients in total, was completed in December 2016, five months ahead of schedule.  The study is proceeding under a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) granted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), with full endorsement by the Canadian Brain Tumor Consortium (CBTC). The company expects top-line results from the full dataset in early 2018.

CLINICAL TRIALS




VBL Therapeutics’ lead oncology product candidate, VB-111 (ofranergene obadenovec) , is a targeted anti-cancer gene-based biologic agent that is positioned to treat a wide range of solid tumors.  It is conveniently administered as an IV infusion once every two months.
Completed Clinical Trials

VBL conducted a Phase 1 “all comers” clinical trial of VB-111 in the United States as an open-label, dose-escalating trial to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of VB-111 in 56 patients with advanced metastatic cancer. In that trial, VB-111 was well-tolerated and showed a dose dependent extension in median overall survival across a range of tumor types.



Based on the Phase 1 results, VBL decided to proceed with the development of VB-111 for the lead indication of rGBM, as well as to investigate VB-111 as a monotherapy for the treatment of thyroid cancer and, in combination with chemotherapy, for ovarian cancer.

Phase 2 single-arm open-label multicenter trial of VB-111 in patients with rGBM – 
On September 2015 at the European Cancer Conference (ECC 2015), VBL Therapeutics reported full Phase 2 data from a multi-center clinical trial of VB-111 in rGBM, meeting the primary endpoint of statistically-significant increase in overall survival.

Study data also suggest that VB-111 may induce an immuno-therapeutic effect. Of the 46 patients who received VB-111, 25 patients experienced a fever post-dosing of VB-111 at least once, while 21 patients did not. Feverish patients demonstrated increased overall survival of 16 months, compared to non-feverish patients, who had a median overall survival of 8.5 months (p=0.03). This correlation between clinical efficacy and fever suggests that VB-111 may induce an immune response in patients and supports a role of the immune system as part of VB-111’s mechanism of action. These findings strengthen VB-111 preclinical data, which showed an elevated immune response in tumors of VB-111-treated animals.
On June 2016, at the 2016 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting, VBL reported new data comparing Phase 2 clinical outcomes with VB-111 with pooled data from 8 studies that investigated Avastin in recurrent glioblastoma (rGBM). In the Phase 2 VB-111 trial, the median overall survival of patients who received continuous exposure of VB-111 in combination with Avastin was 59 weeks. This is compared to 32 weeks in the pooled data from the 8 studies in the meta-analysis (p= 0.0295 Hazard Ratio 0.62, 95% CI: 0.40-0.96). Median survival ranged from 26.0 weeks to 45.7 weeks in the meta-analysis. Overall survival at 12 months for patients on continuous exposure of VB-111 was 57%, compared to 24% overall survival (range 16% – 38%) for the pooled data (p= 0.03).  See also the  VB-111 rGBM Poster at ASCO 2016 .
At ASCO 2017,  VBL presented additional analyses from the Phase 2 study, which demonstrate that tumor growth kinetics was significantly attenuated upon longer treatment with VB-111.  See also VB-111 data at ASCO 2017 and the ASCO 2017 Poster
The FDA granted fast track designation for the investigation of VB-111 for prolongation of survival in patients with glioblastoma that has recurred following treatment with temozolomide. VB-111 was also granted orphan designation for treatment of malignant glioma by the FDA, and for treatment of glioma in Europe.

Phase 1/2 clinical trial of VB-111 in ovarian cancer – This is a Phase 1/2 investigator-initiated clinical trial under VBL’s IND, which was conducted as an open- label, dose-escalating trial to assess the safety and efficacy of bi-monthly doses of VB-111 in combination with weekly paclitaxel in patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer.  On June 2016, at the 2016 ASCO meeting, VBL reported results from a Phase 1/2 trial of VB-111 in patients with recurrent platinum resistant ovarian cancer.  The data demonstrate a median overall survival of 810 days in the VB-111 therapeutic dose arm, versus 172 days in the low dose arm, a result that was statistically significant. There was also a durable doubling in the response rate, as measured by a reduction in the CA-125 biomarker, compared to historical rates of Avastin® (bevacizumab) plus chemotherapy in ovarian cancer. Durable RECIST responses and disease stabilizations were also observed. An immunotherapeutic effect was also observed in biopsies taken from patients.  The trial was conducted at Massachusetts General Hospital and Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.See also the  VB-111 Ovarian Cancer Poster at ASCO 2016 .  


Phase 2 clinical trial of VB-111 in thyroid cancer - We conducted an exploratory Phase 2 clinical trial in the United States to assess the safety and efficacy of single or multiple doses of VB-111.  Our open-label dose-escalating study enrolled patients with advanced, recently-progressive, differentiated thyroid cancer that was unresponsive to radioactive iodine, in two cohorts. Most patients had tumors that had not responded to multiple therapies prior to enrollment, including radiation and kinase inhibitors. In the first cohort, thirteen patients received a single intravenous infusion of VB-111 at a sub-therapeutic dose of 3X1012 viral particles (VPs). The second cohort included seventeen patients, who received VB-111 at a therapeutic dose of 1013 VPs every two months until disease progression. One patient proceeded from a single low dose to receive later multiple high doses at progression and was included in both groups (for PFS only). VB-111 was well-tolerated in this study, with no signs of clinically significant safety issues.The primary endpoint of the trial, defined as 6-month progression-free-survival (PFS-6) of 25%, was met with a dose response. Forty-seven percent (47%; 8/17) of patients in the therapeutic-dose cohort reached PFS-6, versus 25% (4/12) in the sub-therapeutic cohort, both groups meeting the primary endpoint. Reduction in tumor measurement after the first dose was seen in 44% (7/16) of patients in the therapeutic-dose cohort, compared to 9% (1/11) in the sub-therapeutic-dose cohort. An overall survival benefit was seen with a tail of more than 40% at 3.7 years for the therapeutic-dose cohort (mOS 684 days). This is similar to historical data for pazopanib* (Votrient®), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor; however, most patients in the VB-111 study had tumors that previously had progressed on pazopanib or other kinase inhibitors.  The trial was conducted at Mayo Clinic and Mass General Hospital, Boston, MA.

Ongoing Clinical Trials
Phase 3 pivotal, randomized, controlled trial of VB-111 in Patients with rGBM - VBL Therapeutics’ pivotal Phase 3 GLOBE trial of VB-111 in rGBM is ongoing under a special protocol assessment granted by the FDA. The trial is conducted in the US, Canada and Israel .

 

 
 Planned Clinical Trials:

 Ovarian cancer – VBL completed a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in recurrent ovarian cancer, which combined VB-111 therapy with paclitaxel, a common chemotherapeutic agent used to treat ovarian cancer, to evaluate safety and efficacy in this indication. The company expects to launch a Phase 3 study in platinum-resistant Ovarian Cancer in the second half of 2017.



Lung cancer – VBL plans to conduct an exploratory study of VB-111 in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor (immuno-therapy) in non-small-cell lung cancer. The trial launch is expected towards year-end 2017.

 Detailed information on the clinical trials can be found at www.clinicaltrials.gov

OVARIAN CANCER



VB-111, is a first-in class targeted anti-cancer biologic agent that is positioned to treat a wide range of solid tumors with current clinical trials in rGBM, thyroid cancer and ovarian cancer.
On June 2016 at the 2016 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting, VBL reported results from a Phase 1/2 trial of VB-111 in patients with recurrent platinum resistant ovarian cancer.  The data demonstrate a median overall survival of 810 days in the VB-111 therapeutic dose arm, versus 172 days in the low dose arm, a result that was statistically significant. There was also a durable doubling in the response rate, as measured by a reduction in the CA-125 biomarker, compared to historical rates of Avastin® (bevacizumab) plus chemotherapy in ovarian cancer. Durable RECIST responses and disease stabilizations were also observed. An immunotherapeutic effect was also observed in biopsies taken from patients.  The trial was conducted at Massachusetts General Hospital and Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA. under VBL’s IND.
See also the VB-111 Poster at ASCO 2016 . 
For more information on the trial please click  here.
VBL is planning to launch a Phase 3 pivotal study in platinum-resistant Ovarian Cancer in the second half of 2017.

COMPANY OVERVIEW



VBL Therapeutics is a publicly traded (NASDAQ: VBLT), late-stage clinical biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of first in class treatments for cancer. 
VBL’s clinical pipeline is based on two distinct, proprietary platform technologies that leverage the body’s natural physiologic and genetic regulatory elements.  To date, VBL has developed two programs based on these platforms – an oncology program and an anti-inflammatory program.
The Company’s lead oncology product candidate, VB-111, is a targeted anti-cancer gene-therapy agent that is positioned to treat a wide range of solid tumors.  VB-111 is conveniently administered as an IV infusion once every two months. It has been observed to be well-tolerated in >200 cancer patients and we have observed its efficacy signals in an ”all comers“ Phase 1 trial as well as in three tumor-specific Phase 2 studies. The mechanism of VB-111 combines blockade of tumor vasculature with an anti-tumor immune response. This mechanism retains activity regardless of baseline tumor mutations or the identity of the pro-angiogenic factors secreted by the tumor.
VB-111 has received orphan drug designation in both the United States and Europe and was granted Fast Track designation by the FDA for prolongation of survival in patients with glioblastoma that has recurred following treatment with standard chemotherapy and radiation. VBL Therapeutics’ pivotal Phase 3 GLOBE trial of VB-111 in rGBM is ongoing under a special protocol assessment granted by the FDA.
VBL’s oncology program is based on the Company’s proprietary Vascular Targeting System™ or VTS platform technology which utilizes genetically targeted therapy to destroy newly formed or angiogenic blood vessels.
VBL has also developed a proprietary platform of orally-available small molecules, designated Lecinoxoids, for the treatment of chronic immune-related indications.
Founded in 2000, VBL is based in Or-Yehuda, Israel.

We estimate that the net proceeds we will receive from our issuance and sale of
ordinary shares will be approximately $34.4 million, or approximately
$40.0 million if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional
ordinary shares in full, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions
and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The principal reasons for this offering are to increase our capitalization and
financial flexibility, increase our visibility in the marketplace and create a
public market for our ordinary shares. We expect to use the net proceeds from
this offering as follows:
 
   •   approximately $20.0 million to fund clinical development costs of VB-111 
       in rGBM;                                                                      

   •   approximately $1.5 million to fund clinical development costs of VB-111 
       in other indications;                                                         
   •   approximately $3.8 million to fund development costs of VB-201;

   •   approximately $1.0 million for pre-clinical development of follow-on       
       Lecinoxoid product candidates;                                             

   •   approximately $0.3 million, representing 1% of the net proceeds of this    
       offering, to satisfy a payment obligation triggered upon our initial 
       public offering pursuant to an agreement with Tel Hashomer—Medical 
       Research,Infrastructure and Services Ltd.; and                                      

   •   the remainder for working capital and general corporate purposes, 
       including funding the costs of operating as a public company.                        

Based on our planned use of the net proceeds from this offering and our existing
cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, we estimate that such
funds will be sufficient to enable us to receive interim data from our planned
Phase 3 clinical trial of VB-111 in rGBM, to complete our Phase 2 clinical trial
for VB-111 in thyroid cancer, to complete our Phase 1/2 clinical trial for
VB-111 in ovarian cancer and to complete our Phase 2 clinical trials for VB-201
in psoriasis and ulcerative colitis.

As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of the
particular uses for the net proceeds from this offering. The amounts and timing
of our actual expenditures may vary significantly from our expectations
depending upon numerous factors, including the progress of our research and
development efforts, the progress of our clinical trials, our operating costs
and capital expenditures and the other factors. Accordingly, we will retain the discretion to allocate the net
proceeds of this offering, and we reserve the right to change the allocation of
the net proceeds among the uses described above.

Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds from the offering in
investment- grade, interest-bearing instruments, securities or certificates of
deposit.


We are engaged in pharmaceutical development, which is a rapidly changing field.
We have competitors both in the United States and internationally, including
major multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies and
universities and other research institutions.

Many of our potential competitors have substantially greater financial,
technical and other resources, such as larger research and development staff and
experienced marketing and manufacturing organizations. Competition may increase
further as a result of advances in the commercial applicability of technologies
and greater availability of capital for investment in these industries. Our
potential competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing on an
exclusive basis, products that are more effective or less costly than any
product candidate that we may develop, or achieve earlier patent protection,
regulatory approval, product commercialization and market penetration than us.
Additionally, technologies developed by others may render our potential product
candidates uneconomical or obsolete, and we may not be successful in marketing
our product candidates against competitors.

In particular, VB-111 may face competition from currently approved drugs and
drug candidates under development by others to treat rGBM. In May 2009, the FDA
granted accelerated approval to Avastin (bevacizumab), which is an angiogenesis
inhibitor, to treat patients with rGBM at progression after standard first-line
therapy. In addition to bevacizumab, a number of companies are conducting
late-stage clinical trials to test targeted drugs focused on angiogenesis
inhibition for the treatment of ovarian cancer, including, among others, Amgen’s
trebananib, Boehringer Ingelheim’s nintedanib and GlaxoSmithKline’s Votrient.

Even if we are successful in achieving regulatory approval to commercialize a
product candidate faster than our competitors, we may face competition from
biosimilars. In the United States, the Biologics Price Competition and
Innovation Act of 2009 created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological
products that are demonstrated to be “highly similar,” or biosimilar, to or
“interchangeable” with an FDA-approved biological product. This pathway could
allow competitors to reference data from biological products already approved
after 12 years from the time of approval. In Europe, the European Commission has
granted marketing authorizations for several biosimilars pursuant to a set of
general and product class-specific guidelines for biosimilar approvals issued
over the past few years. In Europe, a competitor may reference data from
biological products already approved, but will not be able to market a
biosimilar until ten years after the time of approval. This 10-year period will
be extended to 11 years if, during the first eight of those 10 years, the
marketing authorization holder obtains an approval for one or more new
therapeutic indications that bring significant clinical benefits compared with
existing therapies. In addition, companies may be developing biosimilars in
other countries that could compete with our products. If competitors are able to
obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing our products, our products
may become subject to competition from such biosimilars, with the attendant
competitive pressure and consequences. Expiration or successful challenge of our
applicable patent rights could also trigger competition from other products,
assuming any relevant exclusivity period has expired.

In addition, although VB-111 has been granted orphan drug status by the FDA and
EMA for a specified indication, there are limitations to the exclusivity. In the
United States, the exclusivity period for orphan drugs is seven years, while
pediatric exclusivity adds six months to any existing patents or exclusivity
periods. In Europe, orphan drugs may be able to obtain 10 years of marketing
exclusivity and up to an additional two years on the basis of qualifying
pediatric studies. However, orphan exclusivity may be reduced to six years if
the drug no longer satisfies the original designation criteria. Additionally, a
marketing authorization holder may lose its orphan exclusivity if it consents to
a second orphan drug application or cannot supply enough drug. Orphan drug
exclusivity also can be lost when a second applicant demonstrates its drug is
“clinically superior” to the original orphan drug.

Finally, as a result of the expiration or successful challenge of our patent
rights, we could face more litigation with respect to the validity or scope of
patents relating to other parties’ products. The availability of other parties’
products could limit the demand, and the price we are able to charge, for any
products that we may develop and commercialize.

Since some of our product candidates are aimed for rare diseases, loss of
exclusivity or competition as described above may be very significant in light
of the limited size of the relevant market.


Company Description
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to the discovery,
development and commercialization of first-in-class treatments for cancer and
immune- inflammatory diseases. Our clinical pipeline is based on two distinct,
proprietary platform technologies that leverage the body’s


 natural physiologic
and genetic regulatory elements. To date, we have developed two programs based
on these platforms—an oncology program and an anti-inflammatory program. Our
lead product candidate from our oncology program, VB-111, is a gene-based
biologic that we are initially developing for recurrent glioblastoma, or rGBM,
an aggressive form of brain cancer. We have obtained fast track designation for
VB-111 in the United States for prolongation of survival in patients with
glioblastoma that has recurred following treatment with standard chemotherapy
and radiation. We have also received orphan drug designation in both the United
States and Europe. The FDA has concurred with the design and planned analyses of
our Phase 3 pivotal trial of VB-111 in rGBM pursuant to a special protocol
assessment, or SPA. We intend to begin this trial in the first half of 2015,
subject to the FDA being satisfied with the potency release assay to be used in
the trial. Our lead product candidate from our anti-inflammatory program,
VB-201, is an oral small molecule we are currently evaluating in Phase 2
clinical trials for psoriasis and for ulcerative colitis. We have completed
enrollment of both of these Phase 2 clinical trials and we expect top-line
results from these trials in the first quarter of 2015.

Our oncology program is based on our proprietary Vascular Targeting System, or
VTS, platform technology, which utilizes genetically targeted therapy to destroy
newly formed, or angiogenic, blood vessels. We believe this technology will
allow us to develop product candidates for multiple oncology indications. Our
anti-inflammatory program is based on the use of our Lecinoxoid platform
technology. Lecinoxoids are a novel class of small molecules we developed that
are structurally and functionally similar to naturally occurring molecules known
to modulate inflammation. We believe our two distinct platform technologies
provide us with an opportunity to develop a diversified portfolio of product
candidates targeting both orphan indications and large markets.
