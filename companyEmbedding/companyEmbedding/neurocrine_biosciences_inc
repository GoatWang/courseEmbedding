Neurocrine Biosciences' First Product Approval On The Line - Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:NBIX) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Neurocrine Biosciences' First Product Approval On The LineNov. 1.16 | About: Neurocrine Biosciences, (NBIX) Clinically Sound Investor Biotech, healthcare, tech, event-drivenA Pharmacist Breaks Down BiotechSummaryLead drug candidate INGREZZA faces the proverbial light at the end of the development tunnel in April.INGREZZA is better than its chemical predecessor, which even as a generic won't be a competitor in the tardive dyskinesia (TD) market.With no approved products and decades of pent-up demand, the TD indication alone gives INGREZZA blockbuster potential.Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:NBIX) is a mid-sized biopharmaceutical company ($3.96 billion) which develops new drugs to treat neurological and endocrine-based diseases and disorders. The company's two lead programs (Table 1) are INGREZZA (valbenazine), an inhibitor of vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2); and elagolix, a gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist for women's health that is partnered with AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV). My opening coverage detailed the competitive advantages of these drug candidates over currently available products. Of course, Neurocrine's pair has to go through the approval process first. On October 11, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted for Priority Review the New Drug Application (NDA) for INGREZZA for the treatment of neuroleptic medication-induced or tardive dyskinesia (TD). The NDA has a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date of April 11, 2017. Table 1. Neurocrine Clinical Pipeline   Compound Program Phase   INGREZZA (valbenazine) Tardive Dyskinesia NDA Filed   Elagolix Endometriosis Phase 3   Elagolix Uterine Fibroids Phase 3   INGREZZA Tourette Syndrome Phase 2   Verucerfont (NBI-77860) Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia Phase 2   TD is defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-V) as dyskinesia that persists beyond 4-8 weeks (the window of withdrawal-emergent dyskinesia) after discontinuation or reduction in dosage of neuroleptics. However, antipsychotics aren't the only drugs that may cause TD; these include other mood stabilizers (e.g., lithium, antidepressants), antiemetics (metoclopramide), anticholinergic medications (benztropine, antihistamines), antiepileptics, anti-parkinsonian drugs, estrogen-based hormonal therapy, stimulants (methylphenidate) and many more. INGREZZA is no doubt better than tetrabenazine, another VMAT2 inhibitor and the only recommended TD treatment on the market. However, tetrabenazine is used off-label for TD, as it is only approved in the U.S. for chorea associated with Huntington disease (HD).
 Tetrabenazine became available in generic this year, ending the 7 orphan exclusivity years of Lundbeck's (OTCPK:HLUYY) Xenazine for HD chorea. Xenazine generated revenue in the U.S. of DKK 2,182 million (around $320 million), 1,672 million and 1,394 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. A meta-analysis estimated an overall HD prevalence of 5.70 per 100,000 in North America and Europe. Other experts view this as a gross underestimation and insist on a trend of increasing HD prevalence in most Caucasian populations as HD patients live longer due to better treatments. Even in the base case, there would've been 17,600 HD patients according to the 2010 U.S. census. It is apparent from Table 2 and succeeding sales figures that Xenazine never achieved a 50% market penetration. Table 2. Xenazine U.S.-Based Annual Sales and Demand   Xenazine 2009 2010 2011 2012   Revenues (in $ millions) 54.5 102.6 152.4 202.5   Growth   88.2% 48.6% 32.8%   Patients 2,000 2,700 3,400 4,000   Growth   35.0% 25.9% 17.6%   Before the FDA approved Xenazine in 2008, Americans often resorted to "importing" generic tetrabenazine from Canada, where it was still pricey at less than $2 a pill. Initially, annual treatment with Xenazine 12.5 mg twice daily cost just under $20,000; today, that regimen lists at almost $70,000. It gets worse for TD patients, who usually need higher doses of Xenazine than is effective for chorea. INGREZZA and tetrabenazine are both prodrugs that when metabolized produce the therapeutic drug (+)-α-dihydrotetrabenazine. However, unlike tetrabenazine, INGREZZA does not spawn other active metabolites such as (+)- β-dihydrotetrabenazine that may cause toxic effects like sedation and Parkinsonism. In April, INGREZZA should also become the first approved agent for TD. The NDA includes the results from the Kinect 2 and Kinect 3 TD studies, along with the results from another 18 clinical trials. Kinect 2 had been discussed in the previous article. Kinect 3 was a Phase 3, double-blind, parallel, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (RCT) in 234 TD patients. The primary endpoint (Table 3) showed that the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) ratings at Week 6 for the 80 mg daily INGREZZA were significantly reduced by 3.1 points more than placebo ( P< 0.0001). Some secondary endpoints also trended toward a benefit from using INGREZZA.
 Table 3. Kinect 3 Tardive Dyskinesia (TD) Efficacy Endpoints   Intention-to-treat INGREZZA 40mg Placebo INGREZZA 80mg Placebo   Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale -1.9 -0.1 -3.2 -0.1   (Primary) P = 0.0021   P < 0.0001     Clinical Global Impression of Change-TD 2.9 3.2 2.9 3.2   (Key Secondary) P = .0742   P = .056     The AIMS includes 7 items that are rated on a 5-point scale of severity: 0 (none), 1 (minimal), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate), and 4 (severe). A 2 or higher on one item is evidence of TD, and mild TD in two areas or moderate TD in one area is usually sufficient for a TD diagnosis. Baseline AIMS scores averaged 10.1 (standard deviation 4.0). For illustrative purposes, the results may be interpreted as INGREZZA 80 mg being able to potentially alleviate 3 areas to minimal TD (or INGREZZA 40 mg reducing 2 areas) in a sample patient having mild TD in 5 categories. Even if INGREZZA's label is limited to moderate or severe cases, again it is easy to see how a hypothetical patient with 3 moderate areas could be managed down to all mild. Determining the market for INGREZZA is difficult. Perhaps the best approximation can be made from a study that examined recent trends in 12-month prevalence of receipt of mental health treatments among adults 18 years or older from 3 generations: the Silent Generation (born in the years 1925-1945), the baby boomers (born in the years 1946-1964), and Generation X (born in the years 1965-1980). Nationally representative data was gathered from 274,900 participants in the 2008-2013 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). NSDUH did exclude homeless persons not in shelters, active-duty military personnel and residents of institutional quarters such as nursing homes. In general, younger people adopt a more tolerant view of mental health problems and treatments, so it's not surprising that the estimated prevalence of self-reported mental illness was found to be highest among Gen Xers and lowest among the Silent Generation (see Table 4). On the other hand, Medicare Part D is available for a sizable fraction of baby boomers and others of appropriate age; in addition, the Affordable Care Act of 2010 reduced prescription copays (for generics in 2011 and for brand-name in 2013) when Part D patients hit the "donut hole," which is the coverage gap between the initial coverage limit and the catastrophic-coverage threshold. Thus, not only did a larger proportion of baby boomers receive psychotropic medications, they were the only cohort in focus for which receipt of psychotropic medications increased over time, from 44.4% in 2008 to 50.7% in 2013 ( P = 0.012).
 Table 4. Twelve-Month Prevalence of Mental Illness (MI), 2013 and Model-Adjusted Unless Otherwise Specified     Other Adults Generation X Baby Boomers Silent Generation Overall   Adult Participants, 2008-2013 155400 61000 43400 15100 274900   Prevalence of MI, % (unadjusted) 18.7 20.7 17.4 11.1 18.5   Prevalence of MI 29002 13600 8200 1700 50857   Patients With Past-Year MI Receiving Psychotropics 24324 5127 4157 479 34088   Past-Year MI Receiving Psychotropics, %   37.7 50.7 28.2     Received Psychotropic Medications, % 15.7 8.4 9.6 3.2 12.4   The researchers noted that psychotropic use increased overall by 8.8% (11.4% to 12.4%, P = 0.004). Their main point was that older cohorts had limited access to mental health treatment. One can be easily eyeballed from Table 4 that most adults born from 1981 to the mid-1990s and had mental health problems the previous year were able to receive psychotropic medications. It has been established that the cumulative incidence of TD during the first 5 years of antipsychotic treatment increases linearly with the duration of exposure to offending drugs. The debate still rages on whether atypical (at least second-generation) antipsychotics really have fewer propensities to cause TD compared to first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs). In a naturalistic study of 516 patients, a 19% TD prevalence was observed in those exposed only to atypicals, which was statistically identical in those taking FGAs for the first 5 years (odds ratio 1.0). Some sources have pegged TD prevalence of up to 24% and annual TD incidence of 5.6 per 100 patient years of exposure to FGAs (as well as an alarmingly similar rate of 5.9 per 100 patient years with atypicals). With the current U.S. population, a flat 12% puts the number at 30.0 million adult Americans on antipsychotics, of whom 20% or 6.0 million are suffering from TD. Alternatively, using population frequency distribution by generations leads to a slightly smaller estimate of 4.5 million with TD. Finally, the prevalence of moderate TD is 6-10% of TD patients or about 4% of patients treated with neuroleptics. Using the lower alternative estimate, INGREZZA's market is either at least 270,000-450,000 with the first formula, or more than 1 million with the latter; these figures agree with the range of management's claims.
 INGREZZA will also enjoy first-to-market advantage in TD over rival deutetrabenazine (SD-809) from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA), which reported positive top-line results for AIM-TD last month. AIM-TD is deutetrabenazine's registrational Phase 3 RCT for TD. Deutetrabenazine shares Xenazine's structure but substitutes 6 hydrogens with 6 deuterium atoms, which extends deutetrabenazine's half life and reduce interactions with other drugs. But just as Teva touts a convenience benefit for deutetrabenazine's twice daily dosing compared to Xenazine's occasional 3 times a day frequency, INGREZZA trumps both with a single daily dose, a critical advantage for patients who may have difficulties swallowing or handling small items. Neurocrine had $416.5 million in liquid assets as of June 30 and burned $40 million in Q2, so it is well-funded to launch INGREZZA. The company may be able to get away with charging $50 per 80 mg of INGREZZA (which compares favorably with Xenazine 25 mg at $54.8 each in 2008 and $189.67 today). If so, with each 1% penetration of the TD market, INGREZZA will deliver at least $48 million. It is not difficult to imagine 1 of 20 patients (5%) afflicted with at least moderate TD, after waiting years for an approved TD (or one that insurance was willing to cover) would want to at least try INGREZZA. What remains to be seen is whether Neurocrine can hold off Teva's much larger sales force, but INGREZZA may be able to earn several hundred million in revenue before deutetrabenazine hits the market.

	Neurocrine Announces FDA Approval of INGREZZA TM (valbenazine) Capsules as the First




	and Only Approved Treatment for Adults with Tardive Dyskinesia (TD)




	Provides significant and rapid reduction in involuntary movements with simple once-daily dosing




	Enables treatment of TD with commonly prescribed psychiatric medication regimens




	Investor conference call and webcast scheduled for today at 5:30pm ET (2:30pm PT)



	SAN DIEGO, April 11, 2017 /PRNewswire/  Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc. (NASDAQ: NBIX) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
	(FDA) has approved INGREZZA

	TM

	(valbenazine) capsules for the treatment of adults with tardive dyskinesia (TD). INGREZZA, a novel, selective vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitor, is
	the first and only FDA-approved product indicated for the treatment of adults with TD.


	The often debilitating effects of tardive dyskinesia have
	left people feeling isolated and forgotten. The approval of INGREZZA represents a turning point for these patients and their care partners, offering a meaningful treatment where before there was little hope, said Kevin C. Gorman, Chief
	Executive Officer of Neurocrine Biosciences. For the past 20 years, Neurocrine has been devoted to developing treatments for difficult to manage conditions in underserved patient populations. We are committed to ensuring that those impacted by
	the disruptive effects of TD have access to INGREZZA.


	Until now, one of the few options for physicians, when managing TD, was to stop, change
	or lower the dose of antipsychotic medication, potentially jeopardizing patients psychiatric stability, said Christoph U. Correll, MD, Professor, Psychiatry and Molecular Medicine, Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine. In clinical
	trials, INGREZZA significantly and rapidly improved TD symptoms compared to placebo, reducing involuntary movements acutely and through 48 weeks of treatment without compromising underlying psychiatric care. These results, combined with convenient
	once-daily dosing, represent a tremendous breakthrough for patients suffering from TD.


	Clinical studies have shown that INGREZZA provides
	significant, rapid and meaningful improvement in TD signs and symptoms compared to placebo through six weeks, with continued reductions in TD observed through 48 weeks of treatment. INGREZZA was generally well tolerated, with somnolence as the only
	adverse event occurring at a rate greater than or equal to 5 percent and twice placebo. In clinical trials, no worsening in safety scale scores for depression, suicidal ideation or behaviors was observed. INGREZZA has been studied in over 1,000
	individuals and more than 20 clinical trials.


	A treatment for tardive dyskinesia is a welcome and exciting step in the continued effort to
	destigmatize mental health conditions, said Paul Gionfriddo, President & CEO of Mental Health America. With an FDA approved treatment now available, individuals and doctors can have more productive and proactive conversations
	about TD.


	The FDAs approval of INGREZZA represents the culmination of over ten years of dedicated effort from the Neurocrine research
	and development teams, said Christopher F. OBrien, MD, Neurocrines Chief Medical Officer. Neurocrine would like to thank the many clinical investigators and TD patients who participated in our clinical trials. Without their
	partnership and commitment, we would not have been able to achieve this tremendous breakthrough.


	INGREZZA will be in the distribution channel next
	week and will be available through a select pharmacy network. Promotion to healthcare professionals will commence on May 1, 2017. To assist TD patients in gaining access to INGREZZA, Neurocrine has created the INBRACE

	TM

	patient support program, which will immediately begin accepting treatment initiation forms from health care professionals prescribing INGREZZA and work closely with patients and their families to
	facilitate access. INBRACE is designed to provide personalized product assistance and services. For more information, patients may visit

	About Tardive Dyskinesia (TD)



	TD is characterized by
	uncontrollable, abnormal and repetitive movements of the trunk, extremities and/or face. The condition is caused by treatments that block dopamine receptors in the brain, such as antipsychotics and other medications, which are commonly prescribed to
	treat mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depression. In patients with TD, these treatments are thought to result in irregular dopamine signaling in a region of the brain that controls movement. The symptoms of TD can be
	severe and are often persistent and irreversible. TD is estimated to affect at least 500,000 people in the U.S.



	About INGREZZA



	INGREZZA, a selective VMAT2 inhibitor, is the first and only product indicated for the treatment of adults with tardive dyskinesia. The approval of INGREZZA
	was based on data from the Kinect 3 study, a Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, fixed-dose study comparing once-daily INGREZZA 80mg and 40mg to placebo over six weeks in patients with underlying schizophrenia,
	schizoaffective disorder or mood disorder. Subsequent to the completion of the six week placebo-controlled dosing, all subjects were placed on once-daily 40mg or once-daily 80mg of INGREZZA through week 48. INGREZZA met the primary endpoint in this
	study with a mean change from baseline to week six in the AIMS dyskinesia total score of -3.2 for the 80mg once-daily group as compared to -0.1 in the placebo group (p<0.0001). Also in the Kinect 3 study:


	 




	 


	


	 


	The percentage of participants who achieved at least a 50% reduction in AIMS was 40 percent (p<0.001) in participants receiving 80mg/day of INGREZZA compared to only 8.7 percent of those who received placebo.




	 




	 


	


	 


	INGREZZA was found to be generally well tolerated, with somnolence as the only adverse event occurring at a rate of 5 percent or greater and twice placebo.




	INGREZZA inhibits VMAT2 and is thought to work by reducing the amount of dopamine released in a region of the brain that controls movement and motor function,
	helping to regulate nerve signaling in adults with TD. VMAT2 is a protein in the brain that packages neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, for transport and release in presynaptic neurons. INGREZZA, developed in Neurocrines laboratories, is
	novel in that it selectively inhibits VMAT2 with no appreciable binding affinity for VMAT1, dopaminergic (including D2), serotonergic, adrenergic, histaminergic, or muscarinic receptors. Additionally, INGREZZA can be taken together with psychiatric
	medications such as antipsychotics or antidepressants.


	Breakthrough Therapy Designation was received from the FDA for INGREZZA for the treatment of TD,
	and the New Drug Application was evaluated by the FDA with priority review.



	Important Safety Information



	INGREZZA can cause somnolence. Patients should not perform activities requiring mental alertness such as operating a motor vehicle or operating hazardous
	machinery until they know how they will be affected by INGREZZA.


	INGREZZA may prolong the QT interval, although the degree of QT prolongation is not
	clinically significant at concentrations expected with recommended dosing. INGREZZA should be avoided in patients with congenital long QT syndrome or with arrhythmias associated with a prolonged QT interval.






	The most common adverse reaction (5% or greater and twice the rate of placebo) is somnolence.
