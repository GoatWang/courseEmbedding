History[edit]
Founded in 1981 as a public company, Image began as a distributor of Laserdiscs, whose sound and picture quality surpassed that of VHS and Beta, the dominant tape formats of the time. Image successfully secured exclusive output deals with major studios such as Universal Studios, 20th Century Fox, and the Walt Disney Company and grew to become the dominant distributor of the format.
As the 1990s came to a close and Laserdiscs gave way to DVDs, Image re-focused on the fledgling format that quickly came to dominate the home video marketplace. While studios were busy managing the transition from VHS to DVD, Image began to acquire DVD rights to long-form music concert programs, television programming, foreign films and a broad array of special interest programming, all of which were being ignored by the major studios and music labels.
In 2005, Image signed a distribution deal with Bandai Visual to distribute select anime titles under the Honneamise label.[4] The deal ended in March 2007, when Bandai Visual switched over to Geneon USA.[5]
Image continued to work with its long term partner, Criterion Collection, as well as hundreds of independent content producers and rights holders to bring products to the marketplace. By the 10th anniversary of the DVD, Image has once again established itself as a dominant distributor of independently produced programs. In 2008, Image began to expand its release schedule to include feature films.
On August 31, 2010, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment partnered with Image Entertainment in a multi-year agreement, marketing and distributing some DVDs and Blu-rays by Image. Image retains its own sales and marketing.[6]
In May 2011, Image entered into an in-house film and television production agreement.[clarification needed] Its latest theatrical film is 44 Inch Chest. Most recently,[when?] the company announced the pick-up of The Tall Man, starring Jessica Biel.
On April 2, 2012, it was announced that RLJ Acquisition, Inc. had entered into an agreement to acquire Image Entertainment as well as Acorn Media and plan to merge the two companies together. The two companies operate under the banner "RLJ Entertainment".[7]

History[edit]
Founded in 1981 as a public company, Image began as a distributor of Laserdiscs, whose sound and picture quality surpassed that of VHS and Beta, the dominant tape formats of the time. Image successfully secured exclusive output deals with major studios such as Universal Studios, 20th Century Fox, and the Walt Disney Company and grew to become the dominant distributor of the format.
As the 1990s came to a close and Laserdiscs gave way to DVDs, Image re-focused on the fledgling format that quickly came to dominate the home video marketplace. While studios were busy managing the transition from VHS to DVD, Image began to acquire DVD rights to long-form music concert programs, television programming, foreign films and a broad array of special interest programming, all of which were being ignored by the major studios and music labels.
In 2005, Image signed a distribution deal with Bandai Visual to distribute select anime titles under the Honneamise label.[4] The deal ended in March 2007, when Bandai Visual switched over to Geneon USA.[5]
Image continued to work with its long term partner, Criterion Collection, as well as hundreds of independent content producers and rights holders to bring products to the marketplace. By the 10th anniversary of the DVD, Image has once again established itself as a dominant distributor of independently produced programs. In 2008, Image began to expand its release schedule to include feature films.
On August 31, 2010, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment partnered with Image Entertainment in a multi-year agreement, marketing and distributing some DVDs and Blu-rays by Image. Image retains its own sales and marketing.[6]
In May 2011, Image entered into an in-house film and television production agreement.[clarification needed] Its latest theatrical film is 44 Inch Chest. Most recently,[when?] the company announced the pick-up of The Tall Man, starring Jessica Biel.
On April 2, 2012, it was announced that RLJ Acquisition, Inc. had entered into an agreement to acquire Image Entertainment as well as Acorn Media and plan to merge the two companies together. The two companies operate under the banner "RLJ Entertainment".[7]

ABC COMMERCIAL SETS HIT AUSSIE LEGAL DRAMA NEWTON’S LAW IN MOTION WITH ACORN TV
ABC COMMERCIAL SETS HIT AUSSIE LEGAL DRAMA 
NEWTON’S LAW 
IN MOTION WITH ACORN TV
Starring Claudia Karvan (Jack Irish);
From the team behind international hit Miss Fisher’s Murder Mysteries
     
Silver Spring, MD: ABC Commercial today a nnounced it has signed a new agreement with RLJ Entertainment’s Acorn brand for rights to Australian television drama series Newton’s Law (8 x 60’).
As part of the five-year deal Newton’s Law will be available to North American audiences on world-class TV streaming service Acorn TV in Fall 2017, joining a raft of other premium international series.
“Following the critical acclaim the series enjoyed on debut in Australia, we think Acorn TV is the perfect home for Newton’s Law in North America, appearing alongside other world-class series from Australia, the UK, Canada and New Zealand,” said Jessica Ellis, Head of ABC Content Sales and Distribution.
“After our success in introducing several major Australian series to US audiences, Acorn TV is thrilled to work with ABC Commercial to bring a first-rate legal drama here,” said Don Klees, Vice President of Acorn Programming for RLJ Entertainment. “With its stellar ensemble cast led by Claudia Karvan and entertaining scripts, we know US audiences will love Newton’s Law as much as we do.”
Fast-paced and sparkling with wit, Newton’s Law centers around a suburban solicitor who attempts to return to her briefly glorious career at the Bar. The series was produced by Every Cloud Productions, the team behind international hit Miss Fisher’s Murder Mysteries, and stars a diverse cast of outstanding Australian talent, including Claudia Karvan (Jack Irish opposite Guy Pearce – also on Acorn TV), Toby Schmitz (Black Sails), Brett Tucker (Thor: The Dark World, Mistresses) and Miranda Tapsell (The Sapphires).
Called a “glorious streaming service…an essential must-have” by The Hollywood Reporter, Acorn TV is the premier North American streaming service for world-class TV from Britain and beyond. Given the limited broadcast options for US viewers to watch first rate international programs, Acorn TV offers US fans the opportunity to not only stream many of their favorite series but, more importantly, discover new and classic programs previously unavailable to US audiences. Acorn TV exclusively premieres new international programs every month from Great Britain, New Zealand, Ireland, as well as Australia, including ABC’s Janet King and Jack Irish. Acorn TV is a proprietary digital channel of RLJ Entertainment (NASDAQ: RLJE).

By using, visiting, or browsing our sites, by using our services, by clicking “Watch Now”, “Buy”, “Download”, “Play” or equivalent on our sites and services, you accept and agree to these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use our sites and services.
Changes to Terms
We may, from time to time, change these Terms, without notice to you. Such revisions shall be effective immediately. Your continued membership or use after we change these terms constitutes your acceptance of the changes. If you do not agree to any changes, you must cancel your membership and discontinue use of our sites and services.
Privacy
Personally identifying information is subject to our Privacy Policy (www.RLJEntertainment.com/PrivacyPolicy), the terms of which are incorporated herein.
Electronic Communications
When you visit one of our sites or send email to us, you are communicating with us electronically. You consent to receive communications from us electronically. We will communicate with you by email or by posting notices on this site. You agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing.
Membership
Monthly Membership. You may choose to become a member of one of our services on a monthly basis. You can find specific details regarding your membership by visiting our relevant site and clicking on the “My Account” link.
Annual Membership. You may choose to become a member of one of our services on an annual basis. You can find specific details regarding your membership by visiting our relevant site and clicking on the “My Account” link.
Differing Memberships. We may offer a number of membership plans (i.e. three month memberships), as indicated on the product detail pages. Some promotional memberships are offered by third parties. We are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties. You can find specific details regarding your membership by visiting our relevant site and clicking on the “My Account” link.
Membership Price Changes. We reserve the right to adjust pricing for our services or any components thereof in any manner and at any time as we may determine in our sole and absolute discretion. Except as otherwise expressly provided for in these Terms of Use, any price changes to your service will take effect following email notice to you.
We reserve the right to modify, terminate, or otherwise amend our offered membership plans.
Promotional Trial Periods
We sometimes offer certain customers various free trial periods. We reserve the right, in our absolute discretion, to determine your free trial eligibility.
We will begin billing you for the monthly membership fees at the end of the free trial period unless you cancel prior to the end of the free trial period. You will not receive a notice from us that your free trial period has ended or that the paying portion of your membership has begun.
Billing
Payment Method. You must have internet access and provide us with a current, valid, acceptable method of payment (as such may be updated from time to time) (“Payment Method”) to use our service. You may edit your Payment Method information by visiting our relevant site and clicking on the “My Account” link.
Recurring Monthly Billing. Sometimes we offer monthly memberships. By starting your RLJE membership and providing or designating a Payment Method, you authorize us to charge you a monthly membership fee at the then current rate, and any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of our service. We will bill the monthly membership fee to your Payment Method. You must cancel your membership before it renews each month in order to avoid billing of the next month’s membership fees.
Other Recurring Billing. Sometimes we offer three month memberships or more. By starting your RLJE membership and providing or designating a Payment Method, you authorize us to charge you the membership fee at the beginning of every cycle at the then current rate, and any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of our service. You must cancel your membership before it renews to avoid billing of the next cycle’s membership fees.
Recurring Annual Fee. Sometimes we offer annual memberships. By starting your RLJE membership and providing or designating a Payment Method, you authorize us to charge you the annual membership fee. You may also choose an annual auto-renew option, in which case, you must cancel your membership before it renews the next year in order to avoid billing of the next year’s membership fee.
Billing Cycle. The membership fee will be billed according to the membership option you choose. Visit your “My Account” section of our relevant site to see the commencement date for your next renewal period. For monthly memberships, we automatically bill your Payment Method each month on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your paying membership. In the event your paying membership began on a day not contained in a given month, we bill your Payment Method on the last day of such month. For example, if you became a paying member on January 31st, your next payment date is February 28th and your Payment Method would be billed on that date. You acknowledge that the amount billed each month may vary from month to month for reasons that may include differing amounts due to promotional offers, and you authorize us to charge your Payment Method for such varying amounts. For certain Payment Methods, the issuer of your Payment Method may charge you a foreign transaction fee or related charges. Check with your bank and credit card issuers for details. If the credit card we have on file for you is declined for payment of your membership fee, you have 7 days to provide us a new credit card or your membership will be canceled. If you provide us with a new card and are successfully charged within 7 days, your new membership period will be based on the original renewal date and not the date of the successful charge. Membership charges are fully earned upon payment.
Refunds
No Refunds for Monthly Membership Fee. Payments for your monthly membership are nonrefundable and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods. Following any cancellation, however, you will continue to have access to the service through the end of your current billing period. At any time, and for any reason, we may provide a refund, discount, or other consideration to some or all of our members (“credits”). The amount and form of such credits, and the decision to provide them, are at our sole and absolute discretion. The provision of credits in one instance does not entitle you to credits in the future for similar instances, nor does it obligate us to provide credits in the future, under any circumstance.
No Refunds for Annual Membership Fee. Annual memberships are non-refundable and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods. Following any cancellation, however, you will continue to have access to the service through the end of your current billing period. At any time, and for any reason, we may provide a refund, discount, or other consideration to some or all of our members (“credits”). The amount and form of such credits, and the decision to provide them, are at our sole and absolute discretion. The provision of credits in one instance does not entitle you to credits in the future for similar instances, nor does it obligate us to provide credits in the future, under any circumstance.
No Refunds for Other Membership Fee. Other types of memberships are also non-refundable and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods. Following any cancellation, however, you will continue to have access to the service through the end of your current billing period. At any time, and for any reason, we may provide a refund, discount, or other consideration to some or all of our members (“credits”). The amount and form of such credits, and the decision to provide them, are at our sole and absolute discretion. The provision of credits in one instance does not entitle you to credits in the future for similar instances, nor does it obligate us to provide credits in the future, under any circumstance.
Returns, Refunds, and Title of Hard Goods. RLJE does not take title to returned items until the item arrives at our fulfillment center. At our discretion, a refund may be issued without requiring a return. In this situation, RLJE does not take title to the refunded item.
No Refunds for Digital Content. All purchases and rentals of Digital Content (as defined below) are final. We do not accept returns of Digital Content.
Cancellation
Cancellations for the Monthly Membership Fee. You may cancel your RLJE membership at any time, and you will continue to have access to the RLJE service through the end of your billing period.
Cancellations for the Annual Membership Fee. You may cancel your RLJE membership at any time, and you will continue to have access to the RLJE service through the end of your billing period.
Cancellations for the Other Membership Fees. You may cancel your RLJE membership at any time, and you will continue to have access to the RLJE service through the end of your billing period.
You can find instructions regarding canceling your membership by visiting our relevant website and clicking on the “My Account” link.
Termination By Us
We may terminate your membership(s) at our discretion without notice. For Annual Members that paid the full annual fee, if we terminate your membership, we will give you a prorated refund based on the number of full months remaining in your membership. However, we will not give any refund for termination related to conduct that we determine, in our discretion, violates these Terms or any applicable law, involves fraud or misuse of your membership, or is harmful to our interests or another user. Our failure to insist upon or enforce your strict compliance with these Terms will not constitute a waiver of any of our rights.
Your Account
You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password and for restricting access to your computer, and you agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or password.
RLJE does sell products for children, but it sells them to adults, who can purchase with a credit card or other permitted payment method. If you are under 18, you may use our sites and services only with the involvement of a parent or guardian.
We reserve the right to refuse service, terminate accounts, remove or edit content, or cancel orders in their sole discretion.
The account owner’s control is exercised through use of the account owner’s password and therefore to maintain exclusive control, the account owner should not reveal the password to anyone. By sharing your password, the account owner agrees to be responsible for assuring that household members comply with these Terms and such account owner shall be responsible for the actions of the household members.
In order to provide you with ease of access to your account and to help administer our sites and services, RLJE implements technology that enables us to recognize you as the account holder and provide you with direct access to your account without requiring you to retype any password or other user identification when you revisit the service. You are responsible for updating and maintaining the truth and accuracy of the information you provide to us relating to your account. You are also responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password and for restricting access to your RLJE ready device. If you disclose your password to anyone or share your account and/or devices with other people, you take full responsibility for their actions. Where possible, users of public or shared devices should log out at the completion of each visit. If you sell or return a device, you should logout and/or deactivate the device before doing so. If you fail to log out of your device, subsequent users may access the service through your account and may be able to access certain of your account information.
If you find that you’re a victim of identity theft and it involves your account, you should notify Customer Service and report this instance to all your card issuers, as well as your local law enforcement agency. Also, you should be mindful of any communication requesting that you submit credit card or other account information. Providing your information in response to these types of communications can result in identity theft. We reserve the right to place any account on hold anytime with or without notification to the member in order to protect itself and its partners from what it believes to be fraudulent activity. RLJE is not obligated to credit or discount a membership for holds placed on the account by either a representative of RLJE or by the automated processes of RLJE.
Other Limitations, Limitations of Liability, and Disclaimers of Warranty
We reserve the right to accept or refuse membership at our discretion.
You may not transfer or assign your membership or any membership benefits.
Premium members are not permitted to purchase products for the purpose of resale or to ship to their customers or potential customers using Premium benefits.
From time to time, we may choose in our sole discretion to add or remove membership benefits from paid or free promotional programs.
Due to restrictions placed on us by our content providers, we regret that from time-to-time some programs may be restricted in certain territories.
THE RLJE SERVICE AND ALL CONTENT AND SOFTWARE ASSOCIATED THEREWITH, OR ANY OTHER FEATURES OR FUNCTIONALITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE RLJE SERVICE, ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. RLJE DOES NOT GUARANTEE, REPRESENT, OR WARRANT THAT YOUR USE OF THE RLJE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE. RLJE SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR THE USE OF APPLICATIONS, RLJE READY DEVICES, AND RLJE SOFTWARE (INCLUDING THEIR CONTINUING COMPATIBILITY WITH OUR SERVICE).
IN NO EVENT WILL WE OR OUR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVES BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR PREMIUM MEMBERSHIP. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, WILL NOT EXCEED THE LAST ANNUAL MEMBERSHIP FEE YOU PAID. THESE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY WILL APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW AND WILL SURVIVE CANCELLATION OR TERMINATION OF YOUR PREMIUM MEMBERSHIP. CERTAIN STATE LAWS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES. IF THESE LAWS APPLY TO YOU, SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU, AND YOU MIGHT HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS.

License to Digital Content. Subject to your payment of any applicable fees (including applicable taxes) to rent, purchase, or otherwise obtain access to Digital Content (as defined below), and your compliance with all other terms we specify for Digital Content, RLJE grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, limited right and license, during the applicable Viewing Period (as defined below), to access, view, use and display the Digital Content in accordance with the Usage Rules, for Non-Commercial, Private Use. As used herein, “Non-Commercial, Private Use” means a presentation of Digital Content for which no fee or consideration of any kind (other than that which you pay to us to view the Digital Content) is charged or received, which takes place in your private home or apartment or, if outside your private home or apartment (e.g., in a hotel room, dorm room, office, or airport waiting lounge) is limited to a private viewing for you and your invitees. Non-Commercial, Private Use specifically excludes any public presentation (e.g., a presentation in a dorm lounge) and any presentation by a place of public accommodation or other commercial establishment (e.g., a bar or restaurant), even if no fee is charged for viewing the Digital Content. To simplify your viewing and management of Digital Content that has a limited Viewing Period (such as Rental Digital Content and Subscription Digital Content), we may automatically remove that Digital Content from your Compatible Device after the end of its Viewing Period, and you consent to such automatic removal.
Reviews, Comments, Communications, and Other Content
Visitors may post reviews, comments, photos, and other content; and submit suggestions, ideas, comments, questions, or other information (“Feedback”), so long as the Feedback is not illegal, obscene, threatening, defamatory, invasive of privacy, infringing of intellectual property rights, or otherwise injurious to third parties or objectionable and does not consist of or contain software viruses, political campaigning, commercial solicitation, chain letters, mass mailings, or any form of “spam.” You may not use a false e-mail address, impersonate any person or entity, or otherwise mislead as to the origin of a card or other content. We reserve the right (but not the obligation) to remove or edit such Feedback for these or any other reasons, but does not regularly review posted Feedback. If you do post or submit Feedback, and unless we indicate otherwise, you grant RLJE a nonexclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, and fully sub-licensable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, and display such Feedback throughout the world in any media, for no compensation, acknowledgement, or payment to you for any purpose whatsoever. You grant RLJE and sub-licensees the right to use the name that you submit in connection with such Feedback, if they choose. You represent and warrant that you own or otherwise control all of the rights to the Feedback that you post; that the Feedback is accurate; that use of the Feedback you supply does not violate this policy and will not cause injury to any person or entity; and that you will indemnify RLJE for all claims resulting from Feedback you supply. RLJE has the right but not the obligation to monitor and edit or remove any activity or Feedback. RLJE takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any Feedback posted by you or any third party.
Unsolicited Materials. RLJE welcomes your comments regarding RLJE products, including Image’s online services. Unfortunately, however, RLJE ‘s long-standing company policy does not allow it to accept or consider creative ideas, suggestions, or materials other than those it has specifically requested. We hope you will understand that it is the intent of this policy to avoid the possibility of future misunderstandings when projects developed by RLJE ‘s professional staff might seem to others to be similar to their own creative work. Accordingly, we must, regretfully, ask that you do not send us any original creative materials such as stories or character ideas, screenplays, or original artwork. While we do value your feedback on our services and products, we request that you be specific in your comments on those services and products, and not submit any creative ideas, suggestions, or materials. If, at our request, you send or post certain specific submissions (e.g., via a message boards or contests) or, despite our request that you not send us any other creative materials, you send us creative suggestions, ideas, notes, drawings, concepts, or other information (collectively, the “Submissions”), the Submissions shall be deemed, and shall remain, the property of RLJE. None of the Submissions shall be subject to any obligation of confidence on the part of RLJE, and RLJE shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Submissions. Without limitation of the foregoing, RLJE shall exclusively own all now known or hereafter existing rights to the Submissions of every kind and nature, in perpetuity, throughout the universe and shall be entitled to unrestricted use of the Submissions for any purpose whatsoever, commercial or otherwise, without compensation to the provider of the Submissions. Applicable law may restrict or limit the foregoing provisions of this paragraph. If so, without limitation of the foregoing you agree that in no event shall RLJE ‘s liability exceed the amount payable to a writer under the Writers Guild of America Basic Agreement for a network prime time story or teleplay.
Copyright Complaints
RLJE respects the intellectual property of others. If you believe that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please notify us at inquiries@RLJEntertainment.com. Please provide us with the following information:
A physical signature (or electronic signature) of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright interest;
A description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed upon;
A description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located on the site;
Your address, telephone number, and e-mail address;
A statement by you that you have a good-faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;
A statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf.
Risk of Loss
All items purchased from us are made pursuant to a shipment contract. This means that the risk of loss and title for such items pass to you upon our delivery to the carrier.
Product Descriptions
We attempt to be as accurate as possible. However, we do not warrant that product descriptions or other content of this site is accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free. If a product offered by us is not as described, your sole remedy is to return it in unused condition.
Pricing
Except where noted otherwise, the List Price displayed for products on our website represents the full retail price listed on the product itself, suggested by the manufacturer or supplier, or estimated in accordance with standard industry practice; or the estimated retail value for a comparably featured item offered elsewhere.
Disputes
Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your visit to our sites, products, or services, sold or distributed by RLJE or through RLJE, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.
There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Terms as a court would.
To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to us at RLJ Entertainment, Inc., Attn: Legal Counsel, 6320 Canoga Avenue, 8th Floor, Woodland Hills, California 91367, USA. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA’s rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules. We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, RLJE will not to seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.
We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial. We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.
Applicable Law
By visiting RLJE, you agree that the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict or choice of laws principles, will govern these Terms and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and RLJE.

The basis on which Digital Content is available will be indicated on the product detail page for that Digital Content. From time to time, we may add or remove Digital Content and may change the basis on which Digital Content is available. Our subscription services are dynamic services and the specific Subscription Digital Content available and amount of Subscription Digital Content available will change over time. We make no guarantee as to the availability of specific Subscription Digital Content or the minimum amount of Subscription Digital Content available in any subscription. Additional terms applicable to a subscription (such as the applicable cancellation and refund policy) will be indicated on the informational pages for that subscription.
Compatible Devices
In order to be able to stream or download Digital Content and to view Digital Content, you will need to use a personal computer, portable media player, or other device that meets the system and compatibility requirements that we establish from time to time and is otherwise capable of interacting with the service (each such device, a “Compatible Device”). Some Compatible Devices may be used only to stream Digital Content, some Compatible Devices may be used only to download Digital Content, and some Compatible Devices may be used to stream and download Digital Content. We may change the requirements for Compatible Devices from time to time and, in some cases, whether a device is (or remains) a Compatible Device may depend on software or systems provided or maintained by the device manufacturer or other third parties. As a result, devices that are Compatible Devices at one time may cease to be Compatible Devices in the future.
Streaming Limits
The number of users that can stream at the same time will depend on your membership plan. You can see the limit for your account, as well as other plan options, on our relevant site and going to “My Account”.
Applications
You may encounter third-party applications (including, without limitation, websites, widgets, software, or other software utilities) (“Application(s)”) that interact with our services. These Applications may import data related to your account and activity and otherwise gather data from you. These Applications are provided solely as a convenience to you, and we are not responsible for and do not endorse the content of such Applications. SUCH APPLICATIONS ARE OWNED OR OPERATED BY THIRD PARTIES THAT ARE NOT RELATED TO, ASSOCIATED WITH OR SPONSORED BY RLJE AND MAY NOT BE AUTHORIZED FOR USE WITH OUR SERVICE IN ALL COUNTRIES. Some of these Applications may even use RLJE trademarks. Unless otherwise noted by RLJE, RLJE is not responsible for and does not endorse the content of such Applications. You will need to make your own independent judgment regarding your interaction with these Applications. If you choose, at your sole and absolute discretion and risk, to use an Application, such Application may interact with, connect to or gather and/or pull information from and to your RLJE account. By using such Applications, you acknowledge and agree to the following: (i) if you use an Application to share information relating to your RLJE account, you are consenting to the information about your account being shared; (ii) your use of an Application may cause personally identifying information to be publicly disclosed and/or associated with you, even if RLJE has not provided such information; and (iii) your USE OF AN APPLICATION IS AT YOUR OWN OPTION AND RISK, and you will hold RLJE harmless for the sharing of information relating to your RLJE account that results from your use of an Application. You must read all log-in boxes and other pop-up boxes closely for notices about sharing your RLJE account information with, through or by any other means identified on an Application. In addition, the Application’s end user license agreement, terms of use, and/or any other documentation or materials designated by the Application will govern your use of that Application. It is possible that you may be able to revoke an Application’s access to your RLJE account at any time, but information shared prior to revocation may continue to be viewable within, or otherwise continue to be used by, the Application depending on the policies of such Application.

We make no representation that our sites and services, including merchandise offered for sale on the sites and their copyrights, trademarks, patents, and licensing arrangements, are appropriate or available for use in locations other than the United States. Those who choose to access the sites from locations outside of the U.S. do so on their own initiative and at their own risk, and are responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable. With respect to shipments of merchandise to consumers, wherever they may reside, title to the merchandise and risk of loss shall pass to the buyer upon delivery of the merchandise to the common carrier.

Downloading and Risk of Loss
If you plan to download Digital Content that you purchase, we encourage you to do so promptly after your purchase. If you are unable to complete a download after having reviewed our online help resources, please contact our customer service. Once you purchase Digital Content and we make the Digital Content available to you, you are responsible for completing the download, if you choose to download, and you are responsible for all risk of loss of the Digital Content after download.
Streaming
When you stream Digital Content, the resolution and quality of the Digital Content you receive will depend on a number of factors, including the type of Compatible Device on which you are streaming the Digital Content and your bandwidth, which may go up and down over the course of your viewing. If we detect that Digital Content we are streaming to you may be interrupted or may otherwise not play properly due to bandwidth constraints or other factors, we may decrease the resolution and file size of the Digital Content we stream to you in an effort to provide an uninterrupted viewing experience. While we strive to provide you a high quality viewing experience, we make no guarantee as to the resolution or quality of the Digital Content you will receive when streaming.
Testing
We continually update our service, including the content library. In addition, we continually test various aspects of our service, including our website, user interfaces, service levels, plans, promotional features, availability of movies and TV shows, delivery and pricing. We reserve the right to, and by using our service you agree that we may, include you in or exclude you from these tests without notice. We reserve the right in our sole and absolute discretion to make changes from time to time and without notice in how we offer and operate our service.

HIGH RISK INVESTMENT WARNING:

                End-users of the NetDania software that make use of the trading integration features as direct clients of integrated brokers, should be aware of the level of risk carried by trading in financial markets. Trading foreign exchange and or other financial instruments on margin carries a high level of risk, and may not be suitable for all investors. The high degree of leverage can work against you as well as for you. Before deciding to invest you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or more of your initial investment, and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with trading, and seek advice from your broker and or an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts. Anyone opening a live trading account needs to adhere to the laws of their local country as such laws may differ from country to country.                
                
                NetDania expressly disclaims any liability for any lost principal or profits which without limitation may arise directly or indirectly from the use of or reliance on information on our website or the use of our software with broker integration.
