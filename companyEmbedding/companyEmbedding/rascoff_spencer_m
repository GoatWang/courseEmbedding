The 30-Minute Interview 
By                     
 VIVIAN MARINO
 
OCT. 21, 2014

Mr. Rascoff, 38, is the chief executive of Zillow, an online real estate database and marketplace with headquarters in Seattle.Before helping to start the company in 2005, and rising to the helm in 2010, Mr. Rascoff was involved in the travel industry. He was a founder of Hotwire, an online travel company that was sold to Expedia in 2003. He also was an investment banker with Goldman Sachs.Interview conducted and condensed by
VIVIAN MARINOQ. What brings you to New York?A. Primarily StreetEasy. When we acquired StreetEasy about a year ago, it was a relative newcomer to mobile — contrast that with Zillow, which has about three-quarters of our usage on mobile. And so over the last year, we’ve been taking the Zillow playbook to StreetEasy and expanding its product development resources against mobile. The first thing we did was make the service free; previously, it was $10 per month. Then we redesigned the website; we relaunched it on the mobile web; we launched an iPhone app; and we launched an Android app and an iPad app for StreetEasy.Q. Zillow has been quite busy the past year or so, both with the acquisition of StreetEasy and Trulia.

A. We have.Q. How exactly did the Trulia deal, an all-stock transaction announced in August, come about? Continue reading the main story

A. Our two companies have known one another, respected and competed against one another for many years. And we’ve had several merger conversations in the past, none of which amounted to much until this past summer when we approached the Trulia executives and the board of directors yet again.Q. What’s the status of the deal?A. It’s now in the regulatory approval process.We have had a lot of conversations with the Federal Trade Commission, which is evaluating the proposed transaction. I’m confident that the deal will close late this year or early next, and that it will meet the necessary regulatory approvals. They decide whether to litigate in court if they want to stop the transaction.What they’re evaluating is whether real estate agents have enough alternatives when it comes to advertising themselves and their listings. Our perspective is that real estate agents spend about $10 billion a year on advertising, and they spend about 2 percent of that on Zillow and about 2 percent on Trulia. So they have ample choice when evaluating where to spend their ad budgets.Q. Is that Zillow’s biggest revenue source?A. Our biggest revenue source comes from selling advertising to real estate agents. Specifically, we sell ZIP-code-targeted advertising.Q. After the acquisition is complete, what will be the role of Peter Flint, Trulia’s C.E.O. and a founder? A. When we close we’ll announce what the new organizational structure will be. It’s expected that Pete will run Trulia, which will be a separate brand within the Zillow family of real estate brands. We will definitely keep the name Trulia and the website, and the suite of mobile apps under the Trulia brand. So we will operate a multibrand portfolio of real estate media assets.

Q. Will there be any cutbacks once the deal is done?A. We haven’t announced whether there will be any reductions in the employee count. We’ll have more clear, organizational announcements once we close.

We have 1,100 employees. I’m not including Trulia’s 1,200 people.Q. There’s a lot of overlap between the two businesses.

A. Trulia focuses on late-stage home shoppers that are deep in the purchase funnel — by which I mean people that are actively at the home-buying phase.Zillow focuses on that market segment — people deep in the transaction — as well as earlier-stage home shoppers. For example, Zillow would appeal to a homeowner trying to keep track of the value of their home and look at their “Zestimate,” and perhaps plan a remodel or refinance their mortgage. Trulia would focus on the transaction.We were attracted to the size of the Trulia audience and the strength of its brand. Trulia has over 50 million monthly unique users and a very well-known and well-liked brand.Q. How big is Zillow’s audience now?A. Zillow has about 90 million unique visitors a month, most of which are on mobile. About 75 percent of our usage is on mobile. And we have over 200 homes that are viewed every second on a mobile device on Zillow.Three years ago, when we went public, it was about 20 homes that were viewed every second on mobile. Real estate is the ultimate mobile shopping experience. It’s when you’re untethered when you’re driving around or walking around a neighborhood that you most want access to real estate information.Q. How important is the New York market to Zillow’s overall business?A. It is the largest real estate market in the country. Therefore, it’s critical for Zillow to win in New York, and we acquired StreetEasy with that goal in mind.I grew up in New York; my mom was a real estate agent.Q. You have a pretty extensive résumé for such a young age.A. Looks like I can’t keep a job, huh?Q. You founded the travel website Hotwire.com and spent some time in that industry, before switching to real estate. Did you see real estate as an industry that needed some help in a technological sense?

Continue reading the main story

A. Yes, that’s right. When we left the travel industry, we started looking at other industries that hadn’t been impacted very much by the Internet. Real estate is a huge industry. It’s information-intensive, and it begged for consumer empowerment.Q. Where would you like to see Zillow in the next few years?A. Zillow is about 10 years old, and many technology companies start to lose a step in their second decade. They cease to be innovative and entrepreneurial. And so five or 10 years from now I hope I can say that Zillow is every bit as innovative and entrepreneurial as it was in its first decade. In terms of where that might take us, who knows?Q. So how do I raise the “Zestimate” of my house? A. The first thing you should do is claim your home on Zillow, which any owner can do, and you should make sure that your home facts are accurately represented. When we have accurate information about the home, the Zestimate becomes more accurate.

Spencer  Rascoff
CEO, Zillow Group
 
                         
                    

Overall Rank: 1Category: Technology Execs
Category Rank: 1         
           









For the first time in the SP200’s four years – and we suspect the industry’s longer history as well – someone not from the brokerage or national franchise real estate ranks is the most powerful person in residential real estate.
A brief glance at Zillow’s (NASDAQ: Z) third quarter 2016 earnings report tells a staggering story:

Revenues up 35 percent from the previous year to $224.6 million from
$165.8 million;

164 million monthly unique users, an increase of 16 percent from a year ago;

The number of agents who spend more than $5,000 per month to advertise with Zillow Group increased 80 percent from the previous year.

Perhaps most impressive of all, Zillow Group posted a third quarter profit of$6.8 million versus a loss of $26 million a year ago, quieting the naysayers who snipe that Zillow Group has never made any money and is just burning through investor capital.
In 2016, Zillow Group also settled the lawsuit with Move Inc. and NAR for $130 million, and did not miss a beat. Its industry relations effort, conducted while its top two industry representatives were under the burden of a lawsuit, has borne fruit, as just about every major MLS, franchise, and brokerage in the country is now working with Zillow. 
And the firm bolstered its presence in the industry with the acquisition of Bridge Interactive Group, which provides RETS-related services to major MLS and brokerage clients. Zillow Group also introduced its broker-focused advertising product Premier Broker, which we think could be a game-changer in improving its relationships with the brokerages who were often unhappy about its role in the increasingly online real estate industry. The company just keeps marching on.
In 2016, Rascoff was in the third spot on the SP200 because of all of the challenges facing his firm: the then-pending court case and the continuing integration challenges of Trulia with Zillow. Its Class A shares had dropped to $25 per share and its market cap was down to $4.5 billion. As of December 2016, its stock was up to $35 per share, and its market cap is $6.4 billion. What a difference a year makes.
Zillow Group’s accomplishments under Rascoff during the last year propels him to the No. 1 position on the SP200 – he is the most powerful person in residential real estate today.
Rascoff has been with the firm since inception. He was one of its founding employees in 2005 and became CEO in 2010 when co-founder and executive chairman Rich Barton relinquished the role. Prior to Zillow, Rascoff co-founded Hotwire. com, a leading Internet travel company that was sold to Expedia. He has received numerous awards, including Fortune’s 2012 40 Under 40 Hottest Young Stars in Business and Forbes’ 2016 America’s 20 Most Powerful CEOs Under 40.
