Pursuant to the notice provided to unitholders on our website on 12 May 2017 under section 601GCA of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (as inserted by ASIC Corporations (Attribution Managed Investment Trusts) Instrument 2016/489), Platinum Investment Management Limited (ACN 063 565 006) (Platinum) has made modifications to the constitutions of the Funds (Modifications) to enable each Fund to elect into the AMIT regime.
Copies of the Modifications are available free of charge by contacting Investor Services on 1300 726 700 (Australia only), 0800 700 726 (NZ only), +612 9255 7500 or emailing invest@platinum.com.au.
Reasons for Modifications
The AMIT regime was established by the Australian government to provide qualifying MITs with the ability to benefit from improved flexibility and greater certainty in respect of their tax treatment. Platinum has decided to elect the Funds into the AMIT regime with effect from 1 July 2017, for reasons which include the following:

Under the AMIT regime, taxable income will be allocated to unitholders using the concept of “attribution”, replacing the “present entitlement” model.  Please note that whilst there is a change in terminology under the AMIT regime, in practice, distributions to unitholders will continue to be allocated by Platinum on a proportionate basis in line with Platinum’s distribution policy.
The AMIT regime permits a more equitable allocation of any taxable gains that may have been realised in order to fund large redemption payments to redeeming unitholders.  Currently, all unitholders receive a distribution related to these taxable gains but, under the AMIT regime, the gains may be “streamed” to redeeming unitholders.
Platinum may be taxed on any taxable income of a Fund that it fails to allocate to unitholders, and may be liable for tax in respect of any tax offsets that have been over attributed to unitholders.
The AMIT regime provides a set of rules to deal with instances where amounts have been over-distributed or under-distributed.  It is a common feature of managed investment schemes that the tax components in unitholders’ annual tax statements may sometimes require subsequent adjustment.  Under existing laws, a new tax statement may need to be issued, requiring unitholders to amend their tax returns.  Whilst the prospect of reissuing tax statements and amending unitholder tax returns for so-called “unders and overs” remains possible under AMIT, this possibility will be reduced.
The AMIT rules will also provide a mechanism to prevent double taxation if the amount distributed by a Fund is less than the taxable income attributed.

The existing Platinum Trust Funds’ annual distribution and tax statements will be amended to comply with the new AMIT rules (AMMA statement).  The AMMA statement for a unitholder will continue to detail the unitholder’s share of attributable income but the format will change slightly.  We will update our unitholder Tax Guide for the first distribution impacted by AMIT (currently envisaged to be 30 June 2018).
Effect of Modifications
The Modifications in respect of the Funds amend the Funds’ constitutions to provide Platinum with the power to:

make an irrevocable election for the Funds to operate as AMITs (including the ability to make a choice to treat each class of units as a separate AMIT where relevant);
recover from the Funds in relation to any income tax liability incurred as a result of the Funds being AMITs;
do all things necessary to operate the Funds as AMITs; and
insert other provisions considered by Platinum as being necessary or incidental to the Funds complying with the AMIT regime.

Modification to constitutions
The attribution managed investment trust (AMIT) regime was recently enacted by the Tax Laws Amendment (A New Tax System for Managed Investment Trusts) Act 2016. Qualifying managed investment trusts (MITs) can make an irrevocable election to apply these rules.
Pursuant to the notice provided to unitholders on our website on 12 May 2017 under section 601GCA of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (as inserted by ASIC Corporations (Attribution Managed Investment Trusts) Instrument 2016/489), Platinum Investment Management Limited (ACN 063 565 006) (Platinum) has made modifications to the constitutions of the Funds (Modifications) to enable each Fund to elect into the AMIT regime.
Copies of the Modifications are available free of charge by contacting Investor Services on 1300 726 700 (Australia only), 0800 700 726 (NZ only), +612 9255 7500 or emailing invest@platinum.com.au.
Reasons for Modifications
The AMIT regime was established by the Australian government to provide qualifying MITs with the ability to benefit from improved flexibility and greater certainty in respect of their tax treatment. Platinum has decided to elect the Funds into the AMIT regime with effect from 1 July 2017, for reasons which include the following:

Under the AMIT regime, taxable income will be allocated to unitholders using the concept of “attribution”, replacing the “present entitlement” model.  Please note that whilst there is a change in terminology under the AMIT regime, in practice, distributions to unitholders will continue to be allocated by Platinum on a proportionate basis in line with Platinum’s distribution policy.
The AMIT regime permits a more equitable allocation of any taxable gains that may have been realised in order to fund large redemption payments to redeeming unitholders.  Currently, all unitholders receive a distribution related to these taxable gains but, under the AMIT regime, the gains may be “streamed” to redeeming unitholders.
Platinum may be taxed on any taxable income of a Fund that it fails to allocate to unitholders, and may be liable for tax in respect of any tax offsets that have been over attributed to unitholders.
The AMIT regime provides a set of rules to deal with instances where amounts have been over-distributed or under-distributed.  It is a common feature of managed investment schemes that the tax components in unitholders’ annual tax statements may sometimes require subsequent adjustment.  Under existing laws, a new tax statement may need to be issued, requiring unitholders to amend their tax returns.  Whilst the prospect of reissuing tax statements and amending unitholder tax returns for so-called “unders and overs” remains possible under AMIT, this possibility will be reduced.
The AMIT rules will also provide a mechanism to prevent double taxation if the amount distributed by a Fund is less than the taxable income attributed.

The existing Platinum Trust Funds’ annual distribution and tax statements will be amended to comply with the new AMIT rules (AMMA statement).  The AMMA statement for a unitholder will continue to detail the unitholder’s share of attributable income but the format will change slightly.  We will update our unitholder Tax Guide for the first distribution impacted by AMIT (currently envisaged to be 30 June 2018).
Effect of Modifications
The Modifications in respect of the Funds amend the Funds’ constitutions to provide Platinum with the power to:

make an irrevocable election for the Funds to operate as AMITs (including the ability to make a choice to treat each class of units as a separate AMIT where relevant);
recover from the Funds in relation to any income tax liability incurred as a result of the Funds being AMITs;
do all things necessary to operate the Funds as AMITs; and
insert other provisions considered by Platinum as being necessary or incidental to the Funds complying with the AMIT regime.

For years, the little-known New York hedge fund Platinum Partners stood out for double-digit investment returns that rivaled some of the biggest names in the industry.It turned out that those returns were too good to be true, according to federal prosecutors.Federal agents on Monday arrested Mark Nordlicht, a founder and the chief investment officer of Platinum, and six others on charges related to a $1 billion fraud that led the firm to be operated “like a Ponzi scheme,” prosecutors said. It is one of the largest such fraud cases since Bernard L. Madoff’s investment firm unraveled in 2008.David Levy, the firm’s co-chief investment officer, was also among those arrested in the morning by agents in Texas, Manhattan and New Rochelle, a suburb of New York City. The men were charged with securities fraud and investment adviser fraud, according to an unsealed indictment filed in Federal District Court in Brooklyn. The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a parallel civil case.Platinum tapped prominent families and foundations within the Orthodox Jewish community in New York to fuel high-stake bets on payday lenders, oil companies and even the terminally ill. But prosecutors said these investments and the firm’s performance were misrepresented by its executives. Ultimately, Platinum took in new money in order to pay longtime investors who wanted their money back, something the firm’s executives called among themselves “Hail Mary time.”

“As investors sought redemptions, the defendants engaged in numerous improper measures in an attempt to meet redemption requests, including taking out high-interest rate loans, commingling monies among funds and raising money from new investors through fraudulent misrepresentations,” said Andrew J. Ceresney, the director of the S.E.C.’s enforcement division. Continue reading the main story

Located a few blocks from Central Park, Platinum, founded in 2003, made a splash early on with some of its investments. In one bet, the firm sought to profit from the death of terminally ill patients by investing in variable insurance payouts. As part of the scheme, a rabbi in Los Angeles sought out hospice patients to get their personal details that could be used to buy insurance payouts in their names.A company that Platinum set up to make the investments was fined by the S.E.C. in January 2015. “We definitely were exploiting a loophole, but it was fully vetted by legal counsel,” Mr. Nordlicht said in an interview with Bloomberg later that year.In other bets, Platinum misled both investors and auditors — sometimes brazenly. In December 2012, for example, executives misrepresented to auditors the value of Black Elk Energy, an oil and gas company controlled by Platinum, valuing it at $283 million, prosecutors said. In fact, there had been an explosion on a Black Elk platform in the Gulf of Mexico the month before that had caused the deaths of three workers, injuries to other employees and an oil spill. Black Elk no longer exists.Jeffrey Shulse, who worked at Black Elk and is named in the government’s indictment, denied the charges. “Mr. Shulse’s indictment is a clear case of overreaching,” said F. Andino Reynal, Mr. Shulse’s lawyer, adding that his client was “confident that once a jury has had a chance to hear all the facts, it will exonerate him of any wrongdoing.”Lawyers for the defendants Mr. Nordlicht, Daniel Small, Uri Landesman, Joseph Mann and Joseph San Filippo did not respond to a request for comment. Michael Sommer, a lawyer for Mr. Levy, said he looked forward to “clearing David Levy’s good name.”

As recently as March, Platinum had $1.7 billion of investor money, as of a March regulatory filing. For years it reported a strong performance — with annual average returns of 17 percent.As recent as last year, Platinum said it made gains of 8 percent, a strong performance in a year when the average hedge fund lost 0.85 percent, according to the Hedge Fund Research Composite Index, a gauge of industry performance.

Platinum began to have trouble extracting investor money when some of its obscure investments started to sour, according to prosecutors. From 2013 to 2016, the firm could not stanch the losses in certain funds and the investor requests to withdraw money, so it began to move money between funds in what Mr. Nordlicht called a “big stew,” the indictment said.

Things seemed to reach a crisis point in June 2014, prosecutors said. “It can’t go on like this or practically we will need to wind down....this is code red,” Mr. Nordlicht wrote to Mr. Landesman, a managing director at Platinum, at the time.Yet investors remained in the dark about the firm’s precarious liquidity position. A month later, when an investor emailed to ask about the reliability of Platinum’s reported performance figures, Mr. Landesman replied, “The numbers are all kosher, they have had verbal input every month.”Investors grew restless. By March 2015, the total amount they requested to withdraw from the firm exceeded $83 million. Eventually, executives decided to pay some ahead of others, prosecutors said.“Platinum Partners purported to be a standard-bearer in the hedge fund industry,” said Robert L. Capers, the United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York. “In reality, their returns were the result of the overvaluation of their largest assets.” This inflation led to Mr. Nordlicht and others “operating Platinum like a Ponzi scheme, where they used loans and new investor funds to pay off existing investors,” Mr. Capers added.The arrests on Monday were part of an investigation among several government agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United States Postal Inspection Service. In June, Murray Huberfeld, a former Platinum executive, was arrested. He has pleaded not guilty to conspiracy and wire fraud.Soon after Mr. Huberfeld’s arrest, agents from the F.B.I. and the Postal Inspection Service raided Platinum’s New York offices. Faced with mounting pressure from federal investigators, as well as an investigation by the S.E.C., Platinum liquidated its main hedge fund.For some at Platinum, there was already a sense late last year that government investigators were closing in on the firm. In an email exchange, Mr. Nordlicht, Mr. Landesman and an unnamed principal partner in Platinum discussed fleeing to Israel, according to prosecutors.“Don’t forget the books,” the unnamed partner wrote. “Assume we are not coming back to ny.”
