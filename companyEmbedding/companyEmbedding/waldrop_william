William Waldrop
Owner


















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Daytona Beach:













Does William F Waldrop (Pe) carry a valid contracting license?



If you pay someone to construct a building or a structure, make structural alterations to load bearing walls, or perform services such as plumbing or air conditioning work, that person must have a state contractor's license.
William F Waldrop (Pe) currently holds license PE14948 (Contractor, Engineer), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Daytona Beach?



The Florida Construction Industry License Board maintains high standards for contractor licensing. Prior to receiving their license, Florida contractors are required to prove four years of relevant work experience or education; pass a board examination and prove financial solvency.











Your liability risk when hiring William F Waldrop (Pe)



In Florida, licensed contractors with employees are required to carry workers' compensation insurance and attest they have obtained public liability and property damage insurance in the amounts determined by the Board.











Financial recourse when hiring William F Waldrop (Pe)



Florida maintains a recovery fund, called the Florida Homeowners' Construction Recovery Fund, which is available to a natural person who has suffered monetary damages by the financial mismanagement or misconduct of a contractor, and who has exhausted all other sources of payment. The Board makes the determination of eligibility for an award. Florida contractors are not required to carry an active bond.











What else should I know before hiring William F Waldrop (Pe)



As of 2007, the Florida DBPR began requiring license applicants to submit their fingerprints, which are used to run a criminal background check with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. In addition, they are required to provide a credit report during the license application process to demonstrate financial stability. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The Florida Construction Industry License Board recommends getting at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

Make Some Green with Some Green

Marijuana Trends & Articles Nov 29, 2016 2 2888 



While in some states marijuana has become legal, it remains classified as a Schedule I substance. This is the ranking given to drugs with no medicinal value and the greatest opportunity for abuse. The only way the drug will be removed from this classification and legalized nationally, will be federal standards on testing cannabis to guarantee quality and safety.
“The federal government is watching the transition of cannabis in certain states from an illegal substance to a legal and regulated consumer product very closely,” commented William Waldrop. William Waldrop is the CEO of Signal Bay, which is a Life Science company whose EVIO Labs are a leader in the growing cannabis quality control testing market. Signal Bay currently operates five of its EVIO Labs in Oregon and California. The company has plans to add 18 more EVIO Labs in California by the end of 2018.
“Critical to the eventual national legalization of marijuana for recreational consumer use will be the federal government’s confidence that there is a strict cannabis testing architecture to ensure that cannabis is regulated, standardized, and safe like alcohol or any other consumer product. This is a responsibility that we at Signal Bay take very seriously, and we believe that we are perfectly positioned to capitalize on the growing need for cannabis quality control testing both in the states in which marijuana is now legal, and for the inevitable legalization of cannabis nationwide.”
Signal Targets a $850 Million Cannabis Testing Market
Investors should be looking at the cannabis quality control testing as the industry is growing and profitable. The industry is expected to reach $850 million by 2020. There are not a lot of leaders in the industry because it is harder to enter the market. Signal Bay knows that this industry is about to grow and have been aggressively buying testing space in Oregon and California. California is the largest legal cannabis marketplace in the world.
Signal Bay’s business model is unique and is similar to an industry leader in clinical laboratory services.
“It’s the hub and spokes model,” simplifies Waldrop. “In each state we have one centralized testing laboratory with other ancillary testing facilities in local markets statewide. The core centralized lab handles the bigger, high dollar testing functions while the smaller localized labs handle collection, sampling, and other testing services. This enables us to develop networks of testing laboratories that operate efficiently within each state.”
By the end of this year, Signal Bay plans to have 5 of its EVIO labs in operation, thus doubling revenues. Signal Bay hopped on the bandwagon at the right time and are going to make a lot of money once this industry picks up even more.
