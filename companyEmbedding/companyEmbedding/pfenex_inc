Learn more about biosimilars
Biosimilars 101
What are biosimilars? Why are they important? Are they safe? These questions and more are answered in our Biosimilars 101 review.
VIEW






Pfenex is a leading-edge biologics company driven by the desire to provide patients with access to safe, effective, and affordable products.
Pfenex has developed a high-quality protein production and bioanalytic technology platform approach that allows us to create biosimilars in a highly efficient manner.
We believe we are one of the only companies focused on non-glycosylated biosimilars, creating a differentiated platform approach and competitive advantage. This focus allows us to ensure a robust pipeline of high-quality therapeutics.
In addition, our unique protein production platform is well suited to vaccine development. By capitalizing on our ability to rapidly identify production strains for antigens that cannot be readily produced in other systems we enable infectious disease research and vaccine development that was previously not possible.
See our complete product pipeline below.

Pfenex Inc. Reports Unaudited Consolidated Earnings Results for the First Quarter Ended March 31, 2017
May 8 17
Pfenex Inc. reported unaudited consolidated earnings results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. Total revenue was increased by $0.1 million, or 2%, to $2.8 million in the three month period ended March 31, 2017, compared to just under $2.8 million in the same period in 2016 due primarily to licensing revenue. This was partially offset by a decrease in government contract revenue for its Px563L product candidates. Loss from operations was $10.1 million compared with $8.2 million a year ago. Net loss before income taxes was $10.0 million compared with $8.2 million a year ago. Net loss was $10.0 million or $0.43 per basic and diluted share compared with $8.2 million or $0.35 per basic and diluted share a year ago.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc. at the Supreme Court: Expediting Access to Affordable Biosimilars
June 16, 2017
From the Association for Accessible Medicines and the Biosimilars Council: Introduction: The Association for Accessible Medicines (AAM) applauds the U.S. […]

News





Pfenex’s protein production platform and bioanalytical approach to developing biosimilars enables the potential for a fingerprint-like identity to a reference product limiting the need for extensive and costly clinical trials.
Utilizing our core technology, Pfenex Expression Technology for recombinant protein production, we are able to rapidly develop and produce high-quality therapeutics.
The Pfenex product pipeline currently contains seven biosimilars and one therapeutic equivalent candidate. The 2017 global biologics market is anticipated to represent over $221 billion in product sales with virtually the entire market comprised of branded innovator products. We believe the emerging biosimilar market will be fueled by the large number of blockbuster products facing patent expiry in the next several years, abbreviated regulatory pathways for the approval of biosimilars, and a mandate for lower drug costs by governments and private payers.
Our lead products include PF582, a biosimilar candidate to Lucentis (ranibizumab) and PF708, a therapeutic equivalent to Forteo (teriparatide). Lucentis, marketed by F. Hoffmann-La Roche and Novartis AG, for the treatment of retinal diseases, achieved approximately $3.2 billion in 2016 global sales. Forteo, marketed by Eli Lilly and Company, for the treatment of high-risk fracture patients, achieved approximately $1.5 billion in 2016 global sales.
Our wholly owned candidates include PF529, a biosimilar candidate to Neulasta (pegfilgrastim) marketed by Amgen for the treatment of chemotherapy induced neutropenia that achieved global sales of $4.6 billion in 2016. In addition, PF690, a biosimilar candidate to Oncaspar (pegaspargase), PF530, a biosimilar candidate to Betaseron (interferon beta-1b),) and PF688, a biosimilar candidate to Cimzia (certolizumab-pegol) are also in development.
We also have a product partnership with Strides Acrolab, a specialty pharma company located in Bangalore, India. This includes PF444, a biosimilar candidate to human growth hormone and PF694, a biosimilar candidate to Pegasys (peginterferon alpha-2a).

Learn more about biosimilars
Biosimilars 101
What are biosimilars? Why are they important? Are they safe? These questions and more are answered in our Biosimilars 101 review.
VIEW






Pfenex is a leading-edge biologics company driven by the desire to provide patients with access to safe, effective, and affordable products.
Pfenex has developed a high-quality protein production and bioanalytic technology platform approach that allows us to create biosimilars in a highly efficient manner.
We believe we are one of the only companies focused on non-glycosylated biosimilars, creating a differentiated platform approach and competitive advantage. This focus allows us to ensure a robust pipeline of high-quality therapeutics.
In addition, our unique protein production platform is well suited to vaccine development. By capitalizing on our ability to rapidly identify production strains for antigens that cannot be readily produced in other systems we enable infectious disease research and vaccine development that was previously not possible.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Growth Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

While at Genentech, Dr. Blank has focused on monoclonal antibody process technology and has led the development and commercial scale-up of recovery processes for both full-length antibodies (including Rituxan, Herceptin, and Raptiva) from mammalian cells and antibody fragments from bacteria. The purification processes Dr. Blank developed for Herceptin and Rituxan have formed the purification platform for all of Genentech's monoclonal antibodies. He has also helped develop Genentech's approach to process validation including virus validation, modular validation, and Quality by Design. Since 2010 Dr. Blank has consulted organizations across the globe in the areas of purification process development, scale-up of manufacturing operations, process validation and characterization, virus validation, and regulatory filings.

From January 2006 to August 2013, Matt was the George B. and Joy Rathmann Professor and Director of the Amgen Bioprocessing Center at Keck Graduate Institute (KGI) in Claremont, CA, and was the founding professor of the KGI bioprocessing program, with over 108 masters and two doctoral graduates as his advisees. Prior to 1998, he worked at Genentech for 10 years, in process development and manufacturing sciences, where he developed the first licensed, high density, fed batch animal cell culture process, a core technology now used for dozens of commercial products with ~$100 billion in total annual sales. Matt has two chemical engineering degrees, a Ph.D. from MIT (1988) and BS from UC Berkeley (1983).

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.

Value Score

Momentum Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.
