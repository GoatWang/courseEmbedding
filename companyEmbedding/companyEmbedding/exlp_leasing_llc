COURT OF APPEALS OF TEXAS, FOURTH DISTRICT, SAN ANTONIO




04-14-00343-CV




Marialyn Barnard






                                      	This is an appeal from a trial court's order dismissing a tax dispute action for lack of jurisdiction. Where the entire amount assessed is in dispute, Texas Tax Code §42.08(b) does not require the taxpayer to make a prepayment of taxes to invoke the trial court's jurisdiction. The trial court's order is reversed and remanded.
EXLP LEASING LLC v. WEBB COUNTY APPRAISAL DISTRICT, San Antonio Court of Appeals, No. 04-14-00343-CV, 6/3/15.
