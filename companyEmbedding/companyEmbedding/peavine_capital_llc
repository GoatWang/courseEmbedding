PERS strategy is broadly diversified and emphasizes high quality assets. The fund is invested in over 5000 securities to ensure any individual asset will not have an undue influence on total portfolio risk. They utilize a rebalancing system to keep the portfolio in-line with its policy targets. PERS' investments include US stocks, international stocks, US bonds, international bonds and investments in private markets
