Picking Up a Released Inmate
Please first check to be sure a released inmate you may be picking up has no additional charges pending that would preclude his or her release. Family and friends who pick up an inmate should realize there will probably be a waiting period. The length of the wait will depend on the type of release being processed. The usual waiting time is 4 to 6 hours. You are invited to wait in the Reception area if you wish to do so.
