I am curious if there is some sort of timeline for GRETSCH Drums and the company's manufacture use of Jasper Drum Shells - Like - What year did GRETSCH DRUMS start using Jasper shells in their drum lines/manufacture?? - to - What year did GRETSCH DRUMS stop using Jasper Drum shells in their drum lines manufacture? I am seeing alot of people using that "JASPER" moniker to sell their Vintage Gretsch Drums lately and I thought if there is some sort of timeline of usage ,I could pick out the fakers from the real deals.
Thanks for any help on the subject in advance.

all 6 ply shells until Jasper went under...or as Bob said circa 1958-2003. 

The switch from 3 ply shells to 6 ply was when they started sourcing shells fom Jasper Wood Products instead of making them at the Brooklyn Gretsch plant. So any 6 ply Gretsch made before roughly 2003 is a Jasper shell...and the ones made since are made to the same specs..just not by Jasper.

Actually, They would use shells from Jasper and Keller. Their main source was Jasper but they would fill in with Keller. With all of the edges I have cut over the years I have seen many Keller shells on Gretsch kits. I have also seen bass drum shells used as floor toms and floor tom shells used as bass drums.

I have seen an entire kit made out of Jasper shells and the 12" tom is a Keller. I think the quality assurance guy took many days off.

Were the Kellers the same maple/gum layup or all maple?Nobody was concerned about shell layups or sourcing back in the day so I suppose a shell was a shell. Drums were made of "wood" and that was about as deep as anyone delved into things back then.

Keller all maple.Was this in the round badge and stop sign badge era or just in the Square badge era?I could see them using some Kellers during the square badge era when (pre-Kaman) Gretsch dwindled to basically a shoestring operation and/or near the end of Jasper. I'd always heard that all the 6 ply shells during the "glory years" were Jaspers.Not that there's anything wrong with Keller shells although if they weren't the right 6 ply "recipe" for "that great Gretsch sound" that might be a problem for some.

Nothing like telling a guy that just spent a grip of dough on a vintage Gretsch that his shells are not all the same. They look like their dog just died. 

Some shells have the inside grain running verticle, some horizontal. The Kellers are easy, no seams on the inside at all. The grain is always horizontal. Just the verticle seam where the veneer meets. Jasper shells had multiple horizontal seams inside and sometimes outside.

The best thing that ever happened to Gretsch was being in business with Kaman. All of the old hoops were retooled as well as the lugs. bascially everything was done right. Kaman also brought a new level of quality. 

The shells I am speaking are all era's. From the glory days up until the went into business with Kaman.

I have cut hundreds of Gretsch shells and it is always the same. I have to check each drum for thickness before I go to the router. Keller shells are thinner.

I have heard that the original purpose of the Jasper wooden tubes was as concrete forms. I've never been able to verify that but it would be thought provoking if true.

And I have seven Gretsch sets.

I dont know about the concrete forms. I tend to think not only because they are all made at 1/8" undersize. To me, that means they are made as drumshell forms. You never know!

Just so I dont come off as an ass, not every Gretsch kit I have worked on is made of mixed shells. Just that I have seen a good amount in my 26 years. If a guy loves the kit, it does not matter what the shells are made of. if a kit sounds great, it sounds great.

Really an all maple Keller is closer to what Gretsch was advertising when they did mention shell material (6 ply maple shell). There was never any mention of gum wood in the catalogs or ads. It seems that the gum is important though,  being part of the Jasper formula.

I don't think that Gretsch simply bought dedicated concrete forms and then made drums out of them...just that maybe Jasper originally made similar wooden tubes for that usage and Gretsch (who were already buying wooden guitar parts from Jasper) had them make the appropriate diameters (or perhaps slightly over the appropriate diameters since heads don't always fit so well) for drum shells.

Back in the day, nobody cared what a shell was made of. That was never part of the advertising. 

I dont know what people used to use for concrete forms. They use cardboard now. Seems like the wood could be hard to remove. Just a thought.

BYeah I don't know about that either...but Slingerland did make some drums out of cardboard concrete forms (sonotube)  .

I have owned close to twenty 80's era Gretsch kits and always suspected a few rogue drums were different. Thanks for confirming. Nonetheless, the kit I am thinking about had a thinner 12" shell than the 13" shell and sounded absolutely amazing. 

Of course, rumor had it you touched up the edges on that one, Bill.  Maybe THAT factored in!

 Just maybe........

Huh... I guess that doesn't surprise me in the least. I have seen Gretsch shells that didn't have any real difference in color between the plies, but I never thought much of it. Curious about the actual differences in thickness, I just grabbed a micrometer and ran down to the basement.

At this very moment I have a Gretsch 6-ply SSB 22" bass shell that's 10/32" thick, and a 12" SSB tom that's barely 5/32". Some other random measurements were: 3-ply bass 11/32", 3-ply snare 12/32", SSB 20" bass 9/32". These were taken in areas without wrap.

I just did them all in 32nds so nobody had to try and do fractions, because it give me a terrible headache.

For those who do not already know - this is a link to the Jasper Furniture Factory/Gretsch history:http://gretschpages....ti/22808/page1/ I also traded some emails to Jasper Wood Products when I bought my 58 Gretsch in Sept 2009.   I was looking for anything connected to Jasper and Gretsch drums.  I got in touch with former JWP worker Philip Gramelspacher.  He eventually sent me some more literature and a Jasper Wood Products advertisment brochure.These are his emails to me in 2009:Gary,Jasper Wood Products is the company you are looking for.  Unfortunately, they went out of business around January of 2002.  I worked there for 23 years.  We made drums for Gretsch I believe up through the 1990's.   I hope this helps to answer your questions.  Good luck with your efforts.Sincerely,Jasper DeskPhilip J. GramelspacherHello Drummer Gary,You look good behind your Gretsch drums.  I talked to someone who worked in the office at Jasper Wood Products for 50 years in the inside sales area.  He confirmed my thoughts that the drums we made were of Sweetgum inner plies and the two outside faces (inside and outside) were Hard Maple.  He also confirmed we did make drums in the 50's and 60's for Gretsch.  This was before my time there so he would be the one to know.Gary,The hard maple we used in the drums is also referred to as Sugar Maple.  We purchased the maple from mills in the upper parts of Wisconsin and Michigan.  These areas grew lots of nice white color maple that the drum companies wanted. Also, we do have some literature saved that we could send you.  One of the brochures is an original you can keep. (We have a couple extra of those) The other one we scanned and printed copies for you as it was very scarce.  Please send me your mailing address and we will get this info out to you. Take care,Philip GramelspacherI hope this answers your question and if you need any other information, feel free to ask.  I will do the best I can to help get the answers.  In the meantime, keep the sweet sounds coming off of your vintage drums and enjoy them.  Take care, Philip Gramelspacher

I have played in Jasper, IN and the town is full of some very nice people.  It's a shame that Jasper Wood Products Co. did not survive.

It's not every day a perfect stranger with no corporate obligation would take the time to reply back to an out-of-the-blue email.  Not only did he reply but he sent and/or arranged for you to receive literature that to most seems insignificant but to Gretsch nuts is invaluable.  To say Mr. Gramelspacher was accommodating would be a gross understatement.Thank God personal humanity still exists.Nice!

Monteith's body was found by hotel staff after he              missed his check-out time, Lepard said.               "We do not have a great deal of information as to cause of death,"              Coroner Lisa Lapointe said.               Lepard said Monteith had been out with people earlier and that              those people are being interviewed.               Monteith had voluntarily entered rehab for substance abuse              problems in April.               *** end quote ***               A young man's death.                For whatever reason, by whatever cause, is sad.               I don't watch GLEE.

By far its youngest            player, Andujar said his veteran teammates taught him a lot,            particularly the mental side of the game.             “The older guys on the team, they’ve been through [everything],            they’ve been out of college six or seven years,” the rising junior            told The Rumble’s Zach Braziller. “They already know what it takes.            It felt good, because at Manhattan I have to lead always. Coming on            this team, I was the underdog, the rookie, they had to lead me. It            had to be the one to listen instead of talking.            Emmy Andujar             “It’s going to help me become more of a leader on and off the court,            knowing what to tell my guys before and after games, just being that            glue guy for my team.”             Andujar, whose mother is from Puerto Rico, played with the            18-and-under team in high school and was invited to tryout in June.            He made the team and went to China with the squad for three weeks            for the 2013 Stankovic Cup, which included scores of professional            standouts overseas and former NBA players. Puerto Rico finished            fourth out of six teams, going 2-3.             As part of the trip to China, the team visited group homes, met with            children and went sightseeing. They were also mobbed, asked for            autographs and to pose for pictures, when wearing their Puerto Rico            shirts.             “It’s crazy how packed the street is and how everyone noticed us and            showed us a lot of love,” Andujar said.             Andujar said he thinks the experience will pay off, using the            lessons he learned and bringing them with him to Riverdale this            season. He hopes to help the Jaspers to a MAAC crown this winter —            they reached the conference championship game last March — and down            the road would like to play for Puerto Rico again, possibly even at            the 2016 Olympics in Brazil.             “I’ll stay in contact [with them],” he said. “Hopefully I can get            the opportunity again. It’s a pride thing, to represent my country.”             *** end quote ***             [JR: I dispute the reported about "classes".

Ripp Named Chief Executive Officer of Time Inc.            Press Release: Time Warner Inc. – 3 hours ago             NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--             Time Warner Inc. (TWX) today announced that Joseph A. Ripp will            become the Chief Executive Officer of Time Inc. Mr. Ripp, a former            top Time Inc. and Time Warner executive, is currently the Chief            Executive Officer of OneSource Information Services, Inc. and will            begin his new role in September.             In March, Time Warner announced plans for the legal and structural            separation of Time Inc. from Time Warner through a spin-off.            Following the separation, Time Inc. will be an independent publicly            traded company.             Time Warner Chairman and CEO Jeff Bewkes said: “Joe is a seasoned            executive who has been immersed in the intersection of digital,            advertising and publishing for the past decade. He is respected as a            strategic leader who has delivered financial results throughout his            career, and he also happens to have a thorough understanding of Time            Inc.’s business. We have great confidence that Joe will maximize            Time Inc.’s iconic brands, scale and industry-leading position to            create value for its stockholders.”             Mr. Ripp began his media career at Time Inc. in 1985, and held            several executive level positions there and at Time Warner over the            course of nearly 20 years. Mr. Ripp first joined Time Inc. as            Assistant Comptroller and was elevated to Senior Vice President, CFO            and Treasurer of Time Inc. in 1993. Mr. Ripp then served as            Executive Vice President and CFO of Time Warner Inc. from 1999 to            2001, when he became CFO of America Online. In 2002, Mr. Ripp was            named Vice Chairman of America Online where he oversaw advertising,            technology, operations, marketing, human resources and legal until            he left the company in 2004.             Mr. Ripp said, “I’m privileged to have this rare opportunity to lead            a company I’m passionate about at such a significant moment in its            history and future. Knowing Time Inc. as I have, I’m confident that            it has all the elements for success as it enters a new chapter as an            independent public company– industry leadership, strong executives,            powerful brands, great journalistic talent, and a track record of            innovation.”             After leaving Time Warner in 2004, Mr. Ripp was President and COO of            Dendrite International, a leading provider of sales, marketing,            clinical, and compliance solutions for the global pharmaceutical            industry.

In 2010, Mr. Ripp entered into a            partnership with GTCR, a leading private equity firm, to form            Cannondale Investments. In 2012, GTCR and Cannondale Investments            acquired OneSource Information Services, Inc. As CEO of OneSource,            Mr. Ripp built a world class, digitally focused marketing and            information services platform that provides online business            information and sales intelligence solutions.             Mr. Ripp was a member of the Board of Directors of Greenfield Online            until it was sold to Microsoft in 2007. He has also served on the            Boards of Whittle Communications and American Express Publishing. He            currently serves on the Board of Trustees of Manhattan College and            the Board of Directors of the Advertising Educational Foundation.

He is based in            the firm’s Los Angeles office.             “Particularly in an era of declining federal funds and limited state            and local dollars, infrastructure owners continue to move toward            alternative delivery methods, such as design build, for their            largest and most complex projects,” said Harvey Hammond, PE, HNTB            executive chairman. “At HNTB, our design-build experts work in a            highly collaborative environment with contractor clients to deliver            advanced technical and innovative solutions for a wide range of            infrastructure programs.”             McSpedon, who has been with the firm since 1995, has three decades            of experience in both the public and private sectors of the            transportation industry. An executive-level engineer, he is a member            of the HNTB Companies board of directors and has previously served            as HNTB’s director of corporate development, identifying and            overseeing strategies to grow the firm, and he has managed the            design and construction of some the country’s largest public works            programs. Past design-build project experience includes the Alameda            Corridor Trench in Los Angeles and the San Francisco International            Airport extension for the Bay Area Rapid Transit District.             Quickly becoming a preferred alternative delivery method,            design-build construction streamlines project delivery through a            single contract between the owner and the design-build team.            Projects can be completed more efficiently and safely, mitigating            risks to schedule and costs for contractors and owners.             “HNTB is committed to being the leader in this market,” said            McSpedon. “Our focus on technical excellence and building long-term,            value-based relationships with our private- and public-sector            clients allows us to deliver exceptional results on the largest,            most complex design-build infrastructure projects and programs.”             Current HNTB design-build projects include the Interstate 405            Sepulveda Pass Improvements project in Los Angeles, the Kamehameha            segment of the Honolulu High-Capacity Transit Corridor Project, the            State Route 99 Alaskan Way Tunnel project in Seattle, the BART Warm            Springs Extension Project, the “Green Build” Terminal 2 West            Building and Airside Expansion project at San Diego International            Airport, and the new Levi’s Stadium for the San Francisco 49ers in            Santa Clara, Calif.             To date, 47 states and Puerto Rico have adopted the design-build            process as a way to deliver large, complex projects faster and            within extremely constrained budgets. HNTB supports nationwide            adoption of the design-build project delivery method.             “When it makes sense, all infrastructure owners should have the            option to use design-build to speed and streamline complex project            delivery,” said McSpedon.             McSpedon is active in numerous national associations as well as            civic organizations in the Los Angeles area. This includes serving            on the board of directors of the Construction Industry Round Table,            as well as memberships with the American Society of Civil Engineers,            the Construction Management Association of America, and the board of            directors of the Los Angeles Sports Council. He has a Master’s            degree in civil engineering (transportation) and a Bachelor of            Science in civil engineering (structural/transportation) from            Manhattan College.

Curiously, they don’t do the same for            pro-choice candidates.             *** begin quote ***             Here are 10 questions you never hear a pro-choice candidate asked by            the media:             1. You say you support a woman’s right to make her own reproductive            choices in regards to abortion and contraception. Are there any            restrictions you would approve of?             2. In 2010, The Economist featured a cover story on “the war on            girls” and the growth of “gendercide” in the world – abortion based            solely on the sex of the baby. Does this phenomenon pose a problem            for you or do you believe in the absolute right of a woman to            terminate a pregnancy because the unborn fetus is female?             3. In many states, a teenager can have an abortion without her            parents’ consent or knowledge but cannot get an aspirin from the            school nurse without parental authorization. Do you support any            restrictions or parental notification regarding abortion access for            minors?             *** end quote ***             First three question are great.             Seems like we could split the "pro-choice" front?             # - # - # - # - #            # # # # #       # # # # # Subscribe:                             Distribute_Jasper_Jottings-subscribe@yahoogroups.com Unsubscribe:                    Distribute_Jasper_Jottings-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com Submit material:               Distribute_Jasper_Jottings-owner@yahoogroups.com # # # # #      # # # # #
