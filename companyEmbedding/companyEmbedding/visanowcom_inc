Envoy provides a challenging, fast-paced work environment where the Executive team is supportive and strategic in planning and improving our disruptive technology to help people, by providing a fully transparent and simple way to handle immigration and visa cases from start to finish.

It’s great to work for a company that helps people fulfill their dreams. By facilitating global mobility, Envoy is opening the doors to the world to innumerous individuals. Consequently, we are helping these individuals to expand their minds and unlock their full potential. Envoy is a lot more than just a software company that streamlines the immigration process and makes it easier for Administrators and their Foreign Nationals. Envoy is a conscious and responsible future that is right before our eyes and that I feel lucky to be part of the revolution. 





Ricardo Azambuja
Account Executive
at Envoy





As an immigrant myself, I’ve seen firsthand just how stressful the process can be for everyone involved. I love that I work for a company that strives every day to help employers hire the best talent from around the globe and families be reunited with their loved ones. Envoy is bringing the immigration process up to speed with the times. We’re disrupting the immigration routine and creating an evolved process that provides individuals with the opportunity to share their talents with the world.

For sales if you do what management asks, do the dials, go on the meetings, you will make money.

Make it clear why decisions had to occur and what the process is going forward, it seems after 2 years the place is finally settling into a flow which is only going to move the company forward.

Regarding job security, my sense is that most of the recent turnover has been a result of:1. company adapting strategy (for example, focusing more on marketing and product development (so people actually want to buy it) instead of cold calling to land new accounts (HR professionals are not receptive to cold calling if they don't know what your product is!))2. people finding things they would rather do--fine by me, just go and be happy3. a (sometimes mutual) decision that it wasn't a good fitI would be more worried if the company were stagnant and kept trying the same thing over and over again without getting the desired results. Then we all would be out of a job.
