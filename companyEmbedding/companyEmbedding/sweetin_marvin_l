  Additionally, the Board of Directors has promoted Marvin L.

Sweetin will have overall responsibility for pipeline and distribution safety and compliance, business process and change management, new technology evaluation and deployment, supply chain and facilities management, and workforce development.  "This new senior position reporting to the Chief Executive Officer is further confirmation of the critical importance we place on safety for our employees and the customers we serve," said Cocklin.
