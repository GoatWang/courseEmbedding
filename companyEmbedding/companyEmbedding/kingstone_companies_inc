Kingstone Companies, Inc.: 139 Years Old And Still Growing Stronger - Kingstone Companies Inc (NASDAQ:KINS) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Kingstone Companies, Inc.: 139 Years Old And Still Growing StrongerDec.14.15 | About: Kingstone Companies (KINS) Looking For Diogenes Biotech, mid-cap, research analyst, dividend investingSummaryI share the extensive history of this company.I share the vision of the new leadership team.I share the strengths and limitations that investors face in investing in their stock.
In October of 1886, the Statue of Liberty, sitting at the entrance to New York City's harbor, was unveiled to the U.S. citizenry. That was 139 years ago. If an investor believes that comparable durability, longevity, plus a sustainable business model has credence for one's investing dollars, I just might have the company for your consideration.
In the same year, 1886, in a small bucolic village about 100 miles north of New York City, a company was formed that still survives and thrives to this day. The original name of the company was the Commercial Mutual Insurance Company. The company is now called, Kingstone Companies, Inc. (NASDAQ:KINS). The company was founded in Kingston, New York, where it sits on the western side of the Hudson River in the Hudson Valley. The above picture gives you the modern day version of the place where Kingstone was created. Being far from the congestion of New York City and the daily influence of decision making being dominated by Wall Street machination has its advantages. A place like Kingston, where high prices don't erode revenues from being available for spending on building a sustainable company, makes it an ideal place for nurturing a company.
Kingstone offers property and casualty insurance products, mainly to small businesses and individual clients. Their product line-up includes personal insurance for homeowners, dwelling fire, multi-plex and condominium family dwellings, renters, equipment and service line endorsements, and personal umbrella policies. They also offer commercial liability insurance for owners that have no residential exposure for where the insurance applies. Kingston also writes physical damage coverage on for-hire-vehicles and car service vehicles. This means that they have coverage for the growing car service businesses, like Uber and Lyft. And last, but not least, they offer policies for canine liability, for those dogs that like to bite some thing, or some one.

History of the Company:

(Excalibur Sword in the stone symbolizes the legacy of Arthur. Maybe the same image can symbolize the legacy of Kingstone.)

Created in 1886 as the Commercial Mutual Insurance Company-CMIC. Their area of marketing was limited to the general area around Kingston.
In 2006 Kingstone purchased the controlling interest CMIC.
With new management in place they opted to under go demutualization from the company's original chart in 2009, and renamed it Kingston Insurance Company. Later they changed the holding company into Kingstone Companies, Inc. At this time the new management had put in place their plans to expand their area of doing business.
In 2011 they gained approval from the state of Pennsylvania for them to do business in their state.
Also in 2011, they issued their first dividend of $0.03 a share.
In 2013, they had an IPO that raised net proceeds of $18.8 million, with the stock being issued at a price of $5.95.
The premier rating agency, A.M Best, in 2010 assigned (KNIS) their beginning rating of "B". Subsequently it was raised to "B+" in 2014. Recently Best lifted their rating to "B++". They aren't at the desired "A" rating, as of yet, however they are rapidly moving toward that goal. The rating increases are reflective of the recognition for the growing financial fundamentals of Kingstone's operations.
With their growth plan in place, they have extended their marketing area. Currently, they have clearance to market their coverage in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and Texas. They have a pending clearance in one more state. IMO, the spreading of risk over a more diverse area is essential for sound growth and a more balanced underwriting of risk exposures.

From these key metrics one can see that gross premiums have shown excellent growth over the last four years. This growth has continued in 2015. Through the 3rd Q, 2015, premium growth has been 22.1%. However, it should be noted this is based on one line of business underwriting being systematically eliminated from their insurance offerings. This is being done by not renewing existing policies in the area of commercial auto coverage. (More on this later.) The book value has also increased in a constantly growing pattern where it now stands at $6.00 per share, YTD, 2015.
It's also nice to see that by owning this stock one can participate in yearly increases in dividends being paid. Currently, and with the dividend being paid this month, the annual rate is $0.25 per share. At the time this article is being written the shares area trading at the $9.00 level. At this point, the dividend results in a return of about 2.77% on your capital investment.

From these key metrics one can see that gross premiums have shown excellent growth, over the last four years. This growth has continued in 2015. Through the 3rd Quarter, 2015, premium growth has been 22.1%. However, it should be noted this is based on one line of business underwriting been systematically eliminated from their insurance offerings. This is being done by not renewing existing policies in the area of commercial auto coverage. (More on this later)
I might also point out, at the end of the 3rd Q, 2015; Kingstone's policies in force had grown by 18.0% year-over-year. Currently, 95% of this growth is coming from downstate New York, which includes NYC and Long Island. The good news is that Kingstone has undertaken a major effort for expanding their national area of coverage beyond the tight historical boundaries, where the concentration had been the aforementioned down-state New York area. I will add more to this expansion undertaking, later in the article.
As one can note, since the end of 2014, the quarterly results reflect a nice double digit growth in total revenues. I think it safe to assume that the current quarter will replicate a continuation of this growth. One might observe from this data, the 1st Quarter is the quarter that reflects the smallest net income result. This should be expected as it's this quarter where insurance company should see the greatest amount of claims due to the winter months having a major impact on dwellings. Considering that historically Kingstone has the majority of their insurance coverage in a small geographic area that has extreme weather conditions during this period, such results should be the norm. With the current expansion, with the proper underwriting in place, this could be abated going forward where premium income and claims can be spread over different weather and climate conditions.
Also, from this data it's highly noticeable that since the end of 2014, the 3rd Quarter result reflects an excellent 33% growth in net income. If the current 4th Quarter merely repeats the 3rd Quarter's net income level, then for the full year (2015), we would see net income coming in at $7.45 million. Based on the outstanding shares being only 7.3 million, this would create a net income of just over a $1.00 per share.

There are many takeaways from this data set. The first being the current trailing P/E is 9.82, where the forward P/E (FYE 12/31/16) is 7.42. With this projected earnings growth it shouldn't be out of the realm, during 2016, where we could have the current P/E growing by 20-25%. This is supported by the current book value per share being $6.00. With just a 2x book, the share price would be at $12.00, or 33% above the current price. (This is all predicated on revenues and earnings continuing on the current trend.)
Another key component of the Kingstone story is the fact that they have no outstanding long term debt on their books. As mentioned, there is great merit in having the company domiciled in the Hudson Valley, as opposed to a large city where real estate prices and employee cost being well above the norm. Mentioning employees, Kingstone has in place an employee profit sharing plan so there is a great incentive for employees being dedicated to their workplace and company objectives. Kingstone owns their office building and with planned growth they have room for expansion.

KEY ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION:

With only a few years under new leadership, Kingstone has made great strides in redirecting the company into a boarder based insurance underwriter.
New leadership has grown revenues and profits, reflecting double digit growth in these critical areas.
Operating efficiency has improved each year since 2011, and it's on track for 2015 reflecting further improvement in this key metric.
Company is located in an area where it provides lower-cost employment.
Company has ownership of their operational facilities, thus reducing cost of doing business. Plus, they have space for future expansion needs.
Employees have profit sharing program, enhancing their incentive for doing a good job, plus holds down expense of replacing employees and incurring related expenses.
Since September, 2013, Kingstone has grown their book value from $4.47, to the current $6.00 valuation. This represents a 34% increase. Over same period of time they have grown the quarterly dividend from $0.04 to current $0.0625 rate. This represents a 56% growth rate.
Experienced management team with interest tied to shareholders. Directors and senior management own approximately 29% of shares outstanding.
For a small insurance underwriter it is key that they don't have exposure to a single catastrophe they could undermine financial capabilities for meeting claim obligations. As of July 1, 2015, they have in place new agreements for reinsurance that provides better downside protection for any major adverse events.
From a limited geographic location, where they did underwriting, the company has now started an expansion effort that currently involves five states, with approval currently pending for another state.

Key Issues of Concern:

Kingstone currently is sporting a market cap that is under $70 million. Over recent years, with the new management, they have shown remarkable results in key financial metrics. Recent results must be followed with the same diligence and operational execution. The expanded scope of their market is key, but must be planned and implemented with strict due diligence for sound underwriting of their policies and policy holders. The original geographic area of down state New York where most of their clients lived, has experience several major storms that impacted insurance companies. The recent storm, called Sandy, is a prime example. Even the major insurance companies have undergone strict limitations on the areas where they will offer coverage with exposure to massive storms. With new coverage being written now in Texas, the same issues exist. Major companies will not offer homeowner coverage in the coastal counties subject to Gulf of Mexico storms. Keystone has to be diligent with their underwriting for such areas. It wouldn't be prudent for Kingstone, or any other carrier to step in just because there are homeowners who can't get coverage from the former carriers in these areas. Continued growth is essential, but prudent growth is more essential!
With Kingstone's recent decision to phase out commercial auto coverage, this was a wise decision being made. People who drive company vehicles aren't as careful with their driving habits, as compared with the actual owners who are making monthly car payments. With that said, expanding their offerings is critical since they are using a direct sales forces of independent agents to market their insurance programs. So more options for their key agents is critical for growth, but do the building of such offerings with diligent consideration.
Kingstone only has 7.3 million shares in the float. This presents a liquidity problem for buying and selling the stock. Any orders to purchase the stock should be done with strict limits on your bid price. Always be mindful, limited shares works as a positive for the upside. However, also as a negative, if this requires one attempting to sell their position.
This is not a stock for your grandmother's account, and not one for mortgaging your farm. It is my opinion that this is a stock with the 'potential' to return a nice capital gain, while offering a decent return with their dividend policy. My perspective is based on a long-term outlook for the stock. Any market contraction can and will impact companies like Kingstone. However, if the fundamentals stay in tact, maybe our great grandkids will be thankful for our investing in the stock in 2015, where then they might be able to review a history of more than three centuries showing continued growth, as seen now.


For a more in-depth look at Kingstone's financials I would suggest you visit their website and review the comprehensive investor presentation they made back in November.
Good luck with your investing decisions!

        Improve performance
    




If your system is lagging or a program doesn’t respond or won’t load, you may have a memory shortage. You may see subtle signs, like poor performance in everyday tasks, or you may be receiving “out of memory” messages.
Add reliable Kingston memory and watch your productivity soar. Pages may load faster and launching new applications may be easier and faster, leaving you more time for that important project.

 



        Build your own PC
    

Thinking of building your own rig? It’s a great way to get exactly what you want in a system.
Before you start, consider your motherboard’s technology. Is it DDR3 or DDR4? How many slots are available for memory? Does it have to be installed in pairs, triplets or quads? At what speed do you want your memory to perform?
By answering these questions, you’ll have a better idea of what you need and what Kingston memory will work best in your system. 




 



        Replace your memory
    




In case your memory fails, rest assured that Kingston can deliver what you need to get back up and running.
If you’re using a brand-name system or you know the name of your whitebox system’s motherboard, use our configurator to find the right module.
If you know the specs of the memory in your whitebox system, our product selection tool is for you. Finding the memory you need is easy with Kingston.

Frequently Asked Questions


					Featured Questions
				



Why is my new DDR3 memory not working in my computer although it matches the same specifications as my old memory?


It may be due to chip density, especially if you have an older DDR3 based system. Your system may require 2Gbit (Gigabit) density DRAM chips and the memory you installed is using 4Gbit density chips which is not compatible. Not to be confused with the term Gigabyte (capacity of the memory). 2Gbit chips are no longer being produced by the DRAM chip manufacturers therefore we're unable to manufacturer compatible modules.

How do I find out how much memory is installed in my system?


In Windows, click on the start button and open "Control Panel".Use classic view for Vista and 7. Then open "System". This will display basic information about the computer including the amount of RAM installed.

In MacOS, select "About This Mac" or "About This Computer" from the Apple menu in the upper left corner of your Desktop. This will provide information about your Mac's total memory (built-in memory plus DIMMs or SIMMs installed).


In Linux, open a terminal window and enter the following command: cat /proc/meminfo 
This will show the total amount of RAM as well as other memory information.

When I installed memory in my Notebook, the system did not boot or did not recognize the memory. How do I resolve this?


First, make sure you have the correct memory for your Notebook. Please refer to Kingston’s on-line Memory Search at www.kingston.com for assistance. After you confirm that you have the correct memory for your system, do the following:

Prior to memory installation, first shut down the Notebook, then remove the battery pack and unplug the power cord. Reseat the memory firmly into the socket and then push down on the memory to lock it in place. Replace the battery pack and power cord and boot the system. If the installation is still unsuccessful, try inserting the memory into a different slot, if available.
If you have properly installed the recommended memory and the PC still does not boot or recognize the memory, you may need to download the latest BIOS from your computer manufacturer’s Website. 

Note: Kingston is in no way responsible for any problems resulting from flashing the BIOS. Flashing the BIOS is merely a troubleshooting suggestion. Customers who flash the BIOS do so at their own risk. All instructions on how to upgrade the BIOS will be provided by the computer manufacturer or the 3rd party BIOS manufacturer and not by Kingston.

When I installed memory into my desktop computer, the system did not boot or did not recognize the memory. How do I resolve this?


							First, make sure you have the correct memory for your computer. Please refer to Kingston’s on-line Memory Search at www.kingston.com for assistance. After you confirm that you have the correct memory for your system, do the following:

Shut down and unplug your computer.
Reinsert the memory module(s) with the largest capacity in the first socket followed by the smaller capacities in descending order. To ensure the memory modules are installed properly, line up the memory notches with the key in the memory socket, then push the memory firmly into the socket until the tabs lock the memory into place.
Make sure all the cables in your computer are connected properly. You may have failed to connect a needed power connector to the motherboard or accidentally disconnected a cable to your hard drive. 
If you have properly installed the recommended memory and the PC still does not boot or recognize the memory, you may need to download the latest BIOS from your computer manufacturer’s Website.

Note: Kingston is in no way responsible for any problems resulting from flashing the BIOS. Flashing the BIOS is merely a troubleshooting suggestion. Customers who flash the BIOS do so at their own risk. All instructions on how to upgrade the BIOS will be provided by the computer manufacturer or the 3rd party BIOS manufacturer and not by Kingston.

Will additional memory speed up my computer? 


Additional memory will not necessarily increase the performance of your computer. It will allow you to run more programs or processes at once or more memory intensive programs. There may be a performance increase if the original amount of memory installed was close to insufficient for the programs and processes you use the computer for.


FAQ: KTM-012711-GEN-07

How do I install memory into my computer?


For desktop computers, shut down and unplug your computer and open the case. Please note: The higher capacity memory should be installed in slot 1 followed by the next lower capacity memory in slot 2 and so on. Please refer to your motherboard manual for proper slot identification.
Remove the memory module as shown in Fig 1. Push the tabs (1) outward and the module will gently pop out of it's slot (2). Remove it completely from the slot.
To Install the new memory module see in Fig 2. 
Push the tabs (1)that are at the ends of the memory socket outward and align the memory notches with the key of the memory socket (2), then push the memory down FIRMLY into the socket so the latches lock the memory in place (3).
If the memory has been properly installed and still not detected and you do have the correct memory you should make sure you have the most up to date BIOS from your computer manufacturer's website.


For notebook computers, please note that before you remove/install memory in notebooks you need to shut down the unit and remove the battery pack and power cord. Push the memory in FIRMLY so that it makes good contact (it is important to push the memory in FIRMLY) into the socket before pushing it down to lock in place (See figures below) . Once the memory is installed please put the battery back in your unit and give it power using the power cord and not solely from the battery. If the memory has been properly installed and still not detected and you do have the correct memory you should make sure you have the most up to date BIOS from your computer manufacturer's website.

BIOS - Basic Input/Output System is installed on the computer's motherboard. It controls the most basic operations and is responsible for starting your computer up and initializing the hardware. It is data that is usually held in a ROM chip, which can be updated by "flashing" the BIOS as it's called. BIOS upgrades may correct errors, support new CPUs, support new hardware, including memory etc. BIOS updates are usually obtained by the computer's manufacturer's website.
*NOTE: Kingston in no way is responsible for any problems resulting from flashing the bios. Flashing of the bios is merely a trouble shooting suggestion. Customers that flash their bios do so at there own risk. All instructions on how to upgrade the bios will be provided by the computer manufacturer or the 3rd party bios manufacturer and not by Kingston.

What is the difference between the part numbers that are in dual or triple channel kits and the parts that sold individually? 


Parts sold in kits (denoted by "K2" or "K3"in the part number, e.g. – KVR400X64C3AK2/2G) are specifically packaged for use in Dual or Triple Channel motherboards. Although Dual and Triple Channel technology resides on the motherboard itself (inside the chipset), the memory modules need to be installed in pairs or sets of three for Dual or Triple Channel mode to function properly. Identical modules packaged in a kit work best because the motherboard will be accessing all the memory modules as a single memory location with a wider bandwidth. Kingston suggests the use ofmodules sold in kits for Dual or Triple Channel enabled motherboards.

Will a faster memory of the same type run at a slower speed, i.e., 400Mhz DDR in a 333Mhz DDR system? 


Yes. In most cases if the computer supports a slower speed, it will clock down to a slower speed as long as it is the correct memory type (DDR, DDR2, etc). But be aware the function of clocking down depends on the computer and it isn't guaranteed to work in every case


FAQ: KTM-021011-GEN-16

My BIOS or a diagnostic program such as CPU-Z shows the memory is running at half the frequency. Why?


In many cases, the BIOS or a diagnostic program will report the memory bus frequency, which is half of the frequency for DDR type memory. As its name implies, DDR (Double Data Rate) data rate is twice the memory bus frequency. So if the memory bus speed is 800MHz and you are using DDR3-1600 memory, the RAM is running at the correct speed.

What is ESD?


ElectroStatic Discharge, ESD is simply the discharge of built up static electricity.ESD should not be taken lightly as this is one of the few things an individual can do to damage or destroy their computer or hardware components.It is like when you rub your feet on the carpet and you touch something metal.ESD can occur without the user feeling a shock and will occur when only working on the inside of the computer or handling hardware.
How to help prevent ESD The best method of preventing ESD is to use an ESD wrist strap or a grounding mat or table.However, because most users do not have access to these items, we have included the below steps to help reduce the chance of ESD as much as possible.

Standing – We recommend that you are standing at all times when working on the computer. Setting on a chair can generate more electrostatic.
Cords - Make sure everything is removed from the back of the computer (power cord, mouse, keyboard, etc).
Clothes - Make sure not to wear any clothing that conducts a lot of Electrical Charge, such as a wool sweater.
Accessories - To help reduce ESD and help prevent other problem, it is also a good idea to remove all jewelry.
Weather - Electrical storms can increase the ESD risk; unless absolutely necessary, try not to work on a computer during an electrical storm.In very dry areas, the air itself becomes a part of the electrostatic build-up mechanism every time there is an air flow (wind, air conditioning, blower) passing over an insulated surface.Do not let high humidity levels build a false confidence, and beware of corrosion problems with interconnects and other electrical interfaces.

To learn more about ESD and how to protect your electronics, please refer to the below site.

Need Help With Your Invention or Product Idea?
If you are an inventor with a patent or just someone who has one great idea for a new invention, we can help you make it very profitable.
We are licensing agents in search of great inventions, both with patents and without patents, to bring to market by way of a licensing agreement.
Simply put, we find companies who will manufacture and distribute your invention and give you a generous royalty percentage of sales.
Let Us Pay For It!
Besides a nominal small fee to evaluate your invention, which only serves to weed out those that are simply curious, we are only compensated when we license a deal for you.
Depending on how developed your invention is at the time you submit it, our services of marketing and licensing for your invention or patent can range but may include:
Invention Marketing and Licensing Services



•  Patent assistance
•  Market research
•  Prototype development
•  Engineered drawings
•  Computer renderings
•  Manufacturing feasibility
•  Invention marketing material creation
•  Networking with potential licensees
•  Trade show representation
•  Invention presentation
•  Licensing negotiation
•  License agreement administration



So, if your invention is great like you say it is, and we choose to represent you, all other costs for seeking a license deal will be paid by us!
There are no hidden charges, no large up-front fees, just a no-risk-high-reward offer that we are making to those with great inventions!
