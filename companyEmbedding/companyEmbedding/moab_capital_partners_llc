Maples Fund Services’ customisable approach and sophisticated infrastructure, coupled with the expertise of its team in working with debt funds, were key elements in the asset manager’s decision to migrate from its existing fund administrator.  Maples Fund Services was also selected to provide fund accounting services to Moab’s new insurance dedicated fund which launched on September 1, 2015 with US$25 million.“Having previously been serviced by a division of a large investment bank, we decided to focus our search on independent administrators for their adaptive nature and the increased flexibility they can provide,” said Chad Goldstein, Moab Capital Partner’s Chief Financial Officer and Chief Compliance Officer. “Maples Fund Services has the capabilities to provide superior service to funds like ours with a variety of strategies that invest throughout the capital structure. In addition, the firm’s long-term view towards client relationships as well as its cutting edge approach to technology further supported our decision to partner.”“The new relationship with Moab is a testament to our ability to deliver adaptable, highly specialised solutions to increasingly complex fund structures,” Jason Brandt, Maples Fund Services’ Regional Head of Fund Services – Americas, said. “We look forward to developing a productive, long-lasting relationship with Moab Capital Partners as we help them bring new efficiencies to their operations.”  Categories: Press Releases      Back to the top          Search filters  Categories      All Articles (67) Events (19) Hedge Funds (73) Press Releases (53) Technology (31)                     Our ServicesHedge FundsFund of Hedge FundsManaged AccountsFamily Office/Private WealthPrivate Equity/Real EstateInstitutional Investors   Industry Insight    Staying Agile Amid Regulatory Uncertainty and Increasing Investor Demands Maples Fund Services Supports Award-Winning Serica Credit Balanced Fund MCAs and the Role of Partnership in Dynamic Portfolio Management Maples Fund Services Recognised for Reporting Solutions MaplesFS Announces Dublin Office Relocation        Our Team    Search filters        Location   Location Boston Cayman Islands Delaware Dubai Dublin Hong Kong London Luxembourg Montreal New York San Francisco Singapore     Team   Team Business Development & Client Solutions Client Service Team Executive Management Information Technology and Data Management MPMF Fund Management Regional Heads Risk Management and Compliance    Search          MAPLESFSMAPLES FIDUCIARYMAPLES AND CALDERMAPLESFS CONNECTDisclaimerPrivacyModern Slavery ActSitemapSearchMaplesFS Mobile© 2017 Maples Fund ServicesWeb design agency - Liquid Light
