Description
Journey with the congregation as Curt Landry walks us through the life and times of Father Abraham. Although Abraham is an iconic figure, Curt reminds us that he was considered righteous because of his faith, not because of his perfection. As we evaluate the fathering choices made by our ancient ancestor, we can begin to understand the disconnect between fathers and sons in this current time in history. Curt Landry prepares us to know our identity through our Heavenly Father, and to come together both Jew and Gentile, one in Messiah. 
-Ozzy and Harriet was just a show
– You don’t have an emotional right to behave as damaged goods
– ALL things have been made new

                This review was written for Key United Methodist Beliefs - eBook.
            
 
            I purchased this book because I serve as the pastor of a small group of worshippers living at a senior apartment complex. Though not officially connected with the UM Church, the group was begun by a now extinct UM Church. Though I was raised in the UM Church, I am now associated with the Wesleyan Church; at the same time I want to be fair to the UM church that began this small ministry.


The book is a bit light compared to most of the theology books I am familiar with - both those from a reformed perspective and the Wesleyan/Arminian world in which the UM Church finds itself.


"Key United Methodist Beliefs" is written as much as a devotional as a text book. It introduces the reader to the historical theological foundations that have defined UM theology through the years. Each chapter includes a reading focusing on the topic at hand, a brief catechism of questions and answers, and a set of devotional questions related to the current topic.


I found the book to be useful for my purpose of assisting in helping me to be familiar United Methodist thought. I appreciated having this small monograph available for reference and review.

                Description
            
Bible Collection: Abraham (TNT) -- This powerful film, which premiered on TNT and stars Richard Harris and Barbara Hershey, is based on the moving Bible story in which an ordinary shepherd is called upon by God to show his abiding faith in extraordinary ways. Abraham and his wife, Sarah, embark on a difficult journey through the desert to the Promised Land where Abraham would become father to countless generations. Bible Collection: Jacob (TNT) -- Matthew Modine and Lara Flynn Boyle turn in heartfelt performances as Jacob and Rachel in this poignant romance. Jacob agrees to work for seven years in order to marry the woman he loves, only to be deceived by her father. Forced to start a family with another woman, Jacob agrees to continue his labor in order to win the love of his life.Bible Collection: Moses (TNT) -- Moses is awe-struck when God, in the form of a burning bush, calls him to guide the Israelites out of bondage. The reluctant leader and his flock begin the treacherous journey to the Promised Land. However, Pharaoh intends to stop the exodus and with his brutal army traps the Israelites by the Red Sea. Yet these Israelites are God’s chosen people, and the waters part, allowing their safe passage. Starring Ben KingsleyBible Collection: Joseph (TNT) -- Joseph, the enemy of his jealous brothers, is sold to a powerful Egyptian and faces unbearable tests of cruelty and pain. Joseph's master's wife falsely accuses him of treachery and rape. What looks like sure tragedy ends in the greatest triumph in this powerful epic as the goodness of God transcends the evil intents of men. Starring Paul Mercurio and Ben Kingsley. Parental discretion advised.Bible Collection: David (TNT) -- Here is one of the greatest sagas in all human history—the story of Israel's greatest king. He became a nationally known hero while still a teenager in his battle with the giant Goliath. Thereupon his life was caught up in the whirlwind of his people’s life and destiny. Never far from danger, political intrigue, the jealousy of opponents, and the problems caused by his own surging passions, David, nevertheless, emerged as a "man after God's own heart." Starring Nathaniel Parker as David.Bible Collection: Samson And Delilah (TNT) -- Samson and Delilah is a stunning film based on the most provocative of all Biblical tales.  Samson (Eric Thal) is a simple shepherd with the strength of a titan and the destiny to fight the Philistines and General Tariq (Dennis Hopper).  Delilah (Elizabeth Hurley) is a Philistine beauty, torn between her love for the shepherd and loyalty to her people.  As told in the Old Testament, Samson's betrayal by Delilah left him in slavery.  But Samson's epic revenge vanquished his Philistine foes and made him one of the greatest heroes of the Bible.  Samson and Delilah is the powerful tale of a deception that brought down an empire and sealed their names in eternity. Parental discretion advised (some sexual content).DVD Features for each of the above: Languages: English, SpanishSubtitles: English, Spanish, FrenchClosed Captioned**THESE PROGRAMS CAN ONLY BE SHIPPED TO LOCATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA.**

I LOVE these movies. There are absolutely no others out there that can compare to these!  I recommend these to anyone who loves and wants to see the stories in the Bible come to life. They are as close to the real thing as I am sure anyone on earth can relay in a movie form. My sister had them on VHS years ago and now I am blessed to have them on DVD. Thank you Lord!

I just love these movies I watch  them every Saturday. I watch it because I am a Seventh Day Adventist. I am on Cook Island and I want to say that Saturday is the day you rest.

 Product Description 

Who would have guessed the amazing quantity of new facts that have recently come to light concerning the brilliant servants of God who ministered in the earth between 2000 and 1000 B.C.?The Third Thousand Years were ten tempestuous centuries and we now know more about the lives and writings of the leading prophets of that exciting age than ever before in history.For example, a whole treasure of prophecy concerning our own day was once in the fiftieth chapter of Genesis, but somehow it was stripped out of the Bible. Now this tremendously important scripture has been restored, and in this present volume the complete text is analyzed in every detail.There is also the full panorama of the amazing life of Moses, and the flood of miracles that exceeded any other epic until the ministry of Jesus Christ.There is also the story of Joshua, the great Ephraimite general who conquered Palestine. Then there are now details concerning the lives of Gideon, Deborah, Samson, Ruth, Eli, Samuel, and the tragic biography of the famous King Saul.All of these belong to the provocative and dramatic unfolding of events during the exciting three thousand years.This book is designed to make the study of the Bible an inspirational pleasure. Although presented for easy reading, the text is carefully documented so that every important point can be correlated with appropriate passages in the scriptures. The extensive use of maps, charts and illustrations also facilitate the rapid unfolding of the Biblical story.
