2 Stocks that Cut You a Monthly Check
Looking for monthly income? Here are two stocks that pay 12 times a year that you may not know about.











                Reuben Gregg Brewer
            

                (TMFReubenGBrewer)



            
            Jul 19, 2017 at 7:43AM
            
            





Dividend checks are nice, but most companies only pay four times a year. That means you need to either create a three-month budget or find stocks with staggered pay dates if you want to replace your monthly paycheck.
A few companies, however, cut you a check each month. Companies like Vermilion Energy Inc (NYSE:VET)and Pembina Pipeline Corp (NYSE:PBA). Here's a quick look at each.
1. Canadian oil
Vermilion Energy is a $3.6 billion market cap oil and natural gas driller based out of Canada. It pays monthly and currently yields around 6.5%. Despite the deep oil downturn, it's held its dividend steady at $0.215 per share a month since 2014. Debt is a little on the high side at around 45% of the capital structure, but interest expenses only ate up about 6% of revenues in the first quarter, and the company had a solid current ratio of around 1.7.

The interesting thing about Vermilion is that it's relatively small, but it has a global footprint. That includes operations in its home market of Canada and drilling businesses in the United States, Australia, Germany, France, the Netherlands, and Ireland. And it's been growing its production right through the downturn, with another 10% boost expected in 2017. One other interesting thing about Vermillion: it believes it can cover its dividend and sustain capital expenditures with oil priced as low as $40 a barrel.

If you've been looking at oil companies, you might want to do a deep dive on Vermillion and its monthly dividend check.
2. Canadian pipes
If you don't like the idea of dealing with often volatile energy prices, then Pembina's midstream business may be more your speed. The current yield is around 4.8%, and the company's dividend has increased each year since it converted from a Canadian trust to a corporation in late 2010.
While you may not have heard the name Pembina before, it's a $13 billion market cap company, so it has a sizable business. Debt, meanwhile, is relatively modest at around a third of the capital structure. And it's still growing, with roughly $4 billion worth of capital projects scheduled for 2017 alone. It's also on track to complete the purchase of midstream competitor Veresen late in the year. That continues a long history of growth at the company.

Pembina has an enviable position in the Canadian Oil Sands region, but don't think that this is just a play on Canadian pipes. The company has extended its business across the entire midstream space, from pipes to processing, terminals, and logistics. Roughly 80% of its business is fee-based, with the Veresen acquisition set to take that up over 85%. If you want a steady monthly paycheck, Pembina is worth a closer look.





Collecting the check
Monthly dividends solve a problem that faces many retirees, namely creating a budget around just four dividend checks a year. With Vermilion and Pembina you can collect those monthly payments from old hands in the energy and midstream industries. And both handily managed the oil downturn that started in mid-2014, continuing to grow their businesses despite commodity headwinds. All in all, why not collect monthly dividend checks while investing for the future?

Energy Commentary: EIA Expects U.S. Production To Increase In 2018





 






Energy Commentary: EIA Expects U.S. Production To Increase In 2018
Wednesday, July 12, 2017Sector CommentaryThe energy sector is poised for a higher start, building onto the prior two days of gains from support in the crude complex and broader equity futures. A bullish API report last night lifted futures on both sides of the Atlantic while major stock indices were higher ahead of Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's testimony to Congress.WTI and Brent crude oil futures are up over 1.5% in early trading, with WTI outpacing the UK benchmark, rising ahead of the EIA report which analysts expect to show U.S. inventories likely shrank again last week after the API report last night. The industry group’s report showed crude stocks fell by 8.1 million barrels last week to 495.6 million, which was massively bullish compared with analysts' expectations for a decrease of 2.9 million barrels and that stocks at the Cushing, fell by 2 million barrels. Also offering support was a new report from the EIA which now expects U.S. production to increase in 2018, albeit at a lower rate than previously estimated. Yesterday’s revised short-term energy outlook report showed a lower production forecast for 2018 to 9.9 million barrels a day, slightly down from around 10 million before.

U.S. stock index futures rose ahead of the Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen’s semiannual testimony before the House Financial Services Committee, in Washington. In Europe, a run higher for energy shares and miners, as well as strong updates from retailers Burberry and B&M helped markets to trade higher, though renewed pain for publisher Pearson weighed on the media sector. Asian bourses recorded a mixed trading day. Oil rose in response to a fall in U.S. fuel inventories and a cut in the U.S. government's forecast for crude output next year which raised hopes that a supply glut is easing. Gold rose and continued its recovery from this week's near four-month low.

UPDATE 1-Shell to sell stake in Corrib gas field in Ireland for $1.23 bln
Wednesday, 12 Jul 2017 |  6:59  AM ETReuters

(Adds background, share price)
July 12 (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell is to sell its 45 percent stake in the Corrib gas venture to a subsidiary of Canada Pension Plan Investment Board for up to $1.23 billion, marking the oil company's exit from the upstream business in Ireland.
The deal includes an initial consideration of $947 million and additional payments of up to $285 million between 2018-2025, subject to gas price and production, Shell said in a statement on Wednesday.

The transaction will result in an impairment charge of around $350m, which will be taken in Q2, 2017, Shell said.
CPPIB, Canada's biggest public pension fund, and Canada's Vermilion Energy Inc will become the new operator of the Corrib Gas Venture situated off then north-west coast of Ireland.
The development of the Corrib field, discovered in 1996, has faced protests, including by residents opposed to a pipeline to bring the gas onshore.
In late 2015, gas began to flow from the field, which Shell has estimated could meet up to 60 percent of Irelands gas needs.
Statoil, which owns a 36.5 per cent stake in the Corrib gas field, was not immediately available to comment.
The total sale price of $1.23 billion also includes a payment of up to $171.83 million contingent on annual average (NBP) prices being above 2.03 euro cents/kWh between 2018 to 2022, Shell said.
The transaction, which is subject to partner and regulatory approval, is expected to complete in the second quarter of 2018, the company said.
Shares in Shell were up 1.7 percent at 2079 pence at 1031 GMT.

Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Vermilion Energy Inc. Announce Strategic Partnership in Corrib (CNW Group/Vermilion Energy Inc.)
 


 


 







 



TORONTO and CALGARY, July 12, 2017 /CNW/ - Canada Pension Plan Investment Board ("CPPIB") and Vermilion Energy Inc. ("Vermilion") (TSX, NYSE:  VET) are pleased to announce a strategic partnership in the Corrib Natural Gas Field in Ireland ("Corrib"), whereby CPPIB will acquire Shell Exploration Company B.V.'s ("Shell") 45% interest in the project, with Vermilion operating the assets after completion of the acquisition.  Through its wholly owned subsidiary, CPP Investment Board Europe S.a.r.l., CPPIB has entered into a definitive purchase and sale agreement with Shell, to acquire 100% of Shell E&P Ireland Limited ("SEPIL"), which holds Shell's 45% interest in Corrib (the "Acquisition") for total cash consideration of €830 million, subject to customary closing adjustments and future contingent value payments based on performance and realized pricing.  The Acquisition, which remains subject to customary conditions and receipt of all necessary government consents, has an effective date of January 1, 2017 with closing anticipated in the first half of 2018.
At closing, Vermilion will assume operatorship, and CPPIB plans to transfer SEPIL along with a 1.5% working interest to Vermilion for €19.4 million (before closing adjustments).
Following the transfer to Vermilion, ownership in Corrib would be as follows:

CPPIB would hold a 43.5% non-operated interest 
Vermilion would hold a 20% operated interest 
Statoil ASA would continue to hold a 36.5% non-operated interest


The transaction also contemplates two contingent payments; one linked to price and one linked to produced volumes:

Up to €150 million contingent on NBP prices being above 2.03 Euro cents/kWh on an annual basis from 2018 to 2022; and 
Up to €100 million subject to exceeding certain production thresholds through 2025.


Corrib is located 83 kilometers off the northwest coast of Ireland.  The field has a gross plant capacity of approximately 350 million cubic feet of natural gas per day, provides approximately 60% of Ireland's natural gas consumption and constitutes approximately 95% of Ireland's gas production.
Avik Dey, Managing Director and Head of Natural Resources at CPPIB said, "Ireland is an attractive destination for a long-term investor like CPPIB, and through this investment in the Corrib gas field, we are able to further our strategy of investing in high-quality natural resources assets alongside highly regarded and experienced operating partners such as Vermilion. Vermilion has a strong operational track record in both onshore and offshore projects and we look forward to working with them and are confident that this investment will benefit the CPP Fund by delivering strong risk-adjusted returns over the long-term horizon of the Fund."
Anthony Marino, President and CEO of Vermilion said, "We welcome CPPIB as a strategic partner in this world-class gas field, and we look forward to a productive long-term relationship.  Our ownership in Corrib and investment in Ireland date back to 2009, and we are proud to be a part of the energy industry in this stable jurisdiction.  Our extensive experience in Europe, North America and Australia over our 23-year history will serve us well in Corrib.  We look forward to working with SEPIL employees and Corrib stakeholders to implement our best-in-class approach to safety, environmental protection and strategic community investment." 
Pro forma for the transfer of SEPIL from CPPIB, Vermilion's incremental 1.5% ownership of Corrib would represent approximately 850 boe/d at current production rates and approximately 2.0 million boe of 2P reserves(1) based on an independent evaluation by GLJ Petroleum Consultants Ltd. with an effective date of December 31, 2016.  Assuming a purchase price of €19.4 million ($28.4 million at current exchange rates), before closing adjustments, the transaction metrics are estimated at approximately $33,400 per boe per day, $15.40 per boe of proved plus probable reserves(1) including future development capital (generating a 2P recycle ratio of 1.9 times based on projected 2017 netbacks), and 3.3 times estimated 2017 operating cash flow(2) using the current forward commodity strip.  Vermilion expects the acquisition to be accretive for all pertinent per share metrics including production, fund flows from operations(2), reserves and net asset value.  Vermilion intends to fund this acquisition with existing credit facilities.
The acquisition would significantly increase Vermilion's degree of operating control of its asset base.  Following the assumption of operatorship of Corrib, Vermilion estimates that it will operate 87% of its production base as compared to 72% currently.

(1)  Estimated proved plus probable and proved developed producing reserves attributable to the Assets as evaluated by GLJ Petroleum Consultants Ltd. in a report dated February 27, 2017 with an effective date of December 31, 2016.  
(2)  Non-standardized and non-GAAP financial measures: This news release includes references to certain financial measures which do not have standardized meanings prescribed by International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS"). Fund flows from operations is a non-standardized financial measure that is calculated as cash flows from operating activities before changes in non-cash operating working capital and asset retirement obligations settled. We analyze fund flows from operations both on a consolidated basis and on a business unit basis in order to assess the contribution of each business unit and our ability to generate cash necessary to pay dividends, repay debt, fund asset retirement obligations and make capital investments. Free cash flow and operating cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures. Free cash flow is calculated as fund flows from operations less capital expenditures. Operating cash flow is calculated as fund flows from operations before general and administration expense, interest and income taxes. We consider free cash flow and operating cash flow to be key measures as they are used to determine the funding available for investing and financing activities, including payment of dividends, repayment of long-term debt, reallocation to existing business units, and deployment into new ventures. For additional information on non-standardized and non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to the Management's Discussion and Analysis contained in Vermilion's 2016 Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2016 available on SEDAR or at the Company's website (www.vermilionenergy.com).

Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Vermilion Energy Inc. Announce Strategic Partnership in Corrib

TORONTO, ONTARIO and CALGARY, ALBERTA--(Marketwired - Jul 12, 2017) -  Canada Pension Plan Investment Board ("CPPIB") and Vermilion Energy Inc. ("Vermilion") (TSX:VET)(NYSE:VET) are pleased to announce a strategic partnership in the Corrib Natural Gas Field in Ireland ("Corrib"), whereby CPPIB will acquire Shell Exploration Company B.V.'s ("Shell") 45% interest in the project, with Vermilion operating the assets after completion of the acquisition. Through its wholly owned subsidiary, CPP Investment Board Europe S.a.r.l., CPPIB has entered into a definitive purchase and sale agreement with Shell, to acquire 100% of Shell E&P Ireland Limited ("SEPIL"), which holds Shell's 45% interest in Corrib (the "Acquisition") for total cash consideration of EUR830 million, subject to customary closing adjustments and future contingent value payments based on performance and realized pricing.

Statoil ASA would continue to hold a 36.5% non-operated interest

Assuming a purchase price of EUR19.4 million ($28.4 million at current exchange rates), before closing adjustments, the transaction metrics are estimated at approximately $33,400 per boe per day, $15.40 per boe of proved plus probable reserves(1) including future development capital (generating a 2P recycle ratio of 1.9 times based on projected 2017 netbacks), and 3.3 times estimated 2017 operating cash flow(2) using the current forward commodity strip. Vermilion expects the acquisition to be accretive for all pertinent per share metrics including production, fund flows from operations(2), reserves and net asset value. Vermilion intends to fund this acquisition with existing credit facilities.
The acquisition would significantly increase Vermilion's degree of operating control of its asset base. Following the assumption of operatorship of Corrib, Vermilion estimates that it will operate 87% of its production base as compared to 72% currently.

(1) Estimated proved plus probable and proved developed producing reserves attributable to the Assets as evaluated by GLJ Petroleum Consultants Ltd. in a report dated February 27, 2017 with an effective date of December 31, 2016. 
(2) Non-standardized and non-GAAP financial measures: This news release includes references to certain financial measures which do not have standardized meanings prescribed by International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS"). Fund flows from operations is a non-standardized financial measure that is calculated as cash flows from operating activities before changes in non-cash operating working capital and asset retirement obligations settled. We analyze fund flows from operations both on a consolidated basis and on a business unit basis in order to assess the contribution of each business unit and our ability to generate cash necessary to pay dividends, repay debt, fund asset retirement obligations and make capital investments. Free cash flow and operating cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures. Free cash flow is calculated as fund flows from operations less capital expenditures. Operating cash flow is calculated as fund flows from operations before general and administration expense, interest and income taxes. We consider free cash flow and operating cash flow to be key measures as they are used to determine the funding available for investing and financing activities, including payment of dividends, repayment of long-term debt, reallocation to existing business units, and deployment into new ventures. For additional information on non-standardized and non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to the Management's Discussion and Analysis contained in Vermilion's 2016 Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2016 available on SEDAR or at the Company's website (www.vermilionenergy.com).

Why Energy Stocks Have Been Weak

Kay Ng | July 10, 2017 | More on:  VET VET








 




Energy stocks have been weak in the last couple of months. This at least has partly to do with France?s plan to stop selling gasoline and diesel cars by 2040, which followed India?s more aggressive plan of doing the same thing by 2030.

France is doing this to combat global warming. It seems the country is serious about this as it also plans to stop issuing new oil and gas exploration permits this year. India?s objective is to lower the fuel-import cost and running cost of vehicles.

No matter what the reason, there?s no doubt that the demand for oil and…

Energy stocks have been weak in the last couple of months. This at least has partly to do with France’s plan to stop selling gasoline and diesel cars by 2040, which followed India’s more aggressive plan of doing the same thing by 2030.
France is doing this to combat global warming. It seems the country is serious about this as it also plans to stop issuing new oil and gas exploration permits this year. India’s objective is to lower the fuel-import cost and running cost of vehicles.
No matter what the reason, there’s no doubt that the demand for oil and gas will decline no matter what level of decline will occur in the number of gasoline and diesel cars.
Is Vermilion Energy’s yield in danger?
France’s actions will have a direct impact on Vermilion Energy Inc. (TSX:VET)(NYSE:VET), an international oil and gas producer which produces about 17% of its oil in France and generates 23% of its fund flows from operations there.
With the latest developments, Vermilion Energy shares have dipped below $39 per share and now offer a yield of 6.6%. I don’t think Vermilion Energy’s yield is in danger right now. It’ll take time for countries to phase out of gasoline and diesel cars for electric cars.
Vermilion Energy estimates it will generate about $595 million of fund flows from operations this year. Based on the company’s outstanding shares of 120.9 million and its annual payout of $2.58 per share based on the current monthly dividend of $0.215 per share, it’ll pay out almost $312 million in dividends. This equates to a payout ratio of 52.4%.
If we subtract the exploration and development capital spending of $295 million, the company’s payout ratio will roughly be 104%.
The company has had payout ratios of more than 100% before, but it has still maintained and increased its dividend three times since 2003. So, it shows management is committed to the dividend. Moreover, Vermilion Energy has a dividend-reinvestment program that will give it some cushion as well.
Investor takeaway
The decreasing demand for oil and gas in France and India can worsen the oversupply situation and push oil and gas prices lower. That’s why most oil and gas stocks continue to be weak. For example, year to date, shares of Vermilion Energy, ARC Resources, and Suncor have declined 31%, 27%, and 16%, respectively.
Investors are better off being underweight in oil and gas, and if they must have exposure, stick to more defensive names, such as Enbridge and Suncor.




Fool contributor Kay Ng owns shares of ENBRIDGE INC and VERMILION ENERGY INC. The Motley Fool owns shares of Enbridge. Enbridge is a recommendation of Stock Advisor Canada.






NEW! This Stock Could Be Like Buying Amazon In 1997

For only the 5th time in over 14 years, Motley Fool co-founder David Gardner just issued a Buy Recommendation on this recent Canadian IPO. 
Stock Advisor Canada’s Chief Investment Adviser, Iain Butler, also recommended this company back in March – and it’s already up a whopping 57%!

Breakthrough IPO Receives Rare Endorsement

 




Why are over 15,130 well-positioned and in-the-know Canadian investors all counting down to two very specific days this month at 4 p.m.?

It has to do with an amazingly telling profit signal we’ve come to call a “Ground Floor Event” (even though it’s completely unrelated to an IPO)…
And one that’s made a few lucky investors who’ve paid close attention to under-the-radar events like these gains of 832%... 5,480%... and even 7,902% over the past 5 to 10 years. 
You can join the roughly 0.03% of Canadians who’ve already positioned themselves to capitalize on this next “Ground Floor Event” – but you must act soon…

Any person receiving IR Information acknowledges (i) the need to conduct their own thorough investigation of Vermilion and its activities before considering any investment in its securities; and (ii) that IR Information contains statements that are considered to be "forward-looking statements" or "forward-looking information" within the meaning of applicable Canadian and United States securities laws (collectively, "forward-looking statements"); forward-looking statements are based on Vermilion’s current expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could materially affect future results; Vermilion assumes no obligation to revise or update forward-looking statements to reflect new circumstances, except as required by applicable securities laws; IR Information also contains statements (such as net debt, fund flows from operations and netbacks) that are not determined in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“Non-GAAP measures”); Non-GAAP measures included in IR Information do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and therefore may not be comparable with calculations of similar measures by other companies; in IR Information certain natural gas volumes have been converted on the basis of six thousand cubic feet of gas to one barrel equivalent of oil; barrels of oil equivalent (boe) may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation; a boe conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet to one barrel of oil is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead; IR Information also refers to reserves and resources, and all reserves and resources have been estimated using the definitions in the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation Handbook (the "COGE Handbook") as prescribed by National Instrument 51-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities.   See Vermilion's publicly filed documents, filed on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and on the SEC’s EDGAR system at www.sec.gov, for a description of risks and uncertainties that could affect Vermilion's future results and for a discussion of Non-GAAP measures, including a reconciliation to the nearest IFRS measure, and for reserves and resources information including estimated reserves and resources as evaluated by Vermilion's independent qualified reserves evaluators.

Vermilion Energy Inc. Announces 2015 Year-End Summary Reserves and Resource Information
February 29, 2016


CALGARY, Feb. 29, 2016 /CNW/ - Vermilion Energy Inc. ("Vermilion", the
 "Company", "We" or "Our") (TSX, NYSE: VET) is pleased to announce
 summary 2015 year-end reserves and resource information.  The estimates
 of reserves and resources and other oil and gas information contained
 in this news release has been estimated by GLJ Petroleum Consultants
 Ltd. ("GLJ") and prepared in accordance with National Instrument 51-101
 "Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities" of the Canadian
 Securities Administrators ("NI 51-101") and the Canadian Oil and Gas
 Evaluation Handbook ("COGEH"). For additional information about
 Vermilion, including Vermilion's statement of reserves data and other
 information in Form 51-101F1, report on reserves data by independent
 qualified reserves evaluator or auditor in Form 51-101F2 and report of
 management and directors on oil and gas disclosure in Form 51-101F3,
 please review the Company's Annual Information Form for the year ended
 December 31, 2015, to be filed on March 4, 2016 and available on SEDAR
 at www.sedar.com and on the SEC's EDGAR system at www.sec.gov.


HIGHLIGHTS



Total proved ("1P") reserves increased 6% to 160.7 mmboe(1), while total proved plus probable ("2P") reserves also increased 6% to 260.9
 mmboe(1).  This represents year-over-year 1P and 2P per share reserves growth of
 2% and 1%, respectively.


Finding and Development ("F&D")(2) and Finding, Development and Acquisition ("FD&A")(2) costs, including Future Development Capital ("FDC") for 2015 on a 2P
 basis decreased 48% to $8.98/boe and 55% to $10.03/boe, respectively. 
 Similarly, our three-year F&D and FD&A, including FDC, on a 2P basis
 were $14.82/boe and $17.81/boe, respectively.


Achieved a $212.6 million (12%) reduction in FDC costs attributable our
 existing assets through reductions in drilling, completions and
 facility capital costs.  This was partially offset by the addition of
 $38.4 million of FDC related to properties acquired during the year
 resulting in a net reduction in FDC of 11% to $1.6 billion in 2015.


Recycle ratio (including FDC) was 3.6x during 2015, an increase over
 3.2x achieved during 2014, indicating that Vermilion has been able to
 maintain our high level of investment efficiency despite the decline in
 commodity prices.


In 2015, we added 34.0 mmboe of 2P reserves with 30.5 mmboe (90%) of
 additions coming from exploration and development ("E&D") activities
 and 3.5 mmboe (10%) of additions through acquisitions.


Replaced 152% of production at the 2P level through E&D related
 activities and 170% including acquisitions.  At a 1P level, we replaced
 142% and 146% of 2015 production, respectively.


Increased Proved Developed Producing ("PDP") reserves by 25% to 110.4
 mmboe at an average F&D cost (including FDC) of $10.67/boe resulting in
 a recycle ratio (including FDC) of 3.0x.  PDP reserves represent 69% of
 1P reserves in 2015 as compared to 58% in 2014.


Positive technical revisions of 2.0 mmboe on a 2P basis resulting from
 strong well performance were more than offset by 10.3 mmboe of
 revisions due to the decrease in commodity prices since year-end 2014. 
 Only 4% of the economic revisions occurred outside of Canada,
 reflecting the continued high quality of our reserves attributable to
 our international operations.


Our independent GLJ 2015 Resource Assessment(3) indicates low, best, and high estimates for contingent resources in the
 Development Pending category are 95.1(3) mmboe, 160.7(3) mmboe, and 254.7(3) mmboe, respectively.  Approximately 80% of our best estimate contingent
 resources evaluated reside in the Development Pending category,
 reflecting the high quality nature of our contingent resource base.


At year-end 2015, 2P reserves were comprised of 30% Brent-based light
 crude, 17% North American-based light crude, 11% natural gas liquids,
 20% European natural gas and 22% North American natural gas.


Achieved a reserve life index for 2P reserves of 11.7 years for year-end
 2015 reserves based on annualized Q4 2015 production, compared to 13.6
 years at year-end 2014. Year-end 2015 reserve life index for 1P
 reserves was 7.2 years, as compared to 8.4 years at year-end 2014.


Based on the continued success of our Mannville liquids-rich gas play in
 Alberta, our 2015 activities resulted in an additional 35 (23.2 net)
 undeveloped wells booked at the 2P level, with average net reserves of
 approximately 620 mboe/well.  Additionally, we added a further 14 (9
 net) undeveloped wells that were attributed to lands acquired in 2015.


In the Paris Basin, we added 7.3 mmboe of 2P reserves, related to 18
 development opportunities, including 15 new additions and strong upward
 revisions related to well performance and expanded waterflood
 response.  Well additions and successful workover and optimization
 campaigns in the Aquitaine Basin in France added a further 2.8 mmboe of
 2P reserves.


We added an additional 1.9 mmboe of 2P reserves to our Slootdorp-06 well
 (92.8 working interest) related to the discovery in the Rotliegend
 formation and an additional 1.5 mmboe of 2P reserves to our
 Slootdorp-07 well (92.8% working interest) related to the discovery in
 the Zechstein formation).

As evaluated by GLJ Petroleum Consultants Ltd. ("GLJ") in a report dated
 February 8, 2016 with an effective date of December 31, 2015.




(2)


F&D (finding and development) and FD&A (finding, development and
 acquisition) costs are used as a measure of capital efficiency and are
 calculated by dividing the applicable capital costs for the period,
 including the change in undiscounted future development capital
 ("FDC"), by the change in the reserves, incorporating revisions and
 production, for the same period.




(3)


Vermilion retained GLJ to conduct an independent resource evaluation
 dated February 8, 2016 to assess contingent resources across all of the
 Company's key operating regions with an effective date of December 31,
 2015 (the "GLJ 2015 Resource Assessment").  The associated chance of
 development for each of the low, best and high estimate for contingent
 resources in the Development Pending category are 83%, 82% and 81%,
 respectively.  There is uncertainty that it will be commercially viable
 to produce any portion of the resources.

RESERVES, FUTURE NET REVENUE AND OTHER OIL AND GAS INFORMATION


The following is a summary of the oil and natural gas reserves and the
 value of future net revenue of Vermilion as evaluated by GLJ,
 independent petroleum engineering consultants in Calgary in a report
 dated February 8, 2016 with an effective date of December 31, 2015 (the
 "GLJ 2015 Reserves Evaluation").  The GLJ 2015 Reserves Evaluation was
 prepared in accordance with National Instrument 51-101 and COGEH.


Reserves and other oil and gas information in this news release is
 effective December 31, 2015 unless otherwise stated.


All evaluations of future net production revenue set forth in the tables
 below are stated after overriding and lessor royalties, Crown
 royalties, freehold royalties, mineral taxes, direct lifting costs,
 normal allocated overhead and future capital investments, including
 abandonment and reclamation obligations.  Future net production revenues estimated by the GLJ 2015 Reserves
 Evaluation do not represent the fair market value of the reserves. 
 Other assumptions relating to the costs, prices for future production
 and other matters are included in the GLJ 2015 Reserve Evaluation. 
 There is no assurance that the future price and cost assumptions used
 in the GLJ 2015 Reserves Evaluation will prove accurate and variances
 could be material.


Reserves for Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, the
 Netherlands and the United States are established using deterministic
 methodology.  Total proved reserves are established at the 90 percent
 probability (P90) level.  There is a 90 percent probability that the
 actual reserves recovered will be equal to or greater than the P90
 reserves.  Total proved plus probable reserves are established at the
 50 percent probability (P50) level.  There is a 50 percent probability
 that the actual reserves recovered will be equal to or greater than the
 P50 reserves.


Estimates of reserves have been made assuming that development of each
 property, in respect of which estimates have been made, will occur
 without regard to the availability of funding required for that
 development.


With respect to finding and development costs, the aggregate of the
 exploration and development costs incurred in the most recent financial
 year and the change during that year in estimated future development
 costs generally will not reflect total finding and development costs
 related to reserve additions for that year.


Pricing used in the forecast price estimates is set forth in the table
 below and referenced in the notes to subsequent tables.

The pricing assumptions used in the GLJ Report  with respect to net
 present value of future net revenue (forecast) as well as the inflation
 rates used for operating and capital costs are set forth above.  The
 NGL price is an aggregate of the individual natural gas liquids prices
 used in the Total Proved plus Probable evaluation.  GLJ is an
 independent qualified reserves evaluator appointed pursuant to
 NI 51-101.




All forecast prices in the tables above are provided by GLJ.  For 2015,
 the price of Vermilion's natural gas in the Netherlands is based on the
 TTF day-ahead index, as determined on the Title Transfer Facility
 Virtual Trading Point operated by Dutch TSO Gas Transport Services,
 plus various fees. GasTerra, a state owned entity purchases all natural
 gas produced by Vermilion in the Netherlands.  The price of Vermilion's
 natural gas in Germany is based on the TTF month-ahead index, as
 determined on the Title Transfer Facility Virtual Trading Point
 operated by Dutch TSO Gas Transport Services, plus various fees.  The
 benchmark price for Australia and France crude oil is Dated Brent. The
 benchmark price for Canadian crude oil is Edmonton Par and Canadian
 natural gas is priced against AECO.  For the year ended December 31,
 2015, the average realized sales prices before hedging were $70.22 per
 bbl (Australia), $7.79 per Mcf (Netherlands), $7.18 per Mcf (Germany),
 $63.31 per bbl (France) for Brent-based crude oil, $49.10 per bbl
 (United States) for WTI, $49.73 per bbl for Canadian-based crude oil
 and NGLs and $2.78 per Mcf for Canadian natural gas.

Notes:




(1) 


The pricing assumptions used in the GLJ Report with respect to net
 present value of future net revenue (forecast) as well as the inflation
 rates used for operating and capital costs are set forth below.  See
 "Forecast Prices used in Estimates".  The NGL price is an aggregate of
 the individual natural gas liquids prices used in the Total Proved plus
 Probable evaluation.  GLJ is an independent qualified reserves
 evaluator appointed pursuant to NI 51-101.




(2)


 "Gross Reserves" are Vermilion's working interest (operating or
 non-operating) share before deduction of royalties and without
 including any royalty interests of Vermilion.  "Net Reserves" are
 Vermilion's working interest (operating or non-operating) share after
 deduction of royalty obligations, plus Vermilion's royalty interests in
 reserves.




(3) 


"Proved" reserves are those reserves that can be estimated with a high
 degree of certainty to be recoverable.  It is likely that the actual
 remaining quantities recovered will exceed the estimated proved
 reserves.




(4) 


"Probable" reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain
 to be recovered than proved reserves.  It is equally likely that the
 actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the
 sum of the estimated proved plus probable reserves.




(5) 


"Developed" reserves are those reserves that are expected to be
 recovered from existing wells and installed facilities or, if
 facilities have not been installed, that would involve a low
 expenditure (e.g. when compared to the cost of drilling a well) to put
 the reserves on production.




(6) 


"Developed Producing" reserves are those reserves that are expected to
 be recovered from completion intervals open at the time of the
 estimate.  These reserves may be currently producing or, if shut-in,
 they must have previously been on production, and the date of
 resumption of production must be known with reasonable certainty.




(7) 


"Developed Non-Producing" reserves are those reserves that either have
 not been on production, or have previously been on production, but are
 shut in, and the date of resumption of production is unknown.




(8) 


"Undeveloped" reserves are those reserves expected to be recovered from
 known accumulations where a significant expenditure (for example, when
 compared to the cost of drilling a well) is required to render them
 capable of production.  They must fully meet the requirements of the
 reserves classification (proved, probable, possible) to which they are
 assigned.

Notes:




(1) 


The pricing assumptions used in the GLJ Report with respect to net
 present value of future net revenue (forecast) as well as the inflation
 rates used for operating and capital costs are set forth below.  See
 "Forecast Prices used in Estimates".  The NGL price is an aggregate of
 the individual natural gas liquids prices used in the Total Proved plus
 Probable evaluation.  GLJ is an independent qualified reserves
 evaluator appointed pursuant to NI 51-101.




(2)


 "Proved" reserves are those reserves that can be estimated with a high
 degree of certainty to be recoverable.  It is likely that the actual
 remaining quantities recovered will exceed the estimated proved
 reserves.




(3) 


"Probable" reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain
 to be recovered than proved reserves.  It is equally likely that the
 actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the
 sum of the estimated proved plus probable reserves.

Notes:




(1) 


"Proved" reserves are those reserves that can be estimated with a high
 degree of certainty to be recoverable.  It is likely that the actual
 remaining quantities recovered will exceed the estimated proved
 reserves.




(2) 


"Probable" reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain
 to be recovered than proved reserves.  It is equally likely that the
 actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the
 sum of the estimated proved plus probable reserves.




(3) 


The pricing assumptions used in the GLJ Report with respect to net
 present value of future net revenue (forecast) as well as the inflation
 rates used for operating and capital costs are set forth above.  See
 "Forecast Prices used in Estimates".  The NGL price is an aggregate of
 the individual natural gas liquids prices used in the Total Proved plus
 Probable evaluation.  GLJ is an independent qualified reserves
 evaluator appointed pursuant to NI 51-101.




(4) 


For reporting purposes, "Total Oil" is the sum of Light Crude oil and
 Medium Crude Oil, Heavy Oil and Tight Oil.  For reporting purposes,
 "Total Gas" is the sum of Conventional Natural Gas, Coal Bed Methane
 and Shale Natural Gas.




(5)


"Coal Bed Methane" and "Shale Natural Gas" were considered
 "Unconventional Natural Gas" in previous years. NI 51-5101 no longer
 differentiates between conventional and unconventional activities.






The table below sets out the future development costs deducted in the
 estimation of future net revenue attributable to total proved reserves
 and total proved plus probable reserves (using forecast prices and
 costs).

Note:




(1) 


The pricing assumptions used in the GLJ Report with respect to net
 present value of future net revenue (forecast) as well as the inflation
 rates used for operating and capital costs are set forth above.  See
 "Forecast Prices used in Estimates".  The NGL price is an aggregate of
 the individual natural gas liquids prices used in the Total Proved plus
 Probable evaluation.  GLJ is an independent qualified reserves
 evaluator appointed pursuant to NI 51-101.






Vermilion expects to source its capital expenditure requirements from
 internally generated cash flow and, as appropriate, from Vermilion's
 existing credit facility or equity or debt financing.  It is
 anticipated that costs of funding the future development costs will not
 impact development of its properties or Vermilion's reserves or future
 net revenue.


CONTINGENT RESOURCES


Vermilion retained GLJ to conduct an independent resource evaluation to
 assess contingent resources across all of the Company's key operating
 regions with an effective date of December 31, 2015 (the "GLJ Resources
 Assessment").  All contingent resources evaluated in the GLJ Resources
 Assessment were deemed economic at the effective date of December 31,
 2015.


A range of contingent resources estimates (low, best and high) were
 prepared by GLJ.  See notes 6 to 8 of the tables below for a
 description of low estimate, best estimate and high estimate.


The GLJ Resources Assessment estimated contingent resources of 95.1
 million boe (low estimate) to 254.7 million boe (high estimate), with a
 best estimate of 160.7 million boe.  Contingent resources are in
 addition to reserves estimated in the GLJ Report.


An estimate of risked net present value of future net revenue of
 contingent resources is preliminary in nature and is provided to assist
 the reader in reaching an opinion on the merit and likelihood of the
 company proceeding with the required investment. It includes contingent
 resources that are considered too uncertain with respect to the chance
 of development to be classified as reserves. There is uncertainty that
 the risked net present value of future net revenue will be realized.


Summary information regarding contingent resources and net present value
 of future net revenues from contingent resources are set forth below
 and are derived, in each case, from the GLJ Resources Assessment. The
 GLJ Resources Assessment was prepared in accordance with COGEH and
 NI-51-101 by GLJ, an independent qualified reserve evaluator.

Notes:




(1) 


The contingent resource assessments were prepared by GLJ in accordance
 with the definitions, standards and procedures contained in the COGEH
 and NI 51-101. Contingent resource is defined in the COGEH as those
 quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be
 potentially recoverable from known accumulations using established
 technology or technology under development, but which are not currently
 considered to be commercially recoverable due to one or more
 contingencies. There is no certainty that it will be commercially
 viable to produce any portion of the contingent resources or that
 Vermilion will produce any portion of the volumes currently classified
 as contingent resources. The estimates of contingent resources involve
 implied assessment, based on certain estimates and assumptions, that
 the resources described exists in the quantities predicted or
 estimated, as at a given date, and that the resources can be profitably
 produced in the future. The risked net present value of the future net
 revenue from the contingent resources does not necessarily represent
 the fair market value of the contingent resources. Actual contingent
 resources (and any volumes that may be reclassified as reserves) and
 future production therefrom may be greater than or less than the
 estimates provided herein.




(2)  


GLJ prepared the estimates of contingent resources shown for each
 property using deterministic principles and methods. Probabilistic
 aggregation of the low and high property estimates shown in the table
 might produce different total volumes than the arithmetic sums shown in
 the table. 




(3)  


The forecast price and cost assumptions utilized in the year-end 2015
 reserves report were also utilized by GLJ in preparing the contingent
 resource assessments. See "GLJ December 31, 2015 Forecast Prices" in
 Vermilion's Annual Information Form for the year ended December 31,
 2015.




(4)  


"Gross" Contingent Resources are Vermilion's working interest (operating
 or non-operating) share before deduction of royalties and without
 including any royalty interests of Vermilion.  "Net" Contingent
 Resources are Vermilion's working interest (operating or non-operating)
 share after deduction of royalty obligations, plus Vermilion's royalty
 interests in Contingent Resources.




(5)  


The risked net present value of future net revenue attributable to the
 contingent resources does not necessarily represent the fair market
 value of the contingent resources. Estimated abandonment and
 reclamation costs have been included in the evaluation.




(6)  


This is considered to be a conservative estimate of the quantity that
 will actually be recovered. It is likely that the actual remaining
 quantities recovered will exceed the low estimate. If probabilistic
 methods are used, there should be at least a 90 percent probability
 (P90) that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the
 low estimate.




(7)  


This is considered to be the best estimate of the quantity that will
 actually be recovered. It is equally likely that the actual remaining
 quantities recovered will be greater or less than the best estimate. If
 probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 50 percent
 probability (P50) that the quantities actually recovered will equal or
 exceed the best estimate.




(8)  


This is considered to be an optimistic estimate of the quantity that
 will actually be recovered. It is unlikely that the actual remaining
 quantities recovered will exceed the high estimate. If probabilistic
 methods are used, there should be at least a 10 percent probability
 (P10) that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the
 high estimate. 




(9)  


The Chance of Development (CoDev) is the estimated probability that,
 once discovered, a known accumulation will be commercially developed.
 Five factors have been considered in determining the CoDev as follows:










CoDev = Ps (Economic Factor) × Ps (Technology Factor) × Ps (Development
 Plan Factor) ×Ps (Development Timeframe Factor) × Ps (Other Contingency
 Factor) wherein


Ps is the probability of success


Economic Factor - For reserves to be assessed, a project must be
 economic. With respect to contingent resources, this factor captures
 uncertainty in the assessment of economic status principally due to
 uncertainty in cost estimates and marketing options. Economic viability
 uncertainty due to technology is more aptly captured with the
 Technology Factor. The Economic Factor will be 1 for reserves and will
 often be 1 for development pending and for projects with a development
 study or pre-development study with a robust rate of return. A robust
 rate of return means that the project retains economic status with
 variation in costs and/or marketing plans over the expected range of
 outcomes for these variables.


Technology Factor - For reserves to be assessed, a project must utilize
 established technology. With respect to contingent resources, this
 factor captures the uncertainty in the viability of the proposed
 technology for the subject reservoir, namely, the uncertainty
 associated with technology under development. By definition, technology
 under development is a recovery process or process improvement that has
 been determined to be technically viable via field test and is being
 field tested further to determine its economic viability in the subject
 reservoir. The Technology Factor will be 1 for reserves and for
 established technology. For technology under development, this factor
 will consider different risks associated with technologies being
 developed at the scale of the well versus the scale of a project and
 technologies which are being modified or extended for the subject
 reservoir versus new emerging technologies which have not previously
 been applied in any commercial application. The risk assessment will
 also consider the quality and sufficiency of the test data available,
 the ability to reliably scale such data and the ability to extrapolate
 results in time.


Development Plan Factor - For reserves to be assessed, a project must
 have a detailed development plan. With respect to contingent resources,
 this factor captures the uncertainty in the project evaluation
 scenario. The Development Plan Factor will be 1 for reserves and high,
 approaching 1, for development pending projects. This factor will
 consider development plan detail variations including the degree of
 delineation, reservoir specific development and operating strategy
 detail (technology decision, well layouts (spacing and pad locations),
 completion strategy, start-up strategy, water source and disposal,
 other infrastructure, facility design, marketing plans etc) and the
 quality of the cost estimates as provided by the developer.


Development Timeframe Factor - In the case of major projects, for
 reserves to be assessed, first major capital spending must be initiated
 within 5 years of the effective date. The Development Timeframe Factor
 will be 1 for reserves and will often be 1 for development pending
 provided the project is planned on-stream based on the same criteria
 used in the assessment of reserves. With respect to contingent
 resources, the factor will approach 1 for projects planned on-stream
 with a timeframe slightly longer than the limiting reserves criteria.


Other Contingency Factor - For reserves to be assessed, all
 contingencies must be eliminated. With respect to contingent resources,
 this factor captures major contingencies, usually beyond the control of
 the operator, other than those captured by economic status, technology
 status, project evaluation scenario status and the development
 timeframe. The Other Contingency Factor will be 1 for reserves and for
 development pending and less than 1 for on hold. Provided all
 contingencies have been identified and their resolution is reasonably
 certain, this factor would also be 1 for development unclarified.


These factors may be inter-related (dependent) and care has been taken
 to ensure that risks are appropriately accounted.

ABOUT VERMILION


Vermilion is an international energy producer that seeks to create value
 through the acquisition, exploration, development and optimization of
 producing properties in North America, Europe and Australia. Our
 business model targets annual organic production growth, along with
 providing reliable and increasing dividends to investors.  Vermilion is
 targeting growth in production primarily through the exploitation of
 light oil and liquids-rich natural gas conventional resource plays in
 Canada and the United States, the exploration and development of high
 impact natural gas opportunities in the Netherlands and Germany, and
 through oil drilling and workover programs in France and Australia. 
 Vermilion also holds an 18.5% working interest in the Corrib gas field
 in Ireland.  Vermilion pays a monthly dividend of Canadian $0.215 per
 share, which provides a current yield of approximately 7%.  Management
 and directors of Vermilion hold approximately 6% of the outstanding
 shares, are committed to consistently delivering superior rewards for
 all stakeholders, and have delivered a 20-year history of market
 outperformance.  Vermilion trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the
 New York Stock Exchange under the symbol VET.


Natural gas volumes have been converted on the basis of six thousand
 cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel equivalent of oil.  Barrels of
 oil equivalent ("boe") may be misleading, particularly if used in
 isolation.  A boe conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet of
 natural gas to one barrel of oil is based on an energy equivalency
 conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not
 represent a value equivalency at the wellhead.


Fund flows from operations, netbacks and recycle ratio are measures that
 do not have standardized meanings prescribed by International Financial
 Reporting Standards ("IFRS") and therefore may not be comparable with
 the calculations of similar measures for other entities. "Fund flows
 from operations" represents cash flows from operating activities before
 changes in non-cash operating working capital and asset retirement
 obligations settled. Management considers fund flows from operations
 and fund flows from operations per share to be key measures as they
 demonstrate Vermilion's ability to generate the cash necessary to pay
 dividends, repay debt, fund asset retirement obligations and make
 capital investments. Management believes that by excluding the
 temporary impact of changes in non-cash operating working capital, fund
 flows from operations provides a useful measure of Vermilion's ability
 to generate cash that is not subject to short-term movements in
 non-cash operating working capital. "Recycle Ratio" means a measure of
 capital efficiency calculated by dividing the operating netback of
 production by the cost of adding reserves. "Netbacks" are per boe and
 per Mcf measures used in operational and capital allocation decisions.
 After-tax cash flow netbacks are calculated as cash flow from operating
 activities (determined in accordance with IFRS) expressed on a per boe
 basis.

History[edit]
Vermilion began in 1994 as Vermilion Resources Ltd, an Alberta focused oil and gas company. Vermilion had its initial public offering on the Alberta Stock Exchange in April 1996 for $0.10 per share.[3]
The company changed its status to that of a trust in December 2002 when it became known as Vermilion Energy Trust for eight years; In September 2010, it converted back to a corporation.[4]
In March 2013, Vermilion began trading on the NYSE under the ticker symbol "VET".
Operations[edit]
In Canada, Vermilion's operations are focused in the West Pembina/Drayton Valley region of Alberta and the Northgate Region of southeast Saskatchewan. In West Pembina, Vermilion has the potential for three significant development projects sharing the same surface infrastructure:

Cardium light oil development (1,800 m depth)
Mannville liquids-rich gas inventory (2,400 - 2,700 m depth)
Extensive position in Duvernay liquids-rich gas resource play (3,200 - 3,400 m depth)[5]

Vermilion entered the US market in 2014 with the acquisition of properties in the Powder River Basin of northeastern Wyoming in 2014. Vermilion's activities are targeting oil and gas development in the Turner Sands tight-oil play.[6]
After entering the country in 1997, Vermilion has grown to become the largest oil producer in France. The company estimates there are more than 1.7 billion barrels of original oil in place in the five biggest conventional oil pools. [7]
Vermilion entered the Netherlands in 2004 and has since expanded its undeveloped land base to cover approximately 800,000 net acres.[8] The Netherlands is characterized by high impact natural gas drilling and development. Vermilion's natural gas production in the Netherlands is priced of Title Transfer Facility (TTF).
Vermilion acquired a 25% contractual participation interest in a four partner consortium in Germany from GDF Suez S.A. in February 2014. The assets include 4 natural gas producing fields across 11 production licenses, spanning 204,000 gross acres. Since that time, Vermilion has expanded its land position to include over 1.1 million net acres in the prolific North German Basin.[9]
Vermilion acquired a 18.5% non-operated stake in the Corrib field from Marathon Oil Corp in 2009. The other partners in the project are Shell with 45% (project operator) and Statoil with 36.5%. At peak production, the Corrib project will supply 60-65% of the country's natural gas demand and over 90% of the country's natural gas production. First-gas from Corrib began on December 30, 2015.[10]
Wandoo is Vermilion's Australian asset, an offshore oil field and platform approximately 80 kilometers off the northwest coast of Australia. Wandoo production receives a premium to Brent Crude pricing.[11] Vermilion originally purchased a 60% operated interest in Wandoo in 2005. The company then purchased the remaining 40% interest in Wandoo in 2007.[12]

First-gas from Corrib began on December 30, 2015.[10]
Wandoo is Vermilion's Australian asset, an offshore oil field and platform approximately 80 kilometers off the northwest coast of Australia. Wandoo production receives a premium to Brent Crude pricing.[11] Vermilion originally purchased a 60% operated interest in Wandoo in 2005. The company then purchased the remaining 40% interest in Wandoo in 2007.[12]

CALGARY, April 28, 2017 /PRNewswire/ - Vermilion Energy Inc. ("Vermilion", "We", "Our", "Us" or the "Company") (TSX, NYSE:    VET) is pleased to report operating and unaudited financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2017.  
The unaudited financial statements and management discussion and analysis for the three months ended March 31, 2017, will be available on the System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval ("SEDAR") at www.sedar.com, on EDGAR at www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml, and on Vermilion's website at www.vermilionenergy.com. 








HIGHLIGHTS

Average production increased by 6% in Q1 2017 to 64,537 boe/d as compared to 60,863 boe/d in the prior quarter. This increase was primarily attributable to higher volumes in Canada from the resumption of voluntarily curtailed natural gas production and organic growth from development activities, as well as incremental volumes from our German acquisition which closed on December 19, 2016. We expect production volumes to continue increasing throughout 2017 to achieve our full year production guidance of between 69,000 to 70,000 boe/d.  
Fund flows from operations ("FFO") for Q1 2017 was $143.4 million ($1.21/basic share(1)) as compared to $149.6 million ($1.27/basic share) in Q4 2016. This 4% decrease in FFO quarter-over-quarter is primarily attributable to a significant inventory build in France and Australia related to shipment timing. The pre-tax FFO impact of the quarter-over-quarter change in inventory levels was approximately $15.5 million. Based on anticipated shipment schedules, we expect that this inventory build will reverse over the course of the year, unwinding the FFO impact. Year-over-year, FFO increased by 53% as compared to Q1 2016 as a result of significantly higher commodity prices.  
Production from Corrib averaged 64.8 mmcf/d (10,803 boe/d) in Q1 2017, representing 100% of rated plant capacity. The project has continued to outperform expectations relating to well deliverability and downtime. Due to expected higher recovery efficiency resulting from better well communication, we have adjusted our field and well performance estimates and now expect to maintain peak production plateau through Q1 2018, and potentially into Q2 2018.  
During the first quarter we drilled 22 (18.4 net) wells in Canada and placed 21 (16.1 net) wells on production. Individual well results from our Q1 2017 Mannville program exceeded our expectations with the majority displaying test productivity significantly above our average well performance to-date. Lower Mannville wells tested during the quarter(2) include one well that tested at 8.0 mmcf/d with 190 bbls/d of free liquids, and a second well at 2.8 mmcf/d with 535 bbls/d of free liquids. Based on early stage production results, oil rates from our Cardium and Midale wells are in-line with expectations while cost efficiencies have continued to improve.  
We drilled and completed our first wells in the Neocomian fields in France during Q1 2017. Two wells are on production at a combined initial rate of 300 bbls/d, which exceeded expectations. During the first quarter, we also completed and placed on production the four (4.0 net) Champotran wells we drilled in France in Q4 2016. All wells are productive, with two exceeding expectations, and two below. The combined IP30 oil rate from the four Champotran wells was 550 bbls/d. 
We drilled three (3.0 net) wells in the United States in our early stage Turner Sand play during the quarter. Two of the three wells were completed and placed on production in late March. The two wells have been produced intermittently, with initial production performance comparable to the better wells drilled thus far in our East Finn project area. 
As noted in our year-end 2016 release, permitting delays in the Netherlands have resulted in a reallocation of capital and a change in our production mix in favor of other business units. Due to project approval delays, a modest amount of capital has been moved from the Netherlands to Canada. As a result of production permit delays in the Netherlands, we are employing under-utilized well deliverability in Canada, and to a lesser extent, Australia to meet corporate targets. Our revised production plan by business unit is shown in our May 2017 investor presentation on our website.  
During Q1 2017, we issued US$300 million of eight-year senior unsecured notes at a coupon of 5.625% per annum. This issuance was completed by way of a private offering and represented Vermilion's first issuance in the US debt markets. Subsequent to the quarter, we negotiated an extension of our credit facility with our banking syndicate to May 2021. As a result of our projected liquidity requirements and the proceeds from this debt issuance, we elected to reduce our bank facility to $1.4 billion from $2.0 billion. 
Effective with the April 2017 dividend payment, the allowable participation in the Premium DividendTM Component of our Premium DividendTM and Dividend Reinvestment Plan is now being prorated by 75%. We plan to discontinue the Premium DividendTM Component of our Premium DividendTM and Dividend Reinvestment Plan beginning with the July 2017 dividend payment, such that there would be no further equity issuance under this program. In addition, we reduced the discount associated with the traditional component of our Premium DividendTM and Dividend Reinvestment Plan from 3% to 2% beginning with the January 2017 dividend. 
Vermilion was recently ranked 13th by Corporate Knights on the Future 40 Responsible Corporate Leaders in Canada list. This marks the fourth year in a row that Vermilion has been recognized by Corporate Knights as one of Canada's top sustainability performers. Vermilion continues to be the highest rated oil and gas company on the list. This recognition reflects our strong focus on sustainability, transparency and performance on environmental, social and governance issues.

 Well A (Ellerslie) production test was performed over a 2-day period.  The maximum choke size during the production test was 24.7mm.  Well A achieved a peak burnable gas production rate of 9.1 mmcf/d with a stabilized rate of 8.0 mmcf/d.  Well A also achieved a peak liquids production rate of 375 bbls/d with a stabilized rate of 190 bbls/d.  Well B (Ellerslie) production test was performed over a 2-day period.  The maximum choke size during the production test was 21.3mm.  Well B achieved a peak burnable gas production rate of 3.3 mmcf/d with a stabilized rate of 2.8 mmcf/d.  Well B also achieved a peak liquids production rate of 690 bbls/d with a stabilized rate of 535 bbls/d.  These test results are not necessarily indicative of long-term performance or of ultimate recovery.

MESSAGE TO SHAREHOLDERS
In early April, Vermilion held an investor day in Paris, France to provide investors and analysts with an opportunity to learn more about our company's strategy and global asset portfolio.  The event featured presentations from members of our executive team and senior leaders from each of Vermilion's business units.  Our Investor Day was designed to achieve three main objectives: provide a more detailed description of our assets and projects; demonstrate the technical and management capabilities of Vermilion's global operations leadership team; and emphasize the similarity of our overseas operations to North American operations through a field tour of our Paris Basin assets.  A copy of the Investor Day presentation and a replay of the webcast is available on our website at http://www.vermilionenergy.com/ir/eventspresentations.cfm.
It was fitting that Vermilion's first Investor Day event in nearly seven years coincided with the 20th anniversary of our first international acquisition.  It was in 1997 that Vermilion took the innovative step of expanding internationally by acquiring producing properties in France.  Since then, we have continued to strengthen and diversify our global asset portfolio, maintaining a disciplined focus on our three core regions of North America, Europe and Australia.  As was demonstrated throughout our Investor Day event, Vermilion's diversification has played a key role in our historical success and remains instrumental to our growth-and-income model in the future.
Project Inventory Diversity
Vermilion's diversified inventory of conventional and semi-conventional projects provides several competitive advantages for our company.  Diversification in commodity and price exposures allows us to select and invest in those projects that will generate the highest return for a given commodity price environment.  In addition, our focus on conventional and semi-conventional projects results in lower production decline rates as compared to our North American competitors that focus on shales or other ultra-tight reservoirs.  These lower decline rates significantly reduce our ongoing capital requirements and directly support the sustainability of our growth-and-income model.  At the same time, we continue to apply the best worldwide drilling and completion technologies to our conventional and semi-conventional assets to further enhance our rates of return.  While we are focused on conventional and semi-conventional projects, our inventory depth is more typical of an unconventional producer.  We have greatly expanded our project inventory over the past five years and it is stronger now than at any point in Vermilion's history.
After more than two years of depressed industry activity, we are starting to see a modest recovery in activity levels as global oil markets begin to rebalance.  While this increased activity will lead to service cost reflation, we expect this to have less impact on Vermillion than our competitors.  A majority of our capital is directed to assets outside of North America where the services sector has not been exposed to severe boom-and-bust cycles.  As such, cost escalation pressures on our international operations are expected to be less significant.  Further, our semi-conventional asset base in North America requires significantly less sand, water and horsepower intensity in completions as compared to our shale and ultra-tight focused competitors.  As a result, we have relatively less exposure to the pressure pumping services segment, where services price reflation is expected to be most significant.  
Capital Investment and Production Source Flexibility
Our diversification provides significant flexibility to reallocate capital and production amongst business units as required to meet corporate targets.  This flexibility was recently demonstrated through the reallocation of 2017 capital and production targets due to the permitting delays in the Netherlands noted in our year-end 2016 release and Investor Day materials.  As discussed in the European Review section below, we now project that these permitting delays will result in the deferral of nearly 3,000 boe/d of Netherlands production for 2017 versus our original plan.  In response, we have reallocated a modest amount of additional capital from the Netherlands to Canada and intend to offset this current-year permitting-related production shortfall through increased production in other jurisdictions, primarily Canada and Australia.  Our expectation to maintain our 2017 production guidance of 69,000 – 70,000 boe/d despite the impact of these permitting delays, and without increasing consolidated exploration and development ("E&D") capital, demonstrates a key advantage of our diversification as well as the operational strength of our company.
Risk Reduction and Premium Pricing
Our global asset portfolio provides commodity diversification and premium pricing.  Commodity diversification reduces risk for our shareholders by increasing the stability of our cash flows and providing additional hedging options.  Approximately 55% of our oil-equivalent 2017 estimated production is priced with reference to Dated Brent and European natural gas benchmarks.  These commodities continue to trade at significant premiums as compared to their North American counterparts, improving our margins.  Our commodity exposure advantages, coupled with our focus on cost management, have allowed Vermilion to consistently deliver top quartile netbacks within our peer group.
Summary 
Vermilion's diversification has been a key element of our historical success and consistent record of market outperformance.  Our global asset portfolio generates significant free cash flow(1), while at the same time delivering consistent production growth, allowing us to sustainably deliver our growth-and-income model for our shareholders.  Our focus on three core regions, managed within a decentralized business unit structure with a highly capable leadership team, allows us to focus our efforts and effectively manage our global asset base.  In each region, we are a very technically-focused company that continues to add real value through high quality technical work and careful execution of our projects.   
Q1 2017 Review
Vermilion's first quarter production increased by 6% to 64,537 boe/d from 60,863 boe/d in the prior quarter.  This increase was primarily attributable to higher volumes in Canada related to the resumption of voluntarily curtailed production and organic growth from development activities, as well as incremental volumes from our German acquisition which closed near the end of last year.  We expect production volumes to continue increasing throughout 2017 with production volumes averaging between 69,000 to 70,000 boe/d for the year.
Fund flows from operations ("FFO") for Q1 2017 was $143.4 million ($1.21/basic share(1)) as compared to $149.6 million ($1.27/basic share) in Q4 2016.  This 4% decrease in FFO quarter-over-quarter is primarily attributable to a significant inventory build in France and Australia related to shipment timing.  The pre-tax FFO impact of the quarter-over-quarter change in inventory levels was approximately $15.5 million.  Based on anticipated shipment schedules, we expect that this inventory build will reverse over the course of the year, unwinding the FFO impact. Year-over-year, FFO increased by 53% as compared to Q1 2016 as a result of significantly higher commodity prices.  Vermilion generated net earnings of $44.5 million ($0.38/basic share) during the first quarter, representing a return to positive net income for the first time since Q2 2015.
While commodity prices have increased from the lows experienced in 2016, we continue to maintain our strict focus on cost management.  Per-unit operating expense of $9.35 per boe decreased by 11% during Q1 2017 as compared to the prior quarter and by 2% as compared to the year-earlier quarter.
During the quarter, we issued US$300 million of eight-year senior unsecured notes at a coupon of 5.625% per annum.  This issuance was completed by way of a private offering and represented Vermilion's first issuance in the US debt markets.  Despite Vermilion's first-time issuer status, we were able to secure a very attractive interest rate, reflecting our track record of prudent fiscal management.  The issuance of US dollar denominated debt provides a natural hedge against our largely US dollar denominated revenue streams.  Subsequent to the quarter, we negotiated an extension of our credit facility with our banking syndicate to May 2021.  As a result of our projected liquidity requirements and the proceeds from this debt issuance, we elected to reduce our bank facility to $1.4 billion from $2.0 billion.
Effective with the April 2017 dividend payment, the allowable participation in the Premium DividendTM Component of our Premium DividendTM and Dividend Reinvestment Plan is now being prorated by 75%.  As such, eligible shareholders who have elected to participate in the Premium DividendTM Component now receive a 1.5% premium on 25% of their participating shares, and the regular cash dividend on the remaining 75% of their shares.  We plan to discontinue the Premium DividendTM Component of our Premium DividendTM and Dividend Reinvestment Plan beginning with the July 2017 dividend payment, such that there would be no further equity issuance under this program.  We also reduced the discount associated with the traditional component of our Premium DividendTM and Dividend Reinvestment Plan from 3% to 2% beginning with the January 2017 dividend.  
Europe
Production from Corrib averaged 64.8 mmcf/d (10,803 boe/d) in Q1 2017, representing 100% of rated plant capacity.  The project has continued to outperform expectations for well deliverability and downtime.  Due to expected higher recovery efficiency resulting from better well-to-well communication, we have adjusted our field and well performance estimates, and now expect to maintain peak production plateau through Q1 2018 and potentially into Q2 2018.  Corrib is a highly efficient generator of free cash flow as a result of its highly-valued European gas product, absence of royalties, low operating expense, and low maintenance capital requirements.
In France, we drilled and completed our first wells in the Neocomian fields during Q1 2017.  Initial results from this four (4.0 net) horizontal well program are highly encouraging.  The first well was placed on production in early March and delivered an IP30 rate of 250 bbls/d versus our type curve expectations of 110 bbls/d.  The second well, which only has a completed horizontal section of 40% of the anticipated length due to drilling problems, was placed on production in late March at a rate of approximately 50 bbls/d at low drawdown during the initial production phase.  The production rate from this well is expected to increase as pump displacement and drawdown are turned up over time.  The remaining two wells have now been successfully drilled and cased with slotted liner through the full horizontal section targeted.  Reservoir quality indications from these two wells were positive, and we expect to have them on production during the second quarter.  During the first quarter, we also completed and placed on production the four (4.0 net) Champotran wells we drilled in France in Q4 2016.  All wells are productive, with two exceeding expectations, and two below.  The combined IP30 oil rate from the four wells was 550 bbls/d.  Lastly, we drilled and placed a Vulaines horizontal sidetrack well on production during the quarter.  The well delivered an IP30 rate of 90 bbls/d prior to finishing the completion by acidizing the horizontal lateral.  Our ability to successfully execute a sidetracked horizontal lateral in Vulaines creates the opportunity for higher productivity multi-lateral horizontal development from existing wellbores.
As noted previously, permitting delays in the Netherlands have resulted in a reallocation of capital and production targets amongst business units.  Due to the delays in receiving final production permits for three of our wells, two wells are now producing at significantly restricted rates and a third well has been shut-in. While we believe the final production permits for one of the wells will be received in 2017, we do not currently expect to receive the permits for the other two wells until 2018.  As such, we have reduced our full year 2017 average production forecast for the Netherlands to approximately 6,500 boe/d.  This compares to our initial 2017 Netherlands production plan of 9,400 boe/d which reflected our prior permitting timeline assumptions.  We intend to offset lower Netherlands volumes through increased production in other jurisdictions, primarily Canada and Australia, and have made no changes to our 2017 guidance targets for consolidated production or E&D capital.  In the Netherlands, two (1.0 net) wells that were in our original budget have been postponed and we have deferred the completion activities for the remaining two (1.0 net) exploration wells that we intend to drill this year to 2018.  In addition, we have reduced the scope of our planned seismic program in the Akkrum exploration concession.  Further information on these changes is included in our May 2017 investor presentation available on our website.  We expect the curtailed Netherlands volumes to be available for production during 2018.
In Germany, Vermilion assumed operatorship of the assets acquired near the end of 2016 from Engie E&P Deutschland GmbH.  Production from the acquired assets averaged approximately 2,000 boe/d during the quarter.  Vermilion commenced service rig operations on the acquired assets in February, and we have developed a work plan to implement identified optimization and workover projects.  In March 2017, we were awarded an exploration license in Lower Saxony comprising 150,000 gross acres (50,000 acres net to Vermilion) surrounding the acquired oil fields.  The Engie acquisition, our assumption of production operatorship and the additional exploration acreage further advance our objective of developing a material business unit in Germany. 
North America
In Canada, capital activity increased significantly during the first quarter as compared to Q1 of the prior year.  During Q1 2017, we drilled or participated in seven (5.1 net) Mannville wells, five (5.0 net) Cardium wells and 10 (8.3 net) Midale wells.  Eleven (7.1 net) Mannville wells, two (2.0 net) Cardium wells and eight (7.0 net) Midale wells were brought on production.  Individual well results from our Q1 2017 Mannville program exceeded our expectations with the majority displaying test productivity significantly above our average well performance to-date.  Lower Mannville wells tested during the quarter(2) include one well that tested at 8.0 mmcf/d with 190 bbls/d of free liquids, and a second well at 2.8 mmcf/d with 535 bbls/d of free liquids.  Based on early stage production results, oil rates from our Cardium and Midale wells are in-line with expectations while cost efficiencies continue to improve.  Cardium Drill, Complete, Equip and Tie-in (DCET) well costs averaged $2.3 million on a per-section basis for Q1 2017 as compared to $3.2 million during our last program in 2014.  Per well costs for our Midale play decreased to $1.7 million during Q1 2017 from $3.0 million in 2014.  These improvements largely resulted from an approximately 30% decrease in required drilling days achieved during the quarter as compared to the start in the Midale play in 2014.  The last five wells at the end of the Q1 2017 program achieved a further 25% reduction in drilling days.  During Q1, we also continued to advance an infrastructure project supporting the continued growth of our Upper Mannville development in the Ferrier area.  We plan to start the construction of a 14 mmcf/d compressor station in Q4 2017 with start-up scheduled for Q2 2018.                                                                                                                                  
In the United States, we drilled three (3.0 net) wells in our early stage Turner Sand play during the quarter.  The Q1 2017 program was designed to establish consistent drilling and completion procedures while reducing drilling times and overall capital costs.  Drilling times were reduced to 12 days from the previous 18 day average despite an approximately 20% increase in average lateral length.  Based on currently available data, while recognizing that some additional completion costs may still be incurred on the new wells, we project that the per well drilling and completion capital cost was reduced by approximately 25% from the previous program.  Two of the three wells have been completed and were placed on production in late March, while the third well is expected to be on production by late April.  The first two wells have been produced intermittently so far, with initial production performance that is comparable to the better wells drilled thus far in our East Finn project area.  During Q1 2017, we purchased overriding royalty interests on our lands (ranging from 0.83% to 5%) for US$1.5 million, further consolidating our position and enhancing our play economics.
Australia
Activities in Australia were largely centered around our debottlenecking project to further improve fluid handling capability on the Wandoo B platform.  Once completed, we expect that this infrastructure enhancement will allow us to increase oil production on the platform by 600 to 700 bbls/d later in 2017.  The two sidetrack wells we drilled in Q2 2016 continue to exhibit strong productive capability.  When utilized, combined oil production from these wells was approximately 4,000 bbls/d during Q1 2017.  These wells are produced intermittently to achieve business unit targets and meet oil sales contract commitments.  We do not expect to drill additional wells in Australia until 2019.
Environmental, Social & Governance
Vermilion was recently ranked 13th by Corporate Knights on the Future 40 Responsible Corporate Leaders in Canada list.  This marks the fourth year in a row that Vermilion has been recognized by Corporate Knights as one of Canada's top sustainability performers.  Vermilion continues to be the highest rated oil and gas company on the list.  This recognition reflects our strong focus on sustainability, transparency and performance regarding environmental, social and governance issues.
Board of Directors
Vermilion recently announced that Mr. William Roby will be appointed to the Board of Directors effective April 26, 2017.  Mr. Roby brings 33 years of experience in various senior management and executive positions primarily from a number of US and international management positions with Occidental Petroleum Corporation from 1997 to 2013, most recently as Senior Vice President, Worldwide Operations and Production/Facility Engineering.  From 2013 to 2014, he acted as Chief Operating Officer of Sheridan Production Company, LLC, a Houston based oil and gas company.  Mr. Roby holds a Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering degree from Louisiana State University.
In addition, Mr. Claudio Ghersinich has advised that he will not be standing for re-election to Vermilion's Board in 2017.  Mr. Ghersinich has been a director of Vermilion since 1994.  He was one of the three co-founders of Vermilion and served most recently as Executive Vice President, Business Development from 2005 to 2008.  Mr. Ghersinich was a key contributor to Vermilion's success, and on behalf of Vermilion's management and Board of Directors, we wish to thank him for his contributions to Vermilion, the Board, Audit and Independent Reserves Committees.  We wish Claudio the very best in his future endeavours.

Such forward looking statements or information are based on a number of assumptions, all or any of which may prove to be incorrect.  In addition to any other assumptions identified in this document, assumptions have been made regarding, among other things: the ability of Vermilion to obtain equipment, services and supplies in a timely manner to carry out its activities in Canada and internationally; the ability of Vermilion to market crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas successfully to current and new customers; the timing and costs of pipeline and storage facility construction and expansion and the ability to secure adequate product transportation; the timely receipt of required regulatory approvals; the ability of Vermilion to obtain financing on acceptable terms; foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates; future crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas prices; and management's expectations relating to the timing and results of exploration and development activities.
Although Vermilion believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements or information are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on forward looking statements because Vermilion can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct.  Financial outlooks are provided for the purpose of understanding Vermilion's financial position and business objectives, and the information may not be appropriate for other purposes.  Forward looking statements or information are based on current expectations, estimates, and projections that involve a number of risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by Vermilion and described in the forward looking statements or information.  These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the ability of management to execute its business plan; the risks of the oil and gas industry, both domestically and internationally, such as operational risks in exploring for, developing and producing crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas; risks and uncertainties involving geology of crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas deposits; risks inherent in Vermilion's marketing operations, including credit risk; the uncertainty of reserves estimates and reserves life and estimates of resources and associated expenditures; the uncertainty of estimates and projections relating to production and associated expenditures; potential delays or changes in plans with respect to exploration or development projects; Vermilion's ability to enter into or renew leases on acceptable terms; fluctuations in crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates; health, safety, and environmental risks; uncertainties as to the availability and cost of financing; the ability of Vermilion to add production and reserves through exploration and development activities; the possibility that government policies or laws may change or governmental approvals may be delayed or withheld; uncertainty in amounts and timing of royalty payments; risks associated with existing and potential future law suits and regulatory actions against Vermilion; and other risks and uncertainties described elsewhere in this document or in Vermilion's other filings with Canadian securities regulatory authorities.

Natural gas volumes have been converted on the basis of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil equivalent.  Barrels of oil equivalent (boe) may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation.  A boe conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet to one barrel of oil is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead.
