Commitment to Action 



Zero Mass Water: Access, Quality, Security



Commitment by


    Zero Mass Labs  





In 2014, Zero Mass Labs committed to develop, deploy, and monitor solar-powered personal water production systems that produce potable water for households. ZMW will deploy water systems to pilot communities in Peru and Chile, affecting 20 households. ZMW will also deploy water systems to Syrian refugees in Jordan and to Jordanian families, affecting 100,000 households by the end of 2017. The Zero Mass Water project, in partnership with Duke Energy International and the Jordanian government, aims to fundamentally change how people around the world view access to water and water security, and to reduce the risks associated with a lack of potable water.

Details

APPROACH:
Zero Mass Labs and its partners commit to develop, deploy, and monitor personal water production systems that will produce drinking water at the household level at low cost and high reliability. The Zero Mass Water project (ZMW) will deploy water systems to pilot communities in Peru and Chile, affecting 20 families. ZMW will also deploy its water systems to Syrian refugees in Jordan and to Jordanian families, affecting 50,000 families.
ZMW will empower individual ownership of drinking water around the globe with the development of a water production appliance that can generate drinking water from humidity in the air, using self-contained solar power and air as the only inputs. This commitment is focused on freeing individuals from dependence on water-fetching, non-potable surface sources, or municipal water supplies by the refinement and deployment of ZMW systems.
This commitment has three phases:
The first phase is completing development and design for low-cost-manufacturing.  Zero Mass Labs will complete this work with global deployment in mind, meaning that the systems will be intended to operate across a broad swath of climatic and atmospheric conditions.
In the second phase of the commitment, in partnership with Duke Energy International (DEI), Zero Mass Labs commits to deploy to households in two communities, one in Peru and one in Chile.  This phase will deploy to a total of twenty families, with as many as eighty individuals supported by ZMW systems. This pilot deployment will provide valuable feedback on system performance and usage.
The third phase of the commitment involves the scaled deployment of systems to Syrian refugees in Jordan and Jordanian families in need. With financial support from the Jordanian government, ZMW will deploy to up to 100,000 units by December 2017. Achieving this level of deployment will impact the lives of as many as 200,000 people.  These scaled deployments will produce over 90 million liters of drinking water per year.
King Abdullah II Fund for Development (KAFD) will support ZMW's market development in Jordan and foster the manufacturing of the ZMW Photon system in the Kingdom.
Success in the deployment of ZMW's water production systems holds the promise of fundamentally changing how the world accesses water and how people view the security and ownership of this vital resource.
ACTION PLAN:
Phase 1:
1/2015 - Core development completion
4/2015 - Systems designed for scaled manufacturing and taken to identified contract manufacturer
Phase 2:
2/2015 - Peruvian and Chilean households identified and deployment process begun
4/2015 - 10 units delivered to Peru and 10 units delivered to Chile, each with basic system performance data acquisition
6/2015 - Second deployment partner identified and funded in a second region
6/2015 - Scaled manufacturing kicked off in first region
Phase 3:
1/2015 - Jordanian deployment partner identified and funded
1/2016 - First 10,000 units deployed in first region
6/2016 - Goal of 50,000 units deployed in first region
12/2017 - Goal of 50,000 units deployed in second region


    Background  

Access to potable water is the biggest challenge facing humanity across the globe and across the socio-economic spectrum. There are three fundamental challenges to providing potable water: access, quality, and security.
In many communities, water is drawn from surface sources or from open wells that are frequently contaminated by pathogens. The World Health Organization reports that 3.4 million people die per year from waterborne illnesses, which translates to one person dying every 10 seconds from consuming this essential liquid.
In addition to quality challenges, simply accessing water is a worldwide issue. Immense expenditures of time and effort are devoted to obtaining drinking water; in Africa alone, 40 billion hours per year are spent walking to a water source [UNESCO]. There are vast numbers of people across the Middle East, South America, and Asia that must have drinking water transported to them by truck.
When individuals in developing regions have to walk long distances, sometimes through areas immersed in violent conflict; go to a well that may be contaminated; purchase water from a water truck; or wait for an intermittent or unreliable governmental supply, their level of water security is greatly limited.
Zero Mass Labs sees an opportunity to use the inexhaustible supply of water vapor in the earth's atmosphere to solve this problem. In the region nearest the planet's surface alone, there is enough drinking water for all seven billion people on earth to survive for 15,000 years.


    Partnership Opportunities  

SEEKING:
Zero Mass Water seeks partners in two primary areas:
Deployment partners: These are entities with current operations in-country, ideally those with on-the-ground resources for delivering and installing ZMW systems at residential locations.  ZMW is primarily interested in Peru, Chile, and Jordan to begin with, but is open to partners with especially strong operations in additional regions. Entities of all types are of interest: local governments, corporate partners, NGOs, multilateral institutions, and so on.
Financial Partners: ZMW seeks project- or region-specific philanthropic support to fund the initial construction and deployment of systems to those regions that could most benefit from the solution. ZMW also seeks low-cost working capital financing to fund the supply chain and enable economy-of-scale.
OFFERING:
ZMW will soon have a scalable solution for personal water production that could alter how humans obtain potable water all over the world. ZMW is interested in forming partnerships where it could offer a solution that is complementary to partner solutions already being deployed, such as sustainable housing, solar power solutions, solar lanterns, and/or cook stove technologies, amongst others.

			in Private Financing News 












Share with your friendsYour NameYour EmailRecipient EmailEnter a MessageI read this article and found it very interesting, thought it might be interesting for you. The article is called Zero Mass Water  $7.04 million  Fundraising. Cody Friesen  Published Jun 4  Form D and is was published by Octafinance.com at http://www.octafinance.com/zero-mass-water-7-04-million-fundraising-cody-friesen-published-jun-4-form-d/72428/.CaptchaSubmit
Zero Mass Water  Financing
Zero Mass Water, Inc., Corporation just  had published form D  because of $7.04 million equity financing. This is a new filing. Zero Mass Water  was able to  fundraise $2.00 million so far. That is 28.42% of the  financing offer. The total  private financing amount was $7.04 million.  The fundraising form was filled on 2015-06-04. The reason for the financing was: unspecified.  The fundraising still has about $5.04 million more and is not closed yet. We have to wait more to see if the offering will be fully taken.
 Zero Mass Water  is based in Arizona. The  company’s business is not disclosed. The  D form was  filled by Cody Friesen President.  The company was incorporated in 2014. The filler’s address is: 781 East Terrace Road, Third Floor, Tempe, Az, Arizona, 85281.  Cody Friesen is the related person in the form and it has address: 781 East Terrace Road, 3Rd Floor, Tempe, Az, Arizona, 85281. Link to Zero Mass Water  Filing: 000164409915000001.
Analysis of Zero Mass Water  Offering
On average,  firms in the not disclosed sector, sell 67.77% of the total offering  amount. Zero Mass Water  sold 28.42% of the offering.  The financing is still open. The average  investment offering size for companies in all industries in our database is $3.05 million. The offering was 34.43% smaller than the average of $3.05 million.  Of course this should not be  seen as negative.  Companies  get financed for  different  needs and reasons. The minimum investment for this  offering  was set at $0. If you know more about the reasons for the  fundraising, please comment below.
What is Form D? What It Is Used For
Form D disclosures could be used to track and understand better your competitors. The information in Form D is usually highly confidential for ventures and startups and they don’t like revealing it. This is because it reveals amount raised or planned to be raised as well as reasons for the financing. This could help competitors. Entrepreneurs usually want to keep their financing a ‘secret’ so they can stay in stealth mode for longer.
Why Fundraising Reporting Is Good For Zero Mass Water  Also
The Form D signed by Cody Friesen might help Zero Mass Water, Inc.’s business. First, it helps potential customers feel more safe to deal with a firm that is well financed. The odds are higher that it will stay in the business. Second, this could attract other investors such as venture-capital firms, funds and angels. Third, positive PR effects could even bring leasing firms and venture lenders.
