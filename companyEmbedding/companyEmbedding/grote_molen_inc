(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  You should read the following discussion in conjunction with our financial statements, which are included elsewhere in this report. The following information contains forward-looking statements. (See "Forward-Looking Statements" and "Item 1A. Risk Factors.")  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  This report contains forward-looking statements that reflect the Company's views with respect to future events based upon information available to it at this time. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. These uncertainties and other factors include, but are not limited to the risk factors described in Part I, Item 1A hereof under the caption "Risk Factors." The words "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "expects," "plans," "projects," "targets" and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date the statement was made. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, changes in assumptions, future events or otherwise.  General  Grote Molen, Inc. ("Grote Molen") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 15, 2004. BrownWick, LLC ("BrownWick"), a wholly owned subsidiary, was formed in the State of Idaho on June 5, 2005. The principal business of Grote Molen and BrownWick (collectively the "Company") is to distribute electrical and hand operated grain mills, home kitchen mixers and related accessories for home use.  Critical Accounting Policies  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires our management to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements, including the notes thereto, and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies, if any. We consider our critical accounting policies to be those that require the more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of financial statements, including the following:  Accounts Receivable  Trade accounts receivable are carried at original invoice amount less an estimate made for doubtful accounts. We determine the allowance for doubtful accounts by identifying potential troubled accounts and by using historical experience and future expectations applied to an aging of accounts. Trade accounts receivable are written off when deemed uncollectible. Recoveries of trade accounts receivable previously written off are recorded as income when received. We determined that no allowance for doubtful accounts was required at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.  Inventories  Inventories, consisting primarily of grain mills, kitchen mixers, parts and accessories, are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined using primarily the first-in-first-out (FIFO) method. We purchase substantially all inventories from two foreign suppliers, and have been dependent on those suppliers for substantially all inventory purchases since we commenced operations.  Deposits  Generally we are required to pay advance deposits toward the purchase of inventories from our principal suppliers. Such advance payments are recorded as deposits, a current asset in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.  Property and Equipment  Property and equipment are carried at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows: office equipment - 3 to 5 years; warehouse equipment - 5 to 10 years; website development - 3 years; and molds - 10 years. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in operations for the period. The cost of maintenance and repairs is charged to operations as incurred. Significant renewals and betterments are capitalized.  Intangible Assets  Intangible assets are recorded at cost, less accumulated amortization. Amortization of definitive lived intangible assets is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives or contractual lives of the assets, which range from 10 to 30 years.  Our indefinite lived intangible asset includes the cost to acquire from a German manufacturer in 2012 the license to produce a 110-volt mixer. The license agreement stipulates that as long as the Company meets the terms of the agreement, the Company will have an exclusive license to the mixer indefinitely. No specific legal life or term to the license is otherwise stated in the agreement. We have concluded that no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic, or other factors limit the useful life of this intangible asset. We therefore have classified the license as indefinite, and are not amortizing its carrying value.  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  We periodically review our long-lived assets, including intangible assets, for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. No events or changes in circumstances have occurred to indicate that the carrying amount of our long-lived assets may not be recoverable. Therefore, no impairment loss was recognized during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.  Revenue Recognition  We record revenue from the sales of grain mills, kitchen mixers and accessories in accordance with the underlying sales agreements when the products are shipped, the selling price is fixed and determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.  Warranties  We provide limited warranties to our customers for certain of our products sold. We perform warranty work at our service center in Pocatello, Idaho or at other authorized service locations. Warranty expenses have not been material to our consolidated financial statements.  Research and Development Costs  Research and development costs are expensed as incurred in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification(TM) ("ASC") Topic 730, Research and Development. The costs of materials and other costs acquired for research and development activities are charged to expense as incurred. Salaries, wages, and other related costs of personnel, as well as other facility operating costs are allocated to research and development expense through management's estimate of the percentage of time spent by personnel in research and development activities. We had no material research and development costs for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.  Foreign Currency Transactions  All transactions with our foreign suppliers and customers are delineated in United States Dollars. Therefore, there are no effects of foreign currency transactions and translations in our consolidated financial statements.  Income Taxes  We account for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.  FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires us to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based upon the technical merits of the position. If the more-likely-than-not threshold is met, we must measure the tax position to determine the amount to recognize in our consolidated financial statements. We performed a review of our material tax positions in accordance with recognition and measurement standards established by ASC Topic 740 and concluded we had no unrecognized tax benefit that would affect the effective tax rate if recognized for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.  We include interest and penalties arising from the underpayment of income taxes, if any, in our consolidated statements of operations in general and administrative expenses. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we had no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  Our financial instruments consist of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and notes payable. The carrying amount of cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximates fair value because of the short-term nature of these items. The carrying amount of the notes payable approximates fair value because the interest rates on the notes approximate market rates of interest.  Results of Operations  Sales Our business is not seasonal; however, our quarterly sales, including sales to related parties, may fluctuate materially from period to period. At times we derive a significant portion of our revenues from sales to related parties. Each of our two principal stockholders own companies that are significant customers. Our sales for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were comprised of the following: 2015 2014 Sales $ 1,446,128 $ 1,334,858 Sales to related parties 81,062 68,277 Total sales $ 1,527,190 $ 1,403,135  Sales to related parties represented approximately 5% total sales for the each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  Our total sales increased by $124,055, or approximately 9%, during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. While the increase in sales in 2015 was attributable to the successful introduction of our new WonderMix kitchen mixer, we believe there continues to be an overall slow-down in the preparedness market and continued slow economic recovery in the United States. We completed the development of the molds and the design process during the fourth quarter of 2014, and received our first shipments of the new grain mills. We believe sales of the Wondermix will continue to increase in 2016; however, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these endeavors.  Cost of Sales  Total cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $1,111,422, compared to $995,605 for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $115,817, or approximately 12%. Our cost of sales consists of the purchase price of our products incurred to our suppliers, plus inbound shipping costs. We do not manufacture our own products. Our costs to purchase products for resale remained relatively constant during 2015. Therefore, the increase in our cost of sales during 2015 was primarily attributed to the increase in sales volume compared to 2014. Included in cost of sales were cost of related party sales of $58,993 and $48,446 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Total cost of sales as a percentage of total sales was approximately 73% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to approximately 71% for the year ended December 31, 2014.  Cost of sales as a percentage of sales may fluctuate from period to period, based on the mix of products sold during a particular period and pricing arrangements with our suppliers. In addition, we purchase substantially all inventories from two foreign suppliers, and have been dependent on those suppliers for substantially all inventory purchases since we commenced operations. International manufacturing is subject to factors that can have a material impact on our costs of sales, including: availability of labor at costs consistent with historical levels; changes in labor or other laws; instability of social, political and economic factors; freight costs, including domestic and international customs and tariffs; unexpected changes in regulatory environments; costs and availability of manufacturing materials; and other factors.  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  Our selling, general and administrative expenses were $304,095 for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $276,371 for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $27,724, or approximately 10%. In 2015, we incurred higher levels of professional fees, advertising and web design and hosting.  Management Fees to Related Parties  Pursuant to an agreement effective in February 2011, we pay a monthly management fee to a company owned by one of the major stockholders of the Company to manage our day-to-day business activities and to provide business space. Historically we have paid monthly management fees in varying amounts to this related party pursuant to prior agreements. The agreement is on a month-to-month basis and can be cancelled at any time by the vote of management. The agreement was amended and restated on October 31, 2014 to increase the monthly fee from $10,700 to $12,500 effective November 1, 2014. Also included in management fees are monthly payments of $150 to another major stockholder of the Company for expense reimbursement. Management fees to related parties totaled $151,800 and $133,800 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  Depreciation and Amortization Expense  Depreciation and amortization expense was $18,016 and $6,763 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, with the increase attributable to placing the molds for the new kitchen mixers in service during the fourth quarter of 2014.  Research and Development Expenses  Research and development activities are not currently significant to our business. We did not incur material research and development expenses in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.  Other Expense  Other expense includes interest expense on our indebtedness, a significant portion of which is indebtedness to related parties. Total interest expense - related parties was $10,628 and $14,679 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in interest expense to related parties is due to repayments on both current and long-term debt to related parties in the current year. Total interest expense to non-related parties was $15,009 and $12,597 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in interest expense to non-related parties is due to the increase in debt to non-related parties in the current year.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  As of December 31, 2015, we had total current assets of $822,115, including cash of $9,251, and current liabilities of $420,333, resulting in working capital of $401,782. Our current assets and working capital included inventories of $708,893 and deposits of $64,685. Generally, we are required to pay significant advance deposits toward the purchase of inventories from our principal suppliers.  In addition, as of December 31, 2015, we had total stockholders' equity of $459,399. We have financed our operations, the acquisition of inventories, and the payment of vendor deposits from our operations, short-term loans from our principal stockholders and non-related parties, a long-term note payable from a bank, and from the issuance of our common stock.  For the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash used in operating activities was $30,209, as a result of our net loss of $52,120 and increases in inventories of $380,733, partially offset by non-cash expenses of $18,016, decreases in accounts receivable of $17,652, accounts receivable - related parties of $1,776, deposits of $317,610 and prepaid expenses of $6,579, and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $23,949, accrued interest payable - related parties of $8,571 and accrued interest payable of $8,491.  By comparison, for the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash used in operating activities was $222,958, as a result of our net loss of $42,576, increases in accounts receivable of $1,172, accounts receivable - related parties of $3,294, inventories of $39,641 and deposits of $178,660, and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $20,263, partially offset by non-cash expenses totaling $9,294, a decrease in prepaid expenses of $38,198, and increases in accrued interest payable - related parties of $9,382 and accrued interest payable of $5,774.  For the year ended December 31, 2014, we had net cash used in investing activities of $1,423, comprised of the purchase of property and equipment. We had no net cash provided by or used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015.  For the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash used in financing activities was $21,348, comprised of repayment of notes payable - related parties of $24,500, repayment of long-term debt - related party of $49,734 and repayment of long-term note payable of $20,314, partially offset by proceeds from long-term note payable of $28,700 and proceeds from notes payable of $44,500.  For the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash provided by financing activities was $206,120, comprised of proceeds from long-term note payable of $151,930, proceeds from notes payable - related parties of $50,000, proceeds from notes payable of $19,600 and proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $60,000, partially offset by repayment of notes payable - related parties of $15,000, repayment of long-term debt - related party of $42,702 and repayment of long-term note payable of $17,708.  At December 31, 2015, we had short-term notes payable - related parties totaling $130,127, which are payable to our principal stockholders, are unsecured, bear interest at rates ranging from 6% to 8% per annum and are generally due on demand. In addition, at December 31, 2015, we had short-term notes payable to non-related parties totaling $136,100, which are unsecured, bear interest at rates ranging from 6% to 8% per annum and are due on demand.  At December 31, 2015, our long-term debt - related party was comprised of the remaining principal balance of $2,943 of a note payable to a principal stockholder. The note bears interest at 6.97% per annum and was paid in full in February 2016.  At December 31, 2015, we had a long-term note payable to a bank with a principal balance of $145,139. The long-term note payable is a line of credit promissory note bearing interest at an indexed rate plus 2% (4.5% at December 31, 2015), requiring monthly interest payments only and maturing on May 16, 2021. For the past several months, we have made monthly payments of principal and interest of $5,000. The note payable has an available line of credit of $150,000 and is secured by a deed of trust on certain real estate owned by one of the principal stockholders of the Company and by the Company's inventories, property and equipment, and intangible assets.  Accrued interest payable - related parties was $53,507 and $44,936 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Accrued interest payable to non-related parties was $22,686 and $14,195 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  In the event sales during 2016 do not meet our expectations, we may require additional funding from the sale of our common stock or debt in order to meet our obligations. Depending on the requirement to pay advance deposits on orders from our suppliers, we estimate we may require $50,000 to $100,000 of additional funding in 2016. No assurances can be given that, if required, such funding will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  In July 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2015-11, "Inventory (Topic 330), Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory." An entity is required to measure inventory within the scope of this Update at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. Other than the change in the subsequent measurement guidance from the lower of cost or market to the lower of cost and net realizable value for inventory within the scope of this Update, there are no other substantive changes to the guidance on measurement of inventory. For public companies, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments in this Update are to be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. We are currently unable to determine the impact on our consolidated financial statements of the adoption of this new accounting pronouncement.  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)". ASU 2014-09 amends the guidance for revenue recognition to replace numerous, industry-specific requirements and converges areas under this topic with those of the International Financial Reporting Standards. The ASU implements a five-step process for customer contract revenue recognition that focuses on transfer of control, as opposed to transfer of risk and rewards. The amendment also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows from contracts with customers. Other major provisions include the capitalization and amortization of certain contract costs, ensuring the time value of money is considered in the transaction price, and allowing estimates of variable consideration to be recognized before contingencies are resolved in certain circumstances. The amendments in this ASU are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016; however, in July 2015, the FASB agreed to delay the effective date by one year. The proposed deferral may permit early adoption, but would not allow adoption any earlier than the original effective date of the standard. Entities can transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. We are currently assessing the impact the adoption of ASU 2014-09, including possible transition alternatives, will have on our consolidated financial statements.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  Pursuant to an agreement effective in February 2011, we pay a monthly management fee to a company owned by one of the major stockholders of the Company to manage the day-to-day business activities of the Company and provide business space. Historically we have paid monthly management fees in varying amounts to this related party pursuant to prior agreements approved by the stockholders of the Company. The agreement is on a month-to-month basis and can be cancelled at any time by the vote of management. On October 31, 2014, the agreement was amended and restated to increase the monthly fee from $10,700 to $12,500 effective November 1, 2014.  We also pay another major stockholder of the Company at the rate of $150 per month for expense reimbursement.  Mar 30, 2016  (c) 1995-2016 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved
