Stephen T. Zarrilli
STEPHEN T. ZARRILLI was appointed as U.S. Interactive, Inc.’s Chief
Executive Officer in February 1999. Mr. Zarrilli, one of the company’s
original employees, had previously been the company’s Chief Financial
and Administrative Officer since January 1995. He joined U.S.

Steve Zarrilli named Chair of La Salle University's Board of Trustees
 


 

 




 





 


PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 11, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- La Salle University Trustee and School of Business alumnus Stephen T. Zarrilli was recently named Chair of the University's Board of Trustees. A La Salle Trustee since 2012, Zarrilli serves as President and Chief Executive Officer of publicly traded Safeguard Scientifics, Inc., a growth capital provider headquartered in Wayne, Pa.
Zarrilli succeeds William R. Sautter, La Salle School of Business alumnus and President and Chief Executive Officer of Elliott-Lewis Corporation, who served as Board Chair for nine years.
"This is an important time in La Salle's history and in the rapidly changing higher education industry," Sautter said. "Steve brings many strengths to his role as Chair of La Salle's Board of Trustees. Among those strengths are keen business acumen, a deep respect for the mission and values of the Christian Brothers, and a commitment to advancing the University."  
Zarrilli will work closely with newly appointed President Colleen M. Hanycz, Ph.D., who formerly served as Principal (a Canadian equivalent of President) at Brescia University College in London, Ontario, Canada. Both the new President and new Chair began their terms on July 1.
Zarrilli has built a career spanning 30 years in executive strategic, financial, and operational roles.  He has held various positions as chief financial officer and chief executive officer of public and private companies, demonstrating the ability to successfully grow and manage a diverse selection of enterprises. He also contributes a substantial amount of time serving on a variety of community-based nonprofit boards. He is the Chairman of Ben Franklin Technology Partners/SEP and serves on the boards of the University City Science Center, the Philadelphia Chapter of the National Association of Corporate Directors (NACD), and the Greater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce. He is the past Chairman of the Advisory Board of the Arts & Business Council for Greater Philadelphia and the past Philadelphia Regional Chairman/State Board Member for Economics Pennsylvania. He is also currently a director of Virtus Investment Partners, Inc., a publicly traded investment management company.  
Zarrilli has been very engaged with the University as a Trustee and an alumnus. He was directly involved in launching La Salle University's Center for Entrepreneurship in 2010, and has been recognized by La Salle three separate times with the University's E-Vision Award (2001), the Accounting Department's Michael A. DeAngelis Award (2009), and the Business School's honorary admission to its Beta Gamma Sigma Chapter (2010).
Zarrilli also serves as an Advisory Board member of the Corporate Governance Council of Drexel University's LeBow School of Business and as a member of the Advisory Board for Executive Education at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.
A former Certified Public Accountant, Zarrilli graduated from La Salle University in 1983 with an accounting degree and is a frequent lecturer on corporate governance, financial management, organizational, and capital development matters. He also completed the Advanced Management Program at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 2010.
Zarrilli and his wife, Carol, also a member of La Salle's Class of 1983, have three children. 
La Salle University was established in 1863 through the legacy of St. John Baptist de La Salle and the Christian Brothers teaching order, which St. La Salle founded in 1680. La Salle is an educational community shaped by traditional Catholic and Lasallian values. In a national survey, Money magazine ranked La Salle as a top five college in the Philadelphia region for educational quality, affordability, and alumni earnings, and cited the University as a "Value All-Star." Globally, the Lasallian educational network includes 1,000 schools (60 of which are institutions of higher education) serving 940,000 students in 80 countries.

Safeguard Scientifics Announces Stephen Zarrilli as New CEO


October 25, 2012
By Connie Loizos






Safeguard Scientifics, the Wayne, Pa.-based, publicly traded holding company with stakes in growth-stage life sciences and tech company, has promoted senior VP and CFO Stephen Zarrilli to the post of CE0. Zarrilli will take the reins on November 1. He succeeds Peter Boni.

PRESS RELEASE:
Safeguard Scientifics, Inc., a holding company that builds value in growth-stage life sciences and technology companies, today announced that the Safeguard board of directors has named Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Stephen T. Zarrilli, 51, to succeed Mr. Boni as President and CEO, effective November 1, 2012. Peter J. Boni, 67, will retire at the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders on May 23, 2013 after more than seven years as the primary architect of Safeguard’s repositioning as the preferred catalyst for growth capital. Mr. Zarrilli will also join the Board of Directors of the Company effective November 1, 2012.
“The satisfaction I’ve gained from growing Safeguard and its roster of high-potential partner companies is exceeded only by my immense pleasure from working with the board, Steve and the rest of the Safeguard team”
“This transition comes at a time when Safeguard has never been stronger, strategically or financially,” said Andrew E. Lietz, Chairman of the Safeguard board of directors. “Peter took the Safeguard reins in August 2005, revitalized and refocused the Company post-Internet bubble, and delivered above-average returns even during the current period of prolonged and unprecedented economic uncertainty. Steve Zarrilli is a strong and capable executive who worked closely with Peter to improve Safeguard’s financial strength and flexibility, and to set the stage for continued growth and platform expansion.” 





Mr. Lietz said that from November 2012 until May 2013, Mr. Boni will provide transitional support to Mr. Zarrilli as CEO emeritus. For the balance of 2013, Mr. Boni will serve as a senior advisor to Safeguard.
“Steve Zarrilli and I have worked shoulder to shoulder for six years to position Safeguard as a company builder, focused on growth-stage life sciences and technology businesses,” Mr. Boni said. “Steve is the right executive at the right time to build on that momentum and take Safeguard even higher, to the benefit of shareholders and partner companies.”
“I am humbled by the board’s confidence and support in this new assignment,” Mr. Zarrilli said. “I am energized by the opportunity to continue to work with the Safeguard team to build additional value.”
Over the course of a 30 year career, Mr. Zarrilli has served as CEO and CFO of both publicly traded and privately held technology companies. He also has substantial board governance experience having served on four other publicly traded enterprises over the last 15 years. Mr. Zarrilli joined Safeguard as its CFO in 2006.
Mr. Boni led Safeguard as the Company exited non-strategic legacy businesses and deployed approximately $315 million into two-dozen high growth situations. Three of Safeguard’s partner companies completed initial public offerings and large-cap strategic buyers including Oracle, Eli Lilly, Shire, McKesson and GE Healthcare acquired others. These exits generated approximately $643 million. At the same time, Safeguard improved its debt to equity ratio and built its net cash position to record levels. 





“The satisfaction I’ve gained from growing Safeguard and its roster of high-potential partner companies is exceeded only by my immense pleasure from working with the board, Steve and the rest of the Safeguard team,” Mr. Boni said. “While I may be retiring from Safeguard, I have more in the tank and look forward to identifying new ways to contribute. I’m also looking forward to spending more time with my growing family and young grandchildren.”

"I'm very excited to join the Nutrisystem board," said Mr. Mangan. "I've admired what the board and leadership team have accomplished in turning around this iconic brand. Our country is in the midst of an obesity epidemic and Nutrisystem is providing innovative options to help people change their lives and get healthy.

Nutrisystem's Board of Directors also announced that current Board member, Stephen T. Zarrilli, President and Chief Executive Officer of Safeguard Scientifics, Inc., is stepping down from the Board, a position he has held since December 2003, due to other growing commitments both at Safeguard and in his new role with another public company board. 
"The Board and the management team are grateful to Steve for his many contributions during his nearly 12 years on the board," said Mr. Hagan. "As a company, we have benefited from his expertise in strategic management, leading the Audit Committee and his dedication to best corporate governance practices. As a Board, we have enjoyed Steve's insights, his acumen and his tremendous counsel. He will be missed."
"I have had the privilege of being a member of Nutrisystem's board and working with such strong fellow directors and management personnel," said Mr. Zarrilli. "While leaving is always hard, I know that the Company is again operating from a position of significant market strength with a very strong leadership team.
