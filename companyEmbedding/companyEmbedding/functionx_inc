	Item
	2.04 Triggering Events That Accelerate or Increase a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement





	 




	As
	previously reported on the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on April 19,2017, on April 18, 2017, the Company entered
	into a Note Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with the holder of the $3,000,000 promissory note issued
	by the Company on July 8, 2016, in connection with the Company’s acquisition of the assets of Rant, Inc., and issued its
	Amended and Restated 12% Secured Convertible Promissory Note (the “Note”) in the amount of $3,284,000, which Note
	matures on June 1, 2017. The failure of the Company to file its Form 10-Q for the period ending March 31, 2017, constitutes a
	“Public Information Failure” (as defined in the Exchange Agreement) and as a result, the Company became obligated
	to pay the Holder, an amount in cash equal to one percent (1%) of the greater of the product of (A) the aggregate number of shares
	of common stock which the holder is entitled to convert pursuant to the Note and (B) the closing bid price of the common stock
	on the trading day immediately preceding the Public Information Failure, and on every 30

	th

	day (prorated for periods
	less than thirty days) thereafter until the Public Information Failure is cured. The payments are due on the earlier of the last
	day of the month in which the Public Information Failure occurred and the third business day after the failure is cured. If not
	paid timely such payments bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (prorated when made). The Company does not anticipate it
	will be able to pay the Note on the due date and therefore will be in default under the Note on the date that is five business
	days following the due date.







	 















	Item 3.01 Notice of Delisting or Failure
	to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing.




	 




	On May
	25, 2017, Function(x) Inc. (the “Company”) received written notice from the Listing Qualifications Department (the
	“Staff”) of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) indicating that the Company no longer satisfied Nasdaq’s
	filing requirement, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), due to its failure to timely file the Form 10-Q for the period
	ended March 31, 2017 (the “Form 10-Q”) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and that
	the Company’s common stock was subject to delisting from Nasdaq unless the Company timely requests a hearing before the Nasdaq
	Hearings Panel (the “Panel”).



	 



	The Company
	requested a hearing before the Panel, at which hearing the Company will present its plan to regain compliance with the filing requirement
	and to request an extension, if necessary, within which to do so. The hearing request will automatically stay any delisting action
	by the Staff through June 16, 2017; however, as part of the hearing request, the Company also requested that the stay be extended
	pending the issuance of the Panel’s decision and the expiration of any extension granted by the Panel following the hearing.
	There can be no assurance that the stay will be extended or that the Panel will ultimately grant the Company’s request for
	continued listing on Nasdaq.



	 



	The filing
	deficiency is in addition to the bid price deficiency, of which the Company was notified by the Staff on April 7, 2017 and granted
	a grace period within which to regain compliance through October 4, 2017, as reported on the Current Report on Form 8-K filed on
	April 13, 2017.







	 










	Item
	8.01 Other Events





	 




	On
	June 1, 2017, the Company issued a press release relating to the notice received from the Staff. A copy of the press release is

However yesterday the stock remained in between $0.7117 and $0.9000. The stock is above its 52-week low with 122.83% and is in the wake of its 52-week high with -92.35%.

Likewise, the downbeat performance for the last quarter was -63.04% and for the full year it was -86.55%. Moreover the Company’s Year To Date performance was -67.64%. Now a days one of the fundamental indicator used in the technical analysis is called Stochastic %D”, Stochastic indicator was created by George Lane. The stochastic is a momentum indicator comparing the closing price of a security to the range of its prices over a fix period of time. The gauge is based on the assumption that if price surges, the closing price tends towards the values that belong to the upper part of the area of price movements in the preceding period. On the other hand if price drops, the contrary is right. For Function(x) Inc. (NASDAQ:FNCX), Stochastic %D value stayed at 74.85% for the last 9 days. Considering more the value stands at 78.50% and 81.58% for 14 and 20 days, in that order.

The company has managed to keep price to sales ratio of 5.61 against an industry average of 20.77. The price to sales ratio is the ratio of the market value of equity to the sales.

In-Depth Technical Study
Investors generally keep an extensive variety of technical indicators at their disposal for completing technical stock analysis. The average true range is a moving average, generally 14 days, of the true ranges.
The average true range (ATR) was fashioned to allow traders to more precisely evaluate the daily volatility of an asset by using straightforward calculations. However the indicator does not specify the price direction, rather it is used first and foremost to measure volatility caused by gaps and limit up or down moves. The ATR is fairly simple to calculate and only needs historical price data.
ATR is counted for different periods, like 9-day, 14-day, 20-day, 50-day and 100-day. At the moment, the 14-day ATR for Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. (NASDAQ:MXIM) is noted at 0.77.

Function(X), Inc. - Key Performance Indicators






Business Wire




Nov 22, 2016 10:59 AM EST













 




























































  Function(x) Inc. (NASDAQ: FNCX) (the "Company") today reported financial results for the three months ended September 30, 2016. This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161122005773/en/   Function(X), Inc. - Key Performance Indicators   Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $659,000 down from $922,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. For the same period the cash revenue for the Company's Publishing Segment, which we consider our core operating business, was $371,000 down from $561,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Net loss and diluted loss per share for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 were $(7,553,000) and $(2.53), respectively.  EBITDA for the Company for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was a loss of $2,693,000, which is an improvement from a loss of $7,292,000 for the same period in 2015. EBITDA for the Publishing Segment was a loss of $1,633,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, which represents a material improvement from the loss of $6,756,000 for such segment in the prior year. Without expenses of $659,000, which management has determined are operational expenses that we do not anticipate to affect the financials going forward, the loss in EBITDA for the Publishing Segment would have been $973,000. These unusual operational expenses include stock compensation, costs associated with our ongoing S-1, costs associated with the acquisition of Rant, and one time marketing expense. Additionally, we have not included an incremental $173,000 of cost savings that were not fully realized in the quarter which we expect to impact our financials going forward; giving effect to these cost savings would further reduce the loss of $973,000 above to $800,000.  For full details on the above and other pertinent figures, please see exhibit A and B, attached herein.

the third power plus 4x. And then they ask us to find f
times g of x So the first thing to realize is that this
notation f times g of x is just referring
to a function that is a product of f
of x and g of x. So by definition, this notation
just means f of x times g of x. And then we just
have to substitute f of x with this definition,
g of x with this definition, and then multiply out these
algebraic expressions. f of x is right over there. And g of x, is right over there. So let's do it. So this is going to be
equal to-- switch back to the orange color. It's going to be
equal to f of x, which is 7x minus 5
times g of x, and g of x is x to the
third power plus 4x. And you could-- we're
multiplying two expressions that each have two terms. You could use FOIL if you like. I don't like using
FOIL because you might forget what
it's even about. Foil is really just using the
distributive property twice. So for example, you
take this expression. Whatever you have out here,
if you had a 9 out here, or an a, or an x, or anything. Now you have 7x minus 5. If you're multiplying it
times this expression, you would multiply this
times each term over here. So when you multiply 7x
minus 5 times x to the third, you get-- I'll
write it this way. You get x to the third times--
actually, let me write it the other way. You get 7x minus 5
times x to the third. And then you have plus
7x minus 5 times 4x. And now we can do the
distributive property again. We're not normally
used to seeing the things we distribute
on the right hand side. It's the same exact idea. We could put the x to
the third here as well. And when we distribute,
you multiply x to the third times 7x
and times negative 5. x to the third times 7x
is 7x to the fourth power. X to the third times negative
5 is minus 5x to the third. And then you do it over here. You distribute the
4x over the 7x. 4x times 7x is plus 28x squared. 4x times negative
5 is minus 20x. And let's see if we
can simplify this. We only have one fourth degree
term, one third degree term, one second degree term,
and one first degree term. Actually, we can't
simplify this anymore. And we're done. This is the product of those
two function definitions. This is f times g of x. It is a new function created
by multiplying the other two functions.Adding and subtracting functionsDividing functionsUp NextDividing functions
