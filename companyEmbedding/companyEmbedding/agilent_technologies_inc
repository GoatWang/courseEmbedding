About Agilent Technologies, Inc.

   Products from Agilent Technologies have a measurable effect on the scientific world. A leading maker of scientific testing equipment, Agilent supplies a slew of analytical and measurement instruments, including gas and liquid chromatographs, mass spectrometers, vacuum pumps, anatomic pathology workflows, and genetic and diagnostic instruments and tools. Its operations include products used in life sciences, chemical analysis, energy, and food, forensics, and environment. Agilent's customers include Bristol-Myers Squib Co., Dow Chemical, Merck, and the University of California, Davis. The company, which gets most of sales outside the US, spun off its electronic measurement business in late 2014.
  
Operations

   Agilent operates through three business segments: life sciences and applied markets, diagnostics and genomics, and Agilent CrossLab.
  

   The life sciences and applied markets business brings in about half of Agilent's revenue by providing instruments and software that customers use to identify, quantify, and analyze the physical and biological properties of substances and products.
  

   Agilent CrossLab accounts for a third of the company's revenue with its portfolio of consumables and services.
  

   Diagnostics and genomics generates the rest of Agilent's revenue from reagents, instruments, microarrays, and synthetic RNA.
  
Geographic Reach

   The US remains Agilent's largest single geographic market, accounting for 30% of sales. China, the only other country Agilent reports separately, accounts for a fifth of sales. Other international operations provide the remainder of revenue. Agilent has manufacturing plants in Australia, China, Denmark, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, The Netherlands, Poland, Singapore, the UK, and the US.
  
Sales and Marketing

   The company sells most of its products directly, although it also relies on resellers, distributors, e-commerce, and other channels to a lesser degree. It also has a diverse customer base -- some 23,000 customers for life sciences and applied markets business, about 39,000 Agilent CrossLab customers, and about 14,000 diagnostics and genomics customers. The company spends about $30 million a year on advertising.
  
Financial Performance

   Agilent reported increases of 4% in revenue to $4.2 billion and 15% in net income to $462 million for 2016 (ended October) compared to 2015. The company also posted a surge in cash generated by operations year-to-year. Agilent said foreign currency exchange rates reduced its overall earnings by two percentage points in 2016 from 2015.
  

   Sales in the life sciences and applied markets business ticked up 1% in 2016. Strong growth in China helped offset softness in the Americas and Europe. Agilent's liquid chromatography products generated revenue growth in the pharmaceutical market. While mass spectrometry products sales rose in China, they were hit by continued declines in the chemical and energy markets and in the diagnostic and clinical markets in the Americas. Revenue from diagnostics and genomics increased 7% in 2016, boosted by growth in genomics, strength in the pathology business, and continued demand in nucleic acid products. The diagnostics and clinical research markets continued to be strong, driven by an aging population and lifestyle. The CrossLab business generated 7% more revenue in 2016 from increases in enterprise service contracts, liquid chromatography small molecule columns, remarketed instruments, and bio-columns.
  

   Agilent combined higher revenue with lower costs to score a profit of $462 million in 2016. The absence in 2016 of expenses for discontinued operations, which were $37 million in 2016, also helped push profit higher.
  

   Cash provided by operations closed 2016 at $793 million, compared to $491 for the year before. Starting with more net income, Agilent also had fewer expenses for obsolete and excess inventory, accounts payable and an increase from other assets and liabilities.
  
Strategy

   Agilent has identified product and geographic markets primed for growth while it relies on the slower-growing chemical and energy and environment and forensics markets, where it's the market leader, for sustaining revenue. The company sees growth opportunities in food, pharmaceuticals, academic and government, and clinical diagnostics, areas where its market share lags the competition.
  

   In products, Agilent allocates about 60% of its research and development funds to analytical instrumentation and informatics. The company's efforts have resulted in the Agilent Intuvo 9000, the Agilent 8900 Triple-Quad ICP-MS, and the Agilent Infinity II LC System. About a quarter of R&D goes to genomics and diagnostics with more than 10% for the CrossLab business. In 2016 the company was adding manufacturing capacity with a new manufacturing facility in Colorado, a $120 million investment over three years. It doubles the capacity for making nucleic acid products.
  

   For geographic growth, Agilent looks to emerging markets, including China. The company's grew 30% in 2016 from 2015, a increase of $190 million. It seeks to extend its reach in other countries such as India. Emerging markets delivered about $1.3 billion in revenue (about a third of the total) in 2016.
  

   The company has maintained control of costs, which, it says, should be aided by consolidating its company-wide financial reporting on one platform.
  
Mergers and Acquisitions

   Agilent searches for potential acquisitions that bring complementary technologies. In the company agreed to acquire Multiplicom N.V., which develops, manufactures and commercializes molecular-diagnostics kits, which enable personalized medicine, for about €68 million. Multiplicom strengthens Agilent's genomics portfolio with sequencing workflow capabilities.
  

   An $80 million investment made in 2016 bought Agilent a 48% stake in Lasergen Inc., an emerging biotechnology company that develops sequencing technology. The companies will collaborate on building a next-generation sequencing workflow for clinical applications, based on Lasergen's Lightning Terminators™ sequencing chemistry.
  

   In another 2016 acquisition, Agilent bought most of the assets of iLab Solutions, a provider of cloud-based services for core laboratory management, for $26 million. iLab's offerings help book time in shared facilities, to bill and invoice for projects, to manage studies, to generate reports and business intelligence, and to schedule instrument reservations across multiple projects.
  

   In 2015, Agilent bought Seahorse Bioscience, a provider of instruments and assay kits for measuring cell metabolism and bioenergetics, for $235 million. Seahorse's technology enables researchers to better understand cell health, function and signaling, and the impact of specific drugs.

Agilent Technologies is an American public research, development and manufacturing company established in 1999 as a spin-off from Hewlett-Packard. The resulting IPO of Agilent stock was the largest in the history of Silicon Valley at the time.[7][8]
The company provides analytical instruments, software, services and consumables for the entire laboratory workflow.[9] Agilent focuses its products and services on six markets: food, environmental and forensics, pharmaceutical, diagnostics, chemical and energy, and research. From 1999 to 2014 the company also produced test and measurement equipment, this division was spun out to form Keysight.

Agilent Technologies was created in 1999 by the spin-off of Hewlett-Packard's (HP's) "Medical Products and Instrument Group",[13] including instrumentation and chemical analysis, electronic component and medical equipment product lines.[14][note 1] The split was predicated on the difficulty of growing HP's revenue stream and on the competitive vigor of smaller, more agile competitors.[15] The company's launch slogan was "Innovating the HP Way", which capitalized on the strong HP corporate culture.[15] The starburst logo was selected to reflect "a burst of insight" (or "spark of insight")[16] and the name "Agilent" aimed to invoke the notion of agility as a trait of the new firm.[15] The Agilent spin-off was accompanied by an initial public offering which raised US$2,100,000,000, setting a record at the time.[7]
2000–2008[edit]
In the early 2000s, "economic uncertainty" depressed demand for Agilent's products,[17] including slow sales of health care products to hospitals in the United States, which accounted for 60% of the company's revenue at the time.[13] The downturn also struck sales in the communications and semiconductor markets, where orders amounting to US$500,000,000 were canceled by buyers.[18] These poor economic conditions prompted large reductions in force; from a headcount in 1999 of 35,000, which had risen to 48,000 by May 2001,[18] it had by early 2003 cut 18,500 positions.[17] In 2001, in midst of this downsizing, Agilent sold its health care and medical products organization to Philips Medical Systems,[19] and was noted as having a valuation of about US$11,000,000,000.[20] HP Medical Products had been the second oldest part of Hewlett-Packard, acquired in the 1950s.[citation needed]
In August 2005, Agilent announced the sale of its semiconductor business, which produced chips for a wide range of consumer and industrial uses, to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Silver Lake Partners for US$2,660,000,000.[7] This move was part of a broad effort to concentrate "on the test-and-measurement business at its historic core," and would entail termination of about 1,300 of the company's 28,000 employees.[7] The group operated as a private company, Avago Technologies, until August 2009, when it was brought public in an IPO. After purchasing Broadcom Corporation in 2016, Avago changed its name to Broadcom Limited.
Also in August 2005, Agilent sold its 47% stake in the light-emitting diode manufacturer Lumileds to Philips for US$1,000,000,000.[7] Lumileds originally started as Hewlett-Packard's optoelectronics division.
Also in August 2005, Agilent announced a plan to divest its semiconductor test solutions business, composed of both the system-on-chip and memory test market areas.[7] Agilent listed the new company as Verigy, mid-2006 on NASDAQ.
2009[edit]
In 2009, Agilent announced the closure of a subsection of its Test & Measurement division. The product lines affected included the automated optical inspection, solder paste inspection, and automated X-ray products [5DX]. In 2004 Agilent reported that it had captured 19% of the US$244,000,000 (excluding Japan) global imaging inspection market.[21] On July 27, 2009, Agilent announced they would buy Varian, Inc., for US$1,500,000,000. In November 2009, Agilent sold the N2X product line to IXIA. In February 2010 Agilent announced the selling of its Network Solutions Division to JDSU for US$162,000,000.
2011[edit]
In 2011, the company along with the University of California, Davis, announced that it would be establishing the "Davis Millimeter Wave Research Center".[22]
Agilent announced it would increase its life sciences engagement through the acquisition of Halo Genomics, based in Uppsala, Sweden, which was involved in next-generation sequencing technology development.[23]
2012[edit]
On May 17, 2012, Agilent agreed to buy Dako, a Danish cancer diagnostics company, for US$2,200,000,000, to expand its presence in the life sciences industry.[24]
2013[edit]
On Sept. 19, 2013, Agilent announced its decision to separate into two publicly traded companies: Agilent life sciences, diagnostics, applied markets company, and an electronic measurement company.[25] The life sciences company will retain the Agilent name and the electronic measurement company will be called Keysight Technologies.[26]
2014[edit]
On Oct. 14 the company announced that it is exiting its Nuclear Magnetic Resonance business.[27]
On Nov. 1 the formal separation of Agilent and Keysight Technologies was completed.[8] Agilent announced it has completed the spin-off of its electronic measurement business, Keysight Technologies. Keysight begins trading on the New York Stock Exchange today under the symbol KEYS. The separation was implemented through a spinoff of Keysight’s common stock and is intended to be tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. On Nov. 1, 2014, in a special dividend distribution of all outstanding shares of Keysight’s common stock, Agilent shareholders received one share of Keysight common stock for every two shares of Agilent common stock held as of close of business Oct. 22, 2014.
2015[edit]
Agilent celebrates its 50th anniversary in the analytical instruments market. Hewlett-Packard Co., Agilent’s predecessor, acquired F&M Scientific Corp., maker of gas chromatographs, on Aug. 8, 1965. In September, the company announced it would acquire Seahorse Bioscience for $235 million.[28]

Agilent Technologies is an American public research, development and manufacturing company established in 1999 as a spin-off from Hewlett-Packard. The resulting IPO of Agilent stock was the largest in the history of Silicon Valley at the time.[7][8]
The company provides analytical instruments, software, services and consumables for the entire laboratory workflow.[9] Agilent focuses its products and services on six markets: food, environmental and forensics, pharmaceutical, diagnostics, chemical and energy, and research. From 1999 to 2014 the company also produced test and measurement equipment, this division was spun out to form Keysight.

Agilent Technologies was created in 1999 by the spin-off of Hewlett-Packard's (HP's) "Medical Products and Instrument Group",[13] including instrumentation and chemical analysis, electronic component and medical equipment product lines.[14][note 1] The split was predicated on the difficulty of growing HP's revenue stream and on the competitive vigor of smaller, more agile competitors.[15] The company's launch slogan was "Innovating the HP Way", which capitalized on the strong HP corporate culture.[15] The starburst logo was selected to reflect "a burst of insight" (or "spark of insight")[16] and the name "Agilent" aimed to invoke the notion of agility as a trait of the new firm.[15] The Agilent spin-off was accompanied by an initial public offering which raised US$2,100,000,000, setting a record at the time.[7]
2000–2008[edit]
In the early 2000s, "economic uncertainty" depressed demand for Agilent's products,[17] including slow sales of health care products to hospitals in the United States, which accounted for 60% of the company's revenue at the time.[13] The downturn also struck sales in the communications and semiconductor markets, where orders amounting to US$500,000,000 were canceled by buyers.[18] These poor economic conditions prompted large reductions in force; from a headcount in 1999 of 35,000, which had risen to 48,000 by May 2001,[18] it had by early 2003 cut 18,500 positions.[17] In 2001, in midst of this downsizing, Agilent sold its health care and medical products organization to Philips Medical Systems,[19] and was noted as having a valuation of about US$11,000,000,000.[20] HP Medical Products had been the second oldest part of Hewlett-Packard, acquired in the 1950s.[citation needed]
In August 2005, Agilent announced the sale of its semiconductor business, which produced chips for a wide range of consumer and industrial uses, to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Silver Lake Partners for US$2,660,000,000.[7] This move was part of a broad effort to concentrate "on the test-and-measurement business at its historic core," and would entail termination of about 1,300 of the company's 28,000 employees.[7] The group operated as a private company, Avago Technologies, until August 2009, when it was brought public in an IPO. After purchasing Broadcom Corporation in 2016, Avago changed its name to Broadcom Limited.
Also in August 2005, Agilent sold its 47% stake in the light-emitting diode manufacturer Lumileds to Philips for US$1,000,000,000.[7] Lumileds originally started as Hewlett-Packard's optoelectronics division.
Also in August 2005, Agilent announced a plan to divest its semiconductor test solutions business, composed of both the system-on-chip and memory test market areas.[7] Agilent listed the new company as Verigy, mid-2006 on NASDAQ.
2009[edit]
In 2009, Agilent announced the closure of a subsection of its Test & Measurement division. The product lines affected included the automated optical inspection, solder paste inspection, and automated X-ray products [5DX]. In 2004 Agilent reported that it had captured 19% of the US$244,000,000 (excluding Japan) global imaging inspection market.[21] On July 27, 2009, Agilent announced they would buy Varian, Inc., for US$1,500,000,000. In November 2009, Agilent sold the N2X product line to IXIA. In February 2010 Agilent announced the selling of its Network Solutions Division to JDSU for US$162,000,000.
2011[edit]
In 2011, the company along with the University of California, Davis, announced that it would be establishing the "Davis Millimeter Wave Research Center".[22]
Agilent announced it would increase its life sciences engagement through the acquisition of Halo Genomics, based in Uppsala, Sweden, which was involved in next-generation sequencing technology development.[23]
2012[edit]
On May 17, 2012, Agilent agreed to buy Dako, a Danish cancer diagnostics company, for US$2,200,000,000, to expand its presence in the life sciences industry.[24]
2013[edit]
On Sept. 19, 2013, Agilent announced its decision to separate into two publicly traded companies: Agilent life sciences, diagnostics, applied markets company, and an electronic measurement company.[25] The life sciences company will retain the Agilent name and the electronic measurement company will be called Keysight Technologies.[26]
2014[edit]
On Oct. 14 the company announced that it is exiting its Nuclear Magnetic Resonance business.[27]
On Nov. 1 the formal separation of Agilent and Keysight Technologies was completed.[8] Agilent announced it has completed the spin-off of its electronic measurement business, Keysight Technologies. Keysight begins trading on the New York Stock Exchange today under the symbol KEYS. The separation was implemented through a spinoff of Keysight’s common stock and is intended to be tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. On Nov. 1, 2014, in a special dividend distribution of all outstanding shares of Keysight’s common stock, Agilent shareholders received one share of Keysight common stock for every two shares of Agilent common stock held as of close of business Oct. 22, 2014.
2015[edit]
Agilent celebrates its 50th anniversary in the analytical instruments market. Hewlett-Packard Co., Agilent’s predecessor, acquired F&M Scientific Corp., maker of gas chromatographs, on Aug. 8, 1965. In September, the company announced it would acquire Seahorse Bioscience for $235 million.[28]
Corporate governance[edit]
Agilent's inaugural president and chief executive officer was Ned Barnholt,[15] and he retained this post at least through 2006.[19] Barnholt had originally joined Hewlett-Packard in 1966.[29]
In September 2014, William (Bill) Sullivan announced plans to retire as Agilent's CEO.[30] Mike McMullen, then president of the company's Chemical Analysis Group, was to succeed Sullivan as CEO.[30] As part of the succession plan announcement, McMullen was promoted to the roles of president and chief operating officer (COO).[30]
In 2015, McMullen was elected by Agilent's board of directors to the post of CEO, becoming Agilent's third CEO.[30][31]
Ownership[edit]
As of 2017 Agilent Technologies are mainly held by institutional investors (T. Rowe Price, BlackRock, Fidelity Investments, The Vanguard Group, State Street Corporation, and others[32])

Agilent Technologies is an American public research, development and manufacturing company established in 1999 as a spin-off from Hewlett-Packard. The resulting IPO of Agilent stock was the largest in the history of Silicon Valley at the time.[7][8]
The company provides analytical instruments, software, services and consumables for the entire laboratory workflow.[9] Agilent focuses its products and services on six markets: food, environmental and forensics, pharmaceutical, diagnostics, chemical and energy, and research. From 1999 to 2014 the company also produced test and measurement equipment, this division was spun out to form Keysight.

Agilent Technologies was created in 1999 by the spin-off of Hewlett-Packard's (HP's) "Medical Products and Instrument Group",[13] including instrumentation and chemical analysis, electronic component and medical equipment product lines.[14][note 1] The split was predicated on the difficulty of growing HP's revenue stream and on the competitive vigor of smaller, more agile competitors.[15] The company's launch slogan was "Innovating the HP Way", which capitalized on the strong HP corporate culture.[15] The starburst logo was selected to reflect "a burst of insight" (or "spark of insight")[16] and the name "Agilent" aimed to invoke the notion of agility as a trait of the new firm.[15] The Agilent spin-off was accompanied by an initial public offering which raised US$2,100,000,000, setting a record at the time.[7]
2000–2008[edit]
In the early 2000s, "economic uncertainty" depressed demand for Agilent's products,[17] including slow sales of health care products to hospitals in the United States, which accounted for 60% of the company's revenue at the time.[13] The downturn also struck sales in the communications and semiconductor markets, where orders amounting to US$500,000,000 were canceled by buyers.[18] These poor economic conditions prompted large reductions in force; from a headcount in 1999 of 35,000, which had risen to 48,000 by May 2001,[18] it had by early 2003 cut 18,500 positions.[17] In 2001, in midst of this downsizing, Agilent sold its health care and medical products organization to Philips Medical Systems,[19] and was noted as having a valuation of about US$11,000,000,000.[20] HP Medical Products had been the second oldest part of Hewlett-Packard, acquired in the 1950s.[citation needed]
In August 2005, Agilent announced the sale of its semiconductor business, which produced chips for a wide range of consumer and industrial uses, to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Silver Lake Partners for US$2,660,000,000.[7] This move was part of a broad effort to concentrate "on the test-and-measurement business at its historic core," and would entail termination of about 1,300 of the company's 28,000 employees.[7] The group operated as a private company, Avago Technologies, until August 2009, when it was brought public in an IPO. After purchasing Broadcom Corporation in 2016, Avago changed its name to Broadcom Limited.
Also in August 2005, Agilent sold its 47% stake in the light-emitting diode manufacturer Lumileds to Philips for US$1,000,000,000.[7] Lumileds originally started as Hewlett-Packard's optoelectronics division.
Also in August 2005, Agilent announced a plan to divest its semiconductor test solutions business, composed of both the system-on-chip and memory test market areas.[7] Agilent listed the new company as Verigy, mid-2006 on NASDAQ.
2009[edit]
In 2009, Agilent announced the closure of a subsection of its Test & Measurement division. The product lines affected included the automated optical inspection, solder paste inspection, and automated X-ray products [5DX]. In 2004 Agilent reported that it had captured 19% of the US$244,000,000 (excluding Japan) global imaging inspection market.[21] On July 27, 2009, Agilent announced they would buy Varian, Inc., for US$1,500,000,000. In November 2009, Agilent sold the N2X product line to IXIA. In February 2010 Agilent announced the selling of its Network Solutions Division to JDSU for US$162,000,000.
2011[edit]
In 2011, the company along with the University of California, Davis, announced that it would be establishing the "Davis Millimeter Wave Research Center".[22]
Agilent announced it would increase its life sciences engagement through the acquisition of Halo Genomics, based in Uppsala, Sweden, which was involved in next-generation sequencing technology development.[23]
2012[edit]
On May 17, 2012, Agilent agreed to buy Dako, a Danish cancer diagnostics company, for US$2,200,000,000, to expand its presence in the life sciences industry.[24]
2013[edit]
On Sept. 19, 2013, Agilent announced its decision to separate into two publicly traded companies: Agilent life sciences, diagnostics, applied markets company, and an electronic measurement company.[25] The life sciences company will retain the Agilent name and the electronic measurement company will be called Keysight Technologies.[26]
2014[edit]
On Oct. 14 the company announced that it is exiting its Nuclear Magnetic Resonance business.[27]
On Nov. 1 the formal separation of Agilent and Keysight Technologies was completed.[8] Agilent announced it has completed the spin-off of its electronic measurement business, Keysight Technologies. Keysight begins trading on the New York Stock Exchange today under the symbol KEYS. The separation was implemented through a spinoff of Keysight’s common stock and is intended to be tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. On Nov. 1, 2014, in a special dividend distribution of all outstanding shares of Keysight’s common stock, Agilent shareholders received one share of Keysight common stock for every two shares of Agilent common stock held as of close of business Oct. 22, 2014.
2015[edit]
Agilent celebrates its 50th anniversary in the analytical instruments market. Hewlett-Packard Co., Agilent’s predecessor, acquired F&M Scientific Corp., maker of gas chromatographs, on Aug. 8, 1965. In September, the company announced it would acquire Seahorse Bioscience for $235 million.[28]
Corporate governance[edit]
Agilent's inaugural president and chief executive officer was Ned Barnholt,[15] and he retained this post at least through 2006.[19] Barnholt had originally joined Hewlett-Packard in 1966.[29]
In September 2014, William (Bill) Sullivan announced plans to retire as Agilent's CEO.[30] Mike McMullen, then president of the company's Chemical Analysis Group, was to succeed Sullivan as CEO.[30] As part of the succession plan announcement, McMullen was promoted to the roles of president and chief operating officer (COO).[30]
In 2015, McMullen was elected by Agilent's board of directors to the post of CEO, becoming Agilent's third CEO.[30][31]
Ownership[edit]
As of 2017 Agilent Technologies are mainly held by institutional investors (T. Rowe Price, BlackRock, Fidelity Investments, The Vanguard Group, State Street Corporation, and others[32])

Agilent Technologies is an American public research, development and manufacturing company established in 1999 as a spin-off from Hewlett-Packard. The resulting IPO of Agilent stock was the largest in the history of Silicon Valley at the time.[7][8]
The company provides analytical instruments, software, services and consumables for the entire laboratory workflow.[9] Agilent focuses its products and services on six markets: food, environmental and forensics, pharmaceutical, diagnostics, chemical and energy, and research. From 1999 to 2014 the company also produced test and measurement equipment, this division was spun out to form Keysight.

Agilent Technologies was created in 1999 by the spin-off of Hewlett-Packard's (HP's) "Medical Products and Instrument Group",[13] including instrumentation and chemical analysis, electronic component and medical equipment product lines.[14][note 1] The split was predicated on the difficulty of growing HP's revenue stream and on the competitive vigor of smaller, more agile competitors.[15] The company's launch slogan was "Innovating the HP Way", which capitalized on the strong HP corporate culture.[15] The starburst logo was selected to reflect "a burst of insight" (or "spark of insight")[16] and the name "Agilent" aimed to invoke the notion of agility as a trait of the new firm.[15] The Agilent spin-off was accompanied by an initial public offering which raised US$2,100,000,000, setting a record at the time.[7]
2000–2008[edit]
In the early 2000s, "economic uncertainty" depressed demand for Agilent's products,[17] including slow sales of health care products to hospitals in the United States, which accounted for 60% of the company's revenue at the time.[13] The downturn also struck sales in the communications and semiconductor markets, where orders amounting to US$500,000,000 were canceled by buyers.[18] These poor economic conditions prompted large reductions in force; from a headcount in 1999 of 35,000, which had risen to 48,000 by May 2001,[18] it had by early 2003 cut 18,500 positions.[17] In 2001, in midst of this downsizing, Agilent sold its health care and medical products organization to Philips Medical Systems,[19] and was noted as having a valuation of about US$11,000,000,000.[20] HP Medical Products had been the second oldest part of Hewlett-Packard, acquired in the 1950s.[citation needed]
In August 2005, Agilent announced the sale of its semiconductor business, which produced chips for a wide range of consumer and industrial uses, to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Silver Lake Partners for US$2,660,000,000.[7] This move was part of a broad effort to concentrate "on the test-and-measurement business at its historic core," and would entail termination of about 1,300 of the company's 28,000 employees.[7] The group operated as a private company, Avago Technologies, until August 2009, when it was brought public in an IPO. After purchasing Broadcom Corporation in 2016, Avago changed its name to Broadcom Limited.
Also in August 2005, Agilent sold its 47% stake in the light-emitting diode manufacturer Lumileds to Philips for US$1,000,000,000.[7] Lumileds originally started as Hewlett-Packard's optoelectronics division.
Also in August 2005, Agilent announced a plan to divest its semiconductor test solutions business, composed of both the system-on-chip and memory test market areas.[7] Agilent listed the new company as Verigy, mid-2006 on NASDAQ.
2009[edit]
In 2009, Agilent announced the closure of a subsection of its Test & Measurement division. The product lines affected included the automated optical inspection, solder paste inspection, and automated X-ray products [5DX]. In 2004 Agilent reported that it had captured 19% of the US$244,000,000 (excluding Japan) global imaging inspection market.[21] On July 27, 2009, Agilent announced they would buy Varian, Inc., for US$1,500,000,000. In November 2009, Agilent sold the N2X product line to IXIA. In February 2010 Agilent announced the selling of its Network Solutions Division to JDSU for US$162,000,000.
2011[edit]
In 2011, the company along with the University of California, Davis, announced that it would be establishing the "Davis Millimeter Wave Research Center".[22]
Agilent announced it would increase its life sciences engagement through the acquisition of Halo Genomics, based in Uppsala, Sweden, which was involved in next-generation sequencing technology development.[23]
2012[edit]
On May 17, 2012, Agilent agreed to buy Dako, a Danish cancer diagnostics company, for US$2,200,000,000, to expand its presence in the life sciences industry.[24]
2013[edit]
On Sept. 19, 2013, Agilent announced its decision to separate into two publicly traded companies: Agilent life sciences, diagnostics, applied markets company, and an electronic measurement company.[25] The life sciences company will retain the Agilent name and the electronic measurement company will be called Keysight Technologies.[26]
2014[edit]
On Oct. 14 the company announced that it is exiting its Nuclear Magnetic Resonance business.[27]
On Nov. 1 the formal separation of Agilent and Keysight Technologies was completed.[8] Agilent announced it has completed the spin-off of its electronic measurement business, Keysight Technologies. Keysight begins trading on the New York Stock Exchange today under the symbol KEYS. The separation was implemented through a spinoff of Keysight’s common stock and is intended to be tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. On Nov. 1, 2014, in a special dividend distribution of all outstanding shares of Keysight’s common stock, Agilent shareholders received one share of Keysight common stock for every two shares of Agilent common stock held as of close of business Oct. 22, 2014.
2015[edit]
Agilent celebrates its 50th anniversary in the analytical instruments market. Hewlett-Packard Co., Agilent’s predecessor, acquired F&M Scientific Corp., maker of gas chromatographs, on Aug. 8, 1965. In September, the company announced it would acquire Seahorse Bioscience for $235 million.[28]
Corporate governance[edit]
Agilent's inaugural president and chief executive officer was Ned Barnholt,[15] and he retained this post at least through 2006.[19] Barnholt had originally joined Hewlett-Packard in 1966.[29]
In September 2014, William (Bill) Sullivan announced plans to retire as Agilent's CEO.[30] Mike McMullen, then president of the company's Chemical Analysis Group, was to succeed Sullivan as CEO.[30] As part of the succession plan announcement, McMullen was promoted to the roles of president and chief operating officer (COO).[30]
In 2015, McMullen was elected by Agilent's board of directors to the post of CEO, becoming Agilent's third CEO.[30][31]
Ownership[edit]
As of 2017 Agilent Technologies are mainly held by institutional investors (T. Rowe Price, BlackRock, Fidelity Investments, The Vanguard Group, State Street Corporation, and others[32])

Agilent Technologies is an American public research, development and manufacturing company established in 1999 as a spin-off from Hewlett-Packard. The resulting IPO of Agilent stock was the largest in the history of Silicon Valley at the time.[7][8]
The company provides analytical instruments, software, services and consumables for the entire laboratory workflow.[9] Agilent focuses its products and services on six markets: food, environmental and forensics, pharmaceutical, diagnostics, chemical and energy, and research. From 1999 to 2014 the company also produced test and measurement equipment, this division was spun out to form Keysight.

Agilent Technologies was created in 1999 by the spin-off of Hewlett-Packard's (HP's) "Medical Products and Instrument Group",[13] including instrumentation and chemical analysis, electronic component and medical equipment product lines.[14][note 1] The split was predicated on the difficulty of growing HP's revenue stream and on the competitive vigor of smaller, more agile competitors.[15] The company's launch slogan was "Innovating the HP Way", which capitalized on the strong HP corporate culture.[15] The starburst logo was selected to reflect "a burst of insight" (or "spark of insight")[16] and the name "Agilent" aimed to invoke the notion of agility as a trait of the new firm.[15] The Agilent spin-off was accompanied by an initial public offering which raised US$2,100,000,000, setting a record at the time.[7]
2000–2008[edit]
In the early 2000s, "economic uncertainty" depressed demand for Agilent's products,[17] including slow sales of health care products to hospitals in the United States, which accounted for 60% of the company's revenue at the time.[13] The downturn also struck sales in the communications and semiconductor markets, where orders amounting to US$500,000,000 were canceled by buyers.[18] These poor economic conditions prompted large reductions in force; from a headcount in 1999 of 35,000, which had risen to 48,000 by May 2001,[18] it had by early 2003 cut 18,500 positions.[17] In 2001, in midst of this downsizing, Agilent sold its health care and medical products organization to Philips Medical Systems,[19] and was noted as having a valuation of about US$11,000,000,000.[20] HP Medical Products had been the second oldest part of Hewlett-Packard, acquired in the 1950s.[citation needed]
In August 2005, Agilent announced the sale of its semiconductor business, which produced chips for a wide range of consumer and industrial uses, to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Silver Lake Partners for US$2,660,000,000.[7] This move was part of a broad effort to concentrate "on the test-and-measurement business at its historic core," and would entail termination of about 1,300 of the company's 28,000 employees.[7] The group operated as a private company, Avago Technologies, until August 2009, when it was brought public in an IPO. After purchasing Broadcom Corporation in 2016, Avago changed its name to Broadcom Limited.
Also in August 2005, Agilent sold its 47% stake in the light-emitting diode manufacturer Lumileds to Philips for US$1,000,000,000.[7] Lumileds originally started as Hewlett-Packard's optoelectronics division.
Also in August 2005, Agilent announced a plan to divest its semiconductor test solutions business, composed of both the system-on-chip and memory test market areas.[7] Agilent listed the new company as Verigy, mid-2006 on NASDAQ.
2009[edit]
In 2009, Agilent announced the closure of a subsection of its Test & Measurement division. The product lines affected included the automated optical inspection, solder paste inspection, and automated X-ray products [5DX]. In 2004 Agilent reported that it had captured 19% of the US$244,000,000 (excluding Japan) global imaging inspection market.[21] On July 27, 2009, Agilent announced they would buy Varian, Inc., for US$1,500,000,000. In November 2009, Agilent sold the N2X product line to IXIA. In February 2010 Agilent announced the selling of its Network Solutions Division to JDSU for US$162,000,000.
2011[edit]
In 2011, the company along with the University of California, Davis, announced that it would be establishing the "Davis Millimeter Wave Research Center".[22]
Agilent announced it would increase its life sciences engagement through the acquisition of Halo Genomics, based in Uppsala, Sweden, which was involved in next-generation sequencing technology development.[23]
2012[edit]
On May 17, 2012, Agilent agreed to buy Dako, a Danish cancer diagnostics company, for US$2,200,000,000, to expand its presence in the life sciences industry.[24]
2013[edit]
On Sept. 19, 2013, Agilent announced its decision to separate into two publicly traded companies: Agilent life sciences, diagnostics, applied markets company, and an electronic measurement company.[25] The life sciences company will retain the Agilent name and the electronic measurement company will be called Keysight Technologies.[26]
2014[edit]
On Oct. 14 the company announced that it is exiting its Nuclear Magnetic Resonance business.[27]
On Nov. 1 the formal separation of Agilent and Keysight Technologies was completed.[8] Agilent announced it has completed the spin-off of its electronic measurement business, Keysight Technologies. Keysight begins trading on the New York Stock Exchange today under the symbol KEYS. The separation was implemented through a spinoff of Keysight’s common stock and is intended to be tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. On Nov. 1, 2014, in a special dividend distribution of all outstanding shares of Keysight’s common stock, Agilent shareholders received one share of Keysight common stock for every two shares of Agilent common stock held as of close of business Oct. 22, 2014.
2015[edit]
Agilent celebrates its 50th anniversary in the analytical instruments market. Hewlett-Packard Co., Agilent’s predecessor, acquired F&M Scientific Corp., maker of gas chromatographs, on Aug. 8, 1965. In September, the company announced it would acquire Seahorse Bioscience for $235 million.[28]
Corporate governance[edit]
Agilent's inaugural president and chief executive officer was Ned Barnholt,[15] and he retained this post at least through 2006.[19] Barnholt had originally joined Hewlett-Packard in 1966.[29]
In September 2014, William (Bill) Sullivan announced plans to retire as Agilent's CEO.[30] Mike McMullen, then president of the company's Chemical Analysis Group, was to succeed Sullivan as CEO.[30] As part of the succession plan announcement, McMullen was promoted to the roles of president and chief operating officer (COO).[30]
In 2015, McMullen was elected by Agilent's board of directors to the post of CEO, becoming Agilent's third CEO.[30][31]
Ownership[edit]
As of 2017 Agilent Technologies are mainly held by institutional investors (T. Rowe Price, BlackRock, Fidelity Investments, The Vanguard Group, State Street Corporation, and others[32])

Agilent Technologies is an American public research, development and manufacturing company established in 1999 as a spin-off from Hewlett-Packard. The resulting IPO of Agilent stock was the largest in the history of Silicon Valley at the time.[7][8]
The company provides analytical instruments, software, services and consumables for the entire laboratory workflow.[9] Agilent focuses its products and services on six markets: food, environmental and forensics, pharmaceutical, diagnostics, chemical and energy, and research. From 1999 to 2014 the company also produced test and measurement equipment, this division was spun out to form Keysight.

Agilent Technologies was created in 1999 by the spin-off of Hewlett-Packard's (HP's) "Medical Products and Instrument Group",[13] including instrumentation and chemical analysis, electronic component and medical equipment product lines.[14][note 1] The split was predicated on the difficulty of growing HP's revenue stream and on the competitive vigor of smaller, more agile competitors.[15] The company's launch slogan was "Innovating the HP Way", which capitalized on the strong HP corporate culture.[15] The starburst logo was selected to reflect "a burst of insight" (or "spark of insight")[16] and the name "Agilent" aimed to invoke the notion of agility as a trait of the new firm.[15] The Agilent spin-off was accompanied by an initial public offering which raised US$2,100,000,000, setting a record at the time.[7]
2000–2008[edit]
In the early 2000s, "economic uncertainty" depressed demand for Agilent's products,[17] including slow sales of health care products to hospitals in the United States, which accounted for 60% of the company's revenue at the time.[13] The downturn also struck sales in the communications and semiconductor markets, where orders amounting to US$500,000,000 were canceled by buyers.[18] These poor economic conditions prompted large reductions in force; from a headcount in 1999 of 35,000, which had risen to 48,000 by May 2001,[18] it had by early 2003 cut 18,500 positions.[17] In 2001, in midst of this downsizing, Agilent sold its health care and medical products organization to Philips Medical Systems,[19] and was noted as having a valuation of about US$11,000,000,000.[20] HP Medical Products had been the second oldest part of Hewlett-Packard, acquired in the 1950s.[citation needed]
In August 2005, Agilent announced the sale of its semiconductor business, which produced chips for a wide range of consumer and industrial uses, to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Silver Lake Partners for US$2,660,000,000.[7] This move was part of a broad effort to concentrate "on the test-and-measurement business at its historic core," and would entail termination of about 1,300 of the company's 28,000 employees.[7] The group operated as a private company, Avago Technologies, until August 2009, when it was brought public in an IPO. After purchasing Broadcom Corporation in 2016, Avago changed its name to Broadcom Limited.
Also in August 2005, Agilent sold its 47% stake in the light-emitting diode manufacturer Lumileds to Philips for US$1,000,000,000.[7] Lumileds originally started as Hewlett-Packard's optoelectronics division.
Also in August 2005, Agilent announced a plan to divest its semiconductor test solutions business, composed of both the system-on-chip and memory test market areas.[7] Agilent listed the new company as Verigy, mid-2006 on NASDAQ.
2009[edit]
In 2009, Agilent announced the closure of a subsection of its Test & Measurement division. The product lines affected included the automated optical inspection, solder paste inspection, and automated X-ray products [5DX]. In 2004 Agilent reported that it had captured 19% of the US$244,000,000 (excluding Japan) global imaging inspection market.[21] On July 27, 2009, Agilent announced they would buy Varian, Inc., for US$1,500,000,000. In November 2009, Agilent sold the N2X product line to IXIA. In February 2010 Agilent announced the selling of its Network Solutions Division to JDSU for US$162,000,000.
2011[edit]
In 2011, the company along with the University of California, Davis, announced that it would be establishing the "Davis Millimeter Wave Research Center".[22]
Agilent announced it would increase its life sciences engagement through the acquisition of Halo Genomics, based in Uppsala, Sweden, which was involved in next-generation sequencing technology development.[23]
2012[edit]
On May 17, 2012, Agilent agreed to buy Dako, a Danish cancer diagnostics company, for US$2,200,000,000, to expand its presence in the life sciences industry.[24]
2013[edit]
On Sept. 19, 2013, Agilent announced its decision to separate into two publicly traded companies: Agilent life sciences, diagnostics, applied markets company, and an electronic measurement company.[25] The life sciences company will retain the Agilent name and the electronic measurement company will be called Keysight Technologies.[26]
2014[edit]
On Oct. 14 the company announced that it is exiting its Nuclear Magnetic Resonance business.[27]
On Nov. 1 the formal separation of Agilent and Keysight Technologies was completed.[8] Agilent announced it has completed the spin-off of its electronic measurement business, Keysight Technologies. Keysight begins trading on the New York Stock Exchange today under the symbol KEYS. The separation was implemented through a spinoff of Keysight’s common stock and is intended to be tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. On Nov. 1, 2014, in a special dividend distribution of all outstanding shares of Keysight’s common stock, Agilent shareholders received one share of Keysight common stock for every two shares of Agilent common stock held as of close of business Oct. 22, 2014.
2015[edit]
Agilent celebrates its 50th anniversary in the analytical instruments market. Hewlett-Packard Co., Agilent’s predecessor, acquired F&M Scientific Corp., maker of gas chromatographs, on Aug. 8, 1965. In September, the company announced it would acquire Seahorse Bioscience for $235 million.[28]
Corporate governance[edit]
Agilent's inaugural president and chief executive officer was Ned Barnholt,[15] and he retained this post at least through 2006.[19] Barnholt had originally joined Hewlett-Packard in 1966.[29]
In September 2014, William (Bill) Sullivan announced plans to retire as Agilent's CEO.[30] Mike McMullen, then president of the company's Chemical Analysis Group, was to succeed Sullivan as CEO.[30] As part of the succession plan announcement, McMullen was promoted to the roles of president and chief operating officer (COO).[30]
In 2015, McMullen was elected by Agilent's board of directors to the post of CEO, becoming Agilent's third CEO.[30][31]
Ownership[edit]
As of 2017 Agilent Technologies are mainly held by institutional investors (T. Rowe Price, BlackRock, Fidelity Investments, The Vanguard Group, State Street Corporation, and others[32])

Agilent Technologies Inc.: Agilent Acquires Powerful Next Generation Sequencing IP Portfolio


Tickers:
                    A 




      
        Molecular and Sample Barcoding IP Portfolio Bolsters Agilent's Leadership Position in NGS Target Enrichment Solutions
      
      
        IP Portfolio Aimed at Improving Accuracy and Sensitivity of NGS Detection
      
      
Top Company Interviews

SANTA CLARA, Calif., July 24, 2017
      
      
        Agilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE: A) ('Agilent') today announced that it has acquired the molecular and sample barcoding patent portfolios of Population Genetics Technologies ('Population Genetics'). Founded in 2005, Population Genetics was formed to commercialize the intellectual property portfolio of Nobel Laureate Sydney Brenner focused on high sensitivity and high specificity Next Generation Sequencing ('NGS') detection. In 2015, Population Genetics became an IP holding entity with over 30 patents. Financial terms of the purchase were not disclosed.
      
      
        'Our customers are increasingly requiring fully integrated next-generation sequencing workflows with the highest performance,' said Herman Verrelst, vice president and general manager of Agilent's Genomics Division. 'With the addition of this IP portfolio, we can now deliver complete target enrichment solutions to our customers that they can trust, from QC to target enrichment, to analysis and interpretation that meets this demand.'
      
      
        The acquired Population Genetics IP includes patents related to both molecular and sample barcoding that improve accuracy and sensitivity of NGS detection. The combination of these patents provides for customizable target enrichment solutions that enable customers to detect ultra-low mutation frequencies in very small DNA quantities. These features are ideal for detection of rare-variants in cancer and reproductive genetics, including liquid biopsies.
      
      
        'We are excited to bring these technologies to our customers,' said Jacob Thaysen, president of Agilent's Diagnostics and Genomics Group. 'We outlined a strategy to grow in the diagnostics space, and to build a complete routine clinical NGS workflow. This acquisition is another example of executing on that strategy, and our commitment to helping our customers improve the quality of life.'
      
      
        Agilent's newest next generation sequencing library prep solution, Agilent SureSelect, incorporates molecular barcodes from this IP portfolio. The incorporation of these molecular barcodes improves the overall precision and produces higher complexity libraries than competing products, on a broad range of tissue types and low- and high-quality FFPE samples.   Information about SureSelect is available on Agilent's website.
      
      
        Agilent and Population Genetics had a previous licensing arrangement providing Agilent with licensing rights to certain Population Genetics molecular barcode patented technology, which allows for the sensitive and confident detection of minority genetic variants on next generation sequencing platforms to levels below 0.1%.

        This news release contains forward-looking statements as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and is subject to the safe harbors created therein. The forward-looking statements contained herein include, but are not limited to, information regarding Agilent's future revenue, earnings and profitability; planned new products; market trends; the future demand for the company's products and services; customer expectations; and revenue and non-GAAP earnings guidance for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2017. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause Agilent's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, unforeseen changes in the strength of our customers' businesses; unforeseen changes in the demand for current and new products, technologies and services; unforeseen changes in the currency markets; customer purchasing decisions and timing, and the risk that we are not able to realize the savings expected from integration and restructuring activities.
      
      
        In addition, other risks that Agilent faces in running its operations include the ability to execute successfully through business cycles; the ability to meet and achieve the benefits of its cost-reduction goals and otherwise successfully adapt its cost structures to continuing changes in business conditions; ongoing competitive, pricing and gross-margin pressures; the risk that our cost-cutting initiatives will impair our ability to develop products and remain competitive and to operate effectively; the impact of geopolitical uncertainties and global economic conditions on our operations, our markets and our ability to conduct business; the ability to improve asset performance to adapt to changes in demand; the ability of our supply chain to adapt to changes in demand; the ability to successfully introduce new products at the right time, price and mix; the ability of Agilent to successfully integrate recent acquisitions; the ability of Agilent to successfully comply with certain complex regulations; and other risks detailed in Agilent's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended April 30, 2017. Forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of Agilent's management and on currently available information. Agilent undertakes no responsibility to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement.

Agilent (NYSE:A)Historical Stock Chart
1 Month : From Jun 2017 to Jul 2017



New Solution Streamlines Workflow and Eliminates Sequencing Errors

      Agilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE: A) today introduced its newest 
      next-generation sequencing (NGS) library prep solution — Agilent 
      SureSelectXT HS — a complete target enrichment 
      research solution that provides total workflow management for 
      laboratories, from QC to target enrichment, to analysis and 
      interpretation.
    

      SureSelectXT HS is a streamlined, high-sensitivity 
      (HS) solution for research, optimized for labs with a requirement to 
      sequence DNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples, which 
      may have degraded over time. By incorporating molecular barcodes, 
      SureSelectXT HS improves overall precision and produces 
      higher complexity libraries than competing products, on a broad range of 
      tissue types and low- and high-quality FFPE samples.
    

      “This customizable target enrichment technology with integrated 
      molecular barcode error correction enables us to detect ultra-low 
      mutation frequencies in very small DNA quantities,” said Dr. Marco 
      Gerlinger of the Institute of Cancer Research and the Royale Marsden 
      Hospital in London. “These features make it ideal for the detection and 
      tracking of clonal and subclonal variants in liquid biopsies.”
    

      SureSelectXT HS libraries, with higher percentage reads in 
      targeted regions, require as little as 10 ng of starting DNA, and use 
      molecular barcodes to assist error correction. Additionally, faster and 
      more efficient processing with master-mixed reagents that require less 
      hands-on time, coupled with a 90-minute hybridization — the most rapid 
      hybridization on the market — enables labs to now move from sample to 
      sequencer in a single day.
    

      “SureSelectXT HS provides robust library preparation for 
      low-input, degraded FFPE samples, as well as significantly reduced 
      turnaround time,” said Jeff Heimburger, head of genomics marketing at 
      Agilent. “These advances highlight Agilent’s continued commitment to 
      alleviating customer pain and improving lab efficiency through 
      innovation.”

Agilent Technologies is an American public research, development and manufacturing company established in 1999 as a spin-off from Hewlett-Packard. The resulting IPO of Agilent stock was the largest in the history of Silicon Valley at the time.[7][8]
The company provides analytical instruments, software, services and consumables for the entire laboratory workflow.[9] Agilent focuses its products and services on six markets: food, environmental and forensics, pharmaceutical, diagnostics, chemical and energy, and research. From 1999 to 2014 the company also produced test and measurement equipment, this division was spun out to form Keysight.

Agilent Technologies was created in 1999 by the spin-off of Hewlett-Packard's (HP's) "Medical Products and Instrument Group",[13] including instrumentation and chemical analysis, electronic component and medical equipment product lines.[14][note 1] The split was predicated on the difficulty of growing HP's revenue stream and on the competitive vigor of smaller, more agile competitors.[15] The company's launch slogan was "Innovating the HP Way", which capitalized on the strong HP corporate culture.[15] The starburst logo was selected to reflect "a burst of insight" (or "spark of insight")[16] and the name "Agilent" aimed to invoke the notion of agility as a trait of the new firm.[15] The Agilent spin-off was accompanied by an initial public offering which raised US$2,100,000,000, setting a record at the time.[7]
2000–2008[edit]
In the early 2000s, "economic uncertainty" depressed demand for Agilent's products,[17] including slow sales of health care products to hospitals in the United States, which accounted for 60% of the company's revenue at the time.[13] The downturn also struck sales in the communications and semiconductor markets, where orders amounting to US$500,000,000 were canceled by buyers.[18] These poor economic conditions prompted large reductions in force; from a headcount in 1999 of 35,000, which had risen to 48,000 by May 2001,[18] it had by early 2003 cut 18,500 positions.[17] In 2001, in midst of this downsizing, Agilent sold its health care and medical products organization to Philips Medical Systems,[19] and was noted as having a valuation of about US$11,000,000,000.[20] HP Medical Products had been the second oldest part of Hewlett-Packard, acquired in the 1950s.[citation needed]
In August 2005, Agilent announced the sale of its semiconductor business, which produced chips for a wide range of consumer and industrial uses, to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Silver Lake Partners for US$2,660,000,000.[7] This move was part of a broad effort to concentrate "on the test-and-measurement business at its historic core," and would entail termination of about 1,300 of the company's 28,000 employees.[7] The group operated as a private company, Avago Technologies, until August 2009, when it was brought public in an IPO. After purchasing Broadcom Corporation in 2016, Avago changed its name to Broadcom Limited.
Also in August 2005, Agilent sold its 47% stake in the light-emitting diode manufacturer Lumileds to Philips for US$1,000,000,000.[7] Lumileds originally started as Hewlett-Packard's optoelectronics division.
Also in August 2005, Agilent announced a plan to divest its semiconductor test solutions business, composed of both the system-on-chip and memory test market areas.[7] Agilent listed the new company as Verigy, mid-2006 on NASDAQ.
2009[edit]
In 2009, Agilent announced the closure of a subsection of its Test & Measurement division. The product lines affected included the automated optical inspection, solder paste inspection, and automated X-ray products [5DX]. In 2004 Agilent reported that it had captured 19% of the US$244,000,000 (excluding Japan) global imaging inspection market.[21] On July 27, 2009, Agilent announced they would buy Varian, Inc., for US$1,500,000,000. In November 2009, Agilent sold the N2X product line to IXIA. In February 2010 Agilent announced the selling of its Network Solutions Division to JDSU for US$162,000,000.
2011[edit]
In 2011, the company along with the University of California, Davis, announced that it would be establishing the "Davis Millimeter Wave Research Center".[22]
Agilent announced it would increase its life sciences engagement through the acquisition of Halo Genomics, based in Uppsala, Sweden, which was involved in next-generation sequencing technology development.[23]
2012[edit]
On May 17, 2012, Agilent agreed to buy Dako, a Danish cancer diagnostics company, for US$2,200,000,000, to expand its presence in the life sciences industry.[24]
2013[edit]
On Sept. 19, 2013, Agilent announced its decision to separate into two publicly traded companies: Agilent life sciences, diagnostics, applied markets company, and an electronic measurement company.[25] The life sciences company will retain the Agilent name and the electronic measurement company will be called Keysight Technologies.[26]
2014[edit]
On Oct. 14 the company announced that it is exiting its Nuclear Magnetic Resonance business.[27]
On Nov. 1 the formal separation of Agilent and Keysight Technologies was completed.[8] Agilent announced it has completed the spin-off of its electronic measurement business, Keysight Technologies. Keysight begins trading on the New York Stock Exchange today under the symbol KEYS. The separation was implemented through a spinoff of Keysight’s common stock and is intended to be tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. On Nov. 1, 2014, in a special dividend distribution of all outstanding shares of Keysight’s common stock, Agilent shareholders received one share of Keysight common stock for every two shares of Agilent common stock held as of close of business Oct. 22, 2014.
2015[edit]
Agilent celebrates its 50th anniversary in the analytical instruments market. Hewlett-Packard Co., Agilent’s predecessor, acquired F&M Scientific Corp., maker of gas chromatographs, on Aug. 8, 1965. In September, the company announced it would acquire Seahorse Bioscience for $235 million.[28]
Corporate governance[edit]
Agilent's inaugural president and chief executive officer was Ned Barnholt,[15] and he retained this post at least through 2006.[19] Barnholt had originally joined Hewlett-Packard in 1966.[29]
In September 2014, William (Bill) Sullivan announced plans to retire as Agilent's CEO.[30] Mike McMullen, then president of the company's Chemical Analysis Group, was to succeed Sullivan as CEO.[30] As part of the succession plan announcement, McMullen was promoted to the roles of president and chief operating officer (COO).[30]
In 2015, McMullen was elected by Agilent's board of directors to the post of CEO, becoming Agilent's third CEO.[30][31]
Ownership[edit]
As of 2017 Agilent Technologies are mainly held by institutional investors (T. Rowe Price, BlackRock, Fidelity Investments, The Vanguard Group, State Street Corporation, and others[32])

Agilent Technologies is an American public research, development and manufacturing company established in 1999 as a spin-off from Hewlett-Packard. The resulting IPO of Agilent stock was the largest in the history of Silicon Valley at the time.[7][8]
The company provides analytical instruments, software, services and consumables for the entire laboratory workflow.[9] Agilent focuses its products and services on six markets: food, environmental and forensics, pharmaceutical, diagnostics, chemical and energy, and research. From 1999 to 2014 the company also produced test and measurement equipment, this division was spun out to form Keysight.

Agilent Technologies was created in 1999 by the spin-off of Hewlett-Packard's (HP's) "Medical Products and Instrument Group",[13] including instrumentation and chemical analysis, electronic component and medical equipment product lines.[14][note 1] The split was predicated on the difficulty of growing HP's revenue stream and on the competitive vigor of smaller, more agile competitors.[15] The company's launch slogan was "Innovating the HP Way", which capitalized on the strong HP corporate culture.[15] The starburst logo was selected to reflect "a burst of insight" (or "spark of insight")[16] and the name "Agilent" aimed to invoke the notion of agility as a trait of the new firm.[15] The Agilent spin-off was accompanied by an initial public offering which raised US$2,100,000,000, setting a record at the time.[7]
2000–2008[edit]
In the early 2000s, "economic uncertainty" depressed demand for Agilent's products,[17] including slow sales of health care products to hospitals in the United States, which accounted for 60% of the company's revenue at the time.[13] The downturn also struck sales in the communications and semiconductor markets, where orders amounting to US$500,000,000 were canceled by buyers.[18] These poor economic conditions prompted large reductions in force; from a headcount in 1999 of 35,000, which had risen to 48,000 by May 2001,[18] it had by early 2003 cut 18,500 positions.[17] In 2001, in midst of this downsizing, Agilent sold its health care and medical products organization to Philips Medical Systems,[19] and was noted as having a valuation of about US$11,000,000,000.[20] HP Medical Products had been the second oldest part of Hewlett-Packard, acquired in the 1950s.[citation needed]
In August 2005, Agilent announced the sale of its semiconductor business, which produced chips for a wide range of consumer and industrial uses, to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Silver Lake Partners for US$2,660,000,000.[7] This move was part of a broad effort to concentrate "on the test-and-measurement business at its historic core," and would entail termination of about 1,300 of the company's 28,000 employees.[7] The group operated as a private company, Avago Technologies, until August 2009, when it was brought public in an IPO. After purchasing Broadcom Corporation in 2016, Avago changed its name to Broadcom Limited.
Also in August 2005, Agilent sold its 47% stake in the light-emitting diode manufacturer Lumileds to Philips for US$1,000,000,000.[7] Lumileds originally started as Hewlett-Packard's optoelectronics division.
Also in August 2005, Agilent announced a plan to divest its semiconductor test solutions business, composed of both the system-on-chip and memory test market areas.[7] Agilent listed the new company as Verigy, mid-2006 on NASDAQ.
2009[edit]
In 2009, Agilent announced the closure of a subsection of its Test & Measurement division. The product lines affected included the automated optical inspection, solder paste inspection, and automated X-ray products [5DX]. In 2004 Agilent reported that it had captured 19% of the US$244,000,000 (excluding Japan) global imaging inspection market.[21] On July 27, 2009, Agilent announced they would buy Varian, Inc., for US$1,500,000,000. In November 2009, Agilent sold the N2X product line to IXIA. In February 2010 Agilent announced the selling of its Network Solutions Division to JDSU for US$162,000,000.
2011[edit]
In 2011, the company along with the University of California, Davis, announced that it would be establishing the "Davis Millimeter Wave Research Center".[22]
Agilent announced it would increase its life sciences engagement through the acquisition of Halo Genomics, based in Uppsala, Sweden, which was involved in next-generation sequencing technology development.[23]
2012[edit]
On May 17, 2012, Agilent agreed to buy Dako, a Danish cancer diagnostics company, for US$2,200,000,000, to expand its presence in the life sciences industry.[24]
2013[edit]
On Sept. 19, 2013, Agilent announced its decision to separate into two publicly traded companies: Agilent life sciences, diagnostics, applied markets company, and an electronic measurement company.[25] The life sciences company will retain the Agilent name and the electronic measurement company will be called Keysight Technologies.[26]
2014[edit]
On Oct. 14 the company announced that it is exiting its Nuclear Magnetic Resonance business.[27]
On Nov. 1 the formal separation of Agilent and Keysight Technologies was completed.[8] Agilent announced it has completed the spin-off of its electronic measurement business, Keysight Technologies. Keysight begins trading on the New York Stock Exchange today under the symbol KEYS. The separation was implemented through a spinoff of Keysight’s common stock and is intended to be tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. On Nov. 1, 2014, in a special dividend distribution of all outstanding shares of Keysight’s common stock, Agilent shareholders received one share of Keysight common stock for every two shares of Agilent common stock held as of close of business Oct. 22, 2014.
2015[edit]
Agilent celebrates its 50th anniversary in the analytical instruments market. Hewlett-Packard Co., Agilent’s predecessor, acquired F&M Scientific Corp., maker of gas chromatographs, on Aug. 8, 1965. In September, the company announced it would acquire Seahorse Bioscience for $235 million.[28]
Corporate governance[edit]
Agilent's inaugural president and chief executive officer was Ned Barnholt,[15] and he retained this post at least through 2006.[19] Barnholt had originally joined Hewlett-Packard in 1966.[29]
In September 2014, William (Bill) Sullivan announced plans to retire as Agilent's CEO.[30] Mike McMullen, then president of the company's Chemical Analysis Group, was to succeed Sullivan as CEO.[30] As part of the succession plan announcement, McMullen was promoted to the roles of president and chief operating officer (COO).[30]
In 2015, McMullen was elected by Agilent's board of directors to the post of CEO, becoming Agilent's third CEO.[30][31]
Ownership[edit]
As of 2017 Agilent Technologies are mainly held by institutional investors (T. Rowe Price, BlackRock, Fidelity Investments, The Vanguard Group, State Street Corporation, and others[32])

Agilent Technologies is an American public research, development and manufacturing company established in 1999 as a spin-off from Hewlett-Packard. The resulting IPO of Agilent stock was the largest in the history of Silicon Valley at the time.[7][8]
The company provides analytical instruments, software, services and consumables for the entire laboratory workflow.[9] Agilent focuses its products and services on six markets: food, environmental and forensics, pharmaceutical, diagnostics, chemical and energy, and research. From 1999 to 2014 the company also produced test and measurement equipment, this division was spun out to form Keysight.

Agilent Technologies was created in 1999 by the spin-off of Hewlett-Packard's (HP's) "Medical Products and Instrument Group",[13] including instrumentation and chemical analysis, electronic component and medical equipment product lines.[14][note 1] The split was predicated on the difficulty of growing HP's revenue stream and on the competitive vigor of smaller, more agile competitors.[15] The company's launch slogan was "Innovating the HP Way", which capitalized on the strong HP corporate culture.[15] The starburst logo was selected to reflect "a burst of insight" (or "spark of insight")[16] and the name "Agilent" aimed to invoke the notion of agility as a trait of the new firm.[15] The Agilent spin-off was accompanied by an initial public offering which raised US$2,100,000,000, setting a record at the time.[7]
2000–2008[edit]
In the early 2000s, "economic uncertainty" depressed demand for Agilent's products,[17] including slow sales of health care products to hospitals in the United States, which accounted for 60% of the company's revenue at the time.[13] The downturn also struck sales in the communications and semiconductor markets, where orders amounting to US$500,000,000 were canceled by buyers.[18] These poor economic conditions prompted large reductions in force; from a headcount in 1999 of 35,000, which had risen to 48,000 by May 2001,[18] it had by early 2003 cut 18,500 positions.[17] In 2001, in midst of this downsizing, Agilent sold its health care and medical products organization to Philips Medical Systems,[19] and was noted as having a valuation of about US$11,000,000,000.[20] HP Medical Products had been the second oldest part of Hewlett-Packard, acquired in the 1950s.[citation needed]
In August 2005, Agilent announced the sale of its semiconductor business, which produced chips for a wide range of consumer and industrial uses, to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Silver Lake Partners for US$2,660,000,000.[7] This move was part of a broad effort to concentrate "on the test-and-measurement business at its historic core," and would entail termination of about 1,300 of the company's 28,000 employees.[7] The group operated as a private company, Avago Technologies, until August 2009, when it was brought public in an IPO. After purchasing Broadcom Corporation in 2016, Avago changed its name to Broadcom Limited.
Also in August 2005, Agilent sold its 47% stake in the light-emitting diode manufacturer Lumileds to Philips for US$1,000,000,000.[7] Lumileds originally started as Hewlett-Packard's optoelectronics division.
Also in August 2005, Agilent announced a plan to divest its semiconductor test solutions business, composed of both the system-on-chip and memory test market areas.[7] Agilent listed the new company as Verigy, mid-2006 on NASDAQ.
2009[edit]
In 2009, Agilent announced the closure of a subsection of its Test & Measurement division. The product lines affected included the automated optical inspection, solder paste inspection, and automated X-ray products [5DX]. In 2004 Agilent reported that it had captured 19% of the US$244,000,000 (excluding Japan) global imaging inspection market.[21] On July 27, 2009, Agilent announced they would buy Varian, Inc., for US$1,500,000,000. In November 2009, Agilent sold the N2X product line to IXIA. In February 2010 Agilent announced the selling of its Network Solutions Division to JDSU for US$162,000,000.
2011[edit]
In 2011, the company along with the University of California, Davis, announced that it would be establishing the "Davis Millimeter Wave Research Center".[22]
Agilent announced it would increase its life sciences engagement through the acquisition of Halo Genomics, based in Uppsala, Sweden, which was involved in next-generation sequencing technology development.[23]
2012[edit]
On May 17, 2012, Agilent agreed to buy Dako, a Danish cancer diagnostics company, for US$2,200,000,000, to expand its presence in the life sciences industry.[24]
2013[edit]
On Sept. 19, 2013, Agilent announced its decision to separate into two publicly traded companies: Agilent life sciences, diagnostics, applied markets company, and an electronic measurement company.[25] The life sciences company will retain the Agilent name and the electronic measurement company will be called Keysight Technologies.[26]
2014[edit]
On Oct. 14 the company announced that it is exiting its Nuclear Magnetic Resonance business.[27]
On Nov. 1 the formal separation of Agilent and Keysight Technologies was completed.[8] Agilent announced it has completed the spin-off of its electronic measurement business, Keysight Technologies. Keysight begins trading on the New York Stock Exchange today under the symbol KEYS. The separation was implemented through a spinoff of Keysight’s common stock and is intended to be tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. On Nov. 1, 2014, in a special dividend distribution of all outstanding shares of Keysight’s common stock, Agilent shareholders received one share of Keysight common stock for every two shares of Agilent common stock held as of close of business Oct. 22, 2014.
2015[edit]
Agilent celebrates its 50th anniversary in the analytical instruments market. Hewlett-Packard Co., Agilent’s predecessor, acquired F&M Scientific Corp., maker of gas chromatographs, on Aug. 8, 1965. In September, the company announced it would acquire Seahorse Bioscience for $235 million.[28]
Corporate governance[edit]
Agilent's inaugural president and chief executive officer was Ned Barnholt,[15] and he retained this post at least through 2006.[19] Barnholt had originally joined Hewlett-Packard in 1966.[29]
In September 2014, William (Bill) Sullivan announced plans to retire as Agilent's CEO.[30] Mike McMullen, then president of the company's Chemical Analysis Group, was to succeed Sullivan as CEO.[30] As part of the succession plan announcement, McMullen was promoted to the roles of president and chief operating officer (COO).[30]
In 2015, McMullen was elected by Agilent's board of directors to the post of CEO, becoming Agilent's third CEO.[30][31]
Ownership[edit]
As of 2017 Agilent Technologies are mainly held by institutional investors (T. Rowe Price, BlackRock, Fidelity Investments, The Vanguard Group, State Street Corporation, and others[32])

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
