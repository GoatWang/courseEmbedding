It is not easy to discern what made Dr Daniel Vasella abandon his career as a doctor in favour of the pharmaceutical industry. Some have suggested that he was driven by personal experience of serious ill health during his childhood, others that it was frustration at the slow pace of career progression in medicine, and still others that he preferred the business and development side of medicine to a patient facing role. Whatever his reasons, since leaving medicine in 1988, Vasella has risen from the humble post of a travelling salesman for Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corporation in New Jersey to the CEO and Chairman of one of the world’s most important pharmaceutical companies – Novartis.
Novartis was formed in 1996 through a merger between Swiss drug companies Sandoz and Ciba-Geigy, overseen by Vasella in his role as CEO of Sandoz. It appears that the name ‘Novartis’ was developed by Vasella himself, bringing together the Latin words “novae” and “artis”, meaning “new skills”; a very apt title, as the way that the company works is very different to others in its field. In 2002, Vasella took the decision to base the business’ R&D firmly in science; while the idea of science being the bedrock of drug development may seem obvious, what this meant in reality was that Vasella would not push through new products to the testing stage unless there was a solid body of evidence that trials would be likely to succeed.
An example of this is when, as recounted by Business Week, he declined to advance an experimental Alzheimer’s drug to testing as too little is known about the disease itself. This policy stems from an acknowledgement that the end beneficiary of the product, and the end purchaser, is the patient, not the company’s shareholders – surely a stance influenced by Vasella’s time spent practicing medicine. It is a decision that has meant that the success of Novartis’ drug trails and thus the number of products reaching the market is much higher than that of its competitors, at 80 percent.
But the company has not been without its troubles. The first major scandal took place in 2006, in India: In 2005, India changed its patent laws, bringing them inline with international law. Novartis was one of the first companies to file a suit under the new law, as one of its most successful drugs, Glivec, used in the treatment of cancer, was being produced in generic form without license, to be sold cheaply to the Indian people. During the trial, campaign organisations such as Oxfam and Medecins Sans Frontieres declared that if Novartis won, then life saving medicines would be put out of reach of the hundreds of thousands of poor living in the country and the wider developing world. As a result of the campaign, demonstrations took place in India and over half a million people worldwide wrote to Vasella personally to voice their protest at the company’s actions. Oxfam declared a moral victory when, after the Indian courts denied Novartis’ motion, the business chose not to appeal. In June 2009, the company suffered additional criticism, refusing to donate flu vaccines free to people in the developing world during the flu pandemic, as competitor GlaxoSmithKline had.
Most recently, a major sexual discrimination case, a class action brought by 5,600 current or former female employees, has caused the firm serious embarrassment in America. This was no ordinary sexual discrimination case: While some familiar allegations remain, such as pregnant staff members being excluded, overlooked for promotion or pay rises, features such a women being coached in how to seduce clients and having their ears licked when on sales visits have made this case all the more unusual. The allegations that have caused the company most damage are those made by Marjorie Salame who told the court that she was sexually assaulted by a long time client. When she reported the incident to her manager, she was threatened with disciplinary action and told to accept responsibility for what had happened. Judgement was reached on May 19, when the court awarded the claimants $250m in punitive damages –two percent of the company’s estimated $9.5m value. This was in addition to the $3.3m already awarded to another 12 women two days previously. When possible compensatory damages are also considered, the total bill for Novartis could top $1bn.
But not all problems have been instigated by Novartis: In 2009, Vasella was personally targeted by militant animals rights activists. The problems began in mid July, with threats such as “Death to Vasella” and “We are watching you” painted on the road outside his house in the village of Risch in Switzerland, as well as on the village church. Two weeks later, his parents’ graves were desecrated and his mothers’ ashes stolen. Novartis employees across Europe were also targeted, with bombs being attached to cars and the company leisure centre in France being burnt down.
Finally, on August 3, Vasella’s holiday home in Austria was set alight, prompting him to sell the property so as to avoid any future danger to the residents in the area. No group ever claimed responsibility for the acts, although Novartis pointed the finger at SHAC because of the message “Drop H.L.S [Huntingdon Life Sciences] now.” It was a particularly difficult issue for the company to address, as it claimed to have dropped Huntingdon Life Sciences years ago.
After an impressive career at Novartis, Daniel Vasella stepped aside as CEO of the company on February 1, 2010, while remaining Chairman. There have been controversies and problems under his watch, but there have also been great successes – not least of which is the creation of Novartis itself. Many believe this will increase the company’s competitiveness and innovation, and with his background in consumer goods successor Joe Jimenez will be a break from tradition. Nevertheless, it is Vasella who made the company what it is today and whose end-user based business philosophy led it to be the second largest pharmaceuticals company in Europe by sales. Jimenez has big shoes to fill, let us hope that he is up to the job.

      Sidelights
    

      In eight years, Daniel Vasella went from being a doctor to becoming the
      head of Novartis, one of the world's biggest drug companies. He has
      managed the company with a doctor's interest in research into new
      treatments and a tough-minded businessman's aggressive, innovative
      thinking. Thanks to his leadership, Novartis has released a 
      

          Daniel Vasella 
          
        

       drug that fights a rare cancer without hurting healthy cells, and his
      company has dozens of new drugs almost ready for market at a time when
      competitors are running low on new products. In early 2005, he led
      Novartis in a bold move into the generic drug market, again showing his
      competitive streak and calculated risk-taking.
    
    
      Vasella, who was born in Switzerland in 1953, had to face illness and
      death at a young age. He came down with tuberculosis and meningitis as a
      child. When he was ten, his older sister died of cancer. Three years
      later, his father, Oskar, a history professor, died of complications from
      surgery. He says watching his sister fight her illness led to his interest
      in medicine, and he went to the University of Bern Medical School.
      (Another sister, who went to medical school with him, died in an accident
      in 1982.)
    

      After getting his medical degree, Vasella worked in pathology and internal
      medicine, eventually becoming the University of Bern's chief
      resident. But he was developing an interest in business, so he left the
      hospital to join the drug company Sandoz Pharma, where his wife's
      uncle was chief executive officer. He started working at the Sandoz office
      in New Jersey, where he became product manager for 
       an anti-pancreatic cancer drug. He knew that his success depended on the
      drug's success, so he had researchers, production chemists, and
      marketers work together to find new uses for the drug, instead of the
      usual practice of the three groups working in isolation. They discovered
      that it could also treat the side effects of certain cancers, and its
      sales skyrocketed.
    

      Returning to Switzerland in 1993, Vasella worked in top corporate
      positions, using the methods he had developed with the cancer drug on all
      of Sandoz's drug-development efforts. He became CEO of Sandoz in
      1994, and when Sandoz merged with rival Ciba-Geigy to form Novartis in
      1996, Vasella was named the new company's CEO. His family ties to
      Sandoz made some feel he had gotten the job out of nepotism, but others
      disagree. "To anyone who followed the company at the time, Dan was
      the live wire," SG Cowen analyst Peter Laing told Unmesh Kher of 
      
        Time.
      
       "He had the most international outlook, and there really
      wasn't anyone at Ciba to challenge him."
    

      Making the new company work was difficult. Sandoz had a hierarchical
      leadership style that Vasella thought discouraged initiative, while the
      culture at Ciba seemed to discourage strong decision-making. Both
      companies had started off as chemical companies and gone into drug
      manufacturing; now, they were pharmaceutical companies that still had some
      chemical production business left over. Vasella reorganized the company,
      laying off 12,500 workers and firing several managers, and formed a
      venture fund that helped ex-employees start new businesses. For a while,
      when Vasella would travel to Novartis offices around the world, he would
      fire managers immediately if he did not like what they did or said, until
      he was told that workers had started to fear his visits. "Now I ask
      that they not be fired until several weeks after I come back" to
      Switzerland, he told the 
      
        Wall Street Journal.
      


      At first, success was slow to come. Novartis' sales increased only
      slightly in 1998 and 1999. Vasella invested in life sciences with the idea
      that new biotechnology would link the drug business with agricultural and
      nutritional products. But the life sciences market floundered. Vasella
      realized it and abandoned his goal. Novartis sold off its agricultural arm
      in 2000.
    

      At the time, Novartis' competitors in the pharmaceutical industry
      dismissed it "as a sleepy European giant without the marketing and
      sales firepower to compete in the U.S.," wrote Kerry Capell of 
      
        BusinessWeek.
      
       But thanks to Vasella's decision to spend heavily on research and
      marketing, Novartis scored a huge success when it released the cancer drug
      Gleevec in May of 2001.
    

      Gleevec worked on relatively rare forms of cancer such as chronic myeloid
      leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. But the way it works is
      unique and promising. It is the first drug that had been proven to destroy
      a certain kind of tumor. Other cancer drugs destroy healthy cells and
      cancer cells alike, but Gleevec attacks the proteins that make tumors
      grow.
    

      Vasella's leadership was a key ingredient in Gleevec's
      success. According to the magazine 
      
        Chief Executive,
      
       after the Sandoz/Ciba-Geigy merger, Vasella talked to some Ciba-Geigy
      researchers, who told him about the drug compound that eventually became
      Gleevec. Although it seemed the drug would only appeal to a narrow market
      because it treated a rare disease, Vasella pushed for testing and
      production of it to move forward and personally answered the letters from
      cancer patients who asked to be included in the trials.
    

      In 2003, Vasella told the story in a book, 
      
        Magic Cancer Bullet: How a Tiny Orange Pill is Rewriting Medical
        History,
      
       co-written with Robert Slater. Clifton Leaf, a writer for 
      
        Fortune,
      
       called the book "a heroic saga," attracted to the story of
      a corporate culture championing a life-saving drug. 
      
        Publishers Weekly
      
       acknowledged it was an inspiring story, but complained that the book
      "reads largely as an extended press release for Novartis"
      because of its "repetition and stilted writing" and lack of
      "the details and depth of feeling needed to make that story come
      alive."
    

      As CEO, Vasella is known for putting a lot of money into research and
      development. In 2004, Novartis was spending $3 billion on research, or 19
      percent of its drug sales, compared to an industry standard of 13 to 16
      percent. He moved the company's research and development
      headquarters from Basel, Switzerland, to Cambridge, Massachusetts, to take
      advantage of the Boston area's heavy concentration of medical
      researchers and personally recruited a top scientist from Harvard Medical
      School to run the lab. As a doctor, Vasella can oversee research better
      than other drug company CEOs, his admirers say, because he can ask his
      research teams complex questions.
    

      Relying so much on research and development (as opposed to, say, acquiring
      other companies and their patents) is risky for a pharmaceutical company 
       because it means betting on rare successes to come out of its labs. But
      so far, Vasella's approach is paying off. Novartis moves its drugs
      through research and development in two-thirds the time of the average
      drug company, in part thanks to a strategy of testing a drug on several
      diseases at once. It had 64 drugs in the medium or late stages of
      development in 2004, compared to 37 and 14 at competitors Roche and Merck,
      respectively.
    

      Vasella's accomplishments are more striking in comparison to his
      competitors, who have struggled with decreased profits and competition
      from generic drugs. Novartis "has had to face many of the same
      issues bedeviling its peers, including expiring patents on big-selling
      drugs," according to the 
      
        Wall Street Journal.
      
       "But Dr. Vasella has steered the company through these problems,
      in large part by jettisoning its staid Swiss culture and transforming the
      firm into a bare-knuckled, American-style marketing
      powerhouse,"—a reference to his strategy for getting company
      researchers and marketers to work together to create more effective
      marketing strategies for products. For instance, the company dropped an
      ineffective ad for Lamisil, Novartis' treatment for fungal
      infections, and created a brochure salesmen could give to doctors about
      the condition. Sales of Lamisil went up afterward. "I love
      Switzerland and I think people know that I'm patriotic,"
      Vasella told Harris. "But this is about making decisions that are
      essential to the business. We are going to be as, or even more, American
      as any company."
    

      Vasella's success has won him a lot of praise. In 2004, 
      
        Time
      
       named Vasella one of the world's "100 Most Influential
      People," the only drug company executive on the list. Readers of
      the 
      
        Financial Times
      
       selected him as the most influential business leader in Europe in the
      last 25 years. Capell of 
      
        Business-Week
      
       wrote that he is "an unusual mix: an aggressive manager who still
      keeps something of the gentle bedside manner he developed as a general
      practitioner." Vasella also has a casual, calm persona; Capell
      described him as "an unbuttoned type who likes roaring around the
      Swiss countryside on his BMW bike."
    

      To build on his achievements, Vasella moved to expand Novartis. He tripled
      its United States sales force to 6,200, seeing the United
      States—the world's most lucrative drug market—as key
      to the company's future. He also acquired some North American
      companies. He bought a majority stake in Idenix Pharmaceuticals of
      Cambridge, Massachusetts, which was working on new drugs to treat
      hepatitis B and C, for $225 million, and bought Sabex, a Canadian drug
      company, for more than $500 million.
    

      Many business analysts expected Vasella to make a big move to merge with
      another major company, but he came back empty-handed from his hunt for a
      big deal. He looked longingly at Roche, also based in Basel, and began
      buying its stock, but Roche's CEO and the family who owns the
      majority stake in the company were opposed to a merger. As of early 2005,
      Novartis had only managed to acquire 33 percent of Roche. He also pursued
      a merger with French drug company Aventis, but he backed off after the
      French government, preferring that the company remain French, put up
      hurdles to a deal.
    

      In January of 2005, as Novartis announced record profits and sales for
      2004, Vasella got the drug industry's attention by speaking out
      about recent scandals involving other companies' patented drugs. He
      warned his competitors, who had been accused of not releasing enough
      research information about side effects, that they needed to become more
      open. But he also told critics of the drug industry to back off from calls
      to ease patent protection. That, he said, would discourage companies from
      researching new drugs, hurting patients in the long run.
    

      The next month, Novartis made a bold move. It became the world's
      biggest maker of generic drugs by spending $8.3 billion to buy Hexal, a
      German company that makes generic pharmaceuticals, and Eon Labs,
      Hexal's United States affiliate. The generic drug market is
      expected to be lucrative in the next several years, as patents on many
      popular drugs worth tens of billions of dollars expire. Novartis says it
      is pursuing a third route to success, instead of focusing only on patented
      drugs or diversifying by going into other medical technologies, the usual
      strategies of major pharmaceutical companies.
    

      Vasella, whose salary was about $2.6 million in 2004, believes Novartis
      has a bright future. The company predicted that by 2008 or 2009, it should
      have eight blockbuster drugs on the market—that is, drugs with
      annual sales of $1 billion or more. In early 2005, it had five. The
      possible future drugs include the first pill to fight multiple sclerosis,
      a new asthma treatment, and drugs to fight cancers and high blood
      pressure.

Early life and education[edit]
Vasella was born in Fribourg, Switzerland, in 1953.[8] His father was a history professor at the local university, and his mother was a housewife. His desire to become a doctor began during his childhood, which was marked by several tragedies.[2][5] At eight years old, he contracted TB and meningitis and spent nearly a year in hospitals.[9] When Vasella was 13 years old, his father died from complications of surgery.[9]
Vasella obtained his M.D. in 1980 from the University of Bern in Switzerland.[8] He completed his residency at the University Hospital in Bern and the city hospital in Zurich, before returning to Bern as chief resident.[2][8] In 1988, he changed career paths, working in the United States as a pharmaceutical sales representative and in market research. In 1989, he completed the Program for Management Development at Harvard Business School.[2][8] Vasella was awarded an honorary doctorate for medicine by the University of Basel in 2002.[2][5]
Career[edit]
Vasella held a number of medical positions in Switzerland before being hired in 1988 by Sandoz Pharmaceutical Corporation, the former U.S. subsidiary of Swiss pharmaceutical company, Sandoz. He remained there until 1992, when he was promoted to CEO of parent company, Sandoz Pharma Ltd., and named a member of the Group Executive Committee.[2][10]
Vasella helped to orchestrate the 1996 merger between Sandoz and Ciba-Geigy, another Swiss pharmaceutical company.[2] The two companies combined to form Novartis AG. Vasella was appointed CEO of the combined entity and a member of the Board of Directors. In 1999, he was named Chairman of the Board of Directors.[2]
In January 2010, Vasella decided to step down as CEO. He was replaced by his hand-picked successor, Joseph Jimenez, the Division Head of Novartis Pharmaceuticals at the time.
In January 2013, Novartis announced that Vasella would be retiring as Chairman of the Board of Directors in February 2013.[11] Vasella was named an honorary chairman, to be succeeded by Jörg Reinhard in August 2013.[12] According to the Ethos foundation Vasella earned from 2002 until 2012 312 Mio CHF from Novartis, and for the years before they estimated it to 60 Mio CHF, a total of 421 Mio CHF in 2013. That he should get 72 Mio CHF for a noncompetition clause at the end made him a public figure during the campaign for the Swiss referendum "against rip-off salaries".[13][14][4]
Writing[edit]
Vasella authored Magic Cancer Bullet: How a Tiny Orange Pill May Rewrite Medical History (2003), a book about the discovery and development of the breakthrough cancer drug Gleevec.[15] The book was co-written with Robert Slater.
Personal life[edit]
Vasella met Anne-Laurence Moret, the niece of former Sandoz CFO, CEO, and chairman Marc Moret, in 1973, and they were married in 1978.[16] Vasella and his wife have two grown sons and a daughter. His older brother, Andrea Vasella, was a professor at the ETH Zurich.[16] Vasella is a patron of the arts and enjoys skiing and spending time outdoors.[17]
Awards and recognition[edit]
Vasella has received numerous awards for his humanitarian efforts, corporate philanthropy work, and his leadership in the Pharmaceutical industry. They include:

2003: Harvard Alumnus Award[18]
2004: Most Influential European Business Leader of the Last 25 Years by the readers of Financial Times[2]
2004: Time magazine: One of the Top 100 Most Influential Personalities[6]
2004: The Cancer Research Institute’s Oliver R. Grace Award (for Distinguished Service in Advancing Cancer Research)[19]
University of Marburg’s Karl Winnacker Preis[20] 2007
Elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences 2008
GILD Award for Leadership: Warren Bennis Award for Excellence in Leadership 2010

Early life and education[edit]
Vasella was born in Fribourg, Switzerland, in 1953.[8] His father was a history professor at the local university, and his mother was a housewife. His desire to become a doctor began during his childhood, which was marked by several tragedies.[2][5] At eight years old, he contracted TB and meningitis and spent nearly a year in hospitals.[9] When Vasella was 13 years old, his father died from complications of surgery.[9]
Vasella obtained his M.D. in 1980 from the University of Bern in Switzerland.[8] He completed his residency at the University Hospital in Bern and the city hospital in Zurich, before returning to Bern as chief resident.[2][8] In 1988, he changed career paths, working in the United States as a pharmaceutical sales representative and in market research. In 1989, he completed the Program for Management Development at Harvard Business School.[2][8] Vasella was awarded an honorary doctorate for medicine by the University of Basel in 2002.[2][5]
Career[edit]
Vasella held a number of medical positions in Switzerland before being hired in 1988 by Sandoz Pharmaceutical Corporation, the former U.S. subsidiary of Swiss pharmaceutical company, Sandoz. He remained there until 1992, when he was promoted to CEO of parent company, Sandoz Pharma Ltd., and named a member of the Group Executive Committee.[2][10]
Vasella helped to orchestrate the 1996 merger between Sandoz and Ciba-Geigy, another Swiss pharmaceutical company.[2] The two companies combined to form Novartis AG. Vasella was appointed CEO of the combined entity and a member of the Board of Directors. In 1999, he was named Chairman of the Board of Directors.[2]
In January 2010, Vasella decided to step down as CEO. He was replaced by his hand-picked successor, Joseph Jimenez, the Division Head of Novartis Pharmaceuticals at the time.
In January 2013, Novartis announced that Vasella would be retiring as Chairman of the Board of Directors in February 2013.[11] Vasella was named an honorary chairman, to be succeeded by Jörg Reinhard in August 2013.[12] According to the Ethos foundation Vasella earned from 2002 until 2012 312 Mio CHF from Novartis, and for the years before they estimated it to 60 Mio CHF, a total of 421 Mio CHF in 2013. That he should get 72 Mio CHF for a noncompetition clause at the end made him a public figure during the campaign for the Swiss referendum "against rip-off salaries".[13][14][4]
Writing[edit]
Vasella authored Magic Cancer Bullet: How a Tiny Orange Pill May Rewrite Medical History (2003), a book about the discovery and development of the breakthrough cancer drug Gleevec.[15] The book was co-written with Robert Slater.
Personal life[edit]
Vasella met Anne-Laurence Moret, the niece of former Sandoz CFO, CEO, and chairman Marc Moret, in 1973, and they were married in 1978.[16] Vasella and his wife have two grown sons and a daughter. His older brother, Andrea Vasella, was a professor at the ETH Zurich.[16] Vasella is a patron of the arts and enjoys skiing and spending time outdoors.[17]
Awards and recognition[edit]
Vasella has received numerous awards for his humanitarian efforts, corporate philanthropy work, and his leadership in the Pharmaceutical industry. They include:

2003: Harvard Alumnus Award[18]
2004: Most Influential European Business Leader of the Last 25 Years by the readers of Financial Times[2]
2004: Time magazine: One of the Top 100 Most Influential Personalities[6]
2004: The Cancer Research Institute’s Oliver R. Grace Award (for Distinguished Service in Advancing Cancer Research)[19]
University of Marburg’s Karl Winnacker Preis[20] 2007
Elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences 2008

Daniel Lucius Vasella,  (born Aug. 15, 1953, Fribourg, Switz.), Swiss doctor and businessman who served as chairman (from 1999) and CEO (1996–2010) of the pharmaceutical company Novartis.Vasella received an M.D. degree in 1980 from the University of Bern, Switz. For the next four years, he held residencies at various hospitals in Bern and Zürich before serving (1984–88) as the attendant physician at C.L. Lory-Haus at Bern University Hospital. He left medicine in 1988 and joined the marketing department of Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corp. in New Jersey, the U.S.-based division of Sandoz Pharma Ltd. The following year Vasella graduated from Harvard Business School, and he moved up quickly in the marketing and sales department at Sandoz to become department head of special-product marketing. He was appointed assistant vice president in 1992 and became head of the corporate-marketing department the following year. In 1994 Vasella returned to Switzerland and accepted the position of head of the worldwide development office at Sandoz’s headquarters in Basel. He was named CEO of Sandoz the following year.Early in 1996 Vasella was named CEO of the newly formed Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis, which was established as a result of the largest merger ever in the pharmaceutical industry. The combined company united industry giants Sandoz Ltd. and Ciba-Geigy Ltd., two Swiss-based health care groups, in a $29 billion merger that made Novartis second in size and influence only to Britain’s Glaxo Wellcome, the world’s largest pharmaceutical concern. As CEO, Vasella was responsible for coordinating the integration of the Sandoz and Ciba-Geigy product lines. He assumed a joint leadership role with Novartis chairman Alex Krauer, who had served as chairman of Ciba-Geigy. The two were responsible for overseeing the company’s overall development and direction, and Vasella also served as head of the company’s executive committee. After Krauer retired in 1999, Vasella was appointed chairman of Novartis.Vasella joined the board of PepsiCo, Inc., in 2002. The following year he published the book Magic Cancer Bullet: How a Tiny Orange Pill Is Rewriting Medical History (reissued in 2004), cowritten with Robert Slater, in which he discussed Novartis’s breakthrough cancer drug Gleevec, also known as Glivec. The recipient of numerous honours, in 2003 he received Harvard Business School’s Alumni Achievement Award and the CancerCare Human Services Award.Amanda E. Fuller

Vasella
Illustration by Dennis Balogh

Twenty years ago a young doctor with a hankering for business experience gave up his clinical practice in Bern, Switzerland, and moved to East Hanover, New Jersey, to try his hand at drug sales with the Swiss   conglomerate Sandoz. As high-risk career moves   go, this one played out brilliantly. Within a decade, Dr. Daniel Vasella (PMD 57, 1989) rocketed through the ranks of Sandoz and in 1996 led the firm’s merger with Ciba-Geigy, emerging    as CEO of the new company called Novartis, based in Basel, Switzerland. 
The merger put Vasella’s leadership skills to the test as he methodically refashioned the two old-line chemical companies with disparate corporate cultures into a single entity focused on health care and powered by an innovative approach to R&D. Today, Novartis is one of the world’s most dynamic and admired drug companies, ranking No. 4 with 2006 sales of $37 billion. The company’s aggressive investment in research has made it an industry leader in new drug approvals. And when opportunity knocks, Vasella doesn’t hesitate to broaden Novartis’s business mix through acquisitions.  He recently added generic drugs and vaccines to the company’s portfolio of product lines, setting Novartis apart from its global competitors.
Although initially regarded by critics as too inexperienced to lead a multinational pharmaceutical company, Vasella has triumphed. Three years ago he was named “the most influential European businessman of the past 25 years” in a Financial Times poll of 4,000 executives. He recently spoke about the public policy and business challenges ahead.
U.S. consumers complain loudly that prescription drugs cost too much. What’s your response?
We have a phenomenon where drug prices have been increasing above the rate of inflation, so from that perspective, complaints are understandable. On the other side, there are benefits. Mortality for many diseases has dropped dramatically over the last forty years. Analysis shows that 40 percent of that decline was due to drug therapy.
The big cost item in health care is not drugs, which account for between 15 and 18 percent of the overall health-care costs. The big item is hospital costs. Even if you take away all profits from the pharmaceutical industry, you could lower overall health-care costs by maybe 3 percent at best. So tweaking drug prices will not solve the fundamental problem. 
The Medicare prescription drug program that went into effect last year bars the federal government from negotiating with drug companies over the prices seniors pay. The new Democratic majority in Congress has vowed to remove that barrier. Would seniors benefit? 
This program is very much appreciated by seniors. We have approval rates of way over 70 percent. The costs of drugs in the program are lower than anticipated, and consumers are purchasing drugs at very high discounts. So I think the system seems to work pretty well. The initial issues about confusing coverage and so forth have pretty much vanished. 
In some ways, the prescription drug program is one that should have been introduced by the Democrats years ago because there was a real need for seniors to get drug coverage. It wasn’t right that since 1965, when Medicare was enacted, they didn’t have any drug coverage. So the Democrats are probably unhappy that the Republicans passed the prescription drug law. And some don’t like the fact that it relied on private insurance providers.
Do drug companies have sufficient patent protection for new products? 
There are two issues here. One is the length of patent life (twenty years in the United States), and the other is the solidity of the patent. Regarding length, it’s a sensitive point. If we have delays in FDA regulatory approval because more questions are being asked, or if we are more diligent about studying a drug longer, we pay by having a shorter patent life remaining once a drug goes to market. There are people who say we should have a fixed number of years of patent protection after FDA approval. It would be quite difficult to change current law. But there is a lot of rationale behind such an argument.
The second issue is solidity of the patent. We have significant challenges of existing patents from the generics industry. If you are not careful, generic companies will be very creative about circumventing patents through litigation. So patenting a product in a smart way has become much more complex. That means patent lawyers have become as important to the defense side as to the attacking side. 
Novartis has 138 drugs in its pipeline, more than any of its competitors. How has the company become so successful at creating a culture of innovation? 
Initially, we spent a lot of time integrating development with research   and marketing, functions that had  been separate. On a global basis we created project teams to move drugs forward. That allowed us to have more approvals by the FDA than any other major pharmaceutical company since the year 2000. 
But those changes didn’t solve the problem of creating new compounds. There we took an approach characterized by three things. First, we work closely with academic institutions and with biotech companies. Secondly, we created a genomics institute at The Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California. And the most important step was to create in 2002 the Institutes for BioMedical Research in Cambridge, Massachusetts. We moved our research headquarters there from Basel and developed a new, integrated approach to genomics, biology, and chemistry. 
Novartis is the only drug company with leadership positions in both patented and generic drugs. Given the low margins, why did you decide to get into the generics business?

PROFITABLE YEAR: Speaking at a January 18, 2007, press conference in Basel, Switzerland, Vasella announced that Novartis's 2006 net income rose 17 percent to $7.2 billion.

We have been active in generics for many years. When the industry started to consolidate, the question was, do we get out of it or increase our stake? In view of the long-term trends that we are seeing, generics is a field that is here to stay. And if we want to be in that field, we need to be able to compete with the best. 
The generics business is less profitable than the patented, branded business. But it’s growing at a faster pace. Whenever possible, people switch from branded drugs to generics to cut their expenditures. The question is: Are you in it for the margins, or are you in it for growth of profits and top line? Our philosophy is to look for sustainable growth and to create and maintain a business that is competitive and that satisfies the needs of society and customers. 
You also bought vaccine maker Chiron, even though vaccines have not been a popular business for years. What makes vaccines an attractive business now?
First of all, we owned 42 percent of Chiron. Secondly, we thought we would run it better. The California biotech firm famously failed to produce enough flu vaccine for the U.S. market in 2004. And thirdly, we saw that there was a significant growth opportunity due to new vaccines, new diseases, and new technologies. We believe that in the next five years the growth rate of the vaccine industry will be between 15 and 20 percent, making it a very attractive industry. The margins are, again, not as high as in patented, branded products, but they still are quite attractive.
Also, one of the reasons why big pharma exited the vaccine business was that we had terrible litigation issues. That abuse of litigation now has been limited (with new legislation) because the U.S. government saw that nobody wanted to produce vaccines anymore. 
Do drug companies have a responsibility to supply low-cost drugs to poor countries, even if it means losing money on the effort? 
Our most important responsibility is to discover, develop, and market better products. That’s fundamentally our first responsibility.
If we are successful, that success raises the question of what other roles and responsibilities we have in society aside from our primary mission. And there I believe we have an opportunity, as much as a responsibility, to help people who don’t have the means, for whatever reason, to afford medicines that, in many cases, can be lifesaving.
Last year we delivered to underdeveloped nations products and services valued at about $700 million, which was over 2 percent of our sales. And that exceeds the development aid as a percentage of GDP of many countries, where the agreed target should be .07 percent of GDP. Most countries are way below that. 
However, we cannot fix poor governance, corruption, inadequate distribution systems, or lack of health-care professionals. So the primary responsibility for health care is and remains with governments to take care of their citizens. And in many cases, unfortunately, it appears that government leaders care more about their own pockets than about the well-being of their citizens. We cannot punish patients because they have bad governments. Not surprisingly, there is a tendency to shift responsibilities from governments to private industry. But it would be unfair to push all responsibility to private industry. One has to be careful about how much of this shifting is reasonable, and when it starts to become unreasonable.

                Childhood illness, family misfortune, and an early career as a physician influenced Daniel Vasella’s outlook as CEO of Novartis, which he built into one of the world’s largest drug companies.
            
Daniel Vasella’s early experiences with the health care industry were shaped by his own harrowing battles with childhood illness. As a young boy in Switzerland, he was in and out of hospitals with a host of maladies, including food poisoning and asthma. At the age of eight, he suffered attacks of tuberculosis and meningitis that forced him to spend a year in a sanatorium, away from his family. The compassion of doctors and nurses in that facility helped him through that difficult period and kindled his interest in medicine. But the remainder of his youth was overshadowed by the death of his older sister from cancer when he was 10 and the death of his father in surgery when Vasella was 13.

After graduating with high honors from University of Bern, where he studied medicine and psychoanalysis, Vasella practiced as a physician in Switzerland until 1988, when he accepted an offer from Sandoz AG, the Swiss pharmaceutical giant, to take a sales job with the company’s US affiliate. Vasella thrived in his new role. The switch from medicine to business, he says, gave him the opportunity to do work that could benefit “not one or a hundred but thousands” of people. He rose rapidly in Sandoz’s marketing organization. In 1992, after a series of successful management assignments in the United States and Switzerland, he was named CEO.
A few years later, Vasella helped engineer what was then one of the largest mergers in corporate history by joining Sandoz and its rival Ciba-Geigy to create Novartis. Vasella was named CEO of the new company and retained that position until January 2010. He was appointed chairman of Novartis’s board of directors in 1999 and continues to serve in that capacity.
As CEO, Vasella built Novartis into one of the world’s largest drug companies by sales. He shifted research away from making incremental advances in older medicines for common maladies to focusing instead on drugs for rare, critical diseases whose biological origins could be understood and treated. He pushed Novartis to invest in new areas of health care, such as generics, and led efforts to expand the company’s presence in China. He also spearheaded Novartis’s $52 billion acquisition of US eye-care company Alcon. That purchase, completed in 2010, positioned Novartis as a global leader in one of the health care industry’s fastest-growing segments. In this January 2012 interview with McKinsey’s Rik Kirkland, Vasella discusses the importance of resilience in leading large organizations.
McKinsey: Do you have the sense that, for leaders of large global organizations such as Novartis, the context has changed compared with, say, ten years ago? If so, what are some of the key differences?
Daniel Vasella: The context has changed, without a doubt—and I think it will continue to evolve. If I think about our business, there are many differences. One is that people everywhere are living longer. Another is the ascendance of new economies—Africa, China, Latin America. And then there is the rising indebtedness of governments paired with monetary expansion. So you’ve got longer life spans, expanding populations, and more wealth in emerging economies; all of those imply opportunities and risks. Aging and growing disposable income increase the demand for health care. But at the same time, they pose challenges, as government debt and weak economies in industrialized countries are the source of pricing pressures for us, which in turn forces us to push harder to raise productivity and can lead to restructuring and loss of employment. All these things create tremendous tension. You want to do the right thing, but you have many different responsibilities.
McKinsey: Do you find you are spending more time dealing with officials in the public sector, and is that a new dimension of the CEO’s job?
Daniel Vasella: Our industry has always been highly regulated. But lately, what we see is a paradox: people seem to have less trust in government, yet at the same time they seem to be asking governments to impose more regulations. And it’s not just our industry. Compliance—with rules, with regulations, with societal values—is something that takes up more of a business leader’s time now than ever before.
McKinsey: What about the increased pace of innovation? Is that changing the nature of the leader’s job as well?
Daniel Vasella: We definitely see this trend in our industry. The applications of computing and genetics to the biomedical field are exploding. We can do much more today than we could ever do before. We are on the verge of being able to decipher your genome for less than $1,000. We are moving to an era of so-called personalized medicine, where we will be able choose the treatment knowing the specific nature of the disease in an individual. In cancer treatment this is most advanced.
And of course technology has changed the way everyone communicates. When I look around today, everybody’s on some sort of communication tool—a smartphone or iPad or laptop. Opening the computer is the first thing I do in the office every morning. Anyone, anytime can contact me, and in general I do respond: the job is 24/7, 365 days a year.
McKinsey: Do you delegate e-mail to someone else?
Daniel Vasella: No, I don’t like to do that.
McKinsey: Doesn’t that make it hard to control your agenda?
Daniel Vasella: Well, I don’t pretend to be in control of my agenda. That’s an illusion. You can’t have a scheduler or an assistant who is a guard dog and tells whoever’s trying to get on your calendar, “Don’t even try.” You want someone who is welcoming and accommodating, but nevertheless is able to set boundaries.
McKinsey: Do you take the same approach to external communications and your interactions with the media?
Daniel Vasella: People have a legitimate demand for access to the CEO. But you have to modulate that so you avoid overexposure. To the media, you are a product. And the press will paint you as either a hero or a villain—whatever sells. So if they paint you as a hero today, you should be prepared to be painted as a villain tomorrow. Not everything you do will work out every time, and you have to accept that people will be unfair.
McKinsey: To what extent should a leader share doubts and fears about things not working out with members of his team?
Daniel Vasella: I believe that you have to be able to express doubt in your team and with a board. If you don’t—and you pretend—then you are playing a role, which others will sense rather easily leading to an unhealthy situation. That’s not to say you should act like you’re in a confessional. Facing doubt, you have to recognize if and when a decision is needed. If it is, you have to take the sword and cut through the Gordian knot and make a decision, despite any uncertainties.
This also raises the question of decision making and leadership: are you being led by the context or do you set direction? Are you being led by your followers and are they choosing for you? Or do you choose and do you lead? I think you have to be aware of the context and what people expect and hope for. But as a leader, you’re not there to feed people with all the things they hope for. Your job is to recognize the right goal and path forward and then to align and persuade people to do the things you believe will be relevant for the long-term success of the company. People want you to lead. And if you lead, you will also hurt. You will satisfy sometimes. You will celebrate and you will blame. That’s all part of your job. You have to have the backbone and the integrity to be straight with people.
McKinsey: Can you teach those sorts of skills? How do you think about your role in developing future leaders?
Daniel Vasella: There are hard skills, which are in some ways easier to transmit, and there are soft skills, which I find are much more difficult to teach. You can teach concepts, but you can’t teach experiences.
We know that to be a good leader, it helps to be intelligent, able to think conceptually. Leaders also have to have a certain level of ambition; they need to be people who take pleasure in creating, growing, and building. But those qualities need to be balanced by skepticism—recognition that not everyone wants you to succeed and that sometimes bad things happen.
And you have to be able to resist seduction. If I look at all the reasons leaders fall, it’s usually the soft factors. I talk to my team about the seductions that come with taking on a leadership role. There are many different forms: sexual seduction, money, praise. You need to be aware of how you can be seduced in order to be able to resist and keep your integrity.
McKinsey: How can leaders stay grounded?
Daniel Vasella: Every CEO needs someone who can listen—a board member, an adviser, a partner—someone to whom he can speak in total confidence, to whom he can say, “I’ve had it.” You need someone who understands and can help you to keep the balance. Leaders often forget the importance of stable emotional relationships—especially outside the company. It helps tremendously to manage stress. Your partner will do a lot to help keep you in sync.
McKinsey: What about the physical aspects of the leader’s role?
Daniel Vasella: Of course you need physical stamina; you travel a lot and there are different time zones, dinners and speeches, and all kinds of other demands. But I think psychological stamina is even more important. You need to be able to switch on and switch off. Are you entirely present when you’re present? And can you be entirely away when you’re away? You need to have a moment when you say, “I’m home now,” and work is gone.

					Profile: Novartis chief Daniel Vasella
				














                        By Jorn Madslien
                    


                        BBC News business reporter in Basel, Switzerland
                    






Daniel Vasella is in reflective mood.






When you experience disease and death early on, you realise that time is not endless





As chairman and chief executive of Novartis, the world's fifth largest drug company, the 51-year-old medical doctor is acutely aware of both his powers and his responsibilities.

Dr Vasella comes across as gentle and philosophical, even humble.

Yet he also reveals a pragmatic approach to life and business.

Travelling salesman

Dr Vasella was a late entrant to the world of private enterprise.







                            2004 results
                        
Sales rose 9% to $28.25bn

Net profits rose 15% to $5.77bn







Novartis forecasts soaring sales









While still in his early thirties, he was a physician, having risen to become head of a hospital.

But his world crumbled: the young doctor suffered a breakdown that would force him to reconsider everything.

Psychotherapy proved to be the answer. He now describes it as a life-saving experience that freed him from his past.

"It is not a crisis, it is a recognition of who you are, what you like, how you want to live your life," he says. 

So he made a decision, which at the time must have seemed more foolhardy than gutsy. In 1988, he quit his job at the hospital and moved to New Jersey to become a travelling salesman for the Swiss drugs firm Sandoz, pitching medicines to general practitioners.

Dr Vasella soon rose within the ranks at Sandoz, working in brand and product management before returning to Switzerland in 1992 to take charge of world marketing. Two years later he was crowned as Sandoz's chief executive. 












You obviously have to enjoy business, have a successful company and make money, but it cannot be the end goal
 


Dr Daniel VasellaNovartis







Live: Novartis share price








By then, Dr Vasella's entry into the pharmaceutical sector had come to dominate his life.

Powerhouse

In 1996, the young looking doctor announced big news at a hastily organised press conference at London's City Airport: a new global pharmaceutical giant had just been created following the merger of Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz.

And he would be in charge.

Critics pointed out that Dr Vasella was relatively inexperienced, and there were also accusations of nepotism; his wife of 27 years, Anne-Laurence, is the niece of a former Sandoz chairman.

But nine years later, Dr Vasella has won over most of his critics by building Novartis into a pharmaceutical powerhouse to be reckoned with.

Last year, he was named "the most influential European business leader of the last 25 years" in a poll of Financial Times readers.

Then, in October, he was appointed president of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations.

Accountability

Dr Vasella's success has brought him considerable personal wealth. In 2003, his basic salary of $ 2.2m was part of a $14.4m pay package which made him one of the best paid bosses in Europe.






"Profits provide freedom"





This enables him to live an enviable existence on the edge of Zugersee lake, a 90-minute commute from Basel.

But he is not one for the high life, preferring skiing or scuba diving with his three teenage children, or riding his motorcycle.

Money, he insists, is not the main driving factor in his life. "You obviously have to enjoy business, having a successful company and making money, but it cannot be the end goal,"  he says. 

Instead, he is driven by a sense of purpose that has largely evolved from a cruel string of personal tragedies.

When he was eight, he had tuberculosis and meningitis and was kept out of school for a year. When he was 10, one of his older sisters died from cancer. His father died when he was 13, then years later his other sister died in a car accident.

"When you experience disease and death early on, you realise that time is not endless," Dr Vasella says.

Wealthcare

Dr Vasella has a firm focus on the needs of patients - or customers -  though he also firmly believes that investors' profit requirements have to be met.

"I have modified my position to say that the customer comes first, but I'm also working for shareholders," he says.

To this end, Dr Vasella has pushed through some radical changes that have rocked the Swiss establishment.

At Novartis, old style, incestuous boardroom arrangements - which in the past tied Swiss business and banking tightly together - have been discarded in favour of strict and transparent corporate governance rules that invite scrutiny from the outside. Internally he encourages open debate.

"Showing weakness among good people builds trust," Dr Vasella declares. "Transparency is an outstanding mechanism to keep you on the right track".

For Novartis, the right track is the fast track. Having emerged pretty much unscathed from last year's lost takeover battle for the Franco-German drugs firm Aventis, Novartis is currently the fastest growing of the industry's giant firms, and very profitable at that.

Healthcare

Dr Vasella truly believes his aggressive drive for commercial success is what enables him to release his compassionate energy.

"Money is a tool. It's a real tool. If I sign a deal for $2bn or $3bn, it's abstract."






Showing weakness among good people builds trust





If money can move mountains, then Novartis is well placed to take on the job. Its cash reserves run into billions of dollars.

"So the question comes up about what do you do with it," Dr Vasella says. "It raises the question of accountability, and to whom?"

Novartis has never been coy about its relentless search for new blockbuster drugs, and to this end the group spends vastly more on research and development (R&D) than its drug-industry rivals.

Consequently, its pipeline is full of promise for patients suffering from hypertension, cancer or diabetes.

"I don't care about technological progress as such. Only if mankind can take advantage is it important," he insists, feverishly defending the industry's oft criticised tendency to channel R&D budgets into searches for new drugs that will enjoy commercial success, rather than for drugs treating patients with rare ailments.

"Profits provide freedom," he points out. When deciding on where to channel its R&D budgets, Dr Vasella explains, Novartis goes "medical need, but also economic need".  

"I find this legitimate. It makes sense, ethically and financially." 

Drugs for the poor

This free market formula may work in a wealthy society, but it falls apart when it comes to the search for malaria drugs, anti-retroviral drugs or other medicines for developing world diseases, Dr Vasella acknowledges.

But that, he insists, is not merely the fault of pharmaceutical companies. Rich Western nations and corrupt governments in poor countries should also be blamed for any failure to help.

"I think it's a common responsibility," he says, insisting both Novartis and many of its competitors are pulling their weight.

For instance; Novartis and the Novartis Foundation for Sustainable Development provide free treatment for all leprosy patients in the world. Malaria drugs are provided at cost via the World Health Organisation. In the US the company provides social investment to improve healthcare for some of the 36 million people without health insurance.

"Is it perfect? It is not perfect, but we also have to learn to move ahead with things that are not perfect. I think it is better to do something than nothing," Dr Vasella says.

"I think shareholders can protest if they don't like it, but you know, they don't."

Daniel Lucius Vasella, M.D. (born 15 August 1953) is a medical doctor, author, and executive who served as CEO and chairman of the Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis AG,[1] the world's fifth largest drug company.[2] During his tenure the Novartis shares declined 10%, below the industry.[3][4]
In November 2014, Vasella was elected as a member of the Board of Directors at XBiotech, Inc., a Biopharmaceutical Company located in Austin, Texas, that focuses on the discovery and commercialization of a next generation of therapeutic antibodies which harness a human's natural immunity to fight disease. Vasella is an honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[5] In 2004, Time magazine named him one of the world’s 100 most influential people, and he was chosen as the Most Influential European Business Leader of the Last 25 Years by the readers of the Financial Times.[2][6] He is a former member of the Steering Committee of the Bilderberg Group.[7]

Early life and education[edit]
Vasella was born in Fribourg, Switzerland, in 1953.[8] His father was a history professor at the local university, and his mother was a housewife. His desire to become a doctor began during his childhood, which was marked by several tragedies.[2][5] At eight years old, he contracted TB and meningitis and spent nearly a year in hospitals.[9] When Vasella was 13 years old, his father died from complications of surgery.[9]
Vasella obtained his M.D. in 1980 from the University of Bern in Switzerland.[8] He completed his residency at the University Hospital in Bern and the city hospital in Zurich, before returning to Bern as chief resident.[2][8] In 1988, he changed career paths, working in the United States as a pharmaceutical sales representative and in market research. In 1989, he completed the Program for Management Development at Harvard Business School.[2][8] Vasella was awarded an honorary doctorate for medicine by the University of Basel in 2002.[2][5]
Career[edit]
Vasella held a number of medical positions in Switzerland before being hired in 1988 by Sandoz Pharmaceutical Corporation, the former U.S. subsidiary of Swiss pharmaceutical company, Sandoz. He remained there until 1992, when he was promoted to CEO of parent company, Sandoz Pharma Ltd., and named a member of the Group Executive Committee.[2][10]
Vasella helped to orchestrate the 1996 merger between Sandoz and Ciba-Geigy, another Swiss pharmaceutical company.[2] The two companies combined to form Novartis AG. Vasella was appointed CEO of the combined entity and a member of the Board of Directors. In 1999, he was named Chairman of the Board of Directors.[2]
In January 2010, Vasella decided to step down as CEO. He was replaced by his hand-picked successor, Joseph Jimenez, the Division Head of Novartis Pharmaceuticals at the time.
In January 2013, Novartis announced that Vasella would be retiring as Chairman of the Board of Directors in February 2013.[11] Vasella was named an honorary chairman, to be succeeded by Jörg Reinhard in August 2013.[12] According to the Ethos foundation Vasella earned from 2002 until 2012 312 Mio CHF from Novartis, and for the years before they estimated it to 60 Mio CHF, a total of 421 Mio CHF in 2013. That he should get 72 Mio CHF for a noncompetition clause at the end made him a public figure during the campaign for the Swiss referendum "against rip-off salaries".[13][14][4]
Writing[edit]
Vasella authored Magic Cancer Bullet: How a Tiny Orange Pill May Rewrite Medical History (2003), a book about the discovery and development of the breakthrough cancer drug Gleevec.[15] The book was co-written with Robert Slater.
Personal life[edit]
Vasella met Anne-Laurence Moret, the niece of former Sandoz CFO, CEO, and chairman Marc Moret, in 1973, and they were married in 1978.[16] Vasella and his wife have two grown sons and a daughter. His older brother, Andrea Vasella, was a professor at the ETH Zurich.[16] Vasella is a patron of the arts and enjoys skiing and spending time outdoors.[17]

Early life and education[edit]
Vasella was born in Fribourg, Switzerland, in 1953.[8] His father was a history professor at the local university, and his mother was a housewife. His desire to become a doctor began during his childhood, which was marked by several tragedies.[2][5] At eight years old, he contracted TB and meningitis and spent nearly a year in hospitals.[9] When Vasella was 13 years old, his father died from complications of surgery.[9]
Vasella obtained his M.D. in 1980 from the University of Bern in Switzerland.[8] He completed his residency at the University Hospital in Bern and the city hospital in Zurich, before returning to Bern as chief resident.[2][8] In 1988, he changed career paths, working in the United States as a pharmaceutical sales representative and in market research. In 1989, he completed the Program for Management Development at Harvard Business School.[2][8] Vasella was awarded an honorary doctorate for medicine by the University of Basel in 2002.[2][5]
Career[edit]
Vasella held a number of medical positions in Switzerland before being hired in 1988 by Sandoz Pharmaceutical Corporation, the former U.S. subsidiary of Swiss pharmaceutical company, Sandoz. He remained there until 1992, when he was promoted to CEO of parent company, Sandoz Pharma Ltd., and named a member of the Group Executive Committee.[2][10]
Vasella helped to orchestrate the 1996 merger between Sandoz and Ciba-Geigy, another Swiss pharmaceutical company.[2] The two companies combined to form Novartis AG. Vasella was appointed CEO of the combined entity and a member of the Board of Directors. In 1999, he was named Chairman of the Board of Directors.[2]
In January 2010, Vasella decided to step down as CEO. He was replaced by his hand-picked successor, Joseph Jimenez, the Division Head of Novartis Pharmaceuticals at the time.
In January 2013, Novartis announced that Vasella would be retiring as Chairman of the Board of Directors in February 2013.[11] Vasella was named an honorary chairman, to be succeeded by Jörg Reinhard in August 2013.[12] According to the Ethos foundation Vasella earned from 2002 until 2012 312 Mio CHF from Novartis, and for the years before they estimated it to 60 Mio CHF, a total of 421 Mio CHF in 2013. That he should get 72 Mio CHF for a noncompetition clause at the end made him a public figure during the campaign for the Swiss referendum "against rip-off salaries".[13][14][4]
Writing[edit]
Vasella authored Magic Cancer Bullet: How a Tiny Orange Pill May Rewrite Medical History (2003), a book about the discovery and development of the breakthrough cancer drug Gleevec.[15] The book was co-written with Robert Slater.
Personal life[edit]
Vasella met Anne-Laurence Moret, the niece of former Sandoz CFO, CEO, and chairman Marc Moret, in 1973, and they were married in 1978.[16] Vasella and his wife have two grown sons and a daughter. His older brother, Andrea Vasella, was a professor at the ETH Zurich.[16] Vasella is a patron of the arts and enjoys skiing and spending time outdoors.[17]
Awards and recognition[edit]
Vasella has received numerous awards for his humanitarian efforts, corporate philanthropy work, and his leadership in the Pharmaceutical industry. They include:

2003: Harvard Alumnus Award[18]
2004: Most Influential European Business Leader of the Last 25 Years by the readers of Financial Times[2]

Daniel Lucius Vasella, M.D. (born 15 August 1953) is a medical doctor, author, and executive who served as CEO and chairman of the Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis AG,[1] the world's fifth largest drug company.[2] During his tenure the Novartis shares declined 10%, below the industry.[3][4]
In November 2014, Vasella was elected as a member of the Board of Directors at XBiotech, Inc., a Biopharmaceutical Company located in Austin, Texas, that focuses on the discovery and commercialization of a next generation of therapeutic antibodies which harness a human's natural immunity to fight disease. Vasella is an honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[5] In 2004, Time magazine named him one of the world’s 100 most influential people, and he was chosen as the Most Influential European Business Leader of the Last 25 Years by the readers of the Financial Times.[2][6] He is a former member of the Steering Committee of the Bilderberg Group.[7]

Early life and education[edit]
Vasella was born in Fribourg, Switzerland, in 1953.[8] His father was a history professor at the local university, and his mother was a housewife. His desire to become a doctor began during his childhood, which was marked by several tragedies.[2][5] At eight years old, he contracted TB and meningitis and spent nearly a year in hospitals.[9] When Vasella was 13 years old, his father died from complications of surgery.[9]
Vasella obtained his M.D. in 1980 from the University of Bern in Switzerland.[8] He completed his residency at the University Hospital in Bern and the city hospital in Zurich, before returning to Bern as chief resident.[2][8] In 1988, he changed career paths, working in the United States as a pharmaceutical sales representative and in market research. In 1989, he completed the Program for Management Development at Harvard Business School.[2][8] Vasella was awarded an honorary doctorate for medicine by the University of Basel in 2002.[2][5]
Career[edit]
Vasella held a number of medical positions in Switzerland before being hired in 1988 by Sandoz Pharmaceutical Corporation, the former U.S. subsidiary of Swiss pharmaceutical company, Sandoz. He remained there until 1992, when he was promoted to CEO of parent company, Sandoz Pharma Ltd., and named a member of the Group Executive Committee.[2][10]
Vasella helped to orchestrate the 1996 merger between Sandoz and Ciba-Geigy, another Swiss pharmaceutical company.[2] The two companies combined to form Novartis AG. Vasella was appointed CEO of the combined entity and a member of the Board of Directors. In 1999, he was named Chairman of the Board of Directors.[2]
In January 2010, Vasella decided to step down as CEO. He was replaced by his hand-picked successor, Joseph Jimenez, the Division Head of Novartis Pharmaceuticals at the time.
In January 2013, Novartis announced that Vasella would be retiring as Chairman of the Board of Directors in February 2013.[11] Vasella was named an honorary chairman, to be succeeded by Jörg Reinhard in August 2013.[12] According to the Ethos foundation Vasella earned from 2002 until 2012 312 Mio CHF from Novartis, and for the years before they estimated it to 60 Mio CHF, a total of 421 Mio CHF in 2013. That he should get 72 Mio CHF for a noncompetition clause at the end made him a public figure during the campaign for the Swiss referendum "against rip-off salaries".[13][14][4]
Writing[edit]
Vasella authored Magic Cancer Bullet: How a Tiny Orange Pill May Rewrite Medical History (2003), a book about the discovery and development of the breakthrough cancer drug Gleevec.[15] The book was co-written with Robert Slater.
Personal life[edit]
Vasella met Anne-Laurence Moret, the niece of former Sandoz CFO, CEO, and chairman Marc Moret, in 1973, and they were married in 1978.[16] Vasella and his wife have two grown sons and a daughter. His older brother, Andrea Vasella, was a professor at the ETH Zurich.[16] Vasella is a patron of the arts and enjoys skiing and spending time outdoors.[17]
Awards and recognition[edit]
Vasella has received numerous awards for his humanitarian efforts, corporate philanthropy work, and his leadership in the Pharmaceutical industry. They include:

2003: Harvard Alumnus Award[18]
2004: Most Influential European Business Leader of the Last 25 Years by the readers of Financial Times[2]
2004: Time magazine: One of the Top 100 Most Influential Personalities[6]
2004: The Cancer Research Institute’s Oliver R. Grace Award (for Distinguished Service in Advancing Cancer Research)[19]
University of Marburg’s Karl Winnacker Preis[20] 2007
Elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences 2008

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
