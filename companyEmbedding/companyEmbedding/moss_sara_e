Executive LeadershipBoard of Directors









                Executive Leadership
              


Our team of senior executives is focused on strategically growing our business for the long term. They bring multinational talent, creativity and humanity to the leadership of our organization. In brief interviews below we offer a personal glimpse of our leaders. The Lauder family members featured are active in the business today.

              William P. Lauder
            

              Executive Chairman
            






William P. Lauder, the son of Leonard and Evelyn Lauder and the grandson of Estée and Joseph Lauder, became Executive Chairman and Chairman of the Board of Directors in 2009. During his previous five-year tenure as Chief Executive Officer, he expanded the Company’s international presence and distribution channels and greatly strengthened the brand portfolio. Mr. Lauder joined the company in 1986 as New York Regional Marketing Director for Clinique, eventually running its worldwide business. He led the creation of the Origins brand and its innovative store-within-a store concept as well as directing the company’s freestanding stores and Internet business. He is on the faculty of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, where he teaches “Decision Making in the Leadership Chair,” a course he designed for second-year MBA students.

Q&A










What excites you about coming to work each day?
First and foremost, it’s the people who work here — their commitment to our brands is palpable and energizing. It’s the intellectual challenge. It’s the competition. It’s the excitement of doing great for our consumers — helping people feel better about themselves, helping them unlock their own beauty.








Why is continuous learning important at The Estée Lauder Companies?
Learning is an integral part of our culture. We continuously ask ourselves: Is what we’re doing today going to be relevant to the consumer in the future? We insist that our leaders never stop exploring new ideas, and we expect that mind-set to trickle down throughout the company. We want employees to feel like they have permission to push the envelope and think differently, because we have to constantly reinvent ourselves. Ultimately no one individual has a monopoly on insight and brilliance. Innovation comes from every chair.
You’ve been championing the Company’s online/digital efforts from their inception. What were some of the smartest decisions the Company made in this arena?
When we turned on our first e-commerce site in 1996, it was controversial because our retail partners perceived it as a threat to their business. We understand now that our online presence enhances our overall business. The multichannel consumer is a far more valuable customer who spends more on our brands than the consumer who shops exclusively online or in store. The highest click rates on our websites are for the store locators. Many consumers still want to know where they can see, touch, feel and smell the product before they buy it.
What core capabilities will future leaders need to take the business to the next level of growth?
The technical skills companies need will almost certainly change, but the core capabilities needed for effective leadership — curiosity, adaptability, communication, imagination — will be the same. Leaders have to be bold and have the courage to try something new. This applies to their careers and to the business itself. I encourage young leaders to live in another country or region, to experience another culture — which pushes you to explore and learn.








What’s different about leading a family company versus a nonfamily company?
Leading a family company and being a member of that family is both a pressure and a privilege. In many ways, the stakes are higher in a family company because your name is on the door and you can’t just walk away if things go south. You are the keeper of the culture — it’s your responsibility to honor and respect the past without letting it hold the company back from its future potential. At the same time, there is a real advantage to leading a company that is focused on longevity and on generating long-term value. We practice what I call “patient capitalism” — we have a higher tolerance for long-term investments that yield greater returns 5, 10, 15 years into the future.

We practice what I call “patient capitalism” — we have a higher tolerance for long-term investments that yield greater returns 5, 10, 15 years into the future.








How do you maintain a family culture in such a large, spread out company?
Our definition of family goes beyond the family name — it is broader and more inclusive. It involves a sense of belonging. It’s about those human touches we put into our company that maintain an ethos that makes people feel they are welcome — because they are. We try to maintain a warmth and friendliness that is, hopefully, part of what most families are like, which makes everybody feel they’re a part of the family in one way, shape or form. It’s becoming a lost definition of family, but it still works for us.
What do you hope to accomplish by the end of your career? What do you want your leadership legacy to be?
The most important thing I want to do is to help set our company on a course for sustainable excellence and leadership in our sector that will last for many generations beyond the influence I might have as an individual. I hope that through the executives whose careers we’ve nurtured our company will continue to adapt and thrive while maintaining the value systems that have allowed us to get to where we are today — and those values endure for many generations to come.
What is your definition of beauty?
My definition of beauty is the tremendous diversity we have inside of our company. Diversity of our people, diversity of our brands, the diversity of our consumers and the diversity of their definition of beauty is what connects us all together with all of our brands.

Q&A










What excites you about coming to work each day?
I come to work every day excited and happy to be here. And it’s because of the people, it’s because of the competitive spirits that we have, the creativity and innovation and new ideas, and frankly because of the intellectual challenge — it’s fantastic. There’s an amazing mix of historic strengths and future potential that fuels our efforts.








Can you explain the concept of “leadership from every chair?”
“Leadership from every chair” means leadership from each person in the company, even if they started yesterday. It is leadership that comes from engagement and participation, not from authority. It stems from our deep-rooted commitment to employee education and to developing future leaders. Providing employees the opportunity to continuously learn is extremely important to us and to the future of our organization. By listening to the unique perspectives of our employees we are better able to recognize and respond to the changing beauty needs of our global consumers.
Tell us about your leadership style.
I tend to lead by example. I really never ask people to do something that I’m not willing to do myself. I believe in setting a vision that reflects the Company’s market position and aspirations for future success. With a vision in place, we determine the results we want to generate 3, 5 and 10 years from now and we develop a strategy to get there. And then, we get to work. It’s a reverse engineering process versus a continuous improvement approach. We set the challenge at the beginning of the journey, and at the end, it’s important to acknowledge and thank everyone for what they’ve done to make it happen.
Why is luxury/prestige beauty a good business proposition?
Luxury cosmetics is a great industry, and it’s an exciting time to be a leader in this business. Prestige beauty is a large market — $100 billion and forecasted to grow by 4 to 5 percent in the next few years. And, it’s changing at a faster pace than ever before. We are witnessing a significant transformation in the world — much of which is led by women — and that is having an impact on the prestige beauty business. More women have joined the global workforce, and the growing 65+ population has more disposable income for use on luxury goods. And, with the rise of the millennial consumer, we’re seeing a revolution in where and how frequently women shop, requiring us to reimagine the retail experience.








How does the Company maintain relevance in a rapidly evolving global economy?
We recognize the diversity of the world we live in, and we understand the need to celebrate beauty, not standardize it. We create products, services and experiences that meet the specific needs of diverse consumers, and we aim to provide world class products that have local relevance in each market. To us, diversity is not a source of complexity but a gift of opportunity. With our multiple engines of growth across brands, demographics, geographies and channels, our capacity for creativity and innovation, and our ability to tailor products to meet the tastes of a highly diverse consumer base, I believe The Estée Lauder Companies is ideally positioned to succeed in this globalized, evolving world.

Describe what it is like to lead a company that has strong family leadership and family values.
I’ve worked for a number of global public companies — from mass to high-end luxury and prestige — and I can tell you that family businesses are the best. It’s a special advantage in the luxury space, because the authenticity and deep commitment to quality cannot be matched. Family companies are focused on and invest in the long term. They focus on the enduring success of the company. At our company, family values are embedded deeply in the culture. I feel privileged to serve as a nonfamily member CEO at The Estée Lauder Companies. Our success will always reflect the family’s passion, patience, obsession with quality, warmth, respect and commitment to be the best for generations to come.

Q&A



What is your definition of beauty?
My definition of beauty is the aspiration to be the best that you can be.
Why is the Company a good training ground for tomorrow’s business leaders?
This is an amazing company with amazing brands and, quite honestly, ground-up opportunities to learn all the disciplines of brand development and stewardship in a complex consumer marketplace. At a very early stage in your career, your exposure to the business and your impact can be measured directly. You can make a contribution early on.
What does a typical day look like for you?
A typical day is never typical. What I love most about working at Estée Lauder is the multitude of different things that I get to touch and the honor to be inspired and shape the development of brands.
You are revered inside and outside the industry as a brand builder. How do you foresee new trends and brands on the horizon?
The older you get, the more young people you need to have at your side. I have a personal technique, that wherever I go around the world, I go into my hotel room, I have a stack of local paparazzi magazines, fashion magazines, and I turn on the local music television. I then try to explore the world through a local person’s eyes, pay attention to all the cultural nuances, and get a feel for what the vibe is all about.
From your experience, where do good ideas come from?
The answer is always in the room. It’s my motto in business and in life. Whatever task or business challenge I’ve ever faced, the answer for the future lies a great deal in what has happened, in the present and the past. That’s my number one belief. The answer is always in the room.
Talk to us about your new role as head of the Company’s Center of Excellence for Creative?
I love and respect the creative process. Creativity is at the core of everything that we do. Great brands are created by great ideas and concepts. It’s my personal mission to nurture and respect this every day.

      Carl Haney on Innovating for the Future
       


Q&A



How do you describe your job to someone outside the company?
I have broad responsibilities to deliver innovation, creativity, product, packaging, and ideas to grow this company. The way I explain that to my children is that my job is to make people to look and feel beautiful, more confident, and empowered. And it’s not just about products. It’s about creating the future. My kids always want to know how my day was, and my son always asks: “Did you invent anything today?” That simple question is what matters to me.
What drew you to work for The Estée Lauder Companies?
I joined The Estée Lauder Companies to work on innovation, technology, creativity, ideas and imagination. The Company has a culture of strong family values and that culture also allows me and my team to be ourselves and work side by side with others on ideas.
What excites you about coming to work each day?
My days are unpredictable, which means they are exciting, fun and challenging. We are working on extraordinary things, managing almost incomprehensible complexity, but that doesn’t mean it needs to be complicated. I can get a lot of work done informally as well as in formal meetings. And finally, I just love the people I work for, the people I work with, and the teams that I help lead across a broad area.
Why is The Estée Lauder Companies a good training ground for tomorrow’s business leaders?
The diversity of experiences and opportunities makes this company a great training ground. Someone can be working on strategy one day, and then they’re working on a brand. You have someone in corporate innovation — who then works on the launch of a line of 120 products. Being able to tackle the most difficult problems in the industry and succeed at them, while adapting to change, is an exceptional experience.
What is the most inspiring aspect of the R&D world right now? Based on your experience, where does the best inspiration or innovation come from?
I define R&D very broadly, not only in terms of science and molecules. Personally, I’m inspired by our people — the people that work for me and the people I’m surrounded by. From an R&D perspective, I’m inspired by what is taking place in Silicon Valley, in Boston, in Tel Aviv, in London, in Korea.
What is your definition of beauty?
I think beauty is an attitude, a mindset. Beauty is powerful. It’s empowering, and it empowers. As a scientist at The Estée Lauder Companies, I work to deliver on the promise — to meet individual beauty needs — regardless of who you are, where you are or how old you are.

Leonard A. Lauder is Chairman Emeritus of The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. and is currently the senior member of its Board of Directors.
A graduate of the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, Mr. Lauder also studied at Columbia University’s Graduate School of Business and served as a lieutenant in the U.S. Navy.

Mr. Lauder consistently developed and implemented innovative sales and marketing programs and increased the Company’s sales and profits. He created its first research and development laboratory and brought in professional management on every level. He also initiated The Estée Lauder Companies’ international expansion, which began in 1960 with the opening of the Estée Lauder account at Harrods in London.
Mr. Lauder served as President of The Estée Lauder Companies from 1972 to 1995 and as Chief Executive Officer from 1982 to 1999. He added the title of Chairman in 1995 and served as Chairman through June 2009. Under his leadership, the Company launched many brands, including Aramis, Clinique, Lab Series and Origins.

In addition to his activities with The Estée Lauder Companies, Mr. Lauder is extremely involved in the worlds of education, art, politics and philanthropy.

The Lauder family received the esteemed 2011 Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy in recognition of its long-standing commitment to philanthropy and public service. Mr. Lauder was the 2013 recipient of the Palazzo Strozzi Renaissance Man of the Year Award. Most recently, he was named a 2014 Living Landmark by the New York Landmarks Conservancy.

They had two sons together, William (Executive Chairman, The Estée Lauder Companies) and Gary (Managing Partner, Lauder Partners LLC), and five grandchildren.
On January 1, 2015, Mr. Lauder married Judy Glickman Lauder, an internationally recognized philanthropist and photographer whose work is represented in more than 300 public and private collections including the J. Paul Getty Museum and the Whitney Museum of American Art.

              Chairman, Clinique Laboratories, LLC
            



Ronald S. Lauder is the younger son of Estée and Joseph Lauder and, like his brother, Leonard, learned the family business at the dinner table. He formally joined the company in 1964, beginning his career in the Oevel, Belgium factory. His executive roles began when he became General Manager of Clinique Laboratories in 1985, and he has served as Chairman since 1994. Mr. Lauder was instrumental in the creation of Prescriptives and served as Chairman of Estee Lauder International from 1992 to 2002. He also served as a member of The Estée Lauder Companies’ Board of Directors from 1968 to 1986 and 1988 to 2009. He was re-elected to the Board in November 2016.
In 1983, Mr. Lauder took a leave from The Estée Lauder Companies to serve in the U.S. Pentagon as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for European and NATO Affairs. In 1986, he was appointed Ambassador to Austria by President Ronald Reagan. Upon his return from Vienna in 1987, he established the Ronald S. Lauder Foundation, which now has 35 Jewish schools, kindergartens and summer camps throughout 15 countries in Eastern Europe. Over 7,500 children attend these schools today, and 2,500 children attend the summer camps. Over the years, the Foundation has educated more than 30,000 children in a region that was devoid of Jewish scholarship and has helped build thriving Jewish communities throughout this area. Mr. Lauder also created an International Student Exchange Program between Jewish high school students in New York and Vienna.
In addition to his international interests, Mr. Lauder has long been committed to civic causes and public policy issues at home. A political activist on the state and national level, he was a contender for Mayor of New York City in 1989.
In June 2007, Mr. Lauder was elected to lead the World Jewish Congress, and has served as the organization’s President ever since. In this capacity, Mr. Lauder meets with heads of countries, diplomats and religious leaders, representing Jewish communities in 100 countries around the world.
In February of 1999, Mr. Lauder was elected Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. His selection by the Conference followed his election in 1997 as President of the Jewish National Fund of which he now serves as Chairman.
Mr. Lauder also serves as Chairman of the International Public Committee of the World Jewish Restitution Organization; Chairman of the Auschwitz-Birkenau Foundation Committee; Chairman of the Jewish Heritage Council; Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Sakharov Archives at Brandeis University; Director of the International Board of Governors of the International Society for Yad Vashem; and is a member of the United States Holocaust Memorial Council, the Board of Directors of the Jewish Theological Seminary; the Board of Directors of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee; the Board of Trustees of the Anti-Defamation League Foundation; the International Auschwitz Council; and the International Board of Governors of the Tel Aviv Museum.

Q&A



What drew you to work for The Estée Lauder Companies?
I was drawn to the Company by its reputation and integrity, the quality of our people and products and the challenges and opportunities of a global public company. Also, the Breast Cancer Awareness Campaign resonated deeply with me. Evelyn Lauder’s commitment was, in many ways, the icing on the cake.
How would you describe the Company’s culture?
I think we have a unique and very special blend of family values and public company values. The culture here is very strong with regard to quality, high performance, collaboration, and caring about each other.
Work-life balance is an evergreen topic when it comes to women in the workplace. What is your philosophy on work-life balance and what is your best advice for women in the workplace today?
My best advice is to figure out what is important to you and align your work and life to make that happen. Structure your life to include work and personal time in a balance that is right for you. Every person is responsible for his or her own happiness and success.
What do you love most about your role at the Company?
I love when I work with a team to solve difficult problems. An enormous value that lawyers bring is to “connect the dots.” Being involved in so many aspects of the business enables me to see many of the dots, and to connect them in a way that can contribute to our success — that is fun for me.
Reflecting on your career, what are the most important lessons you have learned?
The most important lesson is to take risks. There were key moments in my career where I took risks, and those have led to the greatest jobs of my career. Take risks and go for it. The other important lesson — which is what I tell my children — is “what goes around comes around.” You earn a personal reputation, as a company does, based on the commitments that you’ve kept and your integrity. If you’ve done it the right way, that grows over time, as it should.

Q&A



How would you describe your talent philosophy?
My talent philosophy is centered on themes of transparency and fluidity. As we recruit talent, it’s critical to make it clear what the work is, and what our culture is all about. Once in the job, employees need to understand what is expected from them in their role, and which competency skills they need to develop to get to the next level — both from a technical and a leadership perspective. Finally, it is paramount to have a mechanism for movement of talent across brands and geographies, to facilitate the building of experiences. At The Estée Lauder Companies we are creating talent road maps that are not your traditional pyramids. There are many side roads vs. straight roads — which is more like tech or start-up companies.
What are the unexpected benefits of working here?
This company is very collaborative and inclusive, with a high level of in-house creativity. We have the left brain and the right brain; the linear and the nonlinear. We’re a collection of people with different backgrounds and different experiences. And, as some brands are growing by 20 percent to 30 percent a year, we are not in a steady state, like you’ll find with traditional consumer brands.
Another unexpected benefit is the high level of focus on ongoing learning and education at the Company, which stems from time-honored commitments from Leonard A. Lauder and William P. Lauder. The Lauder family values permeate the organization and, as a result, there is a huge amount of heart within the Company. This is evident in our philanthropic efforts and beyond. People care about each other.
Why is the Company a good training ground for tomorrow’s business leaders?
Anyone coming into this organization will be exposed to a multitude of global issues, from geographic expansion to channel differentiation, from new acquisition of brands to exponential growth of current brands. Based on the way the organization is growing and developing, business leaders are going to find themselves in situations they’ve never been in before. Even very seasoned leaders will see things in ways they haven’t seen before. Fundamental changes in our business are demanding that our people relearn and develop new competencies in areas like digital marketing and online sales and in the operation of freestanding retail stores. The on-the-job training component for us is huge.
What is the most meaningful or inspiring aspect of your role?
By virtue of leading people and through the creation of certain policies and processes, I can make the work around here a little better, more interesting, more meaningful. It’s not just about getting people paid or providing health benefits. In my role you have the ability to help people find purpose in their work. It’s exciting to implement impactful training programs that help develop great leaders, to create incentive plans that recognize and reward great performance. In many ways, I control quite a few of these levers.
What is your definition of beauty?
It’s not about the aesthetic; it’s about how it makes you feel. Through our products we sell a bit of a dream, a little guilty pleasure, a bit of “me” time.

Q&A



What drew you to work for The Estée Lauder Companies?
The Company was growing really well and pretty consistently, and the industry was growing. It had a marvelous portfolio of brands. In talking to people, it became clear that there was a huge amount of passion for the business, for the family, for what made this company great. And while the Company had a strong and celebrated past, it was investing in new capabilities while looking to transform itself into a truly global company. Having worked in global businesses before, I thought I could help with that.
What excites you the most about coming to work every day?
The fact that you’ll be challenged — but you’re not by yourself. I’m excited to work at a company that has values you can feel. A lot of companies talk about inclusion and diversity; we just do it. Almost everyone I’ve met in our company has their whole heart and soul and mind into doing what’s right for our business. And I think that’s super exciting.
What are the unexpected benefits of working here?
I probably have more colleagues I would call friends than I would have elsewhere. I’d have to say an unexpected benefit is the amount of growth you will experience. Also, realizing how big the opportunity for our business actually is — the possibility to be in a growth company, in a growth industry, with a strong commitment to innovation — that’s exciting.
How would you describe the Company's culture?
The culture is collaborative. People are really willing to help each other. They are compassionate. We are steeped in family values, and we celebrate the involvement and the engagement of each member of the family. This is a business with a soul. And I think there’s nothing better. A company can have great financial results and great brands — all of that is necessary. But to get there, you need a soul. And I think that differentiates us from many other businesses.
What is your definition of beauty?
Beauty is something that gives pleasure to your mind. It’s a feeling. It touches your senses. It is truly in the eye of the beholder. If it’s personal beauty, I think it’s really about total well-being — a feel, a look.

Q&A



What is your definition of beauty?
We recognize beauty whenever our senses receive a stimulus that fills us with awe or joy. It could be a beautiful piece of art or a moment in nature. Although in this case I think it’s important to say that usually it’s more than skin-deep. It’s more about the soul of the person.
What drew you to work for the Company?
I only switched companies once in my career. I joined Estée Lauder about 22 years ago. I was really attracted by the superb reputation, the singularity of purpose and the total focus on prestige, and the fact that there is no compromise.
Tell us about your first day working at The Estée Lauder Companies. 
I started with the Company in 1994 in Singapore. At the time there was a lot of anxiety around the handover of Hong Kong to China. On my first day we had transferred the entire office from Hong Kong to Singapore, so we were very few people. We started completely from scratch. It was a new chapter. I remember plugging in the printer and the equipment in the office. It felt like we were at the beginning of an adventure. It was great.
What does a typical day look like for you?
There is no such thing, and I love it.
How often do you travel and where to the most?
Because I’m leading the international division, it really takes me around the world, probably 50 percent of the time. I try to spend more time in emerging markets because I firmly believe the fast emerging middle class around the world is going to be a key driver of the Company’s future growth.
Talk to us about your most significant accomplishment, personal or professional.
On the personal side I’m very proud of my family — my wife and my two boys. I consider my boys true citizens of the world because they were born in Hong Kong, then moved to Singapore, then New York and Japan, and back to New York. They keep me motivated and honest every day. On the professional side, I’m very proud of our international accomplishments, particularly in the area of emerging markets.

Q&A



What excites you about coming to work at The Estée Lauder Companies every day?
The people I work with. The Company has a unique culture. The people that I have the pleasure of working with are so knowledgeable about their areas of responsibility. They are so caring about the Company, and the business, and each other. We can disagree and debate, yet we recognize at the end of the day we’re all working toward the common goal of seeing this company be as exceptional as it is, and can be in the future. That brings a certain level of camaraderie that I haven’t seen in many other places.
What drew you to work for The Estée Lauder Companies?
I would say the culture, the talent, and the brand portfolio. I had been in apparel and retail for 12 years before I joined, and 10 years at Pepsi prior to that. I initially wasn’t that focused on the beauty industry, but when I saw the brand portfolio, understood how global the Company was, and met Leonard, William and Fabrizio, I became very interested in the Company. Once I learned that I would have the ability to partner with an amazing leadership team to continue to accelerate growth at a very pivotal time for the Company, I knew that it was an opportunity that I couldn’t pass up.
Why is the Company a good training ground for tomorrow’s business leaders?
First of all, with prestige beauty, we are fortunate to be part of one of the best consumer product segments that exists. At the Company, we offer the opportunity to work within multiple brands or multiple regions. Between the geographic breadth and the channel diversification of the Company, there are so many different, interesting career paths you can have here.
What was the best professional advice you ever received?
Early in my career I worked for an individual who was a great mentor to young talent. He was a very demanding person to work for but great at grooming talent. He used to say: “Don’t be afraid to fail.” This is classic and cliché, but it resonated for me. Basically he was saying you are very talented and highly competent. You can achieve anything you dedicate yourself to do. But while most things will work out well, some things will not. If you don’t take risks and try, you’ll never be able to reach your potential. I’ve been fortunate in my career to have a number of wise people share with me the benefit of their experiences, but this was the one that really stood out for me.
What do you see as the most exciting opportunities in the global luxury sector today?
Emerging markets are a big opportunity for us to reach a whole different consumer group. It's exciting to watch emerging market consumers transition into more of a middle class — as it’s defined for that particular market — and being able to aspire to luxury brands. More broadly, the digital landscape is a dynamic frontier for the global luxury sector. The idea that you can access luxury wherever and whenever you want, whether or not there’s a luxury store in your neighborhood, is quite exciting for luxury. It tests the strength of your brand.

Q&A



What is your definition of beauty?
Beauty comes from within. When you look in the mirror and you love what you see, that confidence feeds how you feel internally and radiates into the world.
What drew you to work for The Estée Lauder Companies?
I was in the financial services industry and was ready for a change. I wanted to stretch myself and try something really new. I have always loved beauty, and I have long admired the Lauder family. I was excited about the opportunity to work for a publicly traded family company — a unique combination with so many facets to consider. The family is very active in the Company. They are the creators and the standard-bearers of our values. We also have amazing people across all of our brands, regions and functions. That was a big draw for me.
What are the unexpected benefits of working here?
Besides having an unlimited supply of fabulous lipsticks, I would have to say it is the relationships that I have made with the people I work with. I feel so incredibly blessed to have a fantastic team that I get to work with every day. We are a very flat team in terms of hierarchy and are very interactive. To be able to be a player-coach, where I am rolling up my sleeves alongside the team at all levels, is a great way to get the best ideas and different perspectives. It teaches me so much. I feel like I learn more working with my team on any given day than I have in a month in a past life.
How would you describe the Company's culture?
The Lauder family values are truly at the center of what makes this company exceptional. I think we all, in our own way, ask ourselves every day when we’re making a decision, or creating a strategy, What would Leonard Lauder think of this? What would Estée think? The people here are so incredibly smart. The business acumen that is woven into the culture is tremendous. In a nutshell, I would describe the culture as warm, caring, competitive and absolutely focused on delivering the highest quality product.
Can you share an example of creativity in action at The Estée Lauder Companies?
I think the best example is how we are leading in the world of digital communications. We are engaging our consumers and all of our stakeholders through channels that didn’t exist even a year ago. Being nimble and agile and able to pivot quickly — and to engage in the most high-quality, beautiful way — is something that we are all incredibly proud of. It demands a huge amount of creativity, because our messages have to be compelling and our aesthetics have to be of the highest standards. And I think we see that executed each and every day with our brands across social media.
What was the best professional advice you ever received?
Listen, listen, listen, and listen some more. Second, there is nothing more important than building and nurturing your relationships. I still keep in touch with my mentor and one of my dearest friends from when I was just starting out more than 25 years ago. The third thing I would say is, “Ask for what you want.” You would be surprised how receptive people are and, frankly, how grateful they are when you are clear about what you want. Whether it is asking for your next assignment, or if there is a different part of the world you want to work in, you have to make that known. You are the master of your own professional destiny.

Q&A



What is your definition of beauty?
My definition of beauty is the aspiration to be the best that you can be.
Why is the Company a good training ground for tomorrow’s business leaders?
This is an amazing company with amazing brands and, quite honestly, ground-up opportunities to learn all the disciplines of brand development and stewardship in a complex consumer marketplace. At a very early stage in your career, your exposure to the business and your impact can be measured directly. You can make a contribution early on.
What does a typical day look like for you?
A typical day is never typical. What I love most about working at Estée Lauder is the multitude of different things that I get to touch and the honor to be inspired and shape the development of brands.
You are revered inside and outside the industry as a brand builder. How do you foresee new trends and brands on the horizon?
The older you get, the more young people you need to have at your side. I have a personal technique, that wherever I go around the world, I go into my hotel room, I have a stack of local paparazzi magazines, fashion magazines, and I turn on the local music television. I then try to explore the world through a local person’s eyes, pay attention to all the cultural nuances, and get a feel for what the vibe is all about.
From your experience, where do good ideas come from?
The answer is always in the room. It’s my motto in business and in life. Whatever task or business challenge I’ve ever faced, the answer for the future lies a great deal in what has happened, in the present and the past. That’s my number one belief. The answer is always in the room.
Talk to us about your new role as head of the Company’s Center of Excellence for Creative?
I love and respect the creative process. Creativity is at the core of everything that we do. Great brands are created by great ideas and concepts. It’s my personal mission to nurture and respect this every day.

Q&A



What is your definition of beauty?
Beauty is happiness.
What drew you to work for The Estée Lauder Companies?
I was drawn to work for the Company because it was founded by a woman, Mrs. Estée Lauder. I felt this would be an extraordinary place for me, for a woman, to build my career. And it proved to be true. I love what I do, and I feel extraordinarily fulfilled by my work. I’m growing and learning every day. It’s an honor to work on such extraordinary prestige brands with the most amazing, creative and talented people in the industry.
Why is the Company a good training ground for tomorrow’s business leaders?
We are a company that recognizes people’s talents. As a learning organization, you have the ability to try new things all the time. We have one of the most extraordinary and diverse portfolios of prestige brands, and our employees have the ability to move between brands or within functions, or to move within regions to get the best business education you possibly can while building your career. It’s also a compelling culture — an incredible combination of a warm family company with the discipline and performance metrics of one of the most successful companies in this industry. All told, I think that makes us a fantastic training ground.
What was the best professional advice you ever received?
Leonard Lauder told me to always hire people who are smarter than you are.
What does a typical day look like for you?
You never know what time it is, and you’re never bored. Stimulating meetings. The breadth of topics and issues that are covered and discussed throughout a day is enormous. We work hard morning until night, but I will tell you it’s always exciting, always creative, always fun, always inspiring.
From your experience, where do good ideas come from?
From my experience, good ideas come from anywhere. We have a philosophy in this company about leadership from every chair, from the most junior to the most senior people, from every department. Great ideas come from everywhere. The key is to always be open to listening and learning from new people.

Q&A



What is your definition of beauty?
We recognize beauty whenever our senses receive a stimulus that fills us with awe or joy. It could be a beautiful piece of art or a moment in nature. Although in this case I think it’s important to say that usually it’s more than skin-deep. It’s more about the soul of the person.
What drew you to work for the Company?
I only switched companies once in my career. I joined Estée Lauder about 22 years ago. I was really attracted by the superb reputation, the singularity of purpose and the total focus on prestige, and the fact that there is no compromise.
Tell us about your first day working at The Estée Lauder Companies. 
I started with the Company in 1994 in Singapore. At the time there was a lot of anxiety around the handover of Hong Kong to China. On my first day we had transferred the entire office from Hong Kong to Singapore, so we were very few people. We started completely from scratch. It was a new chapter. I remember plugging in the printer and the equipment in the office. It felt like we were at the beginning of an adventure. It was great.
What does a typical day look like for you?
There is no such thing, and I love it.
How often do you travel and where to the most?
Because I’m leading the international division, it really takes me around the world, probably 50 percent of the time. I try to spend more time in emerging markets because I firmly believe the fast emerging middle class around the world is going to be a key driver of the Company’s future growth.
Talk to us about your most significant accomplishment, personal or professional.
On the personal side I’m very proud of my family — my wife and my two boys. I consider my boys true citizens of the world because they were born in Hong Kong, then moved to Singapore, then New York and Japan, and back to New York. They keep me motivated and honest every day. On the professional side, I’m very proud of our international accomplishments, particularly in the area of emerging markets.

              Chairman, Clinique Laboratories, LLC
            



Ronald S. Lauder is the younger son of Estée and Joseph Lauder and, like his brother, Leonard, learned the family business at the dinner table. He formally joined the company in 1964, beginning his career in the Oevel, Belgium factory. His executive roles began when he became General Manager of Clinique Laboratories in 1985, and he has served as Chairman since 1994. Mr. Lauder was instrumental in the creation of Prescriptives and served as Chairman of Estee Lauder International from 1992 to 2002. He also served as a member of The Estée Lauder Companies’ Board of Directors from 1968 to 1986 and 1988 to 2009. He was re-elected to the Board in November 2016. 
In 1983, Mr. Lauder took a leave from The Estée Lauder Companies to serve in the U.S. Pentagon as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for European and NATO Affairs. In 1986, he was appointed Ambassador to Austria by President Ronald Reagan. Upon his return from Vienna in 1987, he established the Ronald S. Lauder Foundation, which now has 35 Jewish schools, kindergartens and summer camps throughout 15 countries in Eastern Europe. Over 7,500 children attend these schools today, and 2,500 children attend the summer camps. Over the years, the Foundation has educated more than 30,000 children in a region that was devoid of Jewish scholarship and has helped build thriving Jewish communities throughout this area. Mr. Lauder also created an International Student Exchange Program between Jewish high school students in New York and Vienna. 
In addition to his international interests, Mr. Lauder has long been committed to civic causes and public policy issues at home. A political activist on the state and national level, he was a contender for Mayor of New York City in 1989.
In June 2007, Mr. Lauder was elected to lead the World Jewish Congress, and has served as the organization’s President ever since. In this capacity, Mr. Lauder meets with heads of countries, diplomats and religious leaders, representing Jewish communities in 100 countries around the world.

A renowned art collector, Mr. Lauder has established one of the world’s greatest private collections. He was Chairman of the Museum of Modern Art from 1995 to 2005 and now serves as the museum’s Honorary Chairman. In 2001, he established the Neue Galerie New York, of which he is President. The museum is dedicated to German and Austrian art. Mr. Lauder established the Commission for Art Recovery in 1997, which advocates and fights for the recovery of Nazi looted art.

Q&A










What excites you about coming to work each day?
First and foremost, it’s the people who work here — their commitment to our brands is palpable and energizing. It’s the intellectual challenge. It’s the competition. It’s the excitement of doing great for our consumers — helping people feel better about themselves, helping them unlock their own beauty.








Why is continuous learning important at The Estée Lauder Companies?
Learning is an integral part of our culture. We continuously ask ourselves: Is what we’re doing today going to be relevant to the consumer in the future? We insist that our leaders never stop exploring new ideas, and we expect that mind-set to trickle down throughout the company. We want employees to feel like they have permission to push the envelope and think differently, because we have to constantly reinvent ourselves. Ultimately no one individual has a monopoly on insight and brilliance. Innovation comes from every chair.
You’ve been championing the Company’s online/digital efforts from their inception. What were some of the smartest decisions the Company made in this arena?
When we turned on our first e-commerce site in 1996, it was controversial because our retail partners perceived it as a threat to their business. We understand now that our online presence enhances our overall business. The multichannel consumer is a far more valuable customer who spends more on our brands than the consumer who shops exclusively online or in store. The highest click rates on our websites are for the store locators. Many consumers still want to know where they can see, touch, feel and smell the product before they buy it.
What core capabilities will future leaders need to take the business to the next level of growth?
The technical skills companies need will almost certainly change, but the core capabilities needed for effective leadership — curiosity, adaptability, communication, imagination — will be the same. Leaders have to be bold and have the courage to try something new. This applies to their careers and to the business itself. I encourage young leaders to live in another country or region, to experience another culture — which pushes you to explore and learn.








What’s different about leading a family company versus a nonfamily company?
Leading a family company and being a member of that family is both a pressure and a privilege. In many ways, the stakes are higher in a family company because your name is on the door and you can’t just walk away if things go south. You are the keeper of the culture — it’s your responsibility to honor and respect the past without letting it hold the company back from its future potential. At the same time, there is a real advantage to leading a company that is focused on longevity and on generating long-term value. We practice what I call “patient capitalism” — we have a higher tolerance for long-term investments that yield greater returns 5, 10, 15 years into the future.

We practice what I call “patient capitalism” — we have a higher tolerance for long-term investments that yield greater returns 5, 10, 15 years into the future.








How do you maintain a family culture in such a large, spread out company?
Our definition of family goes beyond the family name — it is broader and more inclusive. It involves a sense of belonging. It’s about those human touches we put into our company that maintain an ethos that makes people feel they are welcome — because they are. We try to maintain a warmth and friendliness that is, hopefully, part of what most families are like, which makes everybody feel they’re a part of the family in one way, shape or form. It’s becoming a lost definition of family, but it still works for us.
What do you hope to accomplish by the end of your career? What do you want your leadership legacy to be?
The most important thing I want to do is to help set our company on a course for sustainable excellence and leadership in our sector that will last for many generations beyond the influence I might have as an individual. I hope that through the executives whose careers we’ve nurtured our company will continue to adapt and thrive while maintaining the value systems that have allowed us to get to where we are today — and those values endure for many generations to come.
What is your definition of beauty?
My definition of beauty is the tremendous diversity we have inside of our company. Diversity of our people, diversity of our brands, the diversity of our consumers and the diversity of their definition of beauty is what connects us all together with all of our brands.

About Peer Rating
Martindale-Hubbell® Peer Review Ratings™ are the gold standard in attorney ratings, and have been for more than a century. These ratings indicate attorneys who are widely respected by their peers for their ethical standards and legal expertise in a specific area of practice.


The Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings process is the gold standard due to its objectivity and comprehensiveness. Lawyers solicited for peer reviews include both those selected by the attorney being reviewed and lawyers independently selected by Martindale-Hubbell. All reviewers are verified as attorneys through Martindale-Hubbell's extensive attorney database. Only attorneys practicing at least three years and receiving a sufficient number of reviews from non-affiliated attorneys are eligible to receive a Rating.
What are the different Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings?
AV Preeminent®: The highest peer rating standard. This rating signifies that a large number of the lawyer's peers rank him or her at the highest level of professional excellence for their legal knowledge, communication skills and ethical standards.
Distinguished: An excellent rating for a lawyer with some experience. This rating indicates the attorney is widely respected by their peers for high professional achievement and ethical standards.
Notable: This rating indicates that the lawyer has been recognized by a large number of their peers for strong ethical standards.
Lawyers who have received peer reviews after 2009 will display more detailed information, including practice areas, summary ratings, detailed numeric ratings and written feedback (if available). Details for individual reviews received before 2009 are not displayed.
Attorneys that receive reviews from their peers, but not a sufficient number to establish a Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating, will have those reviews display on our websites.

About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.

Attorneys that receive reviews from their peers, but not a sufficient number to establish a Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating, will have those reviews display on our websites.
For more information on Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings™, please visit our Ratings Page on Martindale.com and our Frequently Asked Questions

Client Reviews 


About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.
For more information on Martindale-Hubbell Client Review Ratings, please visit our Client Review Page.

Disclaimer


No representation is made that the quality of legal services to be performed is greater than the quality of legal services performed by other lawyers. Testimonials or endorsements in any review do not constitute a guarantee, warranty, or prediction regarding the outcome of your legal matter. Past results are not a guarantee of any future results as each case must be decided on its own merits. Client Review Ratings and/or Peer Review Ratings may not be available for all firms and/or lawyers and the fact that a firm or lawyer has not been reviewed should not be construed as unfavorable.
