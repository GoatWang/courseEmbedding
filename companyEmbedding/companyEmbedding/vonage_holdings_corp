THE VONAGE ADVANTAGE 


QUALITY OF SERVICE 






		Share
	




























Quality of Service














As businesses increase the usage of video, online collaboration tools, and other cloud applications, maintaining the quality of shared bandwidth becomes vital.


Sanjay Srinivasan, Vonage Vice President and Chief Technology Architect, Business Engineering








		When we say Business Grade, we mean it. Our robust, cloud-based, plug-and-play Essentials service is the right solution for many businesses. And when organizations need elevated quality of service, there’s also Vonage Premier. With Premier, you'll also have access to our private MPLS network and our SD-WAN solutions specific to UCaaS. It's perfect when your organization demands greater bandwidth and higher-quality voice and video.
	
















    Fully managed, end-to-end Vonage® Premier service.
  

    The Vonage Network Operations Center runs 24/7/365, managing our vast and diverse high-quality voice and data networks and connecting billions of calls each year. With multi-level fail-safes and powerful cloud backup, we maximize uptime and minimize call drops, data loss, and static. In fact,  when you’re a Premier customer using our MPLS network or SD-WAN solution, we often fix issues before you know they occur.
  



    Cloud-hosted and constantly updating.
  

    Cloud hosting is part of great quality of service for both our Essentials and Premier platform products. Because our system is hosted via data centers around the country, and not at your business site, enhancements and upgrades are quick and easy. Plus there’s no extra cost or maintenance scheduling. And since we’re constantly updating our technology, you always have the most up-to-date phone system.
  





















 Key Benefits 

Nationwide coverage for quality, disaster recovery & business continuity, diversity, etc.
Redundant Ring Architecture
National IP Routing Fabric
Multiple Access Options-Ethernet, Dsi, T1, DS3, OCN
Multi-site MPLS VPN
End-to-End Quality of Service (QOS)
2 Domestic 24x7 NOC's with proactive monitoring and support



 Nationwide MPLS Network 

 

















    Vonage Premier’s Resilient MPLS backbone with 20+ POPS.
  

    With 20+ points of presence (POPs), Vonage’s private, MPLS-based IP network stands up to the best in the industry. Our virtual computing platform is built on an advanced, highly distributed software architecture that provides both high performance and massive scale-out capabilities. Its fully redundant ring architecture runs on best-in-class hardware to maximize affordability. Plus, we partner with top technology providers to deploy one of the most robust platforms in the industry.
  



    Add network intelligence to any connection.
  

    As pioneers in creating SD-WAN for UCaaS, and robust Bring Your Own Broadband solutions, we’ve paved the way for reliable, elevated quality of service on any network, even over existing broadband service.  Expect optimized application performance at a reduced cost. We even have hybrid WAN solutions that still allow simplified deployment and reduced costs.
  





















    Higher-quality audio from Vonage Premier. Yes, you heard right.
  

    Making and receiving phone calls is at the heart of business communications. And from day one we’ve been dedicated to providing high-fidelity calling. As our audio capabilities expand from robust conference services to mobile phone integration, we continue to deliver solutions around high-quality audio that’s intuitive to use and works when you need it.
  



    Our HD video plays videos, not static.
  

    We optimize our Premier network solutions to provide solutions across all our high-quality  voice, video, and data offerings. That means congestion prevention so contact centers can handle volume spikes with ease. Or bandwidth prioritization so real-time applications like HD video conferencing don’t lag or cut out.
  





















    Premier network quality and encryption.
  

    Encrypt traffic in a mix of cloud and MPLS deployment with a hybrid VPN. This zero-touch, enterprise-class solution provides you with optimized connectivity to your Vonage services.
  



    Firewall optimization.
  

    Functional Application Layer Firewalls work with our SD-WAN solutions allowing your business to replace both personal firewalls and routers with one intuitive service.
  





















    Smarter bandwidth. Premier quality.
  

    Our network solutions are built to help maximize your bandwidth. We carve out dedicated pieces and create different buckets to optimize performance for your high-quality voice, video, data and more, giving you a smoother overall experience.
  



    SD-WAN voice, data, and video traffic prioritization.
  

    Smart QoS controls with our Premier SD-WAN solution give real-time applications including high quality voice and video a higher priority.  As a result, your network avoids unnecessary congestion while maximizing uptime for your business-critical applications.
  













                    OUR BUSINESS COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS
                

                    Business grade. People friendly.™


                    From a cloud hosted phone system on your current broadband to a unified communications solution on a dedicated network, we can build custom communications for every business and every budget.

Award-Winning Business Phone System – Without Contracts!
Empower your business phone system with a new VoIP solution!






 Low Cost, Low Overhead
Our Vonage business VoIP solution is delivered over the Internet and is hosted in the cloud. So forget the closetful of wires in the office and the expensive service calls. Our customers save at least 36% over traditional carriers month over month* – proof that the best business phone systems don’t have to be the most expensive.
**Savings claim is based on the average monthly recurring charge for unlimited domestic business calling plans from the top three leading wireline service providers. Comparison excludes promotional pricing, fees, surcharges or taxes and assumes a customer already has broadband service. Check your phone bill to determine the savings that would apply to you.

 Business-Class Features
With over 40 calling features built in, our business telephone system delivers productivity with Virtual Receptionist, Dynamic Caller ID, Mobile Apps, Desktop Plugins, Voicemail to Email and more. You can also enhance your communications with low-cost premium features – such as Call Conference, Call Recording, Call Monitoring, Call Queues, Virtual Fax and CRM integration tools.
 Easy Setup & Support
All business phone systems are not created equal. Setting up our system is quick and easy, and our VoIP-compatible phones arrive pre-configured to work on the system and ready to plug in. You can manage the phone system from your desktop through a user-friendly admin portal. If you ever need assistance, you have access to online learning resources and extensive training, and our experienced customer and tech support teams are there when you need them.

Still have questions? We're here to help.
See Our Top FAQs 




1

How is Vonage® different from my landlines phone service?
One big difference is that Vonage works over the Internet. You get everything you’d expect from a landline, plus the ability to take your home phone plan with you on your mobile—even make and receive home phone calls on up to two smartphones when you download our Vonage Extensions® app.





2

What type of internet connection do I need? And is it included?
Vonage works with any high-speed Internet connection (like DSL or cable). We’re not an Internet Service Provider, so you’ll need to have your own broadband Internet service in place to use Vonage.





3

Can I keep my current phone number?
Yes. In most cases you can keep your current phone number. You’ll be able to check if your number can be transferred using the Keep Your Phone Number tool found in the tools module near the bottom of every plan page. If your number is transferable, we’ll help you bring it over to Vonage. And because transfers usually take about 7-10 business days, we’ll give you a temporary phone number so you can start using your Vonage service right away.

30-Day Money-Back Guarantee


SEE MORE

Get peace of mind with our 30-Day Money-Back Guarantee offer!
We offer a 30-day Money Back Guarantee ("MBG") if you terminate your service within 30 days from the date of your order. Your Order Date is the date you order service or the date we successfully process your payment, whichever is later. The MBG applies to the first line only and covers the monthly charge, taxes and any shipping or activation fees. Additional lines are not eligible.
Our MBG does not cover any charges for international calls or usage outside of your service plan, calls to Vonage toll free numbers, any monthly charge for Extensions™ and features or services not expressly included in your monthly plan fee. In addition, not all of the taxes that you paid may be refundable.
If you purchased your adapter from a retail provider, you can return your adapter only to that retailer pursuant to their return policy. Vonage does not refund the price of adapters purchased from retail providers under its Money Back Guarantee.














Roy C.



I would say I am a tech savvy person, an early adopter, I guess you would call it. I started an Internet–based company in the 1990s and was drawn to the technology that Vonage seemed to pioneer. And being in the technology industry, I’ve always thought technology is most effective when you don’t even know it’s there. What I like best about Vonage is that I don’t even think about it anymore. I don’t worry about the quality. I don’t worry about the call. I don’t worry about the price. As our lives get more complicated, we need these things that we don’t have to think about, and Vonage has become that for me.









Nick P.



I have had to use Vonage to call throughout the entire U.S. Just about every state I have had to make a phone call to or receive a call from, because of my job. But I still want to keep my mobile phone number private, which was difficult before Vonage came along. But now with Vonage, I am free to conduct my business and still can keep my phone number protected.









Jose O.



I am originally from Lima, Peru, but my mom and I have been in the U.S. over 25 years.  My sister is still there and my mom has lots of friends and family still in Peru. My mom was spending a lot of money on calling cards until I told her there is this app from Vonage, and you can have it in your phone. So I put the Extensions app on her phone, and she is saving a lot this way. I also have Extensions on my mobile phone, when I travel abroad.   My sister also sent her kids to school in the U.S., and she was spending a lot of money calling them. So, I sent her a Vonage Box, and she was able to keep in touch with them, which has made her very happy.









Vincent F.



When we moved, my wife and I knew we had to switch phone services. We discussed getting a new number, but it’s very inconvenient. You have to notify everyone—and not everyone is going to receive the notification. So when we switched to Vonage, they let us keep our number. And lo and behold, a couple years after moving, I got a phone call from an old high-school buddy. We were on the wrestling team together. He calls me only every 10 or 15 years. If we had changed our number, I may not have gotten that phone call.









Vikram S.



I came to the U.S. a few years ago for a career opportunity and moved seven or eight times since then—Virginia, Massachusetts, New York, and finally New Jersey. We had to keep updating our family in India with a new number every time we moved. Then I signed up for Vonage and got to keep my number. I have been with Vonage for more than seven years, and it’s been primarily because of how easy it is to take my number and my service with me when I move.












Tools to help you decide

Keep Your Phone Number
Do you want to keep your current phone number?
Let’s check if your current phone number can be used for your new Vonage service.
 



Good News!
We will be able to transfer the phone number to your new Vonage service. SAVE THIS NUMBER TRY ANOTHER NUMBER

Success! We can transfer  to your new Vonage service.
Please note this important information concerning number transfer:-

Do not contact your phone company/carrier to disconnect your local telephone service.
Your telephone number must be active with your old phone company for us to transfer your number to Vonage. 
You will need to authorize the transfer of your number later in the order process.
Transferring a number may take up to 10 business days to complete.
During the transfer period, your current phone line will continue to operate normally. You can install and use your Vonage service as soon as you receive your adapter.
While you're waiting on the number transfer, you can still take advantage of all the great features Vonage has to offer.




Sorry!
 can't be used for your new Vonage service.TRY ANOTHER NUMBER
You also have the option to choose a new Vonage phone number rather than porting an existing number.

FAQs
Learn more about Vonage






How is Vonage® different from my landline phone service?






One big difference is that Vonage works over the Internet. You get everything you’d expect from a landline, plus the ability to take your home phone plan with you on your mobile—even make and receive home phone calls on up to two smartphones when you download our Vonage Extensions® app.







What type of Internet connection do I need? And is it included?






Vonage works with any high-speed Internet connection (like DSL or cable). We’re not an Internet Service Provider, so you’ll need to have your own broadband Internet service in place to use Vonage.







Can I keep my current phone number?






Yes. In most cases you can keep your current phone number. You’ll be able to check if your number can be transferred using the Keep Your Phone Number tool found in the tools module near the bottom of every plan page. If your number is transferable, we’ll help you bring it over to Vonage. And because transfers usually take about 7-10 business days, we’ll give you a temporary phone number so you can start using your Vonage service right away.







Do I need an existing phone number?






No. If you don't have an existing phone number, or don't want to transfer your current one, we’ll be happy to give you a new number when you sign up. You can even choose from available area codes and select the phone number you like best.







Will I still receive calls if my power or Internet service goes out?






Yes. Just set up your Network Availability Number when you sign up, and during an outage, all calls are forwarded to the landline or cell number you provided.

I signed up with Vocalocity 8 months ago and since the first day of activating my phones they have not worked.  There is always an issue, and vocalocity never takes responsibility for it.  The employees there have no idea what they are doing and avoid you when you call/email them.

I have lost thousands upon thousands of dollars in business because clients are not able to get through to us and Vocalocity says they are not responsible.

This coompany should not be in business because they honestly have no idea what they are doing.  

Please please please reconsider before signing with this company, you will be sorry and you will not have a reliable phone service.

Vonage /vɑːnɪdʒ/ is a publicly held Internet telephony service provider, providing business and residential telecommunication services based on voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). The company was founded in 2001 and is headquartered in Holmdel Township, New Jersey.
As of 2014, Vonage reported approximately 2.5 million subscriber lines, in conjunction with mobile application services.[2] Through a series of recent acquisitions, Vonage, previously a consumer-focused service provider, expanded its presence in the business marketplace.[3][4][5]

History[edit]
The company was originally called Min-X.com and was based in Melville, New York.[6] Jeffrey Citron, former CEO and majority shareholder at DatekOnline, was the first major investor in the early development stages. In October 2000, Citron invested $1 million as seed capital.[7]
The name was changed to Vonage In December 2000, and in January 2001, Vonage incorporated and moved to Edison, New Jersey.[8]
The company first offered subscription service in the United States, then Canada in 2004 and the United Kingdom in 2005. Vonage went public on May 24, 2006.[9]
In 2005, it relocated its headquarters to Holmdel, New Jersey.[10]
Restructuring efforts[edit]
In 2006, in preparation for an initial public stock offering (IPO), Michael Snyder, former president of ADT Security Services replaced Vonage co-founder Jeffrey A. Citron as CEO.[11] Citron could not preside over the IPO, because he was permanently barred from associating with any securities brokers or dealers.[12][13][14][15] In 2007, in an apparent restructuring effort to reduce ongoing net losses in the face of double-digit stock price slips and patent infringement issues, Snyder resigned, and Citron returned as Interim CEO.[16] The company announced plans for 10% (180) layoffs, as it secured $215 million in financing.[17]
In the second quarter of 2010, with a change in management and improved sales, the company’s stock price increased,[18] and on June 15, 2010, Vonage rose 17.06 percent, $0.36 to $2.47.[19]
As part of its restructuring effort in 2010, Vonage paid off $41 million of its debt at par, negotiated the release of more than $40 million in cash from vendors and announced a comprehensive refinancing. This resulted in a $200 million, pre-payable term loan with interest rates at 9.75%. Vonage planned to get better terms by paying down debt ahead of schedule, and by achieving sustained financial performance. Between March and June 2011, Vonage prepaid $70 million, reducing the balance to $130 million, the year-end 2011 target.[20]
Initial public offering[edit]
Vonage offered shares of its stock to its existing customer base in the period before the initial public offering (IPO).[21] Typically, only large institutional investors such as banks are able to buy shares of an IPO.[22] Vonage’s initial public offering occurred on the New York Stock Exchange on May 24, 2006, opening at $17.00 per share.[9] The price closed at $14.85, a decrease of 12.7 percent, the worst trading day for any IPO in 2006 up to that point. The IPO raised $531 million for the company. However, the existing customers who lost money filed a class-action lawsuit.[23] The IPO and its immediate aftermath also earned Vonage a “Business 2.0 Magazine” award as 14th of 101 “Dumbest Moments in Business for 2006”.[24] In 2009, Vonage reached an agreement with IPO investors. All shareholder claims against Vonage and its individual directors and officers who were named as defendants were dismissed.[25][26] The amount of the settlement, $3.6 million, was paid by an insurance policy covering the directors and officers of the company.[27][28][29]
The firms underwriting the IPO, Citigroup, UBS, and Deutsche Bank, were fined a total of $845,000 and ordered to reimburse customers for "failure to adequately supervise communications" with investors.[30] NYSE regulators went so far as to investigate possible short-selling.[31]
Recent acquisitions[edit]
Beginning in 2013, Vonage acquired several companies, including:

Vocalocity, a Software as a Service (SaaS) provider of cloud-based communications services, for $130 million;[32]
Telesphere, a Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS) provider to large companies, for $114 million;[33]
iCore Networks, also a UCSaaS provider to large companies, for $92 million;
SimpleSignal, another UCSaaS service provider to small and medium-sized businesses, for $25 million;[34][35]
gUnify, also a cloud-based communications service provider to businesses (price not disclosed).[36][37][38]
Nexmo, the 2nd largest CPaaS company, for $230 million;[39]

Patent infringement law suits[edit]
On June 19, 2006, Verizon filed a lawsuit charging that Vonage infringed on five of Verizon's patents related to its VoIP service.[40] The patents describe technology for completing phone calls between VoIP users and people using phones on the traditional public switched network, authenticating VoIP callers, validating VoIP callers' accounts, fraud protection, providing enhanced features, using Wi-Fi handsets with VoIP services, and monitoring VoIP caller usage.
In 2007, Vonage launched a viral marketing campaign and website freetocompete.com, which garnered press coverage about Vonage, its campaign, the lawsuits, and issues of competition with established telecom corporations.[41][42][43][44]
On March 8, 2007 a jury found Vonage guilty of infringing three patents held by Verizon, and not guilty of infringing two other patents. The jury ordered Vonage to pay US$58 million, and a royalty rate of 5.5% of every sale to a Vonage customer, back to Verizon. Subsequent to this jury award, there were a series of appeals and intermediate stays on payment. Vonage was punitively ordered by the court to stop signing up new customers;[45] this was reversed on appeal three weeks later.[46] On November 19, 2007 Vonage agreed to pay ~$120 million in damages[47] to Verizon.
In other patent lawsuits, by December 2007, Vonage was ordered to pay $80 million to Sprint Nextel[48] and $39 million to AT&T Inc.[49] Another lawsuit with Nortel resulted in no monetary damages.[50]
2009 customer service settlement[edit]
In November 2009, Vonage agreed to an Assurance of voluntary compliance (AVC) with 32 states. The settlement followed an investigation into complaints about the marketing of Vonage services, including confusion about availability and cost, along with advertisements involving "free" services, money back guarantees and trial periods. The consumer protection agreement also addressed complaints that some consumers were prevented from canceling the Vonage service. In the settlement, Vonage agreed to pay the seven investigating states $3 million for costs, issue refunds to complainants dating back to January 2004, and change several business practices in regard to advertising and customer retention.[51][52]
Services[edit]
Vonage offers cloud communications and calling plans for residential customers and businesses, including small and medium-sized businesses, mid-market companies, and enterprises.
Business Services[edit]
Vonage offers two unified communications platforms for businesses that integrate communications services, such as video conferencing, voicemail transcription, and desktop sharing, using voice as a platform. Cloud communications services allow business customers to connect with various business applications and customer relationship management (CRM) tools through a middleware technology.[53][54]For business customers that rely on high quantities of voice, video and data communications in their day-to-day operations, Vonage provides Quality of Service over its own private Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) network and via a Software Defined Area Network (SD-WAN) product.[55][56][57][58]
Residential Services[edit]
Residential services provide home phone plans using VoIP (voice over internet protocol) over a broadband internet connection, such as cable internet service or DSL. Features for Vonage home phone residential service includes voicemail transcription; 411 calling; caller ID; call waiting; do not disturb; and a network availability feature which forwards all calls to a mobile phone if Internet connectivity is lost.[59][60][61][62] Many of Vonage’s residential products offer international calling plans.[63]
Service requirements[edit]
Vonage customers must have a broadband Internet connection, such as cable Internet service or DSL, through an Internet service provider (ISP). To initiate subscription a customer must provide a billing and shipping address in the country of service. Vonage supplies an analog telephone adapter which connects a customer supplied standard analog telephone to the Internet and the Vonage service.[64]
Residents of the U.S., Canada, and the UK may subscribe to Vonage by credit card from their respective country, but the Vonage adapter can be connected to the Internet anywhere.
Usage is generally referred to as "unlimited", though Vonage has different national "fair use" policies limiting Vonage-to-phone calls to a few thousand minutes per month in the UK,[65] Canada,[66] and U.S.[67] Evidence suggests that calls are limited to a length of 3 hours and 56 minutes.
Telephone number availability[edit]
Subscribers may choose a number in the country of the service they subscribe to for their primary line, in an area code of their choice. Subscribers can obtain additional "virtual numbers" for a monthly fee. Vonage also offers virtual numbers in Mexico, Canada and Europe. While the company supports porting a U.S. telephone number via the FCC's local number portability (LNP), not every phone number is available in every area code. Additionally, customers can transfer an existing number to Vonage, which can take up to 7 to 10 business days from the time the customer completes the Number Transfer Authorization (NTA).[68]
Emergency calls[edit]
Vonage offered 911 service on a VoIP platform for the first time in 2003.[69] For 911 location services to work, subscribers must activate the 911 calling feature by registering their full address with the company. Customers are responsible for maintaining their 911 location information at all times.[70]
If a customer dials 911 before the 911 verification is completed, the call will usually be routed to a national 911 call center where basic information must be given (name, location, nature of emergency, etc.), after which the call is transferred to a local public service answering point, like a local Police Department.[71][72]
Quality of service and equipment compatibility[edit]
VoIP service relies upon consistent broadband-ISP uptime and VoIP-equipment compatibility with the ISP's modem. Although VoIP was initially optimized for voice, some fax equipment can be operated over VoIP,[73][74][75] but compatibility of monitored alarm systems and other devices is less certain.[76] Vonage offers "specially commissioned" Fax Line service.[77] Vonage recommends customers keep a basic traditional landline dedicated to their home alarm system and use Vonage for the rest of their calling needs.[78]
Vonage implements Voice over IP sending audio via RTP and signaling via SIP.[79]

History[edit]
The company was originally called Min-X.com and was based in Melville, New York.[6] Jeffrey Citron, former CEO and majority shareholder at DatekOnline, was the first major investor in the early development stages. In October 2000, Citron invested $1 million as seed capital.[7]
The name was changed to Vonage In December 2000, and in January 2001, Vonage incorporated and moved to Edison, New Jersey.[8]
The company first offered subscription service in the United States, then Canada in 2004 and the United Kingdom in 2005. Vonage went public on May 24, 2006.[9]
In 2005, it relocated its headquarters to Holmdel, New Jersey.[10]
Restructuring efforts[edit]
In 2006, in preparation for an initial public stock offering (IPO), Michael Snyder, former president of ADT Security Services replaced Vonage co-founder Jeffrey A. Citron as CEO.[11] Citron could not preside over the IPO, because he was permanently barred from associating with any securities brokers or dealers.[12][13][14][15] In 2007, in an apparent restructuring effort to reduce ongoing net losses in the face of double-digit stock price slips and patent infringement issues, Snyder resigned, and Citron returned as Interim CEO.[16] The company announced plans for 10% (180) layoffs, as it secured $215 million in financing.[17]
In the second quarter of 2010, with a change in management and improved sales, the company’s stock price increased,[18] and on June 15, 2010, Vonage rose 17.06 percent, $0.36 to $2.47.[19]
As part of its restructuring effort in 2010, Vonage paid off $41 million of its debt at par, negotiated the release of more than $40 million in cash from vendors and announced a comprehensive refinancing. This resulted in a $200 million, pre-payable term loan with interest rates at 9.75%. Vonage planned to get better terms by paying down debt ahead of schedule, and by achieving sustained financial performance. Between March and June 2011, Vonage prepaid $70 million, reducing the balance to $130 million, the year-end 2011 target.[20]
Initial public offering[edit]
Vonage offered shares of its stock to its existing customer base in the period before the initial public offering (IPO).[21] Typically, only large institutional investors such as banks are able to buy shares of an IPO.[22] Vonage’s initial public offering occurred on the New York Stock Exchange on May 24, 2006, opening at $17.00 per share.[9] The price closed at $14.85, a decrease of 12.7 percent, the worst trading day for any IPO in 2006 up to that point. The IPO raised $531 million for the company. However, the existing customers who lost money filed a class-action lawsuit.[23] The IPO and its immediate aftermath also earned Vonage a “Business 2.0 Magazine” award as 14th of 101 “Dumbest Moments in Business for 2006”.[24] In 2009, Vonage reached an agreement with IPO investors. All shareholder claims against Vonage and its individual directors and officers who were named as defendants were dismissed.[25][26] The amount of the settlement, $3.6 million, was paid by an insurance policy covering the directors and officers of the company.[27][28][29]
The firms underwriting the IPO, Citigroup, UBS, and Deutsche Bank, were fined a total of $845,000 and ordered to reimburse customers for "failure to adequately supervise communications" with investors.[30] NYSE regulators went so far as to investigate possible short-selling.[31]
Recent acquisitions[edit]
Beginning in 2013, Vonage acquired several companies, including:

Vocalocity, a Software as a Service (SaaS) provider of cloud-based communications services, for $130 million;[32]
Telesphere, a Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS) provider to large companies, for $114 million;[33]
iCore Networks, also a UCSaaS provider to large companies, for $92 million;
SimpleSignal, another UCSaaS service provider to small and medium-sized businesses, for $25 million;[34][35]
gUnify, also a cloud-based communications service provider to businesses (price not disclosed).[36][37][38]
Nexmo, the 2nd largest CPaaS company, for $230 million;[39]

Patent infringement law suits[edit]
On June 19, 2006, Verizon filed a lawsuit charging that Vonage infringed on five of Verizon's patents related to its VoIP service.[40] The patents describe technology for completing phone calls between VoIP users and people using phones on the traditional public switched network, authenticating VoIP callers, validating VoIP callers' accounts, fraud protection, providing enhanced features, using Wi-Fi handsets with VoIP services, and monitoring VoIP caller usage.
In 2007, Vonage launched a viral marketing campaign and website freetocompete.com, which garnered press coverage about Vonage, its campaign, the lawsuits, and issues of competition with established telecom corporations.[41][42][43][44]
On March 8, 2007 a jury found Vonage guilty of infringing three patents held by Verizon, and not guilty of infringing two other patents. The jury ordered Vonage to pay US$58 million, and a royalty rate of 5.5% of every sale to a Vonage customer, back to Verizon. Subsequent to this jury award, there were a series of appeals and intermediate stays on payment. Vonage was punitively ordered by the court to stop signing up new customers;[45] this was reversed on appeal three weeks later.[46] On November 19, 2007 Vonage agreed to pay ~$120 million in damages[47] to Verizon.
In other patent lawsuits, by December 2007, Vonage was ordered to pay $80 million to Sprint Nextel[48] and $39 million to AT&T Inc.[49] Another lawsuit with Nortel resulted in no monetary damages.[50]
2009 customer service settlement[edit]
In November 2009, Vonage agreed to an Assurance of voluntary compliance (AVC) with 32 states. The settlement followed an investigation into complaints about the marketing of Vonage services, including confusion about availability and cost, along with advertisements involving "free" services, money back guarantees and trial periods. The consumer protection agreement also addressed complaints that some consumers were prevented from canceling the Vonage service. In the settlement, Vonage agreed to pay the seven investigating states $3 million for costs, issue refunds to complainants dating back to January 2004, and change several business practices in regard to advertising and customer retention.[51][52]
Services[edit]
Vonage offers cloud communications and calling plans for residential customers and businesses, including small and medium-sized businesses, mid-market companies, and enterprises.
Business Services[edit]
Vonage offers two unified communications platforms for businesses that integrate communications services, such as video conferencing, voicemail transcription, and desktop sharing, using voice as a platform. Cloud communications services allow business customers to connect with various business applications and customer relationship management (CRM) tools through a middleware technology.[53][54]For business customers that rely on high quantities of voice, video and data communications in their day-to-day operations, Vonage provides Quality of Service over its own private Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) network and via a Software Defined Area Network (SD-WAN) product.[55][56][57][58]
Residential Services[edit]
Residential services provide home phone plans using VoIP (voice over internet protocol) over a broadband internet connection, such as cable internet service or DSL. Features for Vonage home phone residential service includes voicemail transcription; 411 calling; caller ID; call waiting; do not disturb; and a network availability feature which forwards all calls to a mobile phone if Internet connectivity is lost.[59][60][61][62] Many of Vonage’s residential products offer international calling plans.[63]
Service requirements[edit]
Vonage customers must have a broadband Internet connection, such as cable Internet service or DSL, through an Internet service provider (ISP). To initiate subscription a customer must provide a billing and shipping address in the country of service. Vonage supplies an analog telephone adapter which connects a customer supplied standard analog telephone to the Internet and the Vonage service.[64]
Residents of the U.S., Canada, and the UK may subscribe to Vonage by credit card from their respective country, but the Vonage adapter can be connected to the Internet anywhere.
Usage is generally referred to as "unlimited", though Vonage has different national "fair use" policies limiting Vonage-to-phone calls to a few thousand minutes per month in the UK,[65] Canada,[66] and U.S.[67] Evidence suggests that calls are limited to a length of 3 hours and 56 minutes.
Telephone number availability[edit]
Subscribers may choose a number in the country of the service they subscribe to for their primary line, in an area code of their choice. Subscribers can obtain additional "virtual numbers" for a monthly fee. Vonage also offers virtual numbers in Mexico, Canada and Europe. While the company supports porting a U.S. telephone number via the FCC's local number portability (LNP), not every phone number is available in every area code. Additionally, customers can transfer an existing number to Vonage, which can take up to 7 to 10 business days from the time the customer completes the Number Transfer Authorization (NTA).[68]
Emergency calls[edit]
Vonage offered 911 service on a VoIP platform for the first time in 2003.[69] For 911 location services to work, subscribers must activate the 911 calling feature by registering their full address with the company. Customers are responsible for maintaining their 911 location information at all times.[70]
If a customer dials 911 before the 911 verification is completed, the call will usually be routed to a national 911 call center where basic information must be given (name, location, nature of emergency, etc.), after which the call is transferred to a local public service answering point, like a local Police Department.[71][72]
Quality of service and equipment compatibility[edit]
VoIP service relies upon consistent broadband-ISP uptime and VoIP-equipment compatibility with the ISP's modem. Although VoIP was initially optimized for voice, some fax equipment can be operated over VoIP,[73][74][75] but compatibility of monitored alarm systems and other devices is less certain.[76] Vonage offers "specially commissioned" Fax Line service.[77] Vonage recommends customers keep a basic traditional landline dedicated to their home alarm system and use Vonage for the rest of their calling needs.[78]
Vonage implements Voice over IP sending audio via RTP and signaling via SIP.[79]

History[edit]
The company was originally called Min-X.com and was based in Melville, New York.[6] Jeffrey Citron, former CEO and majority shareholder at DatekOnline, was the first major investor in the early development stages. In October 2000, Citron invested $1 million as seed capital.[7]
The name was changed to Vonage In December 2000, and in January 2001, Vonage incorporated and moved to Edison, New Jersey.[8]
The company first offered subscription service in the United States, then Canada in 2004 and the United Kingdom in 2005. Vonage went public on May 24, 2006.[9]
In 2005, it relocated its headquarters to Holmdel, New Jersey.[10]
Restructuring efforts[edit]
In 2006, in preparation for an initial public stock offering (IPO), Michael Snyder, former president of ADT Security Services replaced Vonage co-founder Jeffrey A. Citron as CEO.[11] Citron could not preside over the IPO, because he was permanently barred from associating with any securities brokers or dealers.[12][13][14][15] In 2007, in an apparent restructuring effort to reduce ongoing net losses in the face of double-digit stock price slips and patent infringement issues, Snyder resigned, and Citron returned as Interim CEO.[16] The company announced plans for 10% (180) layoffs, as it secured $215 million in financing.[17]
In the second quarter of 2010, with a change in management and improved sales, the company’s stock price increased,[18] and on June 15, 2010, Vonage rose 17.06 percent, $0.36 to $2.47.[19]
As part of its restructuring effort in 2010, Vonage paid off $41 million of its debt at par, negotiated the release of more than $40 million in cash from vendors and announced a comprehensive refinancing. This resulted in a $200 million, pre-payable term loan with interest rates at 9.75%. Vonage planned to get better terms by paying down debt ahead of schedule, and by achieving sustained financial performance. Between March and June 2011, Vonage prepaid $70 million, reducing the balance to $130 million, the year-end 2011 target.[20]
Initial public offering[edit]
Vonage offered shares of its stock to its existing customer base in the period before the initial public offering (IPO).[21] Typically, only large institutional investors such as banks are able to buy shares of an IPO.[22] Vonage’s initial public offering occurred on the New York Stock Exchange on May 24, 2006, opening at $17.00 per share.[9] The price closed at $14.85, a decrease of 12.7 percent, the worst trading day for any IPO in 2006 up to that point. The IPO raised $531 million for the company. However, the existing customers who lost money filed a class-action lawsuit.[23] The IPO and its immediate aftermath also earned Vonage a “Business 2.0 Magazine” award as 14th of 101 “Dumbest Moments in Business for 2006”.[24] In 2009, Vonage reached an agreement with IPO investors. All shareholder claims against Vonage and its individual directors and officers who were named as defendants were dismissed.[25][26] The amount of the settlement, $3.6 million, was paid by an insurance policy covering the directors and officers of the company.[27][28][29]
The firms underwriting the IPO, Citigroup, UBS, and Deutsche Bank, were fined a total of $845,000 and ordered to reimburse customers for "failure to adequately supervise communications" with investors.[30] NYSE regulators went so far as to investigate possible short-selling.[31]
Recent acquisitions[edit]
Beginning in 2013, Vonage acquired several companies, including:

Vocalocity, a Software as a Service (SaaS) provider of cloud-based communications services, for $130 million;[32]
Telesphere, a Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS) provider to large companies, for $114 million;[33]
iCore Networks, also a UCSaaS provider to large companies, for $92 million;
SimpleSignal, another UCSaaS service provider to small and medium-sized businesses, for $25 million;[34][35]
gUnify, also a cloud-based communications service provider to businesses (price not disclosed).[36][37][38]
Nexmo, the 2nd largest CPaaS company, for $230 million;[39]

Patent infringement law suits[edit]
On June 19, 2006, Verizon filed a lawsuit charging that Vonage infringed on five of Verizon's patents related to its VoIP service.[40] The patents describe technology for completing phone calls between VoIP users and people using phones on the traditional public switched network, authenticating VoIP callers, validating VoIP callers' accounts, fraud protection, providing enhanced features, using Wi-Fi handsets with VoIP services, and monitoring VoIP caller usage.
In 2007, Vonage launched a viral marketing campaign and website freetocompete.com, which garnered press coverage about Vonage, its campaign, the lawsuits, and issues of competition with established telecom corporations.[41][42][43][44]
On March 8, 2007 a jury found Vonage guilty of infringing three patents held by Verizon, and not guilty of infringing two other patents. The jury ordered Vonage to pay US$58 million, and a royalty rate of 5.5% of every sale to a Vonage customer, back to Verizon. Subsequent to this jury award, there were a series of appeals and intermediate stays on payment. Vonage was punitively ordered by the court to stop signing up new customers;[45] this was reversed on appeal three weeks later.[46] On November 19, 2007 Vonage agreed to pay ~$120 million in damages[47] to Verizon.
In other patent lawsuits, by December 2007, Vonage was ordered to pay $80 million to Sprint Nextel[48] and $39 million to AT&T Inc.[49] Another lawsuit with Nortel resulted in no monetary damages.[50]
2009 customer service settlement[edit]
In November 2009, Vonage agreed to an Assurance of voluntary compliance (AVC) with 32 states. The settlement followed an investigation into complaints about the marketing of Vonage services, including confusion about availability and cost, along with advertisements involving "free" services, money back guarantees and trial periods. The consumer protection agreement also addressed complaints that some consumers were prevented from canceling the Vonage service. In the settlement, Vonage agreed to pay the seven investigating states $3 million for costs, issue refunds to complainants dating back to January 2004, and change several business practices in regard to advertising and customer retention.[51][52]
Services[edit]
Vonage offers cloud communications and calling plans for residential customers and businesses, including small and medium-sized businesses, mid-market companies, and enterprises.
Business Services[edit]
Vonage offers two unified communications platforms for businesses that integrate communications services, such as video conferencing, voicemail transcription, and desktop sharing, using voice as a platform. Cloud communications services allow business customers to connect with various business applications and customer relationship management (CRM) tools through a middleware technology.[53][54]For business customers that rely on high quantities of voice, video and data communications in their day-to-day operations, Vonage provides Quality of Service over its own private Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) network and via a Software Defined Area Network (SD-WAN) product.[55][56][57][58]
Residential Services[edit]
Residential services provide home phone plans using VoIP (voice over internet protocol) over a broadband internet connection, such as cable internet service or DSL. Features for Vonage home phone residential service includes voicemail transcription; 411 calling; caller ID; call waiting; do not disturb; and a network availability feature which forwards all calls to a mobile phone if Internet connectivity is lost.[59][60][61][62] Many of Vonage’s residential products offer international calling plans.[63]
Service requirements[edit]
Vonage customers must have a broadband Internet connection, such as cable Internet service or DSL, through an Internet service provider (ISP). To initiate subscription a customer must provide a billing and shipping address in the country of service. Vonage supplies an analog telephone adapter which connects a customer supplied standard analog telephone to the Internet and the Vonage service.[64]
Residents of the U.S., Canada, and the UK may subscribe to Vonage by credit card from their respective country, but the Vonage adapter can be connected to the Internet anywhere.
Usage is generally referred to as "unlimited", though Vonage has different national "fair use" policies limiting Vonage-to-phone calls to a few thousand minutes per month in the UK,[65] Canada,[66] and U.S.[67] Evidence suggests that calls are limited to a length of 3 hours and 56 minutes.
Telephone number availability[edit]
Subscribers may choose a number in the country of the service they subscribe to for their primary line, in an area code of their choice. Subscribers can obtain additional "virtual numbers" for a monthly fee. Vonage also offers virtual numbers in Mexico, Canada and Europe. While the company supports porting a U.S. telephone number via the FCC's local number portability (LNP), not every phone number is available in every area code. Additionally, customers can transfer an existing number to Vonage, which can take up to 7 to 10 business days from the time the customer completes the Number Transfer Authorization (NTA).[68]
Emergency calls[edit]
Vonage offered 911 service on a VoIP platform for the first time in 2003.[69] For 911 location services to work, subscribers must activate the 911 calling feature by registering their full address with the company. Customers are responsible for maintaining their 911 location information at all times.[70]
If a customer dials 911 before the 911 verification is completed, the call will usually be routed to a national 911 call center where basic information must be given (name, location, nature of emergency, etc.), after which the call is transferred to a local public service answering point, like a local Police Department.[71][72]
Quality of service and equipment compatibility[edit]
VoIP service relies upon consistent broadband-ISP uptime and VoIP-equipment compatibility with the ISP's modem. Although VoIP was initially optimized for voice, some fax equipment can be operated over VoIP,[73][74][75] but compatibility of monitored alarm systems and other devices is less certain.[76] Vonage offers "specially commissioned" Fax Line service.[77] Vonage recommends customers keep a basic traditional landline dedicated to their home alarm system and use Vonage for the rest of their calling needs.[78]
Vonage implements Voice over IP sending audio via RTP and signaling via SIP.[79]

History[edit]
The company was originally called Min-X.com and was based in Melville, New York.[6] Jeffrey Citron, former CEO and majority shareholder at DatekOnline, was the first major investor in the early development stages. In October 2000, Citron invested $1 million as seed capital.[7]
The name was changed to Vonage In December 2000, and in January 2001, Vonage incorporated and moved to Edison, New Jersey.[8]
The company first offered subscription service in the United States, then Canada in 2004 and the United Kingdom in 2005. Vonage went public on May 24, 2006.[9]
In 2005, it relocated its headquarters to Holmdel, New Jersey.[10]
Restructuring efforts[edit]
In 2006, in preparation for an initial public stock offering (IPO), Michael Snyder, former president of ADT Security Services replaced Vonage co-founder Jeffrey A. Citron as CEO.[11] Citron could not preside over the IPO, because he was permanently barred from associating with any securities brokers or dealers.[12][13][14][15] In 2007, in an apparent restructuring effort to reduce ongoing net losses in the face of double-digit stock price slips and patent infringement issues, Snyder resigned, and Citron returned as Interim CEO.[16] The company announced plans for 10% (180) layoffs, as it secured $215 million in financing.[17]
In the second quarter of 2010, with a change in management and improved sales, the company’s stock price increased,[18] and on June 15, 2010, Vonage rose 17.06 percent, $0.36 to $2.47.[19]
As part of its restructuring effort in 2010, Vonage paid off $41 million of its debt at par, negotiated the release of more than $40 million in cash from vendors and announced a comprehensive refinancing. This resulted in a $200 million, pre-payable term loan with interest rates at 9.75%. Vonage planned to get better terms by paying down debt ahead of schedule, and by achieving sustained financial performance. Between March and June 2011, Vonage prepaid $70 million, reducing the balance to $130 million, the year-end 2011 target.[20]
Initial public offering[edit]
Vonage offered shares of its stock to its existing customer base in the period before the initial public offering (IPO).[21] Typically, only large institutional investors such as banks are able to buy shares of an IPO.[22] Vonage’s initial public offering occurred on the New York Stock Exchange on May 24, 2006, opening at $17.00 per share.[9] The price closed at $14.85, a decrease of 12.7 percent, the worst trading day for any IPO in 2006 up to that point. The IPO raised $531 million for the company. However, the existing customers who lost money filed a class-action lawsuit.[23] The IPO and its immediate aftermath also earned Vonage a “Business 2.0 Magazine” award as 14th of 101 “Dumbest Moments in Business for 2006”.[24] In 2009, Vonage reached an agreement with IPO investors. All shareholder claims against Vonage and its individual directors and officers who were named as defendants were dismissed.[25][26] The amount of the settlement, $3.6 million, was paid by an insurance policy covering the directors and officers of the company.[27][28][29]
The firms underwriting the IPO, Citigroup, UBS, and Deutsche Bank, were fined a total of $845,000 and ordered to reimburse customers for "failure to adequately supervise communications" with investors.[30] NYSE regulators went so far as to investigate possible short-selling.[31]
Recent acquisitions[edit]
Beginning in 2013, Vonage acquired several companies, including:

Vocalocity, a Software as a Service (SaaS) provider of cloud-based communications services, for $130 million;[32]
Telesphere, a Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS) provider to large companies, for $114 million;[33]
iCore Networks, also a UCSaaS provider to large companies, for $92 million;
SimpleSignal, another UCSaaS service provider to small and medium-sized businesses, for $25 million;[34][35]
gUnify, also a cloud-based communications service provider to businesses (price not disclosed).[36][37][38]
Nexmo, the 2nd largest CPaaS company, for $230 million;[39]

Patent infringement law suits[edit]
On June 19, 2006, Verizon filed a lawsuit charging that Vonage infringed on five of Verizon's patents related to its VoIP service.[40] The patents describe technology for completing phone calls between VoIP users and people using phones on the traditional public switched network, authenticating VoIP callers, validating VoIP callers' accounts, fraud protection, providing enhanced features, using Wi-Fi handsets with VoIP services, and monitoring VoIP caller usage.
In 2007, Vonage launched a viral marketing campaign and website freetocompete.com, which garnered press coverage about Vonage, its campaign, the lawsuits, and issues of competition with established telecom corporations.[41][42][43][44]
On March 8, 2007 a jury found Vonage guilty of infringing three patents held by Verizon, and not guilty of infringing two other patents. The jury ordered Vonage to pay US$58 million, and a royalty rate of 5.5% of every sale to a Vonage customer, back to Verizon. Subsequent to this jury award, there were a series of appeals and intermediate stays on payment. Vonage was punitively ordered by the court to stop signing up new customers;[45] this was reversed on appeal three weeks later.[46] On November 19, 2007 Vonage agreed to pay ~$120 million in damages[47] to Verizon.
In other patent lawsuits, by December 2007, Vonage was ordered to pay $80 million to Sprint Nextel[48] and $39 million to AT&T Inc.[49] Another lawsuit with Nortel resulted in no monetary damages.[50]
2009 customer service settlement[edit]
In November 2009, Vonage agreed to an Assurance of voluntary compliance (AVC) with 32 states. The settlement followed an investigation into complaints about the marketing of Vonage services, including confusion about availability and cost, along with advertisements involving "free" services, money back guarantees and trial periods. The consumer protection agreement also addressed complaints that some consumers were prevented from canceling the Vonage service. In the settlement, Vonage agreed to pay the seven investigating states $3 million for costs, issue refunds to complainants dating back to January 2004, and change several business practices in regard to advertising and customer retention.[51][52]
Services[edit]
Vonage offers cloud communications and calling plans for residential customers and businesses, including small and medium-sized businesses, mid-market companies, and enterprises.
Business Services[edit]
Vonage offers two unified communications platforms for businesses that integrate communications services, such as video conferencing, voicemail transcription, and desktop sharing, using voice as a platform. Cloud communications services allow business customers to connect with various business applications and customer relationship management (CRM) tools through a middleware technology.[53][54]For business customers that rely on high quantities of voice, video and data communications in their day-to-day operations, Vonage provides Quality of Service over its own private Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) network and via a Software Defined Area Network (SD-WAN) product.[55][56][57][58]
Residential Services[edit]
Residential services provide home phone plans using VoIP (voice over internet protocol) over a broadband internet connection, such as cable internet service or DSL. Features for Vonage home phone residential service includes voicemail transcription; 411 calling; caller ID; call waiting; do not disturb; and a network availability feature which forwards all calls to a mobile phone if Internet connectivity is lost.[59][60][61][62] Many of Vonage’s residential products offer international calling plans.[63]
Service requirements[edit]
Vonage customers must have a broadband Internet connection, such as cable Internet service or DSL, through an Internet service provider (ISP). To initiate subscription a customer must provide a billing and shipping address in the country of service. Vonage supplies an analog telephone adapter which connects a customer supplied standard analog telephone to the Internet and the Vonage service.[64]
Residents of the U.S., Canada, and the UK may subscribe to Vonage by credit card from their respective country, but the Vonage adapter can be connected to the Internet anywhere.
Usage is generally referred to as "unlimited", though Vonage has different national "fair use" policies limiting Vonage-to-phone calls to a few thousand minutes per month in the UK,[65] Canada,[66] and U.S.[67] Evidence suggests that calls are limited to a length of 3 hours and 56 minutes.
Telephone number availability[edit]
Subscribers may choose a number in the country of the service they subscribe to for their primary line, in an area code of their choice. Subscribers can obtain additional "virtual numbers" for a monthly fee. Vonage also offers virtual numbers in Mexico, Canada and Europe. While the company supports porting a U.S. telephone number via the FCC's local number portability (LNP), not every phone number is available in every area code. Additionally, customers can transfer an existing number to Vonage, which can take up to 7 to 10 business days from the time the customer completes the Number Transfer Authorization (NTA).[68]
Emergency calls[edit]
Vonage offered 911 service on a VoIP platform for the first time in 2003.[69] For 911 location services to work, subscribers must activate the 911 calling feature by registering their full address with the company. Customers are responsible for maintaining their 911 location information at all times.[70]
If a customer dials 911 before the 911 verification is completed, the call will usually be routed to a national 911 call center where basic information must be given (name, location, nature of emergency, etc.), after which the call is transferred to a local public service answering point, like a local Police Department.[71][72]
Quality of service and equipment compatibility[edit]
VoIP service relies upon consistent broadband-ISP uptime and VoIP-equipment compatibility with the ISP's modem. Although VoIP was initially optimized for voice, some fax equipment can be operated over VoIP,[73][74][75] but compatibility of monitored alarm systems and other devices is less certain.[76] Vonage offers "specially commissioned" Fax Line service.[77] Vonage recommends customers keep a basic traditional landline dedicated to their home alarm system and use Vonage for the rest of their calling needs.[78]
Vonage implements Voice over IP sending audio via RTP and signaling via SIP.[79]

History[edit]
The company was originally called Min-X.com and was based in Melville, New York.[6] Jeffrey Citron, former CEO and majority shareholder at DatekOnline, was the first major investor in the early development stages. In October 2000, Citron invested $1 million as seed capital.[7]
The name was changed to Vonage In December 2000, and in January 2001, Vonage incorporated and moved to Edison, New Jersey.[8]
The company first offered subscription service in the United States, then Canada in 2004 and the United Kingdom in 2005. Vonage went public on May 24, 2006.[9]
In 2005, it relocated its headquarters to Holmdel, New Jersey.[10]
Restructuring efforts[edit]
In 2006, in preparation for an initial public stock offering (IPO), Michael Snyder, former president of ADT Security Services replaced Vonage co-founder Jeffrey A. Citron as CEO.[11] Citron could not preside over the IPO, because he was permanently barred from associating with any securities brokers or dealers.[12][13][14][15] In 2007, in an apparent restructuring effort to reduce ongoing net losses in the face of double-digit stock price slips and patent infringement issues, Snyder resigned, and Citron returned as Interim CEO.[16] The company announced plans for 10% (180) layoffs, as it secured $215 million in financing.[17]
In the second quarter of 2010, with a change in management and improved sales, the company’s stock price increased,[18] and on June 15, 2010, Vonage rose 17.06 percent, $0.36 to $2.47.[19]
As part of its restructuring effort in 2010, Vonage paid off $41 million of its debt at par, negotiated the release of more than $40 million in cash from vendors and announced a comprehensive refinancing. This resulted in a $200 million, pre-payable term loan with interest rates at 9.75%. Vonage planned to get better terms by paying down debt ahead of schedule, and by achieving sustained financial performance. Between March and June 2011, Vonage prepaid $70 million, reducing the balance to $130 million, the year-end 2011 target.[20]
Initial public offering[edit]
Vonage offered shares of its stock to its existing customer base in the period before the initial public offering (IPO).[21] Typically, only large institutional investors such as banks are able to buy shares of an IPO.[22] Vonage’s initial public offering occurred on the New York Stock Exchange on May 24, 2006, opening at $17.00 per share.[9] The price closed at $14.85, a decrease of 12.7 percent, the worst trading day for any IPO in 2006 up to that point. The IPO raised $531 million for the company. However, the existing customers who lost money filed a class-action lawsuit.[23] The IPO and its immediate aftermath also earned Vonage a “Business 2.0 Magazine” award as 14th of 101 “Dumbest Moments in Business for 2006”.[24] In 2009, Vonage reached an agreement with IPO investors. All shareholder claims against Vonage and its individual directors and officers who were named as defendants were dismissed.[25][26] The amount of the settlement, $3.6 million, was paid by an insurance policy covering the directors and officers of the company.[27][28][29]
The firms underwriting the IPO, Citigroup, UBS, and Deutsche Bank, were fined a total of $845,000 and ordered to reimburse customers for "failure to adequately supervise communications" with investors.[30] NYSE regulators went so far as to investigate possible short-selling.[31]
Recent acquisitions[edit]
Beginning in 2013, Vonage acquired several companies, including:

Vocalocity, a Software as a Service (SaaS) provider of cloud-based communications services, for $130 million;[32]
Telesphere, a Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS) provider to large companies, for $114 million;[33]
iCore Networks, also a UCSaaS provider to large companies, for $92 million;
SimpleSignal, another UCSaaS service provider to small and medium-sized businesses, for $25 million;[34][35]
gUnify, also a cloud-based communications service provider to businesses (price not disclosed).[36][37][38]
Nexmo, the 2nd largest CPaaS company, for $230 million;[39]

Patent infringement law suits[edit]
On June 19, 2006, Verizon filed a lawsuit charging that Vonage infringed on five of Verizon's patents related to its VoIP service.[40] The patents describe technology for completing phone calls between VoIP users and people using phones on the traditional public switched network, authenticating VoIP callers, validating VoIP callers' accounts, fraud protection, providing enhanced features, using Wi-Fi handsets with VoIP services, and monitoring VoIP caller usage.
In 2007, Vonage launched a viral marketing campaign and website freetocompete.com, which garnered press coverage about Vonage, its campaign, the lawsuits, and issues of competition with established telecom corporations.[41][42][43][44]
On March 8, 2007 a jury found Vonage guilty of infringing three patents held by Verizon, and not guilty of infringing two other patents. The jury ordered Vonage to pay US$58 million, and a royalty rate of 5.5% of every sale to a Vonage customer, back to Verizon. Subsequent to this jury award, there were a series of appeals and intermediate stays on payment. Vonage was punitively ordered by the court to stop signing up new customers;[45] this was reversed on appeal three weeks later.[46] On November 19, 2007 Vonage agreed to pay ~$120 million in damages[47] to Verizon.
In other patent lawsuits, by December 2007, Vonage was ordered to pay $80 million to Sprint Nextel[48] and $39 million to AT&T Inc.[49] Another lawsuit with Nortel resulted in no monetary damages.[50]
2009 customer service settlement[edit]
In November 2009, Vonage agreed to an Assurance of voluntary compliance (AVC) with 32 states. The settlement followed an investigation into complaints about the marketing of Vonage services, including confusion about availability and cost, along with advertisements involving "free" services, money back guarantees and trial periods. The consumer protection agreement also addressed complaints that some consumers were prevented from canceling the Vonage service. In the settlement, Vonage agreed to pay the seven investigating states $3 million for costs, issue refunds to complainants dating back to January 2004, and change several business practices in regard to advertising and customer retention.[51][52]
Services[edit]
Vonage offers cloud communications and calling plans for residential customers and businesses, including small and medium-sized businesses, mid-market companies, and enterprises.
Business Services[edit]
Vonage offers two unified communications platforms for businesses that integrate communications services, such as video conferencing, voicemail transcription, and desktop sharing, using voice as a platform. Cloud communications services allow business customers to connect with various business applications and customer relationship management (CRM) tools through a middleware technology.[53][54]For business customers that rely on high quantities of voice, video and data communications in their day-to-day operations, Vonage provides Quality of Service over its own private Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) network and via a Software Defined Area Network (SD-WAN) product.[55][56][57][58]
Residential Services[edit]
Residential services provide home phone plans using VoIP (voice over internet protocol) over a broadband internet connection, such as cable internet service or DSL. Features for Vonage home phone residential service includes voicemail transcription; 411 calling; caller ID; call waiting; do not disturb; and a network availability feature which forwards all calls to a mobile phone if Internet connectivity is lost.[59][60][61][62] Many of Vonage’s residential products offer international calling plans.[63]
Service requirements[edit]
Vonage customers must have a broadband Internet connection, such as cable Internet service or DSL, through an Internet service provider (ISP). To initiate subscription a customer must provide a billing and shipping address in the country of service. Vonage supplies an analog telephone adapter which connects a customer supplied standard analog telephone to the Internet and the Vonage service.[64]
Residents of the U.S., Canada, and the UK may subscribe to Vonage by credit card from their respective country, but the Vonage adapter can be connected to the Internet anywhere.
Usage is generally referred to as "unlimited", though Vonage has different national "fair use" policies limiting Vonage-to-phone calls to a few thousand minutes per month in the UK,[65] Canada,[66] and U.S.[67] Evidence suggests that calls are limited to a length of 3 hours and 56 minutes.
Telephone number availability[edit]
Subscribers may choose a number in the country of the service they subscribe to for their primary line, in an area code of their choice. Subscribers can obtain additional "virtual numbers" for a monthly fee. Vonage also offers virtual numbers in Mexico, Canada and Europe. While the company supports porting a U.S. telephone number via the FCC's local number portability (LNP), not every phone number is available in every area code. Additionally, customers can transfer an existing number to Vonage, which can take up to 7 to 10 business days from the time the customer completes the Number Transfer Authorization (NTA).[68]
Emergency calls[edit]
Vonage offered 911 service on a VoIP platform for the first time in 2003.[69] For 911 location services to work, subscribers must activate the 911 calling feature by registering their full address with the company. Customers are responsible for maintaining their 911 location information at all times.[70]
If a customer dials 911 before the 911 verification is completed, the call will usually be routed to a national 911 call center where basic information must be given (name, location, nature of emergency, etc.), after which the call is transferred to a local public service answering point, like a local Police Department.[71][72]
Quality of service and equipment compatibility[edit]
VoIP service relies upon consistent broadband-ISP uptime and VoIP-equipment compatibility with the ISP's modem. Although VoIP was initially optimized for voice, some fax equipment can be operated over VoIP,[73][74][75] but compatibility of monitored alarm systems and other devices is less certain.[76] Vonage offers "specially commissioned" Fax Line service.[77] Vonage recommends customers keep a basic traditional landline dedicated to their home alarm system and use Vonage for the rest of their calling needs.[78]
Vonage implements Voice over IP sending audio via RTP and signaling via SIP.[79]

July 20--HOLMDEL -- The company had tried door number one, going after the residential market. It could pursue door number two, going after the business market. The board asked him for his thoughts on door number three.
"I said, 'I don't think there is a door number three,'" Masarek said. "'I think we can win door number two.'"
It must have been a trick question, because Masarek was hired. Now three years into his plan, he is revamping Vonage, turning the company known for its inexpensive telephone service and nearly incessant advertising campaign in a new direction, focusing on the business market.
More: Holmdel tech entrepreneur inspired by running his Rutgers fraternity
To get there, he is trying to overhaul the company's culture -- a prospect that could give it a more prominent role in rebuilding the Jersey Shore's technology industry. For more on innovation at the Shore, watch the videos at the top of the story.
Vonage renewed its lease, keeping it here until at least 2023. It redecorated its office, complete with massage chairs and music-themed conference rooms. It recruited interns at New Jersey colleges.
"Vonage is at a historic point," George Sutton, an analyst with Craig-Hallum Capital Group said in a research report in May. With the company's transition, "the math gets to be more and more compelling."
Shaky start
Vonage has nearly 2,000 employees, including about 700 who work at its 88-acre campus on Main Street.
It was founded in 2001, offering Voice over Internet Protocol (VOIP) telephone service that allowed unlimited long-distance calls for $24.99 a month, shaking up traditional telecommunications companies that once charged for long-distance calls by the minute.
Vonage flooded the market with advertising; in 2005 it was the nation's top advertiser on the internet, helping it become a household name. It had more than 2 million customers.
But it ran into problems, too: consumer complaints; patent lawsuits by Verizon Communications and other phone companies; and dwindling cash to pay off debt to name a few.
The company caught a break when it refinanced its debt during the worst of the recession in 2008, a sign that its business was strong enough to survive. But less than a decade later, it faces another obstacles: Consumers are ditching their landlines, along with Vonage's service, in favor of wireless phones.

More: UPDATE: Holmdel has no knowledge of Route 35 supermarket plan
Door No. 2
Vonage is turning to businesses to make up for it. It made a splash a year ago, when it acquired Nexmo, a San Francisco technology company for $230 million. With it, Vonage can provide companies with a voice, video and messaging system through the cloud.
An example: A customer who uses their app to book a flight and runs into trouble can call a customer service agent for help, but the agent will have to start from square one.
But Vonage says it can now provide a system so that the agent will have all of the customer's information -- from their history to what they are trying to do -- when they hop on the line.
It takes away a common source of frustration for customers who are tripped up by online instructions, only to hear an agent say: "Hi, can I get your name/phone number/ZIP code? How can I help you?"
And it opens a new market for Vonage.

"There's not a company I talk to today that isn't trying to figure out how to create an enhanced customer experience," said Zeus Kerravala, a consultant with ZK Research in Westminster, Massachusetts.
Masarek, 56, lives in Milford, Connecticut, with his wife, Patti, and keeps an apartment in Red Bank. They have two adult children, daughter, Jordan, and son, Jared.
A triathlete, Masarek in 2002 co-founded Quickoffice, which allowed consumers to use Microsoft Office products like Word on Excel on any mobile operating system. They sold the company to Google in 2012.
Masarek became CEO of Vonage in 2015, when business customers made up just 10 percent of the company's revenue. This year, they are on pace to make up more than half.
Masarek sat down with the Asbury Park Press this week at the company's headquarters -- which includes free soda, motivational quotes on closet doors from Thomas Edison and Albert Einstein, and a Frank Sinatra conference room that looks like a cigar lounge -- to talk about the company's new direction.
Five questions:
Why leave Google for Vonage?
I worked in the Mountain View headquarters and I was kind of too young to retire and was getting CEO inquires that weren't particularly interesting. And then this one came along and I was kind of fascinated by the opportunity to almost reposition this almost iconic consumer brand.
Why focus on businesses instead of consumers?
Residential is still incredibly important to us, and it's still there and it's profitable, but as home phone usage is in decline, our kids will unlikely have home phones as everybody moves to mobile and such, you have the number of residential home phone subscribers is down from what it once was ... (But the underlying) network doesn't care if you are calling home to your grandmother or if it's a business call. Our network, which is the biggest piece of the cost, is shared between residential and business.
Why would businesses be interested?
Say a customer with 500 restaurants is trying to increase its take-out business. They had users start to text in orders. "I want two doubles and fries." The problem is, you don't know whether the customer is going to walk in in five minutes or 35 minutes. So you don't know when to cook it. So you cook it in five minutes and the guy walks in in 35 minutes, and it's sitting in the heat lamp, soggy french fries.
Using our tools, what they've done is, they've geo-fenced each of those 500 restaurants. It's software that does this. It says, 'I want to have an estimate, basically a circumference around the physical restaurant that basically tells me that a driver is five minutes away. ...' When you cross into the geo fence, it sends ... a message to the restaurant that says, 'Start cooking Mr. Smith's order.' And then sends a followup text message to Mr. Smith that says, don't even come in the restaurant, come in the two designated spots for takeout and we'll bring the food out for them. Here you've used communications as a way to improve the restaurant chain's business imperative to build the takeout business.
What did you learn at Google?
Google has done a remarkable job of hiring great talent, managing them well, delivering great results, which has led to hiring more great talent, managing it well, more great results. Very virtuous cycle. We want to do the same thing here; create Vonage as a destination place to work.
How difficult is that to replicate that culture, not at a startup, but at a 16-year-old company?
Growth and comfort don't co-exist. It's hard. It's discomforting to people to grow. People tend to want to come to work and do what they did yesterday just a little better than they did today. That's not being innovative. ...You have to set the mission where we're going, rinse and repeat on the message, but have the right talent to do it. It's not coming out of my head. I mean, I've got broad shoulders, but not that broad. You've got to bring in great people in order to be able to do that.

Award-Winning Business Phone System – Without Contracts!
Empower your business phone system with a new VoIP solution!






 Low Cost, Low Overhead
Our Vonage business VoIP solution is delivered over the Internet and is hosted in the cloud. So forget the closetful of wires in the office and the expensive service calls. Our customers save at least 36% over traditional carriers month over month* – proof that the best business phone systems don’t have to be the most expensive.
**Savings claim is based on the average monthly recurring charge for unlimited domestic business calling plans from the top three leading wireline service providers. Comparison excludes promotional pricing, fees, surcharges or taxes and assumes a customer already has broadband service. Check your phone bill to determine the savings that would apply to you.

 Business-Class Features
With over 40 calling features built in, our business telephone system delivers productivity with Virtual Receptionist, Dynamic Caller ID, Mobile Apps, Desktop Plugins, Voicemail to Email and more. You can also enhance your communications with low-cost premium features – such as Call Conference, Call Recording, Call Monitoring, Call Queues, Virtual Fax and CRM integration tools.
 Easy Setup & Support
All business phone systems are not created equal. Setting up our system is quick and easy, and our VoIP-compatible phones arrive pre-configured to work on the system and ready to plug in. You can manage the phone system from your desktop through a user-friendly admin portal. If you ever need assistance, you have access to online learning resources and extensive training, and our experienced customer and tech support teams are there when you need them.

THE VONAGE ADVANTAGE 


QUALITY OF SERVICE 






		Share
	




























Quality of Service














As businesses increase the usage of video, online collaboration tools, and other cloud applications, maintaining the quality of shared bandwidth becomes vital.


Sanjay Srinivasan, Vonage Vice President and Chief Technology Architect, Business Engineering








		When we say Business Grade, we mean it. Our robust, cloud-based, plug-and-play Essentials service is the right solution for many businesses. And when organizations need elevated quality of service, there’s also Vonage Premier. With Premier, you'll also have access to our private MPLS network and our SD-WAN solutions specific to UCaaS. It's perfect when your organization demands greater bandwidth and higher-quality voice and video.
	
















    Fully managed, end-to-end Vonage® Premier service.
  

    The Vonage Network Operations Center runs 24/7/365, managing our vast and diverse high-quality voice and data networks and connecting billions of calls each year. With multi-level fail-safes and powerful cloud backup, we maximize uptime and minimize call drops, data loss, and static. In fact,  when you’re a Premier customer using our MPLS network or SD-WAN solution, we often fix issues before you know they occur.
  



    Cloud-hosted and constantly updating.
  

    Cloud hosting is part of great quality of service for both our Essentials and Premier platform products. Because our system is hosted via data centers around the country, and not at your business site, enhancements and upgrades are quick and easy. Plus there’s no extra cost or maintenance scheduling. And since we’re constantly updating our technology, you always have the most up-to-date phone system.
  





















 Key Benefits 

Nationwide coverage for quality, disaster recovery & business continuity, diversity, etc.
Redundant Ring Architecture
National IP Routing Fabric
Multiple Access Options-Ethernet, Dsi, T1, DS3, OCN
Multi-site MPLS VPN
End-to-End Quality of Service (QOS)
2 Domestic 24x7 NOC's with proactive monitoring and support



 Nationwide MPLS Network 

 

















    Vonage Premier’s Resilient MPLS backbone with 20+ POPS.
  

    With 20+ points of presence (POPs), Vonage’s private, MPLS-based IP network stands up to the best in the industry. Our virtual computing platform is built on an advanced, highly distributed software architecture that provides both high performance and massive scale-out capabilities. Its fully redundant ring architecture runs on best-in-class hardware to maximize affordability. Plus, we partner with top technology providers to deploy one of the most robust platforms in the industry.
  



    Add network intelligence to any connection.
  

    As pioneers in creating SD-WAN for UCaaS, and robust Bring Your Own Broadband solutions, we’ve paved the way for reliable, elevated quality of service on any network, even over existing broadband service.  Expect optimized application performance at a reduced cost. We even have hybrid WAN solutions that still allow simplified deployment and reduced costs.
  





















    Higher-quality audio from Vonage Premier. Yes, you heard right.
  

    Making and receiving phone calls is at the heart of business communications. And from day one we’ve been dedicated to providing high-fidelity calling. As our audio capabilities expand from robust conference services to mobile phone integration, we continue to deliver solutions around high-quality audio that’s intuitive to use and works when you need it.
  



    Our HD video plays videos, not static.
  

    We optimize our Premier network solutions to provide solutions across all our high-quality  voice, video, and data offerings. That means congestion prevention so contact centers can handle volume spikes with ease. Or bandwidth prioritization so real-time applications like HD video conferencing don’t lag or cut out.
  





















    Premier network quality and encryption.
  

    Encrypt traffic in a mix of cloud and MPLS deployment with a hybrid VPN. This zero-touch, enterprise-class solution provides you with optimized connectivity to your Vonage services.
  



    Firewall optimization.
  

    Functional Application Layer Firewalls work with our SD-WAN solutions allowing your business to replace both personal firewalls and routers with one intuitive service.
  





















    Smarter bandwidth. Premier quality.
  

    Our network solutions are built to help maximize your bandwidth. We carve out dedicated pieces and create different buckets to optimize performance for your high-quality voice, video, data and more, giving you a smoother overall experience.
  



    SD-WAN voice, data, and video traffic prioritization.
  

    Smart QoS controls with our Premier SD-WAN solution give real-time applications including high quality voice and video a higher priority.  As a result, your network avoids unnecessary congestion while maximizing uptime for your business-critical applications.
  













                    OUR BUSINESS COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS
                

                    Business grade. People friendly.™

Vonage /vɑːnɪdʒ/ is a publicly held Internet telephony service provider, providing business and residential telecommunication services based on voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). The company was founded in 2001 and is headquartered in Holmdel Township, New Jersey.
As of 2014, Vonage reported approximately 2.5 million subscriber lines, in conjunction with mobile application services.[2] Through a series of recent acquisitions, Vonage, previously a consumer-focused service provider, expanded its presence in the business marketplace.[3][4][5]

History[edit]
The company was originally called Min-X.com and was based in Melville, New York.[6] Jeffrey Citron, former CEO and majority shareholder at DatekOnline, was the first major investor in the early development stages. In October 2000, Citron invested $1 million as seed capital.[7]
The name was changed to Vonage In December 2000, and in January 2001, Vonage incorporated and moved to Edison, New Jersey.[8]
The company first offered subscription service in the United States, then Canada in 2004 and the United Kingdom in 2005. Vonage went public on May 24, 2006.[9]
In 2005, it relocated its headquarters to Holmdel, New Jersey.[10]
Restructuring efforts[edit]
In 2006, in preparation for an initial public stock offering (IPO), Michael Snyder, former president of ADT Security Services replaced Vonage co-founder Jeffrey A. Citron as CEO.[11] Citron could not preside over the IPO, because he was permanently barred from associating with any securities brokers or dealers.[12][13][14][15] In 2007, in an apparent restructuring effort to reduce ongoing net losses in the face of double-digit stock price slips and patent infringement issues, Snyder resigned, and Citron returned as Interim CEO.[16] The company announced plans for 10% (180) layoffs, as it secured $215 million in financing.[17]
In the second quarter of 2010, with a change in management and improved sales, the company’s stock price increased,[18] and on June 15, 2010, Vonage rose 17.06 percent, $0.36 to $2.47.[19]
As part of its restructuring effort in 2010, Vonage paid off $41 million of its debt at par, negotiated the release of more than $40 million in cash from vendors and announced a comprehensive refinancing. This resulted in a $200 million, pre-payable term loan with interest rates at 9.75%. Vonage planned to get better terms by paying down debt ahead of schedule, and by achieving sustained financial performance. Between March and June 2011, Vonage prepaid $70 million, reducing the balance to $130 million, the year-end 2011 target.[20]
Initial public offering[edit]
Vonage offered shares of its stock to its existing customer base in the period before the initial public offering (IPO).[21] Typically, only large institutional investors such as banks are able to buy shares of an IPO.[22] Vonage’s initial public offering occurred on the New York Stock Exchange on May 24, 2006, opening at $17.00 per share.[9] The price closed at $14.85, a decrease of 12.7 percent, the worst trading day for any IPO in 2006 up to that point. The IPO raised $531 million for the company. However, the existing customers who lost money filed a class-action lawsuit.[23] The IPO and its immediate aftermath also earned Vonage a “Business 2.0 Magazine” award as 14th of 101 “Dumbest Moments in Business for 2006”.[24] In 2009, Vonage reached an agreement with IPO investors. All shareholder claims against Vonage and its individual directors and officers who were named as defendants were dismissed.[25][26] The amount of the settlement, $3.6 million, was paid by an insurance policy covering the directors and officers of the company.[27][28][29]
The firms underwriting the IPO, Citigroup, UBS, and Deutsche Bank, were fined a total of $845,000 and ordered to reimburse customers for "failure to adequately supervise communications" with investors.[30] NYSE regulators went so far as to investigate possible short-selling.[31]
Recent acquisitions[edit]
Beginning in 2013, Vonage acquired several companies, including:

Vocalocity, a Software as a Service (SaaS) provider of cloud-based communications services, for $130 million;[32]
Telesphere, a Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS) provider to large companies, for $114 million;[33]
iCore Networks, also a UCSaaS provider to large companies, for $92 million;
SimpleSignal, another UCSaaS service provider to small and medium-sized businesses, for $25 million;[34][35]
gUnify, also a cloud-based communications service provider to businesses (price not disclosed).[36][37][38]
Nexmo, the 2nd largest CPaaS company, for $230 million;[39]

Patent infringement law suits[edit]
On June 19, 2006, Verizon filed a lawsuit charging that Vonage infringed on five of Verizon's patents related to its VoIP service.[40] The patents describe technology for completing phone calls between VoIP users and people using phones on the traditional public switched network, authenticating VoIP callers, validating VoIP callers' accounts, fraud protection, providing enhanced features, using Wi-Fi handsets with VoIP services, and monitoring VoIP caller usage.
In 2007, Vonage launched a viral marketing campaign and website freetocompete.com, which garnered press coverage about Vonage, its campaign, the lawsuits, and issues of competition with established telecom corporations.[41][42][43][44]
On March 8, 2007 a jury found Vonage guilty of infringing three patents held by Verizon, and not guilty of infringing two other patents. The jury ordered Vonage to pay US$58 million, and a royalty rate of 5.5% of every sale to a Vonage customer, back to Verizon. Subsequent to this jury award, there were a series of appeals and intermediate stays on payment. Vonage was punitively ordered by the court to stop signing up new customers;[45] this was reversed on appeal three weeks later.[46] On November 19, 2007 Vonage agreed to pay ~$120 million in damages[47] to Verizon.
In other patent lawsuits, by December 2007, Vonage was ordered to pay $80 million to Sprint Nextel[48] and $39 million to AT&T Inc.[49] Another lawsuit with Nortel resulted in no monetary damages.[50]
2009 customer service settlement[edit]
In November 2009, Vonage agreed to an Assurance of voluntary compliance (AVC) with 32 states. The settlement followed an investigation into complaints about the marketing of Vonage services, including confusion about availability and cost, along with advertisements involving "free" services, money back guarantees and trial periods. The consumer protection agreement also addressed complaints that some consumers were prevented from canceling the Vonage service. In the settlement, Vonage agreed to pay the seven investigating states $3 million for costs, issue refunds to complainants dating back to January 2004, and change several business practices in regard to advertising and customer retention.[51][52]
Services[edit]
Vonage offers cloud communications and calling plans for residential customers and businesses, including small and medium-sized businesses, mid-market companies, and enterprises.
Business Services[edit]
Vonage offers two unified communications platforms for businesses that integrate communications services, such as video conferencing, voicemail transcription, and desktop sharing, using voice as a platform. Cloud communications services allow business customers to connect with various business applications and customer relationship management (CRM) tools through a middleware technology.[53][54]For business customers that rely on high quantities of voice, video and data communications in their day-to-day operations, Vonage provides Quality of Service over its own private Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) network and via a Software Defined Area Network (SD-WAN) product.[55][56][57][58]
Residential Services[edit]
Residential services provide home phone plans using VoIP (voice over internet protocol) over a broadband internet connection, such as cable internet service or DSL. Features for Vonage home phone residential service includes voicemail transcription; 411 calling; caller ID; call waiting; do not disturb; and a network availability feature which forwards all calls to a mobile phone if Internet connectivity is lost.[59][60][61][62] Many of Vonage’s residential products offer international calling plans.[63]
Service requirements[edit]
Vonage customers must have a broadband Internet connection, such as cable Internet service or DSL, through an Internet service provider (ISP). To initiate subscription a customer must provide a billing and shipping address in the country of service. Vonage supplies an analog telephone adapter which connects a customer supplied standard analog telephone to the Internet and the Vonage service.[64]
Residents of the U.S., Canada, and the UK may subscribe to Vonage by credit card from their respective country, but the Vonage adapter can be connected to the Internet anywhere.
Usage is generally referred to as "unlimited", though Vonage has different national "fair use" policies limiting Vonage-to-phone calls to a few thousand minutes per month in the UK,[65] Canada,[66] and U.S.[67] Evidence suggests that calls are limited to a length of 3 hours and 56 minutes.
Telephone number availability[edit]
Subscribers may choose a number in the country of the service they subscribe to for their primary line, in an area code of their choice. Subscribers can obtain additional "virtual numbers" for a monthly fee. Vonage also offers virtual numbers in Mexico, Canada and Europe. While the company supports porting a U.S. telephone number via the FCC's local number portability (LNP), not every phone number is available in every area code. Additionally, customers can transfer an existing number to Vonage, which can take up to 7 to 10 business days from the time the customer completes the Number Transfer Authorization (NTA).[68]
Emergency calls[edit]
Vonage offered 911 service on a VoIP platform for the first time in 2003.[69] For 911 location services to work, subscribers must activate the 911 calling feature by registering their full address with the company. Customers are responsible for maintaining their 911 location information at all times.[70]
If a customer dials 911 before the 911 verification is completed, the call will usually be routed to a national 911 call center where basic information must be given (name, location, nature of emergency, etc.), after which the call is transferred to a local public service answering point, like a local Police Department.[71][72]
Quality of service and equipment compatibility[edit]
VoIP service relies upon consistent broadband-ISP uptime and VoIP-equipment compatibility with the ISP's modem. Although VoIP was initially optimized for voice, some fax equipment can be operated over VoIP,[73][74][75] but compatibility of monitored alarm systems and other devices is less certain.[76] Vonage offers "specially commissioned" Fax Line service.[77] Vonage recommends customers keep a basic traditional landline dedicated to their home alarm system and use Vonage for the rest of their calling needs.[78]
Vonage implements Voice over IP sending audio via RTP and signaling via SIP.[79]

History[edit]
The company was originally called Min-X.com and was based in Melville, New York.[6] Jeffrey Citron, former CEO and majority shareholder at DatekOnline, was the first major investor in the early development stages. In October 2000, Citron invested $1 million as seed capital.[7]
The name was changed to Vonage In December 2000, and in January 2001, Vonage incorporated and moved to Edison, New Jersey.[8]
The company first offered subscription service in the United States, then Canada in 2004 and the United Kingdom in 2005. Vonage went public on May 24, 2006.[9]
In 2005, it relocated its headquarters to Holmdel, New Jersey.[10]
Restructuring efforts[edit]
In 2006, in preparation for an initial public stock offering (IPO), Michael Snyder, former president of ADT Security Services replaced Vonage co-founder Jeffrey A. Citron as CEO.[11] Citron could not preside over the IPO, because he was permanently barred from associating with any securities brokers or dealers.[12][13][14][15] In 2007, in an apparent restructuring effort to reduce ongoing net losses in the face of double-digit stock price slips and patent infringement issues, Snyder resigned, and Citron returned as Interim CEO.[16] The company announced plans for 10% (180) layoffs, as it secured $215 million in financing.[17]
In the second quarter of 2010, with a change in management and improved sales, the company’s stock price increased,[18] and on June 15, 2010, Vonage rose 17.06 percent, $0.36 to $2.47.[19]
As part of its restructuring effort in 2010, Vonage paid off $41 million of its debt at par, negotiated the release of more than $40 million in cash from vendors and announced a comprehensive refinancing. This resulted in a $200 million, pre-payable term loan with interest rates at 9.75%. Vonage planned to get better terms by paying down debt ahead of schedule, and by achieving sustained financial performance. Between March and June 2011, Vonage prepaid $70 million, reducing the balance to $130 million, the year-end 2011 target.[20]
Initial public offering[edit]
Vonage offered shares of its stock to its existing customer base in the period before the initial public offering (IPO).[21] Typically, only large institutional investors such as banks are able to buy shares of an IPO.[22] Vonage’s initial public offering occurred on the New York Stock Exchange on May 24, 2006, opening at $17.00 per share.[9] The price closed at $14.85, a decrease of 12.7 percent, the worst trading day for any IPO in 2006 up to that point. The IPO raised $531 million for the company. However, the existing customers who lost money filed a class-action lawsuit.[23] The IPO and its immediate aftermath also earned Vonage a “Business 2.0 Magazine” award as 14th of 101 “Dumbest Moments in Business for 2006”.[24] In 2009, Vonage reached an agreement with IPO investors. All shareholder claims against Vonage and its individual directors and officers who were named as defendants were dismissed.[25][26] The amount of the settlement, $3.6 million, was paid by an insurance policy covering the directors and officers of the company.[27][28][29]
The firms underwriting the IPO, Citigroup, UBS, and Deutsche Bank, were fined a total of $845,000 and ordered to reimburse customers for "failure to adequately supervise communications" with investors.[30] NYSE regulators went so far as to investigate possible short-selling.[31]
Recent acquisitions[edit]
Beginning in 2013, Vonage acquired several companies, including:

Vocalocity, a Software as a Service (SaaS) provider of cloud-based communications services, for $130 million;[32]
Telesphere, a Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS) provider to large companies, for $114 million;[33]
iCore Networks, also a UCSaaS provider to large companies, for $92 million;
SimpleSignal, another UCSaaS service provider to small and medium-sized businesses, for $25 million;[34][35]
gUnify, also a cloud-based communications service provider to businesses (price not disclosed).[36][37][38]
Nexmo, the 2nd largest CPaaS company, for $230 million;[39]

Patent infringement law suits[edit]
On June 19, 2006, Verizon filed a lawsuit charging that Vonage infringed on five of Verizon's patents related to its VoIP service.[40] The patents describe technology for completing phone calls between VoIP users and people using phones on the traditional public switched network, authenticating VoIP callers, validating VoIP callers' accounts, fraud protection, providing enhanced features, using Wi-Fi handsets with VoIP services, and monitoring VoIP caller usage.
In 2007, Vonage launched a viral marketing campaign and website freetocompete.com, which garnered press coverage about Vonage, its campaign, the lawsuits, and issues of competition with established telecom corporations.[41][42][43][44]
On March 8, 2007 a jury found Vonage guilty of infringing three patents held by Verizon, and not guilty of infringing two other patents. The jury ordered Vonage to pay US$58 million, and a royalty rate of 5.5% of every sale to a Vonage customer, back to Verizon. Subsequent to this jury award, there were a series of appeals and intermediate stays on payment. Vonage was punitively ordered by the court to stop signing up new customers;[45] this was reversed on appeal three weeks later.[46] On November 19, 2007 Vonage agreed to pay ~$120 million in damages[47] to Verizon.
In other patent lawsuits, by December 2007, Vonage was ordered to pay $80 million to Sprint Nextel[48] and $39 million to AT&T Inc.[49] Another lawsuit with Nortel resulted in no monetary damages.[50]
2009 customer service settlement[edit]
In November 2009, Vonage agreed to an Assurance of voluntary compliance (AVC) with 32 states. The settlement followed an investigation into complaints about the marketing of Vonage services, including confusion about availability and cost, along with advertisements involving "free" services, money back guarantees and trial periods. The consumer protection agreement also addressed complaints that some consumers were prevented from canceling the Vonage service. In the settlement, Vonage agreed to pay the seven investigating states $3 million for costs, issue refunds to complainants dating back to January 2004, and change several business practices in regard to advertising and customer retention.[51][52]
Services[edit]
Vonage offers cloud communications and calling plans for residential customers and businesses, including small and medium-sized businesses, mid-market companies, and enterprises.
Business Services[edit]
Vonage offers two unified communications platforms for businesses that integrate communications services, such as video conferencing, voicemail transcription, and desktop sharing, using voice as a platform. Cloud communications services allow business customers to connect with various business applications and customer relationship management (CRM) tools through a middleware technology.[53][54]For business customers that rely on high quantities of voice, video and data communications in their day-to-day operations, Vonage provides Quality of Service over its own private Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) network and via a Software Defined Area Network (SD-WAN) product.[55][56][57][58]
Residential Services[edit]
Residential services provide home phone plans using VoIP (voice over internet protocol) over a broadband internet connection, such as cable internet service or DSL. Features for Vonage home phone residential service includes voicemail transcription; 411 calling; caller ID; call waiting; do not disturb; and a network availability feature which forwards all calls to a mobile phone if Internet connectivity is lost.[59][60][61][62] Many of Vonage’s residential products offer international calling plans.[63]
Service requirements[edit]
Vonage customers must have a broadband Internet connection, such as cable Internet service or DSL, through an Internet service provider (ISP). To initiate subscription a customer must provide a billing and shipping address in the country of service. Vonage supplies an analog telephone adapter which connects a customer supplied standard analog telephone to the Internet and the Vonage service.[64]
Residents of the U.S., Canada, and the UK may subscribe to Vonage by credit card from their respective country, but the Vonage adapter can be connected to the Internet anywhere.
Usage is generally referred to as "unlimited", though Vonage has different national "fair use" policies limiting Vonage-to-phone calls to a few thousand minutes per month in the UK,[65] Canada,[66] and U.S.[67] Evidence suggests that calls are limited to a length of 3 hours and 56 minutes.
Telephone number availability[edit]
Subscribers may choose a number in the country of the service they subscribe to for their primary line, in an area code of their choice. Subscribers can obtain additional "virtual numbers" for a monthly fee. Vonage also offers virtual numbers in Mexico, Canada and Europe. While the company supports porting a U.S. telephone number via the FCC's local number portability (LNP), not every phone number is available in every area code. Additionally, customers can transfer an existing number to Vonage, which can take up to 7 to 10 business days from the time the customer completes the Number Transfer Authorization (NTA).[68]
Emergency calls[edit]
Vonage offered 911 service on a VoIP platform for the first time in 2003.[69] For 911 location services to work, subscribers must activate the 911 calling feature by registering their full address with the company. Customers are responsible for maintaining their 911 location information at all times.[70]
If a customer dials 911 before the 911 verification is completed, the call will usually be routed to a national 911 call center where basic information must be given (name, location, nature of emergency, etc.), after which the call is transferred to a local public service answering point, like a local Police Department.[71][72]
Quality of service and equipment compatibility[edit]
VoIP service relies upon consistent broadband-ISP uptime and VoIP-equipment compatibility with the ISP's modem. Although VoIP was initially optimized for voice, some fax equipment can be operated over VoIP,[73][74][75] but compatibility of monitored alarm systems and other devices is less certain.[76] Vonage offers "specially commissioned" Fax Line service.[77] Vonage recommends customers keep a basic traditional landline dedicated to their home alarm system and use Vonage for the rest of their calling needs.[78]
Vonage implements Voice over IP sending audio via RTP and signaling via SIP.[79]

As of 2014, Vonage reported approximately 2.5 million subscriber lines, in conjunction with mobile application services.[2] Through a series of recent acquisitions, Vonage, previously a consumer-focused service provider, expanded its presence in the business marketplace.[3][4][5]

History[edit]
The company was originally called Min-X.com and was based in Melville, New York.[6] Jeffrey Citron, former CEO and majority shareholder at DatekOnline, was the first major investor in the early development stages. In October 2000, Citron invested $1 million as seed capital.[7]
The name was changed to Vonage In December 2000, and in January 2001, Vonage incorporated and moved to Edison, New Jersey.[8]
The company first offered subscription service in the United States, then Canada in 2004 and the United Kingdom in 2005. Vonage went public on May 24, 2006.[9]
In 2005, it relocated its headquarters to Holmdel, New Jersey.[10]
Restructuring efforts[edit]
In 2006, in preparation for an initial public stock offering (IPO), Michael Snyder, former president of ADT Security Services replaced Vonage co-founder Jeffrey A. Citron as CEO.[11] Citron could not preside over the IPO, because he was permanently barred from associating with any securities brokers or dealers.[12][13][14][15] In 2007, in an apparent restructuring effort to reduce ongoing net losses in the face of double-digit stock price slips and patent infringement issues, Snyder resigned, and Citron returned as Interim CEO.[16] The company announced plans for 10% (180) layoffs, as it secured $215 million in financing.[17]
In the second quarter of 2010, with a change in management and improved sales, the company’s stock price increased,[18] and on June 15, 2010, Vonage rose 17.06 percent, $0.36 to $2.47.[19]
As part of its restructuring effort in 2010, Vonage paid off $41 million of its debt at par, negotiated the release of more than $40 million in cash from vendors and announced a comprehensive refinancing. This resulted in a $200 million, pre-payable term loan with interest rates at 9.75%. Vonage planned to get better terms by paying down debt ahead of schedule, and by achieving sustained financial performance. Between March and June 2011, Vonage prepaid $70 million, reducing the balance to $130 million, the year-end 2011 target.[20]
Initial public offering[edit]
Vonage offered shares of its stock to its existing customer base in the period before the initial public offering (IPO).[21] Typically, only large institutional investors such as banks are able to buy shares of an IPO.[22] Vonage’s initial public offering occurred on the New York Stock Exchange on May 24, 2006, opening at $17.00 per share.[9] The price closed at $14.85, a decrease of 12.7 percent, the worst trading day for any IPO in 2006 up to that point. The IPO raised $531 million for the company. However, the existing customers who lost money filed a class-action lawsuit.[23] The IPO and its immediate aftermath also earned Vonage a “Business 2.0 Magazine” award as 14th of 101 “Dumbest Moments in Business for 2006”.[24] In 2009, Vonage reached an agreement with IPO investors. All shareholder claims against Vonage and its individual directors and officers who were named as defendants were dismissed.[25][26] The amount of the settlement, $3.6 million, was paid by an insurance policy covering the directors and officers of the company.[27][28][29]
The firms underwriting the IPO, Citigroup, UBS, and Deutsche Bank, were fined a total of $845,000 and ordered to reimburse customers for "failure to adequately supervise communications" with investors.[30] NYSE regulators went so far as to investigate possible short-selling.[31]
Recent acquisitions[edit]
Beginning in 2013, Vonage acquired several companies, including:

Vocalocity, a Software as a Service (SaaS) provider of cloud-based communications services, for $130 million;[32]
Telesphere, a Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS) provider to large companies, for $114 million;[33]
iCore Networks, also a UCSaaS provider to large companies, for $92 million;
SimpleSignal, another UCSaaS service provider to small and medium-sized businesses, for $25 million;[34][35]
gUnify, also a cloud-based communications service provider to businesses (price not disclosed).[36][37][38]
Nexmo, the 2nd largest CPaaS company, for $230 million;[39]

Patent infringement law suits[edit]
On June 19, 2006, Verizon filed a lawsuit charging that Vonage infringed on five of Verizon's patents related to its VoIP service.[40] The patents describe technology for completing phone calls between VoIP users and people using phones on the traditional public switched network, authenticating VoIP callers, validating VoIP callers' accounts, fraud protection, providing enhanced features, using Wi-Fi handsets with VoIP services, and monitoring VoIP caller usage.
In 2007, Vonage launched a viral marketing campaign and website freetocompete.com, which garnered press coverage about Vonage, its campaign, the lawsuits, and issues of competition with established telecom corporations.[41][42][43][44]
On March 8, 2007 a jury found Vonage guilty of infringing three patents held by Verizon, and not guilty of infringing two other patents. The jury ordered Vonage to pay US$58 million, and a royalty rate of 5.5% of every sale to a Vonage customer, back to Verizon. Subsequent to this jury award, there were a series of appeals and intermediate stays on payment. Vonage was punitively ordered by the court to stop signing up new customers;[45] this was reversed on appeal three weeks later.[46] On November 19, 2007 Vonage agreed to pay ~$120 million in damages[47] to Verizon.
In other patent lawsuits, by December 2007, Vonage was ordered to pay $80 million to Sprint Nextel[48] and $39 million to AT&T Inc.[49] Another lawsuit with Nortel resulted in no monetary damages.[50]
2009 customer service settlement[edit]
In November 2009, Vonage agreed to an Assurance of voluntary compliance (AVC) with 32 states. The settlement followed an investigation into complaints about the marketing of Vonage services, including confusion about availability and cost, along with advertisements involving "free" services, money back guarantees and trial periods. The consumer protection agreement also addressed complaints that some consumers were prevented from canceling the Vonage service. In the settlement, Vonage agreed to pay the seven investigating states $3 million for costs, issue refunds to complainants dating back to January 2004, and change several business practices in regard to advertising and customer retention.[51][52]
Services[edit]
Vonage offers cloud communications and calling plans for residential customers and businesses, including small and medium-sized businesses, mid-market companies, and enterprises.
Business Services[edit]
Vonage offers two unified communications platforms for businesses that integrate communications services, such as video conferencing, voicemail transcription, and desktop sharing, using voice as a platform. Cloud communications services allow business customers to connect with various business applications and customer relationship management (CRM) tools through a middleware technology.[53][54]For business customers that rely on high quantities of voice, video and data communications in their day-to-day operations, Vonage provides Quality of Service over its own private Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) network and via a Software Defined Area Network (SD-WAN) product.[55][56][57][58]
Residential Services[edit]
Residential services provide home phone plans using VoIP (voice over internet protocol) over a broadband internet connection, such as cable internet service or DSL. Features for Vonage home phone residential service includes voicemail transcription; 411 calling; caller ID; call waiting; do not disturb; and a network availability feature which forwards all calls to a mobile phone if Internet connectivity is lost.[59][60][61][62] Many of Vonage’s residential products offer international calling plans.[63]
Service requirements[edit]
Vonage customers must have a broadband Internet connection, such as cable Internet service or DSL, through an Internet service provider (ISP). To initiate subscription a customer must provide a billing and shipping address in the country of service. Vonage supplies an analog telephone adapter which connects a customer supplied standard analog telephone to the Internet and the Vonage service.[64]
Residents of the U.S., Canada, and the UK may subscribe to Vonage by credit card from their respective country, but the Vonage adapter can be connected to the Internet anywhere.
Usage is generally referred to as "unlimited", though Vonage has different national "fair use" policies limiting Vonage-to-phone calls to a few thousand minutes per month in the UK,[65] Canada,[66] and U.S.[67] Evidence suggests that calls are limited to a length of 3 hours and 56 minutes.
Telephone number availability[edit]
Subscribers may choose a number in the country of the service they subscribe to for their primary line, in an area code of their choice. Subscribers can obtain additional "virtual numbers" for a monthly fee. Vonage also offers virtual numbers in Mexico, Canada and Europe. While the company supports porting a U.S. telephone number via the FCC's local number portability (LNP), not every phone number is available in every area code. Additionally, customers can transfer an existing number to Vonage, which can take up to 7 to 10 business days from the time the customer completes the Number Transfer Authorization (NTA).[68]
Emergency calls[edit]
Vonage offered 911 service on a VoIP platform for the first time in 2003.[69] For 911 location services to work, subscribers must activate the 911 calling feature by registering their full address with the company. Customers are responsible for maintaining their 911 location information at all times.[70]
If a customer dials 911 before the 911 verification is completed, the call will usually be routed to a national 911 call center where basic information must be given (name, location, nature of emergency, etc.), after which the call is transferred to a local public service answering point, like a local Police Department.[71][72]
Quality of service and equipment compatibility[edit]
VoIP service relies upon consistent broadband-ISP uptime and VoIP-equipment compatibility with the ISP's modem. Although VoIP was initially optimized for voice, some fax equipment can be operated over VoIP,[73][74][75] but compatibility of monitored alarm systems and other devices is less certain.[76] Vonage offers "specially commissioned" Fax Line service.[77] Vonage recommends customers keep a basic traditional landline dedicated to their home alarm system and use Vonage for the rest of their calling needs.[78]
Vonage implements Voice over IP sending audio via RTP and signaling via SIP.[79]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Vonage Review by WhichVoIP
If you are considering Vonage for your home phone service, you have reached the right place. Vonage is a popular, well-advertised VoIP service that was founded in Edison, New Jersey during the early 2000's with service extending to Canada and the United Kingdom in successive years.  Vonage has had discrepancies in the past regarding user cancellation and advertisements involving 
		"free" services. Since then, however, Vonage has undergone several changes in business and advertising practices. 
		In its 4th quarter financial report that was released in February 2015, Vonage 
		states that it has almost 2.5 million subscribers, maintaining its 
		position as one of the largest VoIP providers in the USA. 
The Good
Vonage offers a 30 day Money Back Guarantee that covers monthly charges, taxes and any shipping or activation fees. This guarantee, combined with a low introductory rate creates a welcoming offer for those who want to try the service out before committing long term.
Standard features are included with all plans, such as call transfer, call waiting, 3-way calling, caller ID, caller ID block and Vonage Extensions, which allows plans to be used from mobile phones. Voicemail can also be accessed from any phone or PC. Premium features are also available, such as virtual numbers, fax lines, additional phone lines, toll free lines and softphone.
		A quick note on Vonage caller ID. By default your outgoing caller ID has a 13 character limit and it tries to use your last name and first initial. If, for some reason, you choose to perform caller ID block (dial *67) it will block your Vonage caller ID and instead use Anonymous.
		These days, this is frowned upon and many providers use Anonymous call block so your call will not get through to its intended recipient.
The World plan is a very popular option for users that 
		frequently make international calls due to its unlimited 
		international calling to 60 countries feature.
The free Vonage Mobile App offers free video calling and video messaging for iPhone and Android users. The app has received high ratings across both operating systems. 
Vonage is more accessible to customers than many other providers. Support is available via phone 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, with live chat support available through their website Monday 
		to Sunday: 9am to 10:30pm. 
Call quality is consistent for inbound and outbound domestic calls across all phone types and devices. Calls have generally been reported to be at 
		"landline" or above sound quality.
The Bad
Vonage is a popular service and has accumulated a good number of user reviews. The majority of users on WhichVoIP reviewed Vonage negatively and do not recommend the service to others, with additional monthly fees and difficulties in resolving service issues being the primary complaint.
If a plan under contract is cancelled early, a fee of up to $99.99 may be charged per voice line. 
International phone calls have been reported to have lower sound quality than domestic calls. The quality of international calls varies from country to country. 
The Bottom Line

Vonage offers both nationwide and international residential plans. Each plan includes free activation, free calling to other residential Vonage customers, the option to keep your current phone number or a new one, and free shipping of the Vonage Box adapter with one-year subscriptions. If they prefer, customers can sign up without committing to a one-year contract. 
U.S. and Canada Unlimited plan: 
			$9.99 a month for the first 12 months, after which the 
			price increases to $25.99 a month. Although this is an 
			unlimited plan, there is a "normal usage" limit of 3000 
			minutes per month, after which minutes are billed at 
			3.9c a min.
U.S. and Canada 400 plan: A one-year agreement at $12.99 a month with free shipping and activation or a no annual contract option at the same $12.99 a month price without free shipping and activation. This plan includes 400 minutes to landlines and mobiles within the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico, with additional minutes priced at 5 cents each and low rates within 10 other countries. 
			
U.S. and Canada 800 plan: A one-year agreement at $21.99 a month with free shipping and activation or a no annual contract option at the same $21.99 a month price without free shipping and activation. This plan includes 800 minutes to landlines and mobiles within the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico, with additional minutes priced at 3.9 cents and low international rates. 
			
World plans - these include a regular world plan that has unlimited landline calling to 60 countries plus mobile phones in 10 countries. The world plus plan is slightly more expensive but that plan adds 250 monthly minutes for calls to mobiles in 40+ countries. There is also a specific plan for those that are frequent callers to Mexico or the Philippines. The Mexico plan offers unlimited calling to both landlines and mobile phones in Mexico and North America, while the Philippine plan provides 3,000 minutes of monthly calling to Globe numbers in the Philippines. 
			Again, remember that the unlimited calling is only 
			unlimited up to the 3,000 minutes per month that are 
			deemed to be within regular usage limits.

Overall Thoughts
Compared to other VoIP services with similar minute plans and features, Vonage is more expensive (after the 
		12 month introductory rate expires). While Vonage's business services are well-reviewed only 35% of the over 300 reviews on WhichVoIP recommend its residential service. 
Vonage's strengths lie 
		in its size, which provides for a more stable and more 
		accessible service to customers when compared to smaller 
		VoIP providers. If you plan on using a good number of 
		minutes monthly at home or the home office the unlimited 
		plans offer a cost effective solution, while the World plans 
		are a great option frequent international callers.



Vonage Overview
WhichVoIP has amassed over 300 user submitted Vonage reviews since it started covering Vonage in 2005. The extensive list below should be able to give you a full picture of what to expect if you sign up for the service.
WhichVoIP note - Please check Vonage reasonable usage policy for details of its requirements and limits around unlimited calling plans.
decent service and I am fairly happy

If you are looking for service through Vonage, plan to pay for the first month with no service.  I requested to have my number ported to them on June 28th and as 
of today, July 17th, I am still being told it will take 2 days for this to happen.  I have called every 2 days and get told the same thing every time I call.  When I ask to 
speak with a supervisor they totally ignore my request.  Do not start this process if you can avoid it!

I could give various ratings, but there is no point because they have been dishonest with me. I 
signed up for a Christmas rebate, then later, after the minimum service period of 60 days, plus 
a few weeks, I couldn't get a valid number for customer service and their Live Chat wasn't working. 
Through emails they gave me the runaround about my rebate with no explanation of why they 
listed the status as $75 BUT "invalid, amount not verified" then later "invalid, promotion 
expired". Since then emails have stated variously it has been "under review", "needs further 
research", and it's in "an escalation process"! It's been several months now. I'm confused 
because I don't see how a company can be legit and yet act like a scam. Furthermore, one time I 
needed to call a local hospital quickly but the 411 service listed only animal hospitals, with 
no way to try again or clarify!

Vonage practices
false advertising. I
was enticed to get
my phone services
from them with a
$75.00 VISA card.
EVERY TIME I have
tried to use it is
has been declined,
including paying for
services from
VONAGE. I tried to
resolve this using
chat, and I was told
I needed to contact
the number on the
card. That number
only allows me to
leave a message and
purchase new
services. So I
contacted VONAGE to
disconnect my
services and not
only do I need to
pay the remainder of
the contract but to
add insult to injury
I can't use the VISA
card VONAGE gave me.
So again I say
VONAGE HAS false
advertising
practices and I will
not be continuing my
phone services with
VONAGE once the
contract expires.

I've been a Vonage customer for over 10 years and they by and large provide good service and I 
like many of the features they offer (especially Extensions which lets you use their service on 
your mobile phone).  As with any service, there are other options now on the market and they are 
more price competitive while Vonage has increased rates for existing customers over the years.  
It may be worth exploring other options.

I still haven't connected yet to the service as I am waiting for my number to switch over, but I 
have received my first bill already. I am suppose to get the service for $9.99 a month for the 
first year with the first month free, but they tack another $9.00 on for so called surcharges, taxes and fees. I might just take advantage of my 30 day money back guarantee and give up the home phone 
altogether.  Also I was charged from the first day I signed up even though my phone number isn't 
scheduled to be transferred for 4 days.  I feel like this is unfair trade practices.  It would 
have been nice if there were at least fine print that explained all of this stuff.

As a small business Vonage has caused me to lose business because I cannot rely on the phones 
working daily. Constant dropped calls, right now I cannot dial out on my office phone. I call for 
a remedy and they tell me it is my server and then the very next day I get an email sent to all 
Vonage customers explaining the reason for the very problem that they said was my server. 
FRUSTRATING! Dropped calls and phone outages have definitely caused me to lose many orders. I 
would advise everyone to reconsider before using Vonage for a business. Especially if you take 
orders over the phone. My worst choice for phone service ever.

WhichVoIP Visitor Comments #2 : Posted by Joe
I am considering getting rid of my landline for vonage. I 
have no cell service where I live. I am on satellite 
internet, and, I wonder what happens to my phone 
service when I have used up my 10 gig of high speed 
internet, and the provider switches me to very very slow 
speed. Does my phone still work then?
-> Response: To be honest I think you may struggle to get decent audio if using Vonage (or any VoIP service) over satellite. The latency and jitter for satellite Internet causes a lot of problems for VoIP.  
#1 : Posted by Linda Morey
Does Vonage offer a phone service that can be used with 
home security systems?
-> Response: Security systems can be troublesome for VoIP service in general, regardless of the provider. This VoIP and home security article may help explain the issues and potential ways around them.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
