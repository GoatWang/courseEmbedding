Home | About Us


About Us

QC Industrial Solutions is a packaging company that specializes in timely delivery and excellent customer service. We currently have three warehouses, Paris, TN, Pleasant View, TN and Hopkinsville KY.
We have four main goals:

To build strong, long-term relationships with our valued customers by giving them our very best in products and services with fair pricing. We hope to provide one single source for all packaging needs.
To consistently increase our line of products in order to satisfy all of our customers’ needs. We endeavor to do this through fair and ethical treatment of our suppliers. Suppliers are selected based on a set of criteria that we have established with our customers’ needs in mind, not just based on who is the “cheapest” at the moment.
To carefully expand into new areas with a focus on creating steady jobs for honest, hard-working people. We strive to provide a good working environment, where reliability, hard work, and creativity are rewarded.
To be good citizens of the communities we serve, participating appropriately in local charities and events. This can be very challenging, with limited budgets, and so many worthy causes to choose from. We try to contribute where we feel it will do the most good for the most people.

We strive to meet our customers’ needs with a mixture of stock and custom packaging products.
Our ultimate goal is to provide everything needed to get the product out the door. We offer effective packaging solutions, and strive to find our customers a cost savings. We currently serve the Middle Tennessee, West Tennessee, and Southern Kentucky areas.
We also offer several different types of services such as kitting and inventory management. Boxes that are built into “kits” are delivered assembled and ready to be loaded with our customers’ products. This can provide a real savings, allowing customers to keep their specialized employees focused on using their valuable skills and knowledge to build the product that goes into the box. A typical kit might consist of a pallet, a box, a lid, and some internal packaging to secure the product in transit. Our inventory management policies are tailored to the needs of each individual program. We do everything for run-and ship to just-in-time supply to vendor managed inventory on site at our customer’s plant.
When we manage inventory for our customers and deliver as required. This reduces the need for storage space in the customer’s facility, and frees up manufacturing space, which is so valuable in today’s market. By simplifying month-end inventories, and significantly reducing on-hand quantities, this service also frees up personnel to fulfill other needs of you company.
We sell all forms of expendable packaging, which includes corrugated RSC’s, HSC’s, tubes, pads, die-cuts and partitions.
We also provide:

stretch wrap
steel and plastic strapping, seals, buckles, and tools
labels and card stock, printed and plain, plus thermal transfer printer ribbons
foam padding (PE, EPS, CLPE, EPE, EPP, PU, etc)
foam sheeting
bubble wrap
poly-bags and film (HDPE and LDPE)
plastic end caps (HDPE, MDPE, LDPE)
metal bail ties

We provide timely delivery of our products to the Middle and West Tennessee and Southern Kentucky area. Because we use our own trucks, we control the schedule, and can be responsive to our customers’ needs.
For in-stock items, we will usually arrive at your facility in a matter of hours, not days or weeks. We will adapt our delivery schedules to your production needs, even making after-hours deliveries if needed.

QCIS will accommodate our customers’ needs.

The Democratsâ Better Way: Positive Messaging or Pandering to Trump Voters Who Are Never Coming Back?



George Washington law professor and economist praises Democrats for coming up with a message that preserves the partyâs commitment to social justice issues, rather than attempting to woo Trump voters by appealing to what Trump appealed to.
