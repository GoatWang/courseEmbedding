Home | About Us


About Us

QC Industrial Solutions is a packaging company that specializes in timely delivery andÂ excellent customer service. We currently have three warehouses, Paris, TN, Pleasant View, TN andÂ Hopkinsville KY.
We have four main goals:

To build strong, long-term relationships with our valued customers by giving them ourÂ very best in products and services with fair pricing. We hope to provide one singleÂ source for all packaging needs.
To consistently increase our line of products in order to satisfy all of our customersâÂ needs. We endeavor to do this through fair and ethical treatment of our suppliers.Â Suppliers are selected based on a set of criteria that we have established with ourÂ customersâ needs in mind, not just based on who is the âcheapestâ at the moment.
To carefully expand into new areas with a focus on creating steady jobs for honest, hard-working people. We strive to provide a good working environment, where reliability,Â hard work, and creativity are rewarded.
To be good citizens of the communities we serve, participating appropriately in localÂ charities and events. This can be very challenging, with limited budgets, and so manyÂ worthy causes to choose from. We try to contribute where we feel it will do the mostÂ good for the most people.

We strive to meet our customersâ needs with a mixture of stock and custom packaging products.
Our ultimate goal is to provide everything needed to get the product out the door. We offerÂ effective packaging solutions, and strive to find our customers a cost savings. We currently serveÂ the Middle Tennessee, West Tennessee, and Southern Kentucky areas.
We also offer several different types of services such as kitting and inventory management.Â Boxes that are built into âkitsâ are delivered assembled and ready to be loaded with ourÂ customersâ products. This can provide a real savings, allowing customers to keep theirÂ specialized employees focused on using their valuable skills and knowledge to build the productÂ that goes into the box. A typical kit might consist of a pallet, a box, a lid, and some internalÂ packaging to secure the product in transit. Our inventory management policies are tailored toÂ the needs of each individual program. We do everything for run-and ship to just-in-time supplyÂ to vendor managed inventory on site at our customerâs plant.
When we manage inventory for our customers and deliver as required. This reduces the need forÂ storage space in the customerâs facility, and frees up manufacturing space, which is so valuableÂ in todayâs market. By simplifying month-end inventories, and significantly reducing on-handÂ quantities, this service also frees up personnel to fulfill other needs of you company.
We sell all forms of expendable packaging, which includes corrugated RSCâs, HSCâs, tubes,Â pads, die-cuts and partitions.
We also provide:

stretch wrap
steel and plastic strapping, seals, buckles, and tools
labels and card stock, printed and plain, plus thermal transfer printer ribbons
foam padding (PE, EPS, CLPE, EPE, EPP, PU, etc)
foam sheeting
bubble wrap
poly-bags and film (HDPE and LDPE)
plastic end caps (HDPE, MDPE, LDPE)
metal bail ties
VCI bags, paper, film, and other products

Delivery


We provide timely delivery of our products to the Middle and West Tennessee and Southern KentuckyÂ area. Because we use our own trucks, we control the schedule, and can be responsive to ourÂ customersâ needs.
For in-stock items, we will usually arrive at your facility in a matter of hours, not days orÂ weeks. We will adapt our delivery schedules to your production needs, even making after-hoursÂ deliveries if needed.
For customers who need delivery outside of our normal delivery area, we can find a freightÂ solution that fits the situation. Some customers prefer to arrange their own freight, and takeÂ advantage of their volume buying power. Some want us to contact carriers directly. QCIS willÂ accommodate our customersâ needs.
