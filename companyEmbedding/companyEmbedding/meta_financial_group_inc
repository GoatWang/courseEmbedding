Apr 26 17
Meta Financial Group, Inc. reported unaudited consolidated earnings results for the second quarter and six months ended March 31, 2017. For the quarter, the company's net interest income was $23,966,000 against $19,938,000 a year ago. The increase was primarily driven by higher volumes in the loan portfolio, growth in specialty finance loans, which includes a full quarter of the student loan portfolio purchased in December 2016, and higher volume and yields attained from investments, primarily in high credit quality, tax-exempt municipal bonds and floating rate asset-backed securities. Income before income tax expense was $40,541,000 against $17,876,000 a year ago. Net income was $32,142,000 or $3.42 per diluted share against $14,283,000 or $1.67 per diluted share a year ago. The increase in net income was due to an increase of $51.3 million in non-interest income, partially offset by an increase of $25.2 million in non-interest expense. Total revenue was $116.1 million, compared to $60.8 million for the same quarter in 2016, an increase of $55.3 million, or 91%, primarily due to growth in tax product fee income, card fee income and interest from loans and investments. 

For the six months, the company's net interest income was $43,799,000 against $37,493,000 a year ago. Income before income tax expense was $42,127,000 against $21,471,000 a year ago.

Meta Financial Group, Inc.® Reports Results For First Quarter Of Fiscal 2017






GlobeNewswire



Jan 30, 2017 4:05 PM EST













 


















































 SIOUX FALLS, S.D., Jan. 30, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Meta Financial Group, Inc. ® (Nasdaq:CASH) (" MFG," " Meta" or the " Company")  Business Developments   MetaBank entered into an agreement with H&R Block in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 to provide funding for interest-free refund advance loans for H&R Block tax preparation customers throughout the 2017 tax season. H&R Block is the world's largest tax services provider with approximately 12,000 company-owned and franchise retail locations. On November 1, 2016, MetaBank completed the acquisition from privately held Drake Enterprises, Ltd. ("Drake") of substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of EPS Financial LLC ("EPS"), a leading provider of comprehensive tax-related financial transaction solutions for over 10,000 electronic return originators nationwide. These solutions include a full suite of refund settlement products, prepaid payroll card solutions and merchant services, offering a one-stop shop for all tax preparer financial transactions. The purchase price for the acquisition included the payment of approximately $21.3 million in cash and the issuance of 369,179 shares of Meta common stock to Drake. MetaBank acquired EPS assets with estimated fair values of $17.9 million of intangible assets, including customer relationships, trademark, and non-compete agreements, and $0.1 million of other assets, resulting in goodwill of $30.4 million. The Company also recorded a negligible amount of liabilities. On December 14, 2016, MetaBank completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and specified liabilities of Specialty Consumer Services LP ("SCS"), a FinTech provider of consumer tax advances and other consumer credit services through its propriety underwriting model and loan management system.  The assets acquired by MetaBank in the SCS acquisition include the SCS trade name, proprietary underwriting model and loan management system and other assets. The purchase price for the acquisition included the payment of approximately $7.5 million in cash to SCS and the issuance of 113,328 shares of Meta common stock to SCS' stakeholders on behalf of SCS. In addition, contingent consideration of up to $41.1 million (estimated fair value), payable in cash and Meta common stock, will be paid if certain performance benchmarks are achieved subsequent to closing. MetaBank acquired SCS assets with estimated fair values of $28.1 million of intangible assets, including customer relationships, trademark, and non-compete agreements, and negligible other assets, resulting in goodwill of $31.6 million. The Company also recorded a liability of $17.3 million, which consisted of the fair value of the contingent cash earn out. In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, MetaBank and Jackson Hewitt finalized an agreement whereby MetaBank will be originating, underwriting and servicing Express Refund Advances to Jackson Hewitt customers. As previously announced on December 8, 2016, Rodney Muilenburg, 72, retired from Meta's Board of Directors after 27 years of service effective at the end of his term at the Company's annual meeting on January 23, 2017. On December 20, 2016, MetaBank purchased, net of purchase discount, a $134.0 million seasoned, floating rate, private student loan portfolio. All loans are indexed to three-month LIBOR. The portfolio is serviced by ReliaMax Lending Services, LLC and insured by ReliaMax Surety Company. Based on the purchase discount and projected prepayment rates, the Company expects to realize current net yields of over 5%.   Financial Highlights for the 2017 fiscal first quarter ended December 31, 2016  The Company recorded net income of $1.2 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, for the three months ended December 31, 2016, compared to net income of $4.1 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, for the three months ended December 31, 2015. The 2017 fiscal first quarter pre-tax results included $1.5 million in amortization of intangibles, $1.2 million in securities losses, $1.2 million in non-cash stock-related compensation associated with employee agreements for three executive officers, $1.0 million in direct tax season startup expenses, and $1.0 million of acquisition-related expenses. Net interest income was $19.8 million in the 2017 fiscal first quarter, an increase of $2.3 million, or 13%, compared to the first quarter of 2016.  The increase was primarily driven by higher volumes in the loan portfolio and higher volume and yields attained from investments, primarily in high credit quality, tax-exempt municipal bonds. Card fee income increased $3.2 million, or 21%, for the 2017 fiscal first quarter when compared to the same quarter in 2016, continuing growth seen in the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by prepaid deposit growth and current promotional programs from one of our largest business partners. The Company's fiscal 2017 first quarter average assets grew to $3.49 billion, compared to $2.69 billion in the 2016 first quarter, an increase of 30%. The Company's average cash balance during the fiscal 2017 first quarter was $201.4 million, and the end of period cash balance was $695.7 million at December 31, 2016.  The Company held much higher than typical historical cash balances in the quarter as it prepared, tested and began building wholesale funding sources for tax-related lending in the Company's 2017 second quarter. Also contributing to the higher cash balances was the Company's decision to forgo its typical dollar cost averaging investment purchases in anticipation of the Company's funding of tax related lending and the student loan portfolio that was purchased on December 20, 2016. Total loans receivable, net of allowance for loan losses, increased $369.9 million, or 50%, at December 31, 2016, compared to December 31, 2015.  This increase is primarily related to growth in consumer loans of $138.3 million, of which $134.0 million is attributable to the previously mentioned student loan portfolio purchase and commercial real estate loans of $118.4 million. Premium finance loans at December 31, 2016 were up $68.9 million, or 62%, compared to December 31, 2015. Retail bank loans at December 31, 2016 were up $158.4 million, or 26%, compared to December 31, 2015. Excluding the purchased student loan portfolio, total loans receivable, net of allowance for loan losses, at December 31, 2016 were up $236.0 million, or 32%, compared to December 31, 2015. Non-performing assets ("NPAs") were 0.05% of total assets at December 31, 2016, compared to 0.22% at December 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily due to a partial charge-off related to a large, non-performing agricultural relationship in the fiscal 2016 third quarter, which does not have any remaining loan balance.  "We are excited that we closed two separate FinTech acquisitions during the first quarter of fiscal 2017," said Chairman and CEO J. Tyler Haahr. "In early November, we acquired EPS Financial and have already seen positive effects from this transaction. Then in mid-December, we closed the acquisition with SCS. We welcome EPS President Clark Gill and the entire EPS team along with SCS CEO Brent Turner and the SCS team to the Meta family. We believe that these transactions solidify Meta as a leader in the tax payments industry. "Much to our satisfaction, we didn't stop with the EPS and SCS acquisitions during the quarter, as we entered into agreements with both H&R Block and Jackson Hewitt. Meta will provide underwriting services, servicing and funding for interest-free refund advance loans for H&R Block customers throughout the 2017 tax season. Our agreement with Jackson Hewitt includes underwriting, servicing and originating Express Refund Advances to Jackson Hewitt customers during the upcoming tax season. Our collective tax businesses will see a significantly increased expense burden in the first and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2017, with approximately 85% to 90% of tax-related income expected to come in during the second quarter. The levels of income and expenses during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 were in line with our expectations. While it is too early in the tax season to accurately predict volume levels, we believe that our infrastructure and funding capacity is well prepared for the upcoming peak period. Meta is excited about these business developments and we are looking forward to continuing Meta's success into 2017 and beyond."  Financial Summary  Revenue Total revenue for the fiscal 2017 first quarter was $39.2 million, compared to $34.4 million for the same quarter in 2016, an increase of $4.8 million, or 14%, primarily due to growth in card fee income, income from tax-exempt securities (included in other investment securities), and interest from loans, which was partially offset, as expected, by delayed securities purchases and higher cash balances.

Meta Financial Group, Inc.® Reports Results for First Quarter of Fiscal 2017
Meta builds infrastructure and positions itself for 2017 tax season



















January 30, 2017 16:05 ET

 | Source: MetaBank






SIOUX FALLS, S.D., Jan.  30, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Meta Financial Group, Inc.® (Nasdaq:CASH) (“MFG,” “Meta” or the “Company”) Business Developments MetaBank entered into an agreement with H&R Block in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 to provide funding for interest-free refund advance loans for H&R Block tax preparation customers throughout the 2017 tax season. H&R Block is the world's largest tax services provider with approximately 12,000 company-owned and franchise retail locations.On November 1, 2016, MetaBank completed the acquisition from privately held Drake Enterprises, Ltd. (“Drake”) of substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of EPS Financial LLC ("EPS"), a leading provider of comprehensive tax-related financial transaction solutions for over 10,000 electronic return originators nationwide. These solutions include a full suite of refund settlement products, prepaid payroll card solutions and merchant services, offering a one-stop shop for all tax preparer financial transactions. The purchase price for the acquisition included the payment of approximately $21.3 million in cash and the issuance of 369,179 shares of Meta common stock to Drake. MetaBank acquired EPS assets with estimated fair values of $17.9 million of intangible assets, including customer relationships, trademark, and non-compete agreements, and $0.1 million of other assets, resulting in goodwill of $30.4 million. The Company also recorded a negligible amount of liabilities.On December 14, 2016, MetaBank completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and specified liabilities of Specialty Consumer Services LP (“SCS”), a FinTech provider of consumer tax advances and other consumer credit services through its propriety underwriting model and loan management system.  The assets acquired by MetaBank in the SCS acquisition include the SCS trade name, proprietary underwriting model and loan management system and other assets. The purchase price for the acquisition included the payment of approximately $7.5 million in cash to SCS and the issuance of 113,328 shares of Meta common stock to SCS’ stakeholders on behalf of SCS. In addition, contingent consideration of up to $41.1 million (estimated fair value), payable in cash and Meta common stock, will be paid if certain performance benchmarks are achieved subsequent to closing. MetaBank acquired SCS assets with estimated fair values of $28.1 million of intangible assets, including customer relationships, trademark, and non-compete agreements, and negligible other assets, resulting in goodwill of $31.6 million. The Company also recorded a liability of $17.3 million, which consisted of the fair value of the contingent cash earn out.In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, MetaBank and Jackson Hewitt finalized an agreement whereby MetaBank will be originating, underwriting and servicing Express Refund Advances to Jackson Hewitt customers.As previously announced on December 8, 2016, Rodney Muilenburg, 72, retired from Meta's Board of Directors after 27 years of service effective at the end of his term at the Company's annual meeting on January 23, 2017.On December 20, 2016, MetaBank purchased, net of purchase discount, a $134.0 million seasoned, floating rate, private student loan portfolio. All loans are indexed to three-month LIBOR. The portfolio is serviced by ReliaMax Lending Services, LLC and insured by ReliaMax Surety Company. Based on the purchase discount and projected prepayment rates, the Company expects to realize current net yields of over 5%. Financial Highlights for the 2017 fiscal first quarter ended December 31, 2016 The Company recorded net income of $1.2 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, for the three months ended December 31, 2016, compared to net income of $4.1 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, for the three months ended December 31, 2015. The 2017 fiscal first quarter pre-tax results included $1.5 million in amortization of intangibles, $1.2 million in securities losses, $1.2 million in non-cash stock-related compensation associated with employee agreements for three executive officers, $1.0 million in direct tax season startup expenses, and $1.0 million of acquisition-related expenses.Net interest income was $19.8 million in the 2017 fiscal first quarter, an increase of $2.3 million, or 13%, compared to the first quarter of 2016.  The increase was primarily driven by higher volumes in the loan portfolio and higher volume and yields attained from investments, primarily in high credit quality, tax-exempt municipal bonds.Card fee income increased $3.2 million, or 21%, for the 2017 fiscal first quarter when compared to the same quarter in 2016, continuing growth seen in the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by prepaid deposit growth and current promotional programs from one of our largest business partners.The Company's fiscal 2017 first quarter average assets grew to $3.49 billion, compared to $2.69 billion in the 2016 first quarter, an increase of 30%.The Company's average cash balance during the fiscal 2017 first quarter was $201.4 million, and the end of period cash balance was $695.7 million at December 31, 2016.  The Company held much higher than typical historical cash balances in the quarter as it prepared, tested and began building wholesale funding sources for tax-related lending in the Company's 2017 second quarter. Also contributing to the higher cash balances was the Company's decision to forgo its typical dollar cost averaging investment purchases in anticipation of the Company's funding of tax related lending and the student loan portfolio that was purchased on December 20, 2016.Total loans receivable, net of allowance for loan losses, increased $369.9 million, or 50%, at December 31, 2016, compared to December 31, 2015.  This increase is primarily related to growth in consumer loans of $138.3 million, of which $134.0 million is attributable to the previously mentioned student loan portfolio purchase and commercial real estate loans of $118.4 million. Premium finance loans at December 31, 2016 were up $68.9 million, or 62%, compared to December 31, 2015. Retail bank loans at December 31, 2016 were up $158.4 million, or 26%, compared to December 31, 2015. Excluding the purchased student loan portfolio, total loans receivable, net of allowance for loan losses, at December 31, 2016 were up $236.0 million, or 32%, compared to December 31, 2015.Non-performing assets (“NPAs”) were 0.05% of total assets at December 31, 2016, compared to 0.22% at December 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily due to a partial charge-off related to a large, non-performing agricultural relationship in the fiscal 2016 third quarter, which does not have any remaining loan balance. "We are excited that we closed two separate FinTech acquisitions during the first quarter of fiscal 2017," said Chairman and CEO J. Tyler Haahr. "In early November, we acquired EPS Financial and have already seen positive effects from this transaction. Then in mid-December, we closed the acquisition with SCS. We welcome EPS President Clark Gill and the entire EPS team along with SCS CEO Brent Turner and the SCS team to the Meta family. We believe that these transactions solidify Meta as a leader in the tax payments industry. "Much to our satisfaction, we didn't stop with the EPS and SCS acquisitions during the quarter, as we entered into agreements with both H&R Block and Jackson Hewitt. Meta will provide underwriting services, servicing and funding for interest-free refund advance loans for H&R Block customers throughout the 2017 tax season. Our agreement with Jackson Hewitt includes underwriting, servicing and originating Express Refund Advances to Jackson Hewitt customers during the upcoming tax season. Our collective tax businesses will see a significantly increased expense burden in the first and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2017, with approximately 85% to 90% of tax-related income expected to come in during the second quarter. The levels of income and expenses during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 were in line with our expectations. While it is too early in the tax season to accurately predict volume levels, we believe that our infrastructure and funding capacity is well prepared for the upcoming peak period. Meta is excited about these business developments and we are looking forward to continuing Meta's success into 2017 and beyond.” Financial Summary Revenue Total revenue for the fiscal 2017 first quarter was $39.2 million, compared to $34.4 million for the same quarter in 2016, an increase of $4.8 million, or 14%, primarily due to growth in card fee income, income from tax-exempt securities (included in other investment securities), and interest from loans, which was partially offset, as expected, by delayed securities purchases and higher cash balances. Net Income           The Company recorded net income of $1.2 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, for the three months ended December 31, 2016, compared to net income of $4.1 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, for the three months ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in net income was due to an increase of $6.7 million in non-interest expense, partially offset by increases of $2.3 million in net interest income and $2.5 million in non-interest income. The 2017 fiscal first quarter pre-tax results included $1.5 million of amortization of intangibles and $1.0 million of acquisition related expenses. In preparation for the upcoming tax season, 2017 first quarter pre-tax results also included $1.2 million in securities losses, and $1.0 million in direct tax season startup expenses, which consisted primarily of legal and wholesale deposit interest expense. In addition, pre-tax results included $1.2 million in named executive officer ("NEO") non-cash stock related compensation associated with stock awards granted in connection with the Company's three highest paid executives signing long-term employment agreements to solidify their long term commitment to the Company. These stock awards vest over eight years. We expect non-cash stock related compensation associated with these agreements to be $8.0 million in fiscal year 2017 and $5.1 million in fiscal year 2018. The 2017 fiscal first quarter results highlight the increased seasonality of the Company's revenue due to the addition of the aforementioned tax-related acquisitions and agreements. Our tax divisions are expected to continue to generate the vast majority of their revenues in the Company's fiscal second quarter, with some additional revenues in the third quarter, while most expenses are spread throughout the year with some additional elevated expenses in the December and March quarters. Net Interest Income Net interest income for the fiscal 2017 first quarter was $19.8 million, up $2.3 million, or 13%, from the same quarter in 2016, primarily due to increases in volume and rate in tax exempt and asset backed investments and continued sizable loan growth funded by non-interest bearing prepaid deposit growth.  Additionally, the overall increase was driven by a better mix and higher percentage of loans and higher yielding investments primarily in high credit quality tax-exempt municipal bonds.  While the Company carried a higher than typical cash balance due to testing and implementation of new funding programs to support the interest-free refund advance loans, overall net interest income was not materially affected as the funding costs were similar to the rate earned on excess cash balances. However, due to the student loan portfolio purchase and tax-related lending, the Company deferred significant securities purchases that would have historically taken place in the August to December months. As a result of the deferral of securities purchases, net interest income was negatively affected, as compared to the comparable prior fiscal year period. Given the significant, recent increase in interest rates, we expect these deferred purchases, which the Company anticipates will take place in February and March, will have significantly higher yields, providing a strong positive effect on earnings going forward. Net Interest Margin Net Interest Margin ("NIM") decreased from 3.21% in the fiscal 2016 first quarter to 2.90% in the 2017 first quarter. Excluding the subordinated debt issuance in 2016, NIM would have been 13 basis points higher for the quarter. As mentioned above, NIM during the 2017 first quarter was adversely impacted as the Company carried a higher than typical cash balance due to testing and implementation of new funding programs to support the interest-free tax refund advance lending program.  Removing the excess cash and its corresponding funding cost, the Company estimates NIM would have been an additional approximate 13-17 basis points higher. While the subordinated debt issuance in 2016 increased the cost of funds at the Company level, MetaBank's cost of funds remained at levels much lower than the overall Company cost of funds, though somewhat higher than historical levels due to preparation for the new tax season funding programs.  The overall tax equivalent yield (“TEY”) on average earning asset yields decreased by 9 basis points when comparing the fiscal 2017 first quarter to the 2016 first quarter, primarily due to the aforementioned higher cash balance.  Adjusting for a more normalized cash balance, the Company estimates the TEY earning asset yield would have been between 15 to 18 basis points higher. We believe that the Company's expanded portfolio of floating rate assets provides a runway for higher NIM levels should short-term interest rates continue to rise. The Company also seeks to remain diligent and disciplined when evaluating loan pool deal flow to continue to optimize the deployment of our national, non-interest bearing deposit base. We anticipate that many of these loan pools could add immediate earnings accretion with acceptable risk parameters, as we believe to be the case with the recent student loan portfolio purchase. In that respect, while the addition of the student loan portfolio did not materially affect NIM or the TEY on average earning assets in the current quarter as the portfolio purchase was completed near the end of the quarter, the impact should be positive going forward. The fiscal 2017 first quarter TEY on the securities portfolio increased by two basis points compared to the comparable prior year fiscal quarter primarily due to a shifting mix in the investment portfolio with new investments in overall higher yielding investment securities rather than mortgage-backed securities ("MBS").  We also expect margins to increase in 2017 with slower premium amortization on the MBS portfolio due to recent higher rates. The Company’s average interest-earning assets for the fiscal 2017 first quarter grew by $719.8 million, or 29%, to $3.22 billion, from the same quarter in 2016, primarily from growth in tax exempt investment securities, loan portfolios, and cash and fed funds sold of $230.3 million, $147.9 million, and $140.8 million, respectively.  Overall, the cost of funds for all deposits and borrowings averaged 0.36% during the fiscal 2017 first quarter, compared to 0.12% for the 2016 first quarter, primarily due to the issuance of the Company's subordinated debt in 2016 and the testing and implementation of additional funding programs throughout the quarter. Notwithstanding this increase, the Company believes that its growing, low-cost deposit base gives it a distinct and significant competitive advantage over most banks, and even more so if interest rates rise, because the Company anticipates that its cost of funds will likely remain relatively low, increasing less than at many other banks. Average earning assets for the three months ended December 31, 2016 increased 29% from the comparable prior year period, while interest-bearing liabilities increased by 61% related to the wholesale deposits described above. The TEY of MBS and other investments was 2.92% for the three months ended December 31, 2016, and 2.90% for the same period in 2015, and is expected to increase further early in 2017 because of the recent increase in rates. Non-Interest Income Fiscal 2017 first quarter non-interest income of $19.3 million increased $2.5 million, or 15%, from $16.8 million in the same quarter of 2016, primarily due to an increase in card fee income of $3.2 million, or 21%, mainly from new and existing business partners and sales promotions from one of our largest business partners. This increase was partially offset by a loss on the sale of securities of $1.2 million. Non-Interest Expense Non-interest expense increased $6.7 million, or 22%, to $36.8 million for the 2017 fiscal first quarter, compared to the same quarter in 2016.  Between these quarters, compensation expense increased $3.2 million, legal and consulting expense increased $1.6 million due primarily to the aforementioned acquisitions and loan funding transactions, other expense increased $0.6 million, occupancy and equipment expense increased $0.6 million and amortization expense increased $0.3 million, primarily due to the recent acquisitions. The increase in compensation was primarily due to the EPS and SCS acquisitions, non-cash stock related compensation associated with three NEOs signing long-term employment agreements, and additional staffing to support the Company’s growth initiatives. We expect the growth rate in compensation expense to decrease during the remainder of 2017 as staffing levels grow more modestly. Income tax expense for the fiscal 2017 first quarter was $0.3 million, or an effective tax rate of 21.6%, compared to a tax benefit of $0.5 million, or an effective tax rate of (12.9)%, for the 2016 first quarter. The increase in the effective tax rate is mainly due to increased annual projected taxable earnings for the fiscal 2017 year and the effective tax rate is expected to stay approximately at that level for the remainder of fiscal 2017. Loans Total loans receivable, net of allowance for loan losses, increased $369.9 million, or 50%, from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016.  Among lending categories, this included a $138.3 million increase in consumer, $134.0 million of which was due to the student loan portfolio purchase, and a $118.4 million increase, or 37%, in commercial real estate, partially offset by a $7.0 million decrease, or 7%, in total agricultural loans. Premium finance loans increased $68.9 million, or 62%, from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016. Retail bank loans increased $158.4 million, or 26%, from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016. Excluding the purchased student loan portfolio, total loans receivable, net of allowance for loan losses, were up $236.0 million, or 32%, from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016. The Company recorded a provision for loan losses of $0.8 million during the three months ended December 31, 2016, primarily related to loan growth. The Company’s allowance for loan losses was $1.0 million, or 0.1% of total loans, at December 31, 2016, compared to an allowance of $0.8 million, or 0.1% of total loans, at September 30, 2016.  Credit Quality MetaBank’s NPAs at December 31, 2016 were $2.3 million, representing 0.05% of total assets, compared to $6.6 million and 0.22% of total assets at December 31, 2015 and $1.2 million and 0.03% at September 30, 2016. Consistent with December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016, the Payments segment did not include any NPAs at December 31, 2016. Investments Total investment securities and MBS increased by $325.5 million, or 19%, to $2.08 billion at December 31, 2016, as compared to December 31, 2015. This included an increase in investment securities of $312.9 million, primarily from purchases of high credit quality non-bank qualified (“NBQ”) municipal securities and government-related asset-backed securities, and an increase in MBS of $12.6 million as purchases exceeded sales and pay downs.  Average TEY on the securities portfolio increased two basis points in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 from the same quarter of 2016.  Overall TEY yields increased by five basis points on non-MBS investment securities over that same time period.  Yields decreased within MBS by 27 basis points in the first quarter of 2017 from the same quarter of 2016 due to the significant downward movement in longer term interest rates in late fiscal 2016 and the time it takes for rate increases late in the calendar year to funnel through the mortgage and refinancing market. The Company anticipates prepayments on its MBS holdings to decrease meaningfully by no later than March 2017, due to the recent increase in longer term rates, thereby slowing premium amortization and increasing yields and income realized from the MBS portfolio. For example, the Company estimates, based on projections provided by the Yield Book software in concert with management assumptions, on its fixed rate MBS portfolio as of December 31, 2016, in the base (Yield Book lifetime projected speeds at current rates) and in a +50 and +100 immediate, parallel shocked interest rate environment, interest earned on its fixed rate MBS securities and reinvested principal at market rates over one year’s time would increase by $3.48 million, $3.98 million and $4.45 million, respectively, from the current, historical three-month CPR income amount. MBS duration extension is also muted with extension expectations near 1.5 years in a +300 immediate, parallel interest rate shocked environment. The focus of the MBS portfolio remains on minimizing prepayment speed volatility by selecting agency MBS with characteristics intended to make the Company’s agency MBS holdings less susceptible to increased prepayment speeds, while still allowing yields to increase if interest rates increase with controlled extension risk. The Company continues to purchase high-quality investments within certain sectors of the municipal market, at what it believes to be attractive yields. Many of these new purchases are tax-exempt and also backed, or collateralized, by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac, thereby enhancing credit quality. The Company also has opportunistically and carefully selected certain government related and guaranteed floating rate securities at yields that are expected to enhance the portfolio's projected performance in a rising interest rate environment. The Company continues to execute its investment strategy of primarily purchasing U.S. Government-related securities and U.S. Government-related MBS, as well as AAA and AA rated NBQ municipal bonds; however, the Company is also reviewing opportunities to add other diverse, high-quality securities at attractive relative rates when opportunities arise.  With the Company’s large percentage of non-interest bearing deposits, the TEY for these NBQ bonds is higher than a similar term investment in other investment categories of similar risk and higher than many other banks can realize on the same instruments due to the Company’s current cost of funds and its projected cost of funds if interest rates rise. Deposits and Other Liabilities Total end-of-period deposits increased $1.23 billion, or 51%, to $3.66 billion at December 31, 2016, compared to September 30, 2016. The increase in end-of-period deposits is primarily a result of wholesale deposits executed by the Company during the fiscal 2017 first quarter to prepare for the upcoming tax season and the student loan portfolio purchase. Total wholesale deposits at December 31, 2016 were $927.0 million. Total average deposits for the fiscal 2017 first quarter increased by $712.4 million, or 36%, compared to the same period in 2016; a portion of the growth is directly related to the testing and implementation of new funding programs to support the interest-free refund advance loans. Average non-interest bearing deposits for the 2017 first quarter were up $298.2 million, or 17%, compared to the same period in 2016. The Company experienced some volatility in the growth rate of its Meta Payment Systems (MPS)-related non-interest bearing deposits as a one-time program expires and the timing of new programs begins to accelerate, though long-term growth rates are expected to remain strong.  The average balance of total deposits and interest-bearing liabilities was $3.06 billion for the three-month period ended December 31, 2016, compared to $2.38 billion for the same period in fiscal 2016. A portion of this increase was due to the previously mentioned testing and implementation of new funding programs as well as the Company's completion of the public offering of its subordinated notes in August 2016, which are due August 15, 2026. Business Segment Performance Payments For the fiscal 2017 first quarter, Payments recorded income before tax of $0.7 million, compared to $1.2 million during the same period last year. As expected, our combined tax businesses (Refund Advantage, EPS, and SCS) incurred a pre-tax loss of $4.7 million during the quarter, compared to a loss of $1.6 million during the same quarter of the prior year. Total first quarter 2017 average Payments-generated deposits increased by $280.2 million, or 16%, compared to the same quarter in 2016. Banking The Banking segment recorded income before tax of $5.2 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, compared to $3.5 million in the first quarter of 2016. This increase is primarily driven by the increase in interest income of $1.9 million as a result of growth in our loan portfolio. Capital Ratios The Company and the Bank remain above the federal regulatory minimum capital requirements to remain classified as well-capitalized institutions. Regulatory capital ratios are stated in the table below. The tables below also include certain non-GAAP financial measures that are used by investors, analysts and bank regulatory agencies to assess the capital position of financial services companies.  Management reviews these measures along with other measures of capital as part of its financial analysis.

Basel III revised the definition of capital, increased minimum capital ratios, and introduced a minimum CET1 ratio; those changes are being fully phased in through the end of 2021. The following table provides a reconciliation of tangible common equity used in calculating tangible book value data.  December 31, 2016 (Dollars in Thousands)Total Stockholders' Equity$371,786 Less: Goodwill98,898 Less: Intangible assets73,472 Tangible common equity199,416 Less: AOCI5,022 Tangible common equity excluding AOCI194,394  Due to the predictable, quarterly cyclicality of MPS deposits in conjunction with tax season business activity, management believes that a six-month capital calculation is a useful metric to monitor the Company’s overall capital management process. As such, the Bank’s six-month average Tier 1 leverage ratio, Common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, Tier 1 capital ratio, and Total qualifying capital ratio as of December 31, 2016 were 9.80%, 21.14%, 21.14%, and 21.58%, respectively.
