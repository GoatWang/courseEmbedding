Here Are Facebook's 7 Biggest Problems, According To Its Top Ad Product Exec

It's starting to look like Facebook and YouTube blew a golden opportunity to grab TV ad money this year





How an 111-year-old brand is trying to make old-fashioned greeting cards relevant for millennials




Gokul Rajaram is Facebook's director of product management for ads. He recently did a detailed, free-wheeling interview with AdExchanger, in which he described seven priorities for the advertising side of Facebook's business (which is to say, virtually all of its $1 billion-per quarter business).
In doing so, however, he also hinted at Facebook's seven biggest problems. Here are Rajaram's priorities and the problems that come with them:
1. Data. Facebook has one of the biggest hoards of marketing data on the planet, and its members are targetable based on their demographics and interests. It's a potential marketing goldmine.
Problem: Facebook isn't doing anything with it. When asked if Facebook ever planned to switch on its data for ad targeting, Rajaram said only: "Not at this time."
2. Facebook Pages.  "Facebook Pages work really well to reach people at all parts of the funnel. The Page should be the hub of all your marketing, we believe, because Pages allow you to reach people in the news feed. Pages allow you to publish content. That initially starts out as organic content, and then you can sponsor or boost the content."
Problem: Pages are free, but Facebook needs to see sales dollars growth. But there's no such thing as a "free" page at Facebook. As Rajaram admits, most posts made by marketers are only seen by a small proportion of followers because users' news feeds are so crowded. So marketers are forced to pay to get the reach they need: "Organically, you get anywhere from 15 percent to 20 percent of your fans, that you reach organically. In order to reach the remaining 80 to 85 percent, sponsoring posts is important."
3. Mobile. "Our advertising strategy on mobile is all about making sure we are part of the organic content that people consume. It’s primarily News Feed. On mobile, it’s actually fairly easy for us."
Problem: Everyone knows Facebook's mobile app leaves a lot to be desired. Also, Rajaram says Facebook will NOT introduce banner ads, leaving it dependent on Sponsored Stories—which aren't as obvious or intrusive as display advertising. He says, "we don’t introduce content which would not be there otherwise—like a banner ad or something like that—in mobile, it’s a much easier transition for us from a pure product development point of view." That's fine ... except that advertisers LIKE obvious and intrusive media. The mobile screen is comparatively tiny and Facebook has turned its back on a major part of the real estate it offers.
4. Offers. "We intrinsically believe that advertising and marketing should enhance native‑user behaviors. Things like Offers originated from this belief. When we survey users asking, 'What are the reasons you Like a page on Facebook?' one of the primary reasons was people want discounts, coupons, and deals. To build a compelling product it takes a coupon, which is an age-old thing."
Problem: When was the last time you redeemed a Facebook Offer?
5. Speed. "Our focus is to move fast — have all teams that work together not encumbered by any constraints. They execute and launch something fast and learn something and move on."
Problem: Facebook is rolling out new products so fast it's confusing for clients. Here's  how Rajaram says Facebook communicates with its main ad partners, the so-called preferred marketing developers (PMD): "We have a number of communication channels with PMDs. All PMDs have access to a PMD-only community forum. We have several forums, groups on Facebook that they have access to. Then we have product and program update forums. Then we have PMD email support. We also have regular newsletters that we send out, and we have limited opportunities for select PMDs to test products in pre‑launch status so they can test it and give us feedback." Phew!
6. Facebook Exchange: "There are obviously some differences in Facebook creative being different from [standardized display] and so on. We want to make sure the partners understand that just because they are integrated, it doesn’t mean the responsibility ends there. Their responsibility is to work with us to make sure the advertisers who are our common client have a great experience on Facebook Exchange."
Problem: Rajaram seems to be implying that Facebook's ad formats are a creative hurdle for some buyers. Facebook's ads come in different shapes and sizes than standard web format banner ads—which means that clients have to create separate campaigns just for Facebook, before they buy on Facebook.
7. Video. Facebook is one of the largest servers of video in the world, and video advertising is a lot more lucrative than display advertising. So it's a huge opportunity for video ads.
Problem: Facebook isn't doing anything about it. "Unlike everybody else It’s something we haven’t talked too much about. We probably need to focus and build a lot of stuff on the consumer side, if we want to do something. I think, so far, we haven’t talked much about the advertising side of video, at this point."

Square Hires AdSense “Godfather” Gokul Rajaram Away From Facebook

TC’s Picks From TechStars NY Summer 2013 Class












While Square has seen several top senior people leave over the last year, it’s also making up for them with some notable hires.
Today Gokul Rajaram, dubbed the “Godfather of AdSense,” is joining Square from Facebook, where he was the product director of ads. At Facebook, he oversaw the company’s aggressive monetization push over the past year, including incorporating better ad units on mobile devices.
The company says he’ll oversee Square Register, the point-of-sale system that the startup designed for small and medium businesses to use from tablets and smartphones.
“I’ve been fortunate to work for two mission-driven, world-changing companies, and Square’s vision and passion for helping businesses grow is inspiring,” Rajaram said in a statement.
He joined Facebook through the sale of his startup Chai Labs to the social network back in August 2010. Before that, he also was a key leader in developing Google’s AdSense network.
While Square has lost recent executives like COO Keith Rabois and other senior people like Jared Fliesler to the world of venture capital, Rajaram is a win for the company as it figures out its strategy going forward. The company picked up Francoise Brougher from Google as Business Lead in April. It also hired former U.S. trade representative Demetrios J. Marantis as head of international government, regulatory and policy work last month.
Gokul isn’t the only core Facebook Ads team member to have left recently. Antonio Garcia-Martinez, the product director of Facebook’s retargeted ads program FBX, left in April and today announced he’s joining Facebook adtech partner Nanigans.

Gokul is an absolutely fantastic advisor. We send him weekly updates and almost always he asks probing questions that stretch our abilities. Despite his extremely tight schedule, he is always there to... more help and hence none of our questions go unanswered. He is truly a Sherpa, someone who has done it before — raised money, done deals, worked with startups etc. Very lucky to have him as our Sherpa.

Gokul Rajaram of Square Drops Product Management Knowledge

In our first episode of "Confessions of a Product Manager," we interview Gokul Rajaram of Square. Don't know who Gokul is? Let me Google that for you.
The man is sometimes referred to as "The Godfather of Adsense," due to his key role in the early success of one of Google's most profitable products. Since leaving Google in 2007, Rajaram has founded (and sold) his own startup, Chai Labs, led ad-product strategy at Facebook and, most recently, joined Square to help the San Francisco-based company revolutionize the world of commerce. As if that weren't enough, Gokul is also one of the friendliest, most humble and down-to-earth guys we know...

In this interview, Gokul and our Director of Product, Matt Pasienski, cover a LOT of territory, including:

How to effectively staff up a successful product development team.
Which original Star Wars character best reflects Gokul's approach to product management. (Hint: it's not Darth Vader.)
Personal tips and tricks for managing the daily grind of product management. (Spoiler alert: stickies aren't a tactic, they're a way of life.)

Big thanks to our friends over at Square for hosting us, and to Gokul for making the time to chat with us.
Enjoy! And stay tuned for future installments of "PM Confessions."

Matt Pasienski: It's Gokul?
Gokul Rajaram: Gokul, yeah.
Matt Pasienski: Is that good?
Gokul Rajaram: Yeah. Perfect.
Matt Pasienski: Because my last name's Pasienski and no one ever...and then Rajaram?
Gokul Rajaram: Yep.
Matt Pasienski: Okay. Just wanted to get that...I'm sensitive. So I'm here with Gokul Rajaram who is a product managing genius. He was at Google and has been called the godfather of AdSense. Then started his own company called Chai Technologies which was acquired by Facebook where you then ran product management for ads.
Gokul Rajaram: Yep.
Matt Pasienski: And now you're here at Square. So obviously a whole range of different types of companies and products and experience so we just want to pick your brain about what's the best way to manage product, what's the best way to run your teams and what's the best way to make decisions.
Gokul Rajaram: Awesome. Excited to be here. Thank you very much. (Thank you for having me.)
Matt Pasienski: First question, when you were at Google, it's 2003. Very big time, especially for ads. They do things differently there. What were some of the innovative things that they did around product management that were different or innovative?
Gokul Rajaram: So one of the things that I loved about Google, and we've tried to have it here at Square also, is that success begets success. What that means is you don't staff up a team up front without understanding what that team can accomplish. So you first start really small for any product.  However big the vision is, you start with a very small team. You start with a team of 3 or 4 engineers, a product manager, a designer and you see what they can do. You give them some milestones, you let them set their milestones. You give them some metrics. If they hit their metrics, you give them more people. When I started out on AdSense we were literally 6 people and we launched a product with 6 or 7 people and then it grew from there and then by 6 months from then we were 25 people. So, you hit your metrics and you get more people and that should be how a team should operate. You should never forward staff a project. You should always staff with small teams. And small teams are actually more efficient process.
Matt Pasienski: It's like how do you think about the separation of the team and the product and your consumer base or do all of those things have to grow in unison?
Gokul Rajaram: All of them grow in unison. They all have to be really [inaudible 00:02:12] (tight) and ultimately of course the product needs to be consistent with the company strategy. So first of all the reason for existence for the product comes down from the company strategy and then after that, the metrics of the product need to be consistent with how it feeds back into the company strategy. So ultimately, we have a saying here that launch is not success. It's not just about launching a product, it's about growing the product, making it successful based on any metric that the product has.
Matt Pasienski: Excellent. What percentage of those initial, small seeds of products were actually successful and how well do you think that approach of just putting out all these little projects succeeded and what could have been improved or what ended up getting improved?
Gokul Rajaram: I would say about 80% of Google's initiatives were a success. But more than the 80%, the philosophy of the fact that you are empowered to take an idea and run with it, create a small team, go and influence people and build something has really savored the company. And I think very few companies could have done things like self driving cars and Google fiber and all of these things that Google is doing without having that mindset in the people.
Matt Pasienski: What do you think is the best want to manage that bottom-up process where people are trying things, you're measuring them, you're seeing what's successful and then growing those projects? What do you think is the right type of mentality as a manager? And in specific which Stars Wars character best represents it? You have Darth Vader maybe on one hand and, I don't know, maybe Luke Skywalker on the other hand.
Gokul Rajaram: Laughs.
Matt Pasienski: You just pick one our of that spectrum ...
Gokul Rajaram: So I think it's, as a manager, or as someone who sets frameworks, the most important thing you need to do is have guardrails. What you need to tell the team is, here is the set of things. Here is the surface area of all the things we will consider or work on. For example, at Square it might be focusing around commerce, but even commerce is too broad, so we try to say what are the things that are more specific than commerce that we want to do. And then within those, you then have a process for people to bring ideas. And then have very clear ways that you say that an idea gets converted into a team based on this criteria or this metric. But then after that, you really need to let them run. I can't really constrain them too much, because small teams will feel very clear ownership versus being top-down managed are the ones that are more successful.   
Matt Pasienski: So I think you are saying Obi-Wan.
Gokul Rajaram: Obi-Wan is perfect. I was going to say Commissioner Hans Solo and Darth Vader, but Obi-Wan is better.
Matt Pasienski: Excellent. I'm more of a Lando. I just want to act smooth.
Gokul Rajaram: There you go. Lando is good but Obi-Wan for this one.
Matt Pasienski: Obi-Wan is the best.
Gokul Rajaram: Obi-Wan is awesome.
Matt Pasienski: You have a notebook in your pocket. It looks like it's on you all the time. Talk about how you use that.
Gokul Rajaram: Yeah so, I'm in meetings all the time and I need to take my thoughts down in a way that I can remember it and transcribe it and then take actions on it. So, the notebook is essentially both a to-do list, so I maintain my to-do list on paper form as well as a meetings notes list. It's very hard to take notes on a phone, because the person you are meeting with feels that you are checking your email. And it's also hard to cart around a laptop all the time and open it again, the whole perception of doing email. So I use a notebook. It's served me well for the last 5 years and I hope it will for the next 20.
Matt Pasienski: That's interesting. Okay so you ...
Gokul Rajaram: How do you do notes? I'm curious.
Matt Pasienski: We actually have notepads in every office and I'm a big sticky fan. I have stickies everywhere and the thing I like about those is that they go up and then I integrate all of my notes into documents that I share with my team. So, it this intermediate format but then my biggest thrill during the day is taking down a bunch of stickies as I finish tasks.
Gokul Rajaram: That's exactly...for me it's crossing out a to-do. It gives you such power when you cross something out.
Matt Pasienski: Yeah and if you're lost, you just look up and you're like sticky and you just take it off and you start working. Kind of like an engineer with a backlog. Just building backlogs all day.
What would you say are you're biggest, top 1, top 3 tips for project managers that are looking to improve their team, improve their process, or just looking to improve their own personal performance?
Gokul Rajaram: Yeah. Think like a CEO. Remember that your job is not just to be responsible for the technical aspects of the product, it is for the holistic product. This means go to market, pricing is a feature. So pricing, customers, everything, You need to be the person who is ultimately responsible for the product. You are the guardian of the product. So that mindset is really hard to get because a lot of product managers come from different backgrounds. Some come from engineering some come from marketing. So I've seen that this in their background, they tend to gravitate towards that aspect of the product. It's really hard to find product managers who really think of themselves as GM's and are literally responsible for the product, even though they don't have people who report to them working on the product. They really need to think of themselves as a CEO. That's the biggest...that's the number 1 tip. All successful PMs I've seen have GM or CEO mentality.
Matt Pasienski: Okay. There we go. You heard it from the godfather (laughter). Thank you very much.
Gokul Rajaram: Thank you.
Matt Pasienski: That was amazing. I appreciate it. All right.
Gokul Rajaram: Awesome.
