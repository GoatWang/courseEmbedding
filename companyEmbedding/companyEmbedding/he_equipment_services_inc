From preventative maintenance to extensive crane remanufacturing, our technicians provide timely, quality work along with award-wining customer service. We continually look for highly motivated, mechanically-inclined individuals ranging from entry-level technical school graduates to highly experienced heavy equipment and mobile hydraulic crane technicians. We offer a rewarding career with advancement opportunities and specialized training that is unmatched in the heavy equipment industry.

            H&E Equipment Services, Inc. provides integrated equipment services in the United States focused on heavy construction and industrial equipment.

H&E Equipment Services Inc.


            
            H&E Equipment Services, Inc. provides integrated equipment services in the United States focused on heavy construction and industrial equipment. It rents, sells and provides parts and service support for four core categories of specialized equipment: hi-lift or aerial work platform equipment; cranes; earthmoving equipment; and industrial lift trucks. The company operates its business through five segments: Equipment Rentals, New Equipment Sales, Used Equipment Sales, Parts Sales and Repair & Maintenance Services. The Equipment Rentals segment primarily rents its four core types of construction and industrial equipment.

The Used Equipment Sales segment sales are generated primarily from sales of used equipment from its rental fleet, as well as from sales of inventoried equipment that are acquired through trade-ins from its equipment customers and through selective purchases of high quality used equipment. The Parts Sales segment business sells new and used parts for the equipment it sells and also provides parts to its rental fleet. The Repair & Maintenance Services segment provides maintenance and repair services for its customer's equipment and to its own rental fleet at its facilities as well as at its customers locations. H&E Equipment was founded on February 3, 2006 and is headquartered in Baton Rouge, LA.

                H&E Equipment Services, Inc. provides integrated equipment services in the United States focused on heavy construction and industrial equipment. It rents, sells and provides parts and service support for four core categories of specialized equipment: hi-lift or aerial work platform equipment; cranes; earthmoving equipment; and industrial lift trucks. The company operates its business through five segments: Equipment Rentals, New Equipment Sales, Used Equipment Sales, Parts Sales and Repair & Maintenance Services. The Equipment Rentals segment primarily rents its four core types of construction and industrial equipment. The New Equipment Sales segment sells new equipment in all of its four core product categories. The Used Equipment Sales segment sales are generated primarily from sales of used equipment from its rental fleet, as well as from sales of inventoried equipment that are acquired through trade-ins from its equipment customers and through selective purchases of high quality used equipment. The Parts Sales segment business sells new and used parts for the equipment it sells and also provides parts to its rental fleet. The Repair & Maintenance Services segment provides maintenance and repair services for its customer's equipment and to its own rental fleet at its facilities as well as at its customers locations. H&E Equipment was founded on February 3, 2006 and is headquartered in Baton Rouge, LA.

                H&E Equipment Services, Inc. provides integrated equipment services in the United States focused on heavy construction and industrial equipment. It rents, sells and provides parts and service support for four core categories of specialized equipment: hi-lift or aerial work platform equipment; cranes; earthmoving equipment; and industrial lift trucks. The company operates its business through five segments: Equipment Rentals, New Equipment Sales, Used Equipment Sales, Parts Sales and Repair & Maintenance Services. The Equipment Rentals segment primarily rents its four core types of construction and industrial equipment. The New Equipment Sales segment sells new equipment in all of its four core product categories. The Used Equipment Sales segment sales are generated primarily from sales of used equipment from its rental fleet, as well as from sales of inventoried equipment that are acquired through trade-ins from its equipment customers and through selective purchases of high quality used equipment. The Parts Sales segment business sells new and used parts for the equipment it sells and also provides parts to its rental fleet. The Repair & Maintenance Services segment provides maintenance and repair services for its customer's equipment and to its own rental fleet at its facilities as well as at its customers locations. H&E Equipment was founded on February 3, 2006 and is headquartered in Baton Rouge, LA.
