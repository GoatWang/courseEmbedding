Scribe was a server for aggregating log data streamed in real-time from a large number of servers. It was designed to be scalable, extensible without client-side modification, and robust to failure of the network or any specific machine.
Scribe was developed at Facebook and released in 2008 as open source.[1][2]
Scribe servers are arranged in a directed graph, with each server knowing only about the next server in the graph. This network topology allows for adding extra layers of fan-in as a system grows, and batching messages before sending them between datacenters, without having any code that explicitly needs to understand datacenter topology, only a simple configuration.[3]
Scribe was designed to consider reliability but to not require heavyweight protocols and expansive disk usage. Scribe spools data to disk on any node to handle intermittent connectivity node failure, but doesn't sync a log file for every message. This creates a possibility of a small amount of data loss in the event of a crash or catastrophic hardware failure. However, this degree of reliability is often suitable for most Facebook use cases.[3]

What is iPaaS?
An integration platform-as-service, or iPaaS, is a cloud-based approach to integration that can connect data, applications and processes faster than a traditional integration platform. An iPaaS is designed for the cloud, so it can easily handle the challenges of cloud (SaaS) applications, making it possible to integrate any database and any application—whether they function in a cloud environment, on premises, or in a combination of both environments. Scribe’s iPaaS is:





Secure – Scribe’s iPaaS uses the security capabilities built into your applications, including encryption and password protection, and, therefore, is very secure.







Agile – iPaaS is built for today’s fast-moving, “digital” businesses, allowing you to get data flowing between applications in hours and easily adapt integrations over their lifecycle.







Reliable – Thousands of customers use our iPaaS for their real-time data integration and synchronization between applications, data migrations, and data replication.
