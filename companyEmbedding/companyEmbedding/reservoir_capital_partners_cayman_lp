Reservoir Capital Group














Reservoir was founded in 1998 based upon the belief that patient capital and a flexible investment mandate are competitive advantages in the pursuit of superior, long-term risk-adjusted returns. Reservoir's primary investment objective is to identify or create investment opportunities with asymmetric risk/reward profiles - generally offering enhanced downside protection and meaningful upside optionality. These investment opportunities are frequently found in out-of-favor areas experiencing fundamental change and/or scarcity of capital. We also believe a large portion of investment returns are generated by allocating assets to the most attractive asset classes or sectors at opportune times, and that partnering with world-class managers and specialists may provide enhanced risk/reward profiles, superior economics and proprietary deal flow.

              Daniel H. Stern and Craig A. Huff, Co-Chief Executive Officers, and Gregg M. Zeitlin, a Senior Managing Director, founded Reservoir and have worked together as a team for more than nineteen years, including their prior tenure managing Ziff Brothers Investments. The founders are joined by Matthew T. Popoli and Anil A. Ranavat, Senior Managing Directors who have been with Reservoir since 2005, in leading Reservoir's general investment efforts.

About Us - Reservoir Capital Group





















 





 About Us 
 
 
 
 
 



 
 

 Reservoir was founded in 1998 based upon the belief that patient capital and a flexible investment mandate are competitive advantages in the pursuit of superior, 
	long-term risk-adjusted returns. Reservoir's primary investment objective is to identify or create investment opportunities with asymmetric risk/reward profiles - 
	generally offering enhanced downside protection and meaningful upside optionality. These investment opportunities are frequently found in out-of-favor areas experiencing 
	fundamental change and/or scarcity of capital.

	Reservoir opportunistically invests directly in securities and structured private investments, builds platform companies with industry specialists, 
	and creates new hedge funds and private equity firms in which the Reservoir funds hold ownership or other economic interests. Reservoir currently has over $6 billion of 
	capital under management. 
	
 
 


 
	Daniel H. Stern and Craig A. Huff, Co-Chief Executive Officers, and Gregg M. Zeitlin, a Senior Managing Director, founded Reservoir and 
	have worked together as a team for more than twenty-one years, including their prior tenure managing Ziff Brothers Investments. The founders are joined by Senior Managing Directors Matthew T. 
	Popoli, Anil A. Ranavat, and Eric Engler, in leading Reservoir's investment efforts.

Reservoir has pursued its opportunistic strategy since 1999, initially with the launch of the Opportunistic Fund and subsequently with select capital raisings based on the opportunity set:
 
 






 1998 

 Reservoir Founded; Launch of Opportunistic Fund
"Evergreen" hybrid investment fund



 2010 

 Reservoir/ContourGlobal  Co-Investment Fund
Established to invest alongside the Opportunistic Fund in ContourGlobal, the power platform company



 2012 

 Reservoir Strategic  Partners Fund
Hedge fund seeding focus with PE-like structure



 2014 

 Reservoir Resource  Partners Fund
Natural resources and power focus with PE structure
