The above figures represent only estimated costs. The estimated cost of this
registration statement is $8,000 which will be paid from offering proceeds. If
the offering proceeds are less than registration costs, Iuldashkhan Umurzakov,
our president and director, has verbally agreed to loan the Company funds to
complete the registration process. Mr. Umurzakov’s verbal agreement to provide
us loans for registration costs is non- binding and discretionary. Also, these
loans would be necessary if the proceeds from this offering will not be
sufficient to implement our business plan and maintain reporting status and
quotation on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board when and if our common stocks
become eligible for trading on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. Mr.
Umurzakov will not be paid any compensation or anything from the proceeds of
this offering. There is no due date for the repayment of the funds advanced by
Mr. Umurzakov. Mr. Umurzakov will be repaid from revenues of operations if and
when we generate revenues to pay the obligation.


As to the present date, there are many companies with similar services. There
are the few barriers of entry in the business and level of competition is
extremely high. We think that our main competitive advantage is a possibility to
integrate inventory systems of shops into our web catalog. We intend to focus
our forces on the specific needs related to our potential clients.


Company Description
Uvic Inc. was incorporated in Nevada on August 21, 2013. We are development
stage company and intend to commence operations in the business of developing a
web catalog integrated within the inventory count of any kind of shops aimed at
all sorts of customers willing to acquire goods of any purpose.


 Our catalog is
about to be based on the website platform demonstrating the availability of
different goods intended for different purposes. The website mentioned above
will permit the end commercial customers to order, purchase, or to put a hold on
the goods in the shop itself. We intend to engage in business activity, however,
there is no assurance that we will be successful in developing our marketable
product.

NOTES TO
THE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR THE
THREE MONTHS PERIODS ENDED SEPTEMBER  30, 2015 AND 2014 AND
FOR THE PERIOD FROM INCEPTION (AUGUST 21, 2013) TO SEPTEMBER
 30, 2015

 

 

 

NOTE 1 -
ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS

Organization
and Description of Business

 

UVIC, INC.
(the "Company", "we" or "us") was incorporated under the laws of
the State of Nevada on August 21, 2013 ("Inception") and has
adopted March 31 fiscal year end. The Company is in the development
stage as defined under Financial Accounting Standards Board
("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 915-205 "
Development-Stage Entities ."

 

 

NOTE 2
– GOING CONCERN

 

The
Company has incurred a loss since Inception (August 21, 2013)
resulting in an accumulated deficit of $7,970 as of September 30,
2015 and further losses are anticipated in the development of its
business.  Accordingly, there is substantial doubt about the
Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  Management
believes that the Company's capital requirements will depend on
many factors including the success of the Company's development
efforts and its efforts to raise capital. Management also believes
the Company needs to raise additional capital for working capital
purposes. There is no assurance that such financing will be
available in the future.   The conditions described above
raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going
concern. The financial statements of the Company do not include any
adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of
recorded assets, or the amounts and classifications of liabilities
that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as
a going concern.

 

The
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the
Company generating profitable operations in the future and, or,
obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay
its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they
come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the
next twelve months with existing cash on hand, loans from directors
and, or, the  private placement of common stock.
 

 

 

NOTE 3 -
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of
Presentation

 

The
financial statements of the Company have been prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States of America and are presented in US dollars. The
Company's year -end is March 31.

 

Revenue
Recognition

 

The
Company will recognize revenue in accordance with Accounting
Standards Codification No. 605, "Revenue Recognition" ("ASC-605"),
ASC-605 requires that four basic criteria must be met before
revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred; (3) the selling
price is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectibility is
reasonably assured. Determination of criteria (3) and (4) are based
on management's judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling
prices of the products delivered and the collectibility of those
amounts. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers,
estimated returns and allowances, and other adjustments are
provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded. The
Company will defer any revenue for which the product has not been
delivered or is subject to refund until such time that the Company
and the customer jointly determine that the product has been
delivered or no refund will be required.

UVIC,

(A

NOTES TO
THE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR THE
THREE MONTHS PERIODS ENDED SEPTEMBER  30, 2015 AND 2014 AND
FOR THE PERIOD FROM INCEPTION (AUGUST 21, 2013) TO SEPTEMBER
 30, 2015

 

 

 

Accounts
Receivable

Accounts
receivable is reported at the customers' outstanding balances, less
any allowance for doubtful accounts.  Interest is not
accrued on overdue accounts receivable.

 

Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts

An
allowance for doubtful accounts on accounts receivable is charged
to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for
uncollectible accounts at a level management believes is adequate
to cover any probable losses.  Management determines the
adequacy of the allowance based on historical write-off percentages
and information collected from individual
customers.  Accounts receivable are charged off against
the allowance when collectability is determined to be permanently
impaired

 

Cash and
Cash Equivalents

For
purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all
highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of
three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company's bank
accounts are deposited in insured institutions. The funds are
insured up to $250,000. At September 30, 2015 the Company's bank
deposits did not exceed the insured amounts.

 

Basic and
Diluted Income (Loss) Per Share

The
Company computes income (loss) per share in accordance with FASB
ASC 260, "Earnings per Share" which requires presentation of both
basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the statement
of operations. Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net
income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted
average number of outstanding common shares during the period.
Diluted income (loss) per share gives effect to all dilutive
potential common shares outstanding during the period.
 Dilutive loss per share excludes all potential common shares
if their effect is anti-dilutive.

 

For the
three months periods ended September  30, 2015 and 2014 there
were no potentially dilutive debt or equity instruments issued or
 outstanding and any such shares would have been excluded from
the computation because they would have been anti-dilutive as the
Company incurred losses in these years.

 

Fair Value
of Financial Instruments

ASC 820 "
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures " establishes a
three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs in
measuring fair value. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into
three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring
fair value are observable in the market.

 

These
tiers include:

Level 1:
defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active
markets;

Level 2:
 defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets
that are either directly or indirectly observable; and

Level 3:
 defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market
data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own
assumptions.

 

The
carrying value of cash and the Company's loan from shareholder
approximates its fair value due to their short-term
maturity.

UVIC,

(A

NOTES TO
THE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR THE
THREE MONTHS PERIODS ENDED SEPTEMBER  30, 2015 AND 2014 AND
FOR THE PERIOD FROM INCEPTION (AUGUST 21, 2013) TO SEPTEMBER
 30, 2015

 

 

 

Income
Taxes

The
Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to FASB ASC 740 "
Income Taxes ". Under ASC 740 deferred income taxes are
provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are
recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss
carryforwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for
taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the
differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation
allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely
than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will
not be realized. The provision for income taxes represents the tax
expense for the period, if any, and the change during the period in
deferred tax assets and liabilities.

 

Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes
in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.

ASC 740
also provides criteria for the recognition, measurement,
presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions. Under ASC
740, the impact of an uncertain tax position on the income tax
return may only be recognized at the largest amount that is
more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant
taxing authority. At September 30, 2015, there were no unrecognized
tax benefits.

 

Advertising
Costs

The
Company's policy regarding advertising is to expense advertising
when incurred. The Company incurred advertising expense of $0
during three months periods ended September 30, 2015 and
2014.

 

Business
Segments

ASC
280,  "Segment Reporting"  requires use of
the  "management approach"  model for segment
reporting. The management approach model is based on the way a
company's management organizes segments within the company for
making operating decisions and assessing performance. The Company
determined it has one operating segment as of September 30,
2015.

 

Recent
accounting pronouncements

The
Company continually assesses any new accounting pronouncements to
determine their applicability to the Company. Where it is
determined that a new accounting pronouncement affects the
Company's financial reporting, the Company undertakes a study to
determine the consequence of the change to its financial statements
and assures that there are proper controls in place to ascertain
that the Company's financials properly reflect the change. The
Company currently does not have any rece
