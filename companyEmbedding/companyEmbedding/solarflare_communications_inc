“Our business is modernizing data security for scale-out environments,” said Mark Schreiber, General Manager at CDL. “With software defined network processing on every server, SolarSecure provides both the granularity and scalability we need in a security platform to cloak data lakes from prying eyes.”



“The whole challenge in providing a low-latency trading platform is to make the infrastructure as thin as possible, said Dan Feldman, vice president of systems and network engineering at Trading Technologies. “Adding firewall appliances adds hops and latency. By placing a Smart NIC with SolarSecure in line with the transactions, we eliminate hops and deliver a similar security narrative.”











We design ultra high performance networking chips, adapter cards, software and turnkey systems



Which are deployed in enterprise, telco and cloud data centers



For the world’s most demanding customers







Our Solutions
High bandwidth ♦ Ultra low latency ♦ Ultra scale ♦ Software defined ♦ Instrumentation ♦ Security




XtremeScale chips and NICs, with Universal Kernel Bypass software, connect servers to Ethernet networks

Next generation scale-out computing environments incorporate thousands of cores (neurons) inter-connected at very high speeds and at very low latencies. Servers in these neural-class networks are instrumented for the telemetry needed to automate self-driving data centers, instrumented to process packets needed for real-time analytics, and instrumented for hardware based security. Solarflare is pioneering server connectivity for neural-class networks, from silicon to firmware to software, to provide a comprehensive, integrated set of technologies for distributed, ultra scale, software defined datacenters.

Neural-Class Networks

 
Two macro-trends are leading to the emergence of “Neural-Class Networks”--computing environments which may or may not be used for artificial intelligence and deep learning, but share the same distributed scale-out architecture, and massive size. Neural-class networks can be found in the data centers of public cloud service providers, stock exchanges, large retailers, insurance providers and carriers, to name just a few.

SolarCapture Product Brief
 
 
Key features and benefits
Lossless packet capture as standard: designed for real-time analytics, SolarCapture provides both throughput and capacity, with multiple configuration options. With deep burst buffering, SolarCapture delivers raw frames from the wire to disk without loss at up to 40Gbps
Real-time analytics: SolarCapture allows live query of captured and time-stamped data, and online live packet processing with third‐party libpcap‐aware analytics applications, without impeding capture performance
Open architecture: SolarCapture has been designed to share data with third party applications via the SolarCapture libpcap or C APIs, and to share alerts via Syslog and SNMP. SolarCapture delivers streams from buffers in memory, or as an uninterrupted packet stream from disk when applications cannot keep up with the capture rate
Easy to deploy and manage: SolarCapture is available as a stand-alone turnkey appliance, or as a adapter and software bundle which can be installed in an industry-standard server. Once installed, the intuitive SolarCapture Dashboard GUI offers multiple configuration options, flow and conversation statistics, flow indices, query outputs, and filters
