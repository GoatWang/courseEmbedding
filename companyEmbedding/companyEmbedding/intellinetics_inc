Matthew Chretien, Interim President/CEO, EVP & Chief Technology Officer
Matthew is a co-founder of Intellinetics and a strategic entrepreneur backed by more than 20 years of experience in technology sales, consulting and software product life cycle management within the aerospace, public safety, government and select commercial markets. After graduating from The Ohio State University with an engineering degree in 1990, he spent two years in the Fisher College of Business Doctoral Program at Ohio State in computer science to work on his Ph.D. During this period, Matthew discovered his research would be far too narrow to satisfy his interests and ultimately co-founded Intellinetics in 1994.
Joseph D. Spain, CFO
Joe combines 6 years of public accounting experience with KPMG, 19 years at Mettler-Toledo International, Inc., a global manufacturer of scales and analytical instruments, and 2 years with nChannel, Inc., a leader in multi-channel integration solutions for merchants. Roles encompassed Controller positions at various Mettler-Toledo operating units, including over 10 years total as head of finance in Australia and Canada, as well as CFO of nChannel. Joe also brings experience in corporate treasury, sales and service operations, and has held key roles in acquisitions.
Michael Chretien, VP & Corporate Counsel
Michael is a co-founder of Intellinetics. After graduating from the University of Massachusetts with a Bachelor of Arts in economics in 1961, he joined the United States Marine Corps and retired in 1965 as a 1st Lieutenant. Michael continued to serve his country for 26 years in law enforcement and foreign counter intelligence. After retirement from government service, he continued his career in the law enforcement field by studying for his Juris Doctorate and was awarded a law degree from Capital University Law School in 1991. Michael’s next move was founding Intellinetics with his son Matthew using his law enforcement background as a client resource to consult and assist with document storage and various other IT-related solutions.
Thomas D. Moss, Chief Software Engineer
Tom is a co-founder of Intellinetics and director of the company’s software research and development efforts. He boasts 20 years of expertise in database application design and document imaging software technologies, and has earned both a mathematics degree and a computer science degree at the University of Wisconsin.
Michael A. Beck, Director of Operations
Mike brings to Intellinetics 25 years of IT experience including technical hands on experience, operational management and leadership as well as sales support. Mike has worked for Fortune 150 companies including Abbott Labs and Cardinal Health where he progressed from technical to leadership positions. Mike joined Intellinetics in 2005 as Sr. Technical Lead and soon after was promoted to the position for Director of Operations. Mike is responsible for the operational aspects of project implementation, technical support, and sales support.
Neil C. Campbell, Director of Software Products Group
Neil has 22 years of experience in the IT field with an emphasis in infrastructure design, software architecture and productivity improvement solutions. Neil spent 11 years at Abbott Laboratories with focus on manufacturing IT operations and warehouse management systems before he joined Intellinetics as a project manager in fall of 2006. Neil was promoted to Director of Software products in 2008, where he currently contributes visionary leadership, thoughtful interpretation, diagnosis and resolution to complex business issues facing companies today and in the future. Neil holds a bachelor’s degree from The Ohio University and industry certifications from Microsoft, Cisco, Extreme Networks, HP, Dell, Marathon Technologies and IBM.

					Full Description



Intellinetics, Inc., formerly GlobalWise Investments, Inc., incorporated on July 12, 2000, is a holding company with a single operating subsidiary, Intellinetics Ohio. The Company is an enterprise content management (ECM) software development, sales and marketing company serving both the public and private sectors. In the public sector, the Company's products, services and process models serve, principally, the needs of law enforcement and compliance agencies within the state and local government establishment. The Company provides its software solutions principally through the direct licensing of its software installed on customer computer platforms, and providing the applications as a service, accessible through the Internet. Its solutions include services that range from pre-installation assessment, project scoping, implementation, consulting and ongoing software maintenance, and customer support. Its software products allow customers to manage enterprise content (unstructured data, such as hard-copy scanned documents, Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) files, images, pictures, faxes, audio/video files, e-mails and PowerPoint presentations) through its entire life cycle. The Company offers industry-specific vertical composite content applications (CCA) to clients in a pre-configured, on-demand basis through the On-demand Solution Store.The Company's ECM platform, Intellivue, focuses on the underserved small to medium sized businesses (SMB). The six components of Intellivue include Image-processing Application, Records Management, Workflow/BPM, Social Content, Web Content Management and Extended Components. The Intellivue platform includes image processing modules used for capturing, transforming and managing images of paper documents. Intellivue supports distributed and high volume capture, optical and intelligent character recognition, and form-processing technology. Intellivue open architecture enables plug-and-play compatibility with advanced capture tools from providers, such as Ancora. The Intellivue records management module addresses needs relating to long-term retention of content through automation and policies, ensuring legal, regulatory and industry compliance for its clients. Intellivue supports business processes, routing content electronically, assigning work tasks and states (e.g., reviews or approvals), and creating related audit trails. Intellivue addresses document sharing, collaboration and knowledge management and project teams. The Intellivue platform specifically addresses native functions, such as templating, workflow, change management and content deployment functions that deliver prepackaged or on-demand content (through Intellivue WebVue). Intellivue uses its full-functioned Web services based on its software development kit (SDK) and application protocol interface (API). Intellivue includes document composition and e-forms (through third party original equipment manufacturer integration partnership), search, content and Web analytics (through third-party Advanced Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engine partnership), e-mail and information archiving and packaged application integration (through Intellinetics' DirectVue).The Company competes with DocuWare, Square 9 and Laserfiche.

Intellinetics, Inc. Reports Year-End Results






Business Wire




Mar 30, 2017 8:36 AM EDT













 


















































  Intellinetics, Inc. ( OTCQB: INLX), a document solutions software company focused on IntelliCloud™ (a cloud-based document management solution for the Small to Medium Business (SMB) market and business teams within large enterprises), announced financial results for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.  Year End Key Metrics   Software as a Service Revenue increased 86%   Total Revenue increased 11%   Despite net loss improvement, Adjusted EBITDA erosion - a result of sales and marketing investments needed to support and execute our burgeoning pipeline    Summary - Year-End Results  Revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 were $2,601,733, as compared with $2,336,991 for the same period in 2015, an increase of $264,742, or 11%. Sales of Software as a Service (SaaS) led the way with an 86% increase, which includes data storage and hosting services. Overall, gross margins were 73% and 77% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, primarily due to product mix.  Net loss was $(1,576,311) and $(3,921,428) for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, or $(0.09) and $(0.55) per share, respectively, representing a decrease of $(2,345,117), or 60%. Total decrease in net loss was attributable to the decrease in non-cash and mostly non-recurring expenses, including stock option expense, non-cash interest expense and notes payable conversion underwriting expense associated with the conversion of convertible notes to equity, effected in December 2015, as well as an increase in gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2016. However, Adjusted EBITDA loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $(1,023,668), compared with a loss of $(481,454) for the year ended December 31, 2015, a 113% increase.  Matthew L. Chretien, President and CEO of Intellinetics, stated, "We made tremendous progress in 2016 and many of the building blocks to create accelerating growth were put in place. We look forward to our quarterly financial results soon reflecting successful execution of our business plan. In the meantime, we look forward to providing progress reports on a growing number of OEM/Embedded channel technology partners."  2016 Highlights   Refined our imaging channel model by streamlining growth through a master distribution partner (such as copier resellers) using IntelliCloud to become a world-class managed business services provider.     The partner is initially focusing on its top 150 dealers in its top 30 markets - supported by a mature multi-channel marketing engine and in-field sales teams.     Designed, built and launched IntelliCloud University™, allowing dealers (that primarily sell Multi-Function Printers, Managed Print Services or Managed IT Services) to generate more sales by seamlessly adding IntelliCloud document management to their core offerings, while reducing our costs. ( www.intelliclouduniversity.com)   Continued to grow total revenues quarter-over-quarter all year while focusing on SaaS business.     SaaS sales are a recurring revenue model - providing an increasingly growing, stable revenue base while maximizing long-term enterprise value.     Launched in Q4, we focused on growing new revenue streams through technology-based partners that have leading cloud-based platforms with large and growing installation bases.     This new OEM / Embedded channel segment embeds the sale of IntelliCloud into an existing model vs. as a separate / standalone process. In some cases, this created new offerings that we are also selling through our imaging channel.     At the end of December, we initiated a convertible debt financing round of $1.25M (which was fully subscribed in January) to support our expected rapid growth.    IntelliCloud™     - Powered by the Intel  ®   NUC  IntelliCloud™  is a cloud-based document management platform that is optimized for the vast SMB market segment and business teams within large enterprises who are stuck with paper in business-critical processes. Thousands and thousands of people at any given moment depend upon IntelliCloud to perform their work.
