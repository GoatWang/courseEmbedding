GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT
On June 19, 2007, El Segundo Power II, LLC (El Segundo) filed a petition with the California Energy Commission requesting to amend the Energy Commission Decision to eliminate the use of ocean water as the cooling water source for the El Segundo Power Redevelopment Project (ESPR). The petition proposes a new rapid response combined cycle (R2C2) design that will allow the project to operate without once-through cooling, along with changes to the previously approved laydown/staging areas and access routes. The 630 MW ESPR was originally certified by the Energy Commission at a special Business Meeting on December 23, 2004, but a second Business Meeting to consider errata was held on February 2, 2005. The decision, with errata, was certified on February 2, 2005. A petition challenging the certification was filed with the California Supreme Court shortly thereafter, thus delaying the effective date of the decision. With the Court's denial of the petition on August 31, 2005, the decision became final. The facility is located in the City of El Segundo in Los Angeles County.


Energy Commission Facility Certification Process

The California Energy Commission is the lead agency (for licensing thermal power plants 50 megawatts and larger) under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and has a certified regulatory program under CEQA. 
Under its certified program, the Energy Commission is exempt from having to prepare an environmental impact report. 
Its certified program, however, does require environmental analysis of the project, including an analysis of alternatives and mitigation measures to minimize any significant adverse effect the project may have on the environment.

        El Segundo Power II LLC (El Segundo) filed an application for market-based rate authority, with an accompanying rate schedule. The proposed market-based rate schedule provides for the sale of energy, capacity and ancillary services at market-based rates. El Segundo also requested waivers of various Commission regulations. In particular, El Segundo requested that the Commission grant blanket approval Start Printed Page 28481under 18 CFR Part 34 of all future issuances of securities and assumptions of liability by El Segundo. 
On May 11, 2007, pursuant to delegated authority, the Director, Division of Tariffs and Market Development—West, granted the requests for blanket approval under Part 34 (Director's Order). The Director's Order also stated that the Commission would publish a separate notice in the Federal Register establishing a period of time for the filing of protests. Accordingly, any person desiring to be heard concerning the blanket approvals of issuances of securities or assumptions of liability by El Segundo should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 888 First Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure. 18 CFR 385.211, 385.214 (2004).

Absent a request to be heard in opposition to such blanket approvals by the deadline above, El Segundo is authorized to issue securities and assume obligations or liabilities as a guarantor, indorser, surety, or otherwise in respect of any security of another person; provided that such issuance or assumption is for some lawful object within the corporate purposes of El Segundo, compatible with the public interest, and is reasonably necessary or appropriate for such purposes. 
The Commission reserves the right to require a further showing that neither public nor private interests will be adversely affected by continued approvals of El Segundo's issuance of securities or assumptions of liability. 
Copies of the full text of the Director's Order are available from the Commission's Public Reference Room, 888 First Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426.
