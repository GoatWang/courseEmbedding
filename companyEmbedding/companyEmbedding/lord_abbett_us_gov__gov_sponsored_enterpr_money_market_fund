	Expense Example





	As a shareholder of the Fund you incur ongoing costs, including management fees; distribution and service (12b-1) fees (currently only Class B
	shares have an active 12b-1 Plan); and other Fund expenses. This Example is intended to help you understand your ongoing costs (in dollars) of investing in the Fund and to compare these costs with the ongoing costs of investing in other mutual
	funds.




	The Example is based on an investment of $1,000 invested at the beginning of the period and held for the entire period (January
	1, 2011 through June 30, 2011).





	Actual Expenses





	For each class of the Fund, the first line of the applicable table on the following page provides information about actual account values and actual expenses. You may use the information in this line, together with
	the amount you invested, to estimate the expenses that you paid over the period. Simply divide your account value by $1,000 (for example, an $8,600 account value divided by $1,000 = 8.6), then multiply the result by the number in the first line
	under the heading titled Expenses Paid During Period 1/1/11  6/30/11 to estimate the expenses you paid on your account during this period.





	Hypothetical Example for Comparison Purposes





	For each class of the Fund, the second line of
	the table on the following page provides information about hypothetical account values and hypothetical expenses based on the Funds actual expense ratio and an assumed rate of return of 5% per year before expenses, which is not the
	Funds actual return. The hypothetical account values and expenses may not be used to estimate the actual ending account balance or expenses you paid for the period. You may use this information to compare the ongoing costs of investing in the
	Fund and other funds. To do so, compare this 5% hypothetical example with the 5% hypothetical examples that appear in the shareholder reports of the other funds.

	Please note that the expenses shown in the table are meant to highlight
	your ongoing costs only and do not reflect any transactional costs, such as sales charges (loads). Therefore, the second line of the table is useful in comparing ongoing costs only, and will not help you determine the relative total costs of owning
	different funds. In addition, if these transactional costs were included, your costs would have been higher.

	Notes to Financial Statements





	 





	1.    ORGANIZATION





	Lord Abbett U.S. Government & Government Sponsored Enterprises Money Market Fund, Inc. (the Fund) is registered under the Investment Company
	Act of 1940, as amended (the Act), as a diversified, open-end management investment company. The Fund was incorporated under Maryland law on May 9, 1979.




	The investment objective of the Fund is to seek high current income and preservation of capital through investments in high quality, short-term, liquid securities. These securities are commonly known as Money
	Market instruments.




	The Fund has four classes of shares: Classes A, B, C and I. There are no front-end sales charges on shares of
	each class, although there may be a contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) applied to a class of shares as follows: certain redemptions of Class A shares acquired through an exchange; Class B shares redeemed before the sixth
	anniversary of purchase; and Class C shares redeemed before the first anniversary of purchase. Class B shares will automatically convert to Class A shares on the 25



	th



	day of the month (or, if the 25



	th



	day is not a business day, the next business day thereafter) following the eighth anniversary of the day on which the purchase
	order was accepted. The Fund no longer issues Class B shares for purchase.




	The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting
	principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
	the financial statements and the reported amounts of increases and decreases in net assets from operations during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.





	2.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES




	 





	(a)




	 





	Investment Valuation

	The Fund values securities utilizing the amortized cost method, which approximates fair value. Under the amortized cost method, all investments
	purchased at a discount or premium are valued by amortizing the difference between the original purchase price and maturity value of the issue over the period to maturity. Securities purchased at face value are valued at cost, which approximates
	fair value due to the short duration of the issue.





	 





	(b)




	 





	Security Transactions

	Security transactions are recorded as of the date that the securities are purchased or sold (trade date). Realized gains and losses on sales of
	portfolio securities are calculated using the identified-cost method.





	 





	(c)




	 





	Investment Income

	Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis as earned. Discounts are accreted and premiums are amortized using the effective interest method
	and are included in Interest income on the Statement of Operations. Investment income is allocated to each class of shares based upon the relative proportion of net assets at the beginning of the day.





	 





	(d)




	 





	Income Taxes

	It is the policy of the Fund to meet the requirements of Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
	distribute substantially all taxable income and capital gains to its shareholders. Therefore, no income tax provision is required.






	 




	12








	Notes to Financial Statements (continued)





	 




	The Fund files U.S. federal and various state and local tax returns. No
	income tax returns are currently under examination. The statute of limitations on the Funds U.S. federal tax returns filed remains open for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2008 through June 30, 2011. The statutes of limitations on
	the Funds state and local tax returns may remain open for an additional year depending upon the jurisdiction.



	 





	(e)




	 





	Expenses

	Expenses, excluding class-specific expenses, are allocated to each class of shares based upon the relative proportion of net assets at the beginning of the
	day. Class B shares bear all expenses and fees relating to the Funds 12b-1 Distribution Plan.

	Repurchase Agreements

	The Fund may enter into repurchase agreements with respect to securities. A repurchase agreement is a transaction in which a Fund acquires a
	security and simultaneously commits to resell that security to the seller (a bank or securities dealer) at an agreed-upon price on an agreed-upon date. The Fund requires at all times that the repurchase agreement be collateralized by cash, or by
	securities of the U.S. Government, its agencies, its instrumentalities, or U.S. Government sponsored enterprises having a value equal to, or in excess of, the value of the repurchase agreement (including accrued interest). If the seller of the
	agreement defaults on its obligation to repurchase the underlying securities at a time when the fair value of these securities has declined, the Fund may incur a loss upon disposition of the securities.





	 





	(g)




	 





	Time Deposits

	The Fund may invest in time deposits. Time deposits are non-negotiable deposits maintained at a banking institution for a specified period of time
	(often overnight) at a specified interest rate.





	 





	(h)




	 





	Fair Value Measurements

	Fair value is defined as the price that the Fund would receive upon selling an investment or transferring a liability in an orderly
	transaction to an independent buyer in the principal or most advantageous market of the investment. A three-tier hierarchy is used to maximize the use of observable market data and minimize the use of unobservable inputs and to establish
	classification of fair value measurements for disclosure purposes. Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk  for example, the risk inherent
	in a particular valuation technique used to measure fair value (such as a pricing model) and/or the risk inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. Inputs may be observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect the assumptions market
	participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Observable inputs are based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity. Unobservable inputs reflect the reporting entitys own assumptions about the
	assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs are based on the best information available in the circumstances. The three-tier hierarchy of inputs is summarized in the three broad Levels listed
	below:





	 





	 




	




	 





	Level 1 - unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical investments;






	 





	 




	




	 





	Level 2 - other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar investments, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risk,
	etc.); and






	 





	 




	




	 





	Level 3 - significant unobservable inputs (including the Funds own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments).







	The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those
	securities.

	3.    MANAGEMENT FEE AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES






	Management Fee





	The Fund has a management agreement with
	Lord, Abbett & Co. LLC (Lord Abbett), pursuant to which Lord Abbett supplies the Fund with investment management services and executive and other personnel, provides office space and pays for ordinary and necessary office and
	clerical expenses relating to research and statistical work and supervision of the Funds investment portfolio.




	The management fee is based on the
	Funds average daily net assets at the following annual rate:



	 




















	First $250 million





	  




	 




	.50%




	  







	Next $250 million





	  




	 




	.45%




	  







	Over $500 million





	  




	 




	.40%




	  







	For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011, the effective management fee, net of waivers, was at an annualized rate of .00% of the
	Funds average daily net assets.




	In addition, Lord Abbett provides certain administrative services to the Fund pursuant to an Administrative
	Services Agreement in return for a fee at an annual rate of .04% of the Funds average daily net assets.




	Lord Abbett voluntarily agreed to waive
	all or a portion of the Funds management fee and, if necessary, reimburse expenses to the extent necessary so Class A, C and I shares maintain a .02% annualized distribution yield, and Class B shares maintain a .00% annualized
	distribution yield. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011, Lord Abbett waived its entire management fee of $2,799,415 and reimbursed other expenses of $515,184. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011, Lord Abbett Distributor LLC (the
	Distributor) reimbursed Class B 12b-1 distribution fees of $199,122.




	Lord Abbett may stop or change the level of the voluntary waiver or
	reimbursement at any time.





	12b-1 Distribution Plan





	The Fund has adopted a distribution plan with respect to Class A, B, and C shares pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the Act, which provides for the payment of
	ongoing distribution and service fees to Lord Abbett Distributor LLC (the Distributor), an affiliate of Lord Abbett. The fees are accrued daily at annual rates based upon the Funds average daily net assets as follows:



	 


































	Fees





	  





	Class A

	(1)






	 




	  





	Class B





	 




	  





	Class C

	(1)






	 







	Service and distribution fee





	  




	 




	.15%




	  




	  




	 




	.75%




	  




	  




	 




	1.00%




	  





	 






	(1)

	 




	 





	The Fund has not activated its plan for Class A and Class C, and therefore, no payments are currently authorized under the distribution plan.







	 




	14








	Notes to Financial Statements (continued)





	 




	Class I shares do not have a distribution plan.




	Two Directors and certain of the Funds officers have an interest in Lord Abbett.







	4.    DISTRIBUTIONS





	Dividends from net investment income are
	declared daily and paid monthly.




	The tax character of distributions paid during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2011 and 2010 was as follows:



	 
























	 

	 




	  






	Year Ended






	6/30/2011






	 




	  






	Year Ended






	6/30/2010






	 







	Distributions paid from:





	  










	  













	Ordinary income

	115,966

	On December 22, 2010, the Regulated Investment Company Modernization Act of 2010 (the Modernization Act) was signed
	by the President. The Modernization Act includes numerous provisions that generally become effective for taxable years beginning after the date of enactment. Management is currently assessing the impact of the Modernization Act as it relates to the
	Fund.





	5.    DIRECTORS REMUNERATION





	The Funds officers and the two Directors who are associated with Lord Abbett do not receive any compensation from the Fund for serving in such capacities. Outside Directors fees are allocated among all
	Lord Abbett-sponsored funds based on the net assets of each fund. There is an equity-based plan available to all outside Directors under which outside Directors must defer receipt of a portion of, and may elect to defer receipt of an additional
	portion of Directors fees. The deferred amounts are treated as though equivalent dollar amounts had been invested in the funds. Such amounts and earnings accrued thereon are included in Directors fees on the Statement of Operations and
	in Directors fees payable on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities and are not deductible for U.S. federal income tax purposes until such amounts are paid.





	6.    EXPENSE REDUCTIONS





	The Fund has entered into an arrangement
	with its transfer agent and custodian, whereby credits realized as a result of uninvested cash balances are used to reduce a portion of the Funds expenses.





	7.    CUSTODIAN AND ACCOUNTING AGENT





	State Street Bank and Trust
	Company (SSB) is the Funds custodian and accounting agent. SSB performs custodial, accounting and recordkeeping functions relating to portfolio transactions and calculating the Funds net asset value.





	8.    INVESTMENT RISKS





	The Funds yield may vary in response to changes in interest rates and other market factors.




	 




	15








	Notes to Financial Statements (concluded)





	 




	The Fund generally invests a substantial portion of its assets in money market
	securities issued by the U.S. Government and by various government-sponsored enterprises such as Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, the Federal Home Loan Banks and Federal National Mortgage Association. Such securities are not guaranteed by the
	U.S. Government, but are supported only by the credit of the particular government-sponsored enterprises involved, and the discretionary authority of the U.S. Treasury to purchase the enterprises obligations. There is no assurance that the
	U.S. Government will provide financial support to enterprises that are not supported by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government.




	An investment
	in the Fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of an investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose
	money by investing in the Fund.




	These factors can affect the Funds performance.

	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm





	 





	To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Lord Abbett U.S. Government 

	&


	Government Sponsored Enterprises Money Market Fund, Inc.:






	We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of Lord Abbett U.S. Government & Government Sponsored Enterprises Money Market Fund, Inc. (the Fund), including the schedule
	of investments, as of June 30, 2011, and the related statement of operations for the year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the five
	years in the period then ended. These financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of the Funds management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based on our
	audits.




	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
	require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. The Fund is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit
	of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
	expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
	the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of
	June 30, 2011, by correspondence with the custodian. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.




	In our opinion, the
	financial statements and financial highlights referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Lord Abbett U.S. Government & Government Sponsored Enterprises Money Market Fund, Inc. as of June 30,
	2011, the results of its operations for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the five years in the period then ended, in conformity with
	accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

	CERTIFICATIONS




	Pursuant to Section 302 of the




	Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002




	I,
	Robert S. Dow, certify that:



	 





	 




	1.




	I have reviewed this report on Form N-CSR of Lord Abbett U.S. Government & Government Sponsored Enterprises Money Market Fund, Inc.;





	 





	 




	2.




	Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in
	light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;





	 





	 




	3.




	Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial
	condition, results of operations, changes in net assets, and cash flows (if the financial statements are required to include a statement of cash flows) of the Registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;





	 





	 




	4.




	The Registrants other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 30a-3(c)
	under the Investment Company Act of 1940) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the Investment Company Act of 1940) for the Registrant and have:





	 





	 




	(a)




	designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material
	information relating to the Registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;





	 





	 




	(b)




	designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide
	reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;





	 





	 




	(c)




	evaluated the effectiveness of the Registrants disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the
	disclosure controls and procedures, as of a date within 90 days prior to the filing date of this report based on such evaluation; and











	 




	(d)




	disclosed in this report any change in the Registrants internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the second fiscal quarter of the period
	covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Registrants internal control over financial reporting; and





	 





	 




	5.




	The Registrants other certifying officer and I have disclosed to the Registrants auditors and the audit committee of the Registrants board of
	directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):





	 





	 




	(a)




	all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely
	affect the Registrants ability to record, process, summarize, and report financial information; and





	 





	 




	(b)




	any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the Registrants internal control over financial
	reporting.

The performance quoted represents past performance, which is no indication of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted. Returns shown at net asset value have all distributions reinvested. If a sales charge had been deducted, the results would have been lower. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that shares, on any given day or when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Therefore, there can be no assurance of future results.

SUPPLEMENT DATED SEPTEMBER 25, 2003 TO THE PROSPECTUSES AND 
STATEMENTS OF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
 (CLASS A, B, C, P, & Y)
CHANGES IN RIGHTS OF ACCUMULATION AND LETTER OF INTENTION  EFFECTIVE  OCTOBER 1,
2003                                                                            

1.   With respect to Class A, B, C, & P of the Funds, Portfolios,  and/or Series
     of the above  referenced  investment  companies  with the exception of Lord
     Abbett U.S.  Government  Securities  Money Market Fund, Inc. (the "Funds"),
     the  section  in  the  Prospectuses  entitled  "Your  Investment  Purchases
     Reducing Your Class A Share  Front-End Sales Charges" is amended to read as
follows:                                                              

          Class A shares may be  purchased  at a discount if you  qualify  under
either of the following conditions:                         

          o    RIGHTS OF ACCUMULATION - A Purchaser may combine the value at the
               current  public  offering price of Class A, B, C, and P shares of
               any Eligible  Fund  already  owned with a new purchase of Class A
               shares of any  Eligible  Fund in order to reduce the sales charge
on the new purchase.                              

          o    LETTER OF INTENTION - A Purchaser may combine  purchases of Class
               A, B, C, and P shares of any Eligible Fund the Purchaser  intends
               to make over a  13-month  period in  determining  the  applicable
               sales charge.  Current  holdings under Rights of Accumulation may
               be included in a Letter of Intention.  Shares  purchased  through
               reinvestment of dividends or  distributions  are not included.  A
 Letter of Intention may be backdated up to 90 days.

          The term "Purchaser" includes:  (1) an individual,  (2) an individual,
          his or her spouse and  children  under the age of 21, or (3) a trustee
          or other  fiduciary  purchasing  shares for a single trust,  estate or
          single  fiduciary  account  (including a pension,  profit-sharing,  or
          other  employee  benefit  trust  qualified  under  Section  401 of the
          Internal  Revenue  Code).  Please  note that  more than one  qualified
          employee   benefit   trust  of  a  single   employer,   including  its
          consolidated  subsidiaries,  may be considered a single trust,  as may
          qualified  plans of  multiple  employers  registered  in the name of a
        single bank trustee, although more than one beneficiary is involved.

          PLEASE INFORM THE FUNDS OR YOUR FINANCIAL  INTERMEDIARY IF YOU BELIEVE
          YOU  QUALIFY FOR A REDUCED  FRONT-END  SALES  CHARGE.  YOU MAY NEED TO
          SUPPLY  INFORMATION  TO THE FUNDS OR YOUR  FINANCIAL  INTERMEDIARY  TO
 ESTABLISH QUALIFICATION FOR A REDUCED FRONT-END SALES CHARGE.

2.   With respect to the Funds, the section in the  Prospectuses  entitled "YOUR
     INVESTMENT  PURCHASES  CLASS  A SHARE  CDSC"  is  amended  to  include  the
     following  category  as a  circumstance  in which  the  Class A share  CDSC
generally will not be assessed:                                       

     o    ELIGIBLE  MANDATORY  DISTRIBUTIONS  under 403(b) Plans and  individual
retirement accounts.                                        

3.   With  respect  to  the  Funds,  all  references  in  the  Prospectuses  and
     Statements of Additional  Information  relating to "Rights of Accumulation"
     and "Letter of Intention" are revised to be consistent  with sections 1 and
2 above.

						Expense Ratioas of 06/30/2017











Expense ratio details, Click here.

The net expense is based on estimates for the current fiscal year and takes into account contractual fee waivers/expense reimbursements that currently are scheduled to remain in place through 02/28/2018.  For periods when fees and expenses were waived and/or reimbursed, the Fund benefited by not bearing such expenses.  Without such fee waivers/reimbursements, performance would have been lower.

The performance quoted represents past performance, which is no indication of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted. Returns shown include the reinvestment of all distributions. Returns shown at net asset value do not reflect the current maximum sales charge, had the sales charge been included, returns would have been lower. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that shares, on any given day or when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Therefore, there can be no assurance of future results.

For Sales Charge Reductions and Waivers Click here.





SALES CHARGE REDUCTIONS AND WAIVERS
Please inform the fund company or your financial intermediary at the time of your purchase of fund shares if you believe you qualify for a reduced front-end sales charge.
Reducing Your Class A Share Front-End Sales Charge
 You may purchase Class A shares at a discount if you qualify under the circumstances outlined below. To receive a reduced front-end sales charge, you must let the fund or your financial intermediary know at the time of your purchase of fund shares that you believe you qualify for a discount. If you or a related party have holdings of eligible funds (as defined below) in other accounts with your financial intermediary or with other financial intermediaries that may be combined with your current purchases in determining the sales charge as described below, you must inform a fund or your financial intermediary. You may be asked to provide supporting account statements or other information to allow us or your financial intermediary to verify your eligibility for a discount. If you or your financial intermediary do not notify a fund or provide the requested information, you may not receive the reduced sales charge for which you otherwise qualify. Class A shares may be purchased at a discount if you qualify under either of the following conditions:

Rights of Accumulation - A purchaser may combine the value of Class A, B, C, F, and P shares of any eligible fund currently owned with a new purchase of Class A shares of any eligible fund in order to reduce the sales charge on the new purchase. Class I, R2, and R3 share holdings may not be combined for these purposes.
To the extent that your financial intermediary is able to do so, the value of Class A, B, C, F, and P shares of eligible funds determined for the purpose of reducing the sales charge of a new purchase under the Rights of Accumulation will be calculated at the higher of: 1) the aggregate current maximum offering price of your existing Class A, B, C, F, and P shares of eligible funds or 2) the aggregate amount you invested in such shares (including dividend reinvestments but excluding capital appreciation) less any withdrawals. You should retain any information and account records necessary to substantiate the historical amounts you and any related purchasers have invested in eligible funds. You must inform a fund and/or your financial intermediary at the time of purchase if you believe your purchase qualifies for a reduced sales charge; you may be requested to provide documentation of your holdings in order to verify your eligibility. If you do not do so, you may not receive all sales charge reductions for which you are eligible.

Letter of Intention — In order to reduce your Class A front-end sales charge, a purchaser may combine purchases of Class A, B, C, F, and P shares of any eligible fund the purchaser intends to make over the next 13 months in determining the applicable sales charge. The 13-month Letter of Intention period commences on the day that the Letter of Intention is received by a fund, and the purchaser must tell a fund that later purchases are subject to the Letter of Intention. Purchases submitted prior to the date the Letter of Intention is received by a fund are not counted toward the sales charge reduction. Current holdings under Rights of Accumulation may be included in a Letter of Intention in order to reduce the sales charge for purchases during the 13-month period covered by the Letter of Intention. Shares purchased through reinvestment of dividends or distributions are not included. Class I, R2, and R3 share holdings may not be combined for these purposes. Class A shares valued at 5% of the amount of intended purchases are escrowed and may be redeemed to cover the additional sales charges payable if the intended purchases under the Letter of Intention is not completed. The Letter of Intention is neither a binding obligation on you to buy nor on a fund to sell any or all of an intended purchase amount.

Purchaser — A purchaser includes: 1) an individual; 2) an individual, his or her spouse, and children under the age of 21; 3) retirement and benefit plans, including a 401(k) plan, profit-sharing plan, money purchase plan, defined benefit plan, and 457(b) plan sponsored by a governmental entity, nonprofit organization, school district, or church to which employer contributions are made, as well as SIMPLE IRA plans and SEP-IRA plans; or 4) a trustee or other fiduciary purchasing shares for a single trust, estate, or single fiduciary account. An individual may include under item (1) his or her holdings in eligible funds as described above in IRAs, as a sole participant of a retirement and benefit plan sponsored by the individual's business, and as a participant in a 403(b) plan to which only pretax salary deferrals are made. An individual and his or her spouse may include under item (2) their holdings in IRAs, and as the sole participants in retirement and benefit plans sponsored by a business owned by either or both of them. A retirement and benefit plan under item (3) includes all qualified retirement and benefit plans of a single employer and its consolidated subsidiaries, and all qualified retirement and benefit plans of multiple employers registered in the name of a single bank trustee.
Eligible fund — An eligible fund is any Lord Abbett-sponsored fund except for (1) each portfolio of Lord Abbett Series Fund, Inc., (2) Lord Abbett U.S. Government & Government Sponsored Enterprises Money Market Fund, Inc. ("Money Market Fund") (except for holdings in Money Market Fund, which are attributable to any shares exchanged from the Lord Abbett-sponsored funds), and (3) any other fund the shares of which are not available to the investor at the time of the transaction due to a limitation on the offering of a fund's shares.
Front-end Sales Charge Waivers
 Class A shares may be purchased without a front-end sales charge under any of the following conditions:

purchases of $1 million or more (may be subject to a CDSC);
purchases by retirement and benefit plans with at least 100 eligible employees (may be subject to a CDSC);
purchases for retirement and benefit plans made through financial intermediaries that perform participant recordkeeping or other administrative services for the plans and that have entered into special arrangements with a fund and/or Lord Abbett Distributor specifically for such purchases (may be subject to a CDSC);
purchases made by or on behalf of financial intermediaries for clients that pay the financial intermediaries fees in connection with fee-based advisory program, provided that the financial intermediaries or their trading agents have entered into special arrangements with a fund and/or Lord Abbett Distributor specifically for such purchases; and
certain other types of investors may qualify to purchase Class A share without a front-end sales charge as described in the Statement of Additional Information (SAI).

IMPORTANT INFORMATION
 




headingView Disclosure




New Fund Risk: The Fund is newly organized. There can be no assurance that the Fund will reach or maintain a sufficient asset size to effectively implement its investing strategy.







headingView Disclosure




A Note about Risk: The value of investments in equity securities will fluctuate in response to general economic conditions and to changes in the prospects of particular companies and/or sectors in the economy. The foreign securities in which the Fund primarily invests generally pose greater risks than domestic securities, including greater price fluctuations and higher transaction costs. Foreign investments also may be affected by changes in currency rates or currency controls. With respect to certain foreign countries, there is a possibility of nationalization, expropriation or confiscatory taxation, imposition of withholding or other taxes, and political or social instability that could affect investments in those countries. These risks can be greater in the case of emerging country securities. Investments in either growth or value stocks may shift in and out of favor for long periods of time, depending on market and economic conditions. The Fund is subject to the risks associated with derivatives, which may be different from and greater than the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other investments. The Fund may invest in exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), investments in ETFs are subject to a variety of risks, including the risks associated with a direct investment in the underlying securities that the ETF holds. 







 
Performance data quoted is historical. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance quoted. The investment return and principal value of an investment in the Fund will fluctuate so that shares, on any given day or when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. To obtain performance data current to the most recent quarter-end, go to quarter ending performance on our Website or call Lord Abbett at (888) 522-2388.
 



Class A  Except as noted below, returns with sales charges reflect a maximum sales charge of 5.75% for equity funds, 2.25% for all tax-free income funds, fixed income funds and multi-asset class funds. There are also ongoing 12b-1 service fees (and, in certain cases, distribution fees).
Class A Shares purchased subject to a front-end sales charge have no contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC). However, certain purchases of Class A shares made without a front-end sales charge may be subject to a CDSC of 1% if the shares are redeemed before the first day of the month in which the one year anniversary of the purchase falls. The CDSC is not reflected in the performance with maximum sales charge.



With Sales Charge - Returns with sales charges reflect applicable fees and expenses and include all distributions reinvested.
 
 




Without Sales Charge - Returns shown are without sales charges and have all distributions reinvested. If a sales charge had been deducted, the results would have been lower.
 




Returns shown at less than a year reflect aggregate total returns.
 




Double-Digit Returns - instances of high double-digit returns were achieved primarily during favorable market conditions and may not be sustainable over time.
