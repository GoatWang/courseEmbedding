Stowell’s base salary was an increase from 2013’s $887,500. His $930,000 salary
was raised to $1 million mid-year, resulting in the odd number.The $1,679,567 target annual cash incentive compensation for Stowell was a
maximum 250% of his salary based on the company’s pre-tax income, with a target
of $325 million and minimum of $275 million. Since the company’s actual pre-tax
income last year was $350 million, an award of $1,355,976 was earned. Another
$323,591 came in a supplemental cash incentive that measured mid-year pre-tax
income—the target was $215.1 million, and the company earned $196.5 million,
resulting in a $323,591 bonus.The $2,469,979 earned in stock awards represent long-term equity
compensation—the restricted stock issued to Stowell vests in three installments
if a threshold of pre-tax income is achieved, so the number of performance
share issued to Stowell in 2014 depends on the company’s earnings per share for
2016. So this amount represents the grant date fair value of capped stock
appreciation rights.
