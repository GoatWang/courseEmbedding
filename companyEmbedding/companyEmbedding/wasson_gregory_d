"Diversity and inclusion at Walgreens are more than business initiatives – they are a way of life, embedded deep in our culture. As a retailer in diverse communities across the country and Puerto Rico, we want to reflect that diversity in many ways – in the products and services we offer, in our choice of the vendors and other entities with whom we do business, and in our everyday interactions with our customers, patients and each other."

For 35 years, Gregory D. Wasson worked at Walgreens, eventually presiding over some of the drugstore chain’s biggest deals as its chief executive.Now he is working on a smaller scale to build up new companies.Mr. Wasson’s family investment office and a team of entrepreneurs have a new project, Innventure, which aims to develop businesses around new technologies lent by big corporations. Innventure’s first partner, expected to be announced on Friday, is Procter & Gamble.Mr. Wasson is joining forces with a group led by Michael Otworth, whose previous business, also called Innventure, will now be run as a joint venture with Mr. Wasson’s family office, Wasson Enterprise. Mr. Wasson will serve as chairman and Mr. Otworth as chief executive.It is the latest career turn for Mr. Wasson, who left Walgreens in 2014 after the company finished its merger with a European counterpart, Alliance Boots. After retiring, he set up Wasson Enterprise to provide angel investments in health and retail start-ups.

“Innventure will identify the opportunities, create a company, nurture it, then put in a management team to where it stands on its own — and then we move on,” Mr. Wasson said in an interview.

It is a corporate incubator of sorts. But Mr. Wasson said that Innventure’s management team had both the insight to identify commercially viable technologies furnished by Procter & Gamble — and any future partners — as well as the know-how to create flourishing businesses. That approach, he said, reduced the risk that accompanied any start-up.“What I think is most interesting is that we’re looking to help leverage their powerful R. & D. machine with our nimble entrepreneur team to identify the opportunities that they have developed,” he said.

In return, Innventure will have a stake in any companies it creates.The venture already has one new business based on a Procter & Gamble technology: PureCycle Technologies, which aims to reuse polypropylene plastic more efficiently than current approaches allow. In particular, it allows for the material to be recycled without any residual odor or color.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:
