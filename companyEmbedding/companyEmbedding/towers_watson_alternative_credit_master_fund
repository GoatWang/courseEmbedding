Press Release


Willis Towers Watson launches high active share fund





                June 20, 2016
            






















LONDON, 20 June 2016 – Willis Towers Watson has launched an  equity fund for institutional investors which contains the top  unconstrained-equity ideas of the world’s best stock pickers. The new fund,  called Global Equity Focus Fund (GEFF), follows five other pooled funds - including  a diversified multi-asset fund (now with a ten-year track record), two liquid  alternative funds, and an alternative credit fund - which wrap Willis Towers  Watson’s best investment ideas. 
The new fund,  which provides daily liquidity, comprises the top 10 to 15 stock picks from  eight top-rated investment managers with risk managed at the portfolio level.
Paul Berriman,  Global Head of Willis Towers Watson’s funds business, said: “Our new equity  focus fund is specifically designed to provide institutional investors with  targeted access to the world’s best equity ideas with high levels of  transparency of the underlying investments, at competitive fees. This is  consistent with our vision to help all our clients - whether advisory or  delegated – to achieve the best net-of-fees returns for the right level of risk  and, if the vehicles don’t exist, we’ll build them.”
The company’s  funds provide portfolio construction, risk management and manager-selection  decisions, while using best-in-class asset managers for underlying security  selection and trading strategies. 
David Shapiro,  GEFF portfolio manager at Willis Towers Watson said: “When looking at what was  available to those clients wishing to invest in equities, we were dispirited by  the preponderance of expensive index-hugger-type products. So we built  something very different. We would assert that this high active share fund,  offered at such a competitive price, is a world first. While not for every  institutional investor, we are confident that many disillusioned institutional  equity investors, both large and small, will recognise the opportunity  presented by this approach.”
The company’s six  pooled funds have total assets under management of around US$5bn.

Press Release


            Willis Towers Watson launches secure income assets fund
        

            Willis Towers Watson has launched a new fund for institutional investors which provides a compelling alternative to index-linked gilts in funding liabilities and enhancing returns.
        


                March 13, 2017
            

| United Kingdom
                
            




















LONDON, 13 March 2017 –  Willis Towers Watson has launched a new fund for institutional investors which  provides a compelling alternative to index-linked gilts in funding liabilities  and enhancing returns.
The new fund, called  the Secure Income Fund, provides institutional investors with an  inflation-linked cash flow through investments which generate a better  risk-adjusted return than investment-grade credit and index-linked gilts. It  encompasses a wide range of strategies across real estate, infrastructure,  renewable energy and real asset debt and uses all implementation options  including secondaries and co-investments.
Willis Towers Watson  has been investing in secure income assets (SIAs) since 2006, and has a  30-strong team identifying the most appropriate opportunities and engaging with  skilled managers.  SIAs provide an  attractive cash flow profile, with an expected long term yield of 4-5% a year,  while also adding diversification to a portfolio.
Karen Dolenec, Global  Head of Real Assets at Willis Towers Watson, said: “With many institutional  investors continuing to prioritise inflation-linked income, the real yields  available from traditional assets have been squeezed. Clients have been telling  us about the challenges which they have faced in establishing a presence in the  alternative area of secure income investments.   The key benefit of the fund is that it offers a simple solution for  individual clients to benefit from our sourcing skills in an attractive but  difficult to access opportunity set.
“Our proactive approach  and scale have allowed us to develop strong relationships with a substantial  manager universe. We often work with members of the manager community to create  new products meaning that we are at the forefront of innovation while securing  capacity and preferential terms. All of this is in keeping with our objective  of ensuring that our clients are able to achieve the best possible outcomes at  an appropriate level of risk. If we don’t believe that the most appropriate  solution exists, we will create it.”  
About  Willis Towers Watson Investment 
Willis Towers Watson’s Investment business  is focused on creating financial value for institutional investors through its  expertise in risk assessment, strategic asset allocation, fiduciary management  and investment manager selection. It has over 900 associates worldwide, assets  under advisory of over US$2.3 trillion and over US$87 billion of assets under  management.

Alternatives

Investors understand the importance of an efficiently diversified portfolio where risk is well managed and where there are sources of return other than equities. But for many investors, achieving effective access to these often complex return-seeking strategies is challenging. 

Towers Watson has researched alternative investment strategies and advised our institutional clients on building and maintaining their alternative portfolios since 1995. We are firm believers in diversity and have built significant expertise in this area. Today some 40% of our global research resources are focused on alternative asset classes. Our extensive coverage includes all investable alternative asset classes of institutional quality.
Why Towers Watson?
We offer our clients advice on manager selection, construction of alternatives portfolios and on the integration of alternatives into the overall portfolio. For investors who prefer to focus on strategic issues, we offer a delegated investment service where partial or full management of the alternatives investments may be outsourced to our team of experts. Many investors have chosen to delegate management of their alternatives investments to Towers Watson instead of to a fund of funds provider because our tailored approach to portfolio construction delivers a more appropriate portfolio diversification at a lower fee. 
Our outstanding client base reflects our significant influence in this market. As one of the largest consultants in the world, with significant assets under management in alternatives, we have access to some of the most exciting global investment opportunities.
