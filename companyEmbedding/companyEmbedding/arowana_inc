Arowana Inc. Amends Agreement For Business Combination With VivoPower International PLC






Business Wire




Oct 18, 2016 9:04 AM EDT













 




























































  Arowana Inc. ("ARWA") (NASDAQ: ARWA, ARWAU, ARWAR, ARWAW), a public investment vehicle formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, acquisition or similar business combination, and VivoPower International PLC ("VivoPower"), a global solar power company, announced today that they have amended the contribution agreement pursuant to which ARWA will contribute cash held in its trust account to VivoPower in exchange for ordinary shares of VivoPower.  VivoPower is a global next generation solar power company that operates a build, transfer, operate model to establish an installed solar power asset base in a capital efficient manner. VivoPower intends to leverage this asset base to sell distributed generation power and manage data driven energy services for commercial, industrial and government customers. VivoPower has offices and personnel in the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia and across Asia. VivoPower is currently wholly owned by Arowana International Limited (ASX: AWN), an Australian company affiliated with certain of ARWA's officers and directors ("AWN").  Summary of Amendments  The material terms of the contribution agreement were amended as follows:   The maximum number of ARWA ordinary shares as to which ARWA shareholders may exercise their conversion rights under the contribution agreement was increased from 2,732,400 shares to 6,127,200 shares. Accordingly, the minimum amount of cash ARWA is required to contribute to VivoPower was decreased from $56,585,520 to $21,958,560 (less certain fees and expenses incurred by ARWA) and the minimum number of shares VivoPower is required to deliver to ARWA in exchange for such minimum contribution was decreased from 9,444,950 to 6,050,150.   To the extent that more than $21,958,560 remains in ARWA's trust account after payments to ARWA ordinary shareholders who properly exercise their conversion rights, ARWA will use the excess funds to purchase additional ordinary shares from VivoPower. However, VivoPower will in turn utilize those funds to repurchase VivoPower ordinary shares from AWN only to the extent that more than $56,585,520 remains in ARWA's trust account after such conversion payments, the same conditions that would have resulted in such repurchases pursuant to the contribution agreement as in effect prior to the amendment.   In connection with the transactions contemplated by the contribution agreement (the "Transactions"), VivoPower will acquire certain businesses, including Aevitas O Holdings Pty Ltd ("OptionCo"). The consummation of these acquisitions (the "Contingent Acquisitions") is conditional on the closing of the Transactions. In addition, as soon as practical after the closing of the Transactions and the Contingent Acquisitions, OptionCo will acquire over 99% of Aevitas Group Limited ("Aevitas"). The acquisition of Aevitas in turn would have triggered the repurchase or redemption of certain outstanding unsecured notes and convertible non-cumulative preference shares of Aevitas. Under the amendment, however, the notes and preference shares will remain outstanding on mutually agreed terms and will be redeemable for ordinary shares of VivoPower, in accordance with their terms. Furthermore, under the amendment, it is a condition to the parties' obligations to consummate the Transactions that the notes and preferred shares be amended in order to effectuate the changes described above.    The description of the amendment, the contribution agreement and the Transactions that is contained herein is only a summary and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the amendment and the contribution agreement relating to the Transactions, a copy of which will be filed by ARWA with the SEC as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K. Interested parties should visit the SEC website at www.sec.gov.  Extension Meeting and Business Combination Meeting  ARWA is scheduled to hold an extraordinary general meeting of its shareholders on November 3, 2016 (the "Extension Meeting") to consider and vote on proposals that will extend the time that ARWA has to complete the proposed business combination with VivoPower until January 9, 2017 (the "Extension"). The record date for the Extension Meeting is October 7, 2016.

MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A

VivoPower International and Arowana Inc. Announce Completion of Business Combination | Business Wire


























































VivoPower International and Arowana Inc. Announce Completion of 
      Business Combination





VivoPower Ordinary Shares to List on The Nasdaq Capital Market 
        Under the Symbol “VVPR”







December 28, 2016 06:50 PM Eastern Standard Time



LONDON & SYDNEY--(BUSINESS WIRE)--VivoPower International PLC (“VivoPower” or the “Company”), a global 
      next generation solar power company, and Arowana Inc. (Nasdaq:ARWA) 
      (“ARWA”), today announced the closing of their business combination 
      transaction.
    

      Pursuant to the transaction, ARWA contributed approximately $16.8 
      million in cash to VivoPower in exchange for 6,088,200 newly issued 
      VivoPower ordinary shares, which are to be distributed to holders of 
      ARWA’s ordinary shares, rights and warrants as of 28 December 2016 (the 
      “record date”). Holders of ARWA’s ordinary shares on the record date 
      will receive one VivoPower ordinary share for each ARWA share, or 
      4,769,850 shares in the aggregate. Holders of ARWA’s rights on the 
      record date will receive one-tenth of one VivoPower ordinary share for 
      each right, or 878,900 shares in the aggregate. Holders of ARWA’s 
      warrants on the record date will receive one-twentieth of one VivoPower 
      ordinary share for each warrant, or 439,450 shares in the aggregate.
    

      In connection with the transaction, VivoPower promptly will acquire 
      approximately 80.1% of the outstanding shares of VivoPower Pty Ltd 
      (“VivoPower Australia”) for a purchase price of 1,750,308 VivoPower 
      ordinary shares. VivoPower Australia operates photovoltaic (“PV”) solar 
      array projects in Australia. In addition, VivoPower will also promptly 
      acquire all of the outstanding shares of Aevitas O Holdings Pty Ltd 
      (“Aevitas Holdings”), which is a holding company that, promptly 
      following its acquisition by VivoPower, will acquire 99.9% of the 
      outstanding shares of Aevitas Group Limited (“Aevitas”), a provider of 
      power services throughout Australasia, for a purchase price of $9.1 
      million. In addition to its own operations, Aevitas owns the 19.9% of 
      VivoPower Australia’s outstanding shares not being acquired directly by 
      VivoPower.
    

      The contribution of cash by ARWA to VivoPower and the acquisitions by 
      VivoPower of VivoPower Australia and Aevitas Holdings, and the issuances 
      of VivoPower ordinary shares in connection therewith, are referred to 
      collectively as the “Business Combination.”
    

      Prior to the Business Combination, VivoPower was wholly owned by Arowana 
      International Limited (“AWN”), a publicly traded company on the 
      Australian Securities Exchange (“ASX”) that is an affiliate of certain 
      officers, directors and shareholders of ARWA. Upon completion of the 
      Business Combination, there will be 13,557,387 ordinary shares of 
      VivoPower issued and outstanding, with AWN and entities affiliated with 
      AWN owning a majority of such shares.
    

      VivoPower’s ordinary shares are scheduled to commence trading on The 
      Nasdaq Capital Market on or about 29 December 2016 under the symbol 
      “VVPR.” ARWA’s securities will cease trading on The Nasdaq Capital 
      Market as of 28 December 2016.
    

      Dr. Philip Comberg, Chief Executive Officer of VivoPower, commented, “We 
      are pleased to have completed the business combination transaction with 
      Arowana Inc. and to introduce as a public company this innovative next 
      generation solar company. The Nasdaq listing will provide VivoPower with 
      a platform to accelerate the execution of its strategic plan in the 
      coming months, which we believe will establish the Company as a leading 
      global solar power company and generate positive results for our 
      shareholders.”
    

      Kevin Chin, Non-Executive Chairman of the Board of VivoPower and 
      Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of ARWA, commented, 
      “VivoPower’s innovative and capital efficient business model has the 
      potential to deliver significant growth and maximize the performance and 
      value of solar assets for its customers. In under two years, development 
      and performance of the Company’s solar assets have exceeded 
      expectations. We are excited by the Company’s strong momentum and large 
      and growing global addressable market. We look forward to contributing 
      to and participating in the rollout of the Company’s plan to acquire, 
      build, finance and operate solar assets worldwide.”
    

      Upon the closing of the Business Combination, ARWA has no further 
      ongoing business operations and intends to dissolve and liquidate as 
      soon as practicable and to deregister its ordinary shares, rights, 
      warrants and units under Section 12(b), and suspend its periodic 
      reporting obligations under Section 15(d), of the Securities Exchange 
      Act of 1934, as amended.
    

      Following the closing, VivoPower’s Board of Directors plans to promptly 
      seek shareholder approval as required by U.K. law for the Company’s 
      repurchase of up $10 million of VivoPower’s outstanding ordinary shares. 
      Repurchased shares are expected to be held in treasury and used to seed 
      a dual listing of VivoPower’s ordinary shares on the ASX and be 
      available for reissuance under VivoPower’s proposed equity incentive 
      plan. Such repurchases are expected to be funded with operating cash 
      flow available to VivoPower. Share repurchases, if implemented, would 
      occur from time to time as market and business conditions warrant in 
      open market, negotiated or block transactions, and would be subject to 
      the availability of shares at prices which are acceptable to the 
      Company. Whether the Company makes any repurchases will depend on many 
      factors, including, but not limited to, the receipt of shareholder 
      approval, the availability of operating cash flow, VivoPower’s business 
      and financial performance, the business and market conditions at the 
      time, the price of the Company’s ordinary shares and other factors that 
      management considers relevant. Accordingly, there is no guarantee as to 
      the timing or number of shares that would be repurchased.
    

About VivoPower


      VivoPower is a global next generation solar power company that operates 
      a build, transfer and operate (“BTO”) model to establish an installed 
      solar power asset base in a capital efficient manner. VivoPower does 
      this by aggregating small and medium sized PV solar projects underpinned 
      by long term power purchasing agreements and then arranges corporate and 
      project financing, engineering design and equipment procurement and 
      manages the build out of such solar PV projects for asset owners. 
      VivoPower intends to leverage this asset base to sell distributed 
      generation power, manage power support services (encompassing 
      operations, maintenance and optimization) and data driven energy 
      services for commercial, industrial and government customers, pursuant 
      to long term contracts with the asset owners so as to maximize the 
      performance and value of their solar assets.

(1)$171,306 of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the 
   FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and 
   a portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid from the funds we 
   borrowed from Arowana Partners Group Pty Ltd. described below. These funds 
   will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us. If we 
   determine not to proceed with the offering, such amounts would not be repaid.  

(2)No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of 
   the private units.  

(3)The funds held in the trust account will be used to acquire a target 
   business, to pay holders who wish to convert or sell their shares for 
   a portion of the funds held in the trust account and potentially to pay 
   our expenses relating thereto, including a fee payable to EarlyBirdCapital 
   equal to 4.0% of the gross proceeds raised in this offering upon consummation 
   of our initial business combination for assisting us in connection with 
   our initial business combination. Our expenses relating to the acquisition 
   of a target business would either come from the funds held in the trust 
   account or additional funds otherwise available to us outside of the trust 
   account, including cash held by the target business. Any remaining funds 
   will be disbursed to the combined company and be used as working capital 
   to finance the operations of the target business.  

(4)The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at $500,000 
   even if the over-allotment is exercised. In addition, interest income earned 
   on the amounts held in the trust account (after payment of taxes owed on such 
   interest income) will be available to us to pay for our working capital 
   requirements. We estimate the interest earned on the trust account will be 
   approximately $45,900 over an 18-month period assuming an interest rate of 
   approximately 0.05% per year.  

(5)These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these 
   items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may 
   incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in 
   connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business combination 
   based upon the level of complexity of that business combination. We do not 
   anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than 
   fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which 
   fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific 
   category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess working capital.  

Our initial shareholders and their affiliates have committed to purchase an
aggregate of 455,000 private units at a price of $10.00 per unit ($4,550,000 in
the aggregate) in a private placement that will occur simultaneously with the
closing of this offering. Our initial shareholders and their affiliates have
also agreed that if the over-allotment option is exercised by the underwriters,
they will purchase from us at a price of $10.00 per unit an additional number of
private units (up to a maximum of 54,000 private units) pro rata with the amount
of the over-allotment option exercised so that at least $10.20 per share sold to
the public in this offering is held in trust regardless of whether the
over-allotment option is exercised in full or part. All of the proceeds we
receive from these purchases will be placed in the trust account described
below.

$73,440,000, or $84,456,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private units will be
placed in an account in the United States, maintained by Continental Stock
Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee. Pursuant to the
investment management trust agreement that will govern the investment of such
funds, the trustee, upon our written instructions, will direct UBS Financial
Services to invest the funds as set forth in such written instructions and to
custody the funds while invested and until otherwise instructed in accordance
with the investment management trust agreement. The funds held in trust will be
invested only in United States government treasury bills, bonds or notes having
a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting the applicable
conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940
and that invest solely in United States government treasuries, so that we are
not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Except
with respect to (i) interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that
may be released to us to pay our income or other tax obligations and (ii) any
remaining interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be
released to us for our working capital requirements, the proceeds will not be
released from the trust account until the earlier of the completion of a
business combination or our liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust account
may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which
we complete a business combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the
sellers of the target business may be used to finance operations of the target
business.

Commencing on the date of this prospectus, we will pay Arowana International, an
affiliate of our executive officers, a monthly fee of $10,000 pursuant to a
letter agreement for general and administrative services including office space,
utilities and secretarial support. The foregoing arrangement is being agreed to
by Arowana International for our benefit and is not intended to provide our
executive officers compensation in lieu of a salary. We believe, based on 
rents and fees for similar services in North Sydney, Australia, that the fee 
charged by Arowana International is at least as favorable as we could have 
obtained from an unaffiliated person. This arrangement will terminate upon 
completion of a business combination or our liquidation. 

Other than the $10,000 monthly administrative fee, no compensation of any kind
(including finder’s, consulting or other similar fees) will be paid to any of
our existing officers, directors, shareholders, or any of their affiliates,
prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the
consummation of the business combination (regardless of the type of transaction
that it is). However, such individuals will receive reimbursement for any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our
behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses, performing business due
diligence on suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as
traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective
target businesses to examine their operations. Since the role of present
management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to
determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a
business combination.

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working capital
requirements in searching for a business combination will be approximately
$500,000. In addition, the interest earned on the funds held in the trust
account (after payment of taxes owed on such interest income) may be released to
us to fund our working capital requirements in searching for a business
combination. We intend to use the excess working capital available for
miscellaneous expenses such as paying fees to consultants to assist us with our
search for a target business and for director and officer liability insurance
premiums, with the balance being held in reserve in the event due diligence,
legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business
combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our initial shareholders, officers and
directors in connection with activities on our behalf as described above. We
will also be entitled to have interest earned on the funds held in the trust
account released to us to pay any tax obligations that we may owe. We intend to
use the after-tax interest earned for miscellaneous expenses such as paying fees
to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business and for
director and officer liability insurance premiums, with the balance being held
in reserve in the event due diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses of
structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed our estimates, as well
as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our initial
shareholders, officers and directors in connection with activities on our behalf
as described below.

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account,
along with the available interest earned on the funds held in the trust account,
represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the event
that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such
proceeds within the above described categories. If our estimate of the costs of
undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating our initial business
combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, or the amount of
interest available from the trust account is insufficient as a result of the
current low interest rate environment, we may be required to raise additional
capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from members of our management team, but such
members of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We will likely use a substantial portion of the net proceeds of this offering,
including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business, to
pay holders who wish to convert or sell their shares to us for a portion of the
funds held in the trust account and to pay our expenses relating thereto,
including a fee payable to EarlyBirdCapital equal to 4.0% of the gross proceeds
raised in this offering (exclusive of any applicable finders’ fees which might
become payable) upon consummation of our initial business combination for
assisting us in connection with our initial business combination. If the 
payment of our liabilities, including the fee payable to EarlyBirdCapital, 
were to reduce the amount available to us in trust necessary to pay all holders 
who wish to convert or sell their shares to us for a portion of the funds held 
in the trust account, we would not be able to consummate such transaction. To 
the extent that our share capital is used in whole or in part as consideration 
to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust account which 
are not used to consummate a business combination, to pay holders who wish to 
convert their shares into a portion of the funds held in the trust account 
or pay our expenses relating thereto (which could include the up to $2,760,000 
payable to EarlyBirdCapital described above if the over-allotment option is 
exercised in full) will be disbursed to the combined company and will, along 
with any other net proceeds not expended, be used as working capital to 
finance the operations of the target business. Such working capital funds 
could be used in a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the 
target business’ operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, 
research and development of existing or new products. 

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidating our trust account from our remaining assets outside of
the trust account. If such funds are insufficient, Kevin Chin has agreed to
advance us the funds necessary to complete such liquidation (currently
anticipated to be no more than $15,000) and has agreed not to seek repayment of
such expenses.

As of February 28, 2015, Arowana Partners Group Pty Ltd. loaned to us an
aggregate of $171,306 to be used to pay a portion of the expenses of this
offering referenced in the line items above for SEC registration fee, FINRA
filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a portion
of the legal and audit fees and expenses. The loan is payable without interest
on the earlier of (i) October 21, 2015, (ii) the date on which we consummate our
initial public offering or (iii) the date on which we determine to not proceed
with our initial public offering. The loan will be repaid out of the proceeds of
this offering available to us for payment of offering expenses. If we determine
not to proceed with the offering, such amounts would not be repaid.

In order to meet our working capital needs following the consummation of this
offering until completion of an initial business combination, our initial
shareholders, officers and directors or their affiliates may, but are not
obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever
amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion. Each loan would be
evidenced by a promissory note. The notes would either be paid upon consummation
of our initial business combination, without interest, or, at the lender’s
discretion, up to $500,000 of the notes may be converted upon consummation of
our business combination into additional private units at a price of $10.00 per
unit (which, for example, would result in the holders being issued 55,000
ordinary shares if $500,000 of notes were so converted since the 50,000 rights
included in the private units would result in the issuance of 5,000 shares upon
the closing of our business combination, as well as 50,000 warrants to purchase
25,000 shares). Our shareholders have approved the issuance of the units and
underlying securities upon conversion of such notes, to the extent the holder
wishes to so convert them at the time of the consummation of our initial
business combination. If we do not complete our initial business combination,
the loans would not be repaid.

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account to
the extent not previously released to us) only in the event of (i) our
liquidation if we have not completed a business combination within the required
time period or (ii) if that public shareholder converts such public shares or
sells them to us in a tender offer in each case in connection with a business
combination which we consummate or in connection with an amendment to our
memorandum and articles of association prior to the consummation of an initial
business combination. In no other circumstances will a public shareholder have
any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.


In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we may encounter
intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to
ours. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience
identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates.
Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources
than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted
with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there may be numerous
potential target businesses that we could acquire with the net proceeds of this
offering, our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses
may be limited by our available financial resources.

The following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses:

•our obligation to seek shareholder approval of a business combination or 
 obtain the necessary financial information to be sent to shareholders in 
 connection with such business combination may delay or prevent the completion 
 of a transaction;  

•our obligation to convert public shares held by our public shareholders may 
 reduce the resources available to us for a business combination;  

•Nasdaq may require us to file a new listing application and meet its initial 
 listing requirements to maintain the listing of our securities following a 
 business combination;  

•our outstanding rights, warrants and unit purchase options, and the potential 
 future dilution they represent;  

•our obligation to pay EarlyBirdCapital a fee of 4.0% of the gross proceeds 
 of this offering upon consummation of our initial business combination;  

•our obligation to either repay or issue private units upon conversion of up 
 to $500,000 of working capital loans that may be made to us by our initial 
 shareholders, officers, directors or their affiliates;  

•our obligation to register the resale of the insider shares, as well as the 
 private units (and underlying securities) and any securities issued to our 
 initial shareholders, officers, directors or their affiliates upon conversion 
 of working capital loans; and  

•the impact on the target business’ assets as a result of unknown liabilities 
 under the securities laws or otherwise depending on developments involving us 
 prior to the consummation of a business combination.  

Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully
negotiating a business combination. Our management believes, however, that our
status as a public entity and potential access to the United States public
equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately-held entities
having a similar business objective as ours in acquiring a target business with
significant growth potential on favorable terms. Furthermore, the fact that we
will not be required to pay our underwriters any deferred compensation upon
consummation of an initial business combination may give us a competitive
advantage over other similarly structured blank check companies.

If we succeed in effecting a business combination, there will be, in all
likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business. We
cannot assure you that, subsequent to a business combination, we will have the
resources or ability to compete effectively.


Company Description
We are a Cayman Islands company incorporated on October 1, 2014 as an exempted
company with limited liability. Exempted companies are Cayman Islands companies
wishing to conduct business outside the Cayman Islands and, as such, are
exempted from complying with certain provisions of the Companies


 Law. As an
exempted company, we have applied for and received a tax exemption undertaking
from the Cayman Islands government that, in accordance with section 6 of the Tax
Concessions Law (2011 Revision) of the Cayman Islands, for a period of 20 years
from the date of the undertaking, no law which is enacted in the Cayman Islands
imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations shall
apply to us or our operations and, in addition, that no tax to be levied on
profits, income, gains or appreciations or which is in the nature of estate duty
or inheritance tax shall be payable (i) on or in respect of our shares,
debentures or other obligations or (ii) by way of the withholding in whole or in
part of a payment of dividend or other distribution of income or capital by us
to our shareholders or a payment of principal or interest or other sums due
under a debenture or other obligation of us.

We were formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset
acquisition, share purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or similar
business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to
as a “target business.” While our efforts to identify a prospective target
business will not necessarily be limited to a particular industry or geographic
region of the world, we initially intend to focus on target businesses located
in the Asia Pacific region (with a particular emphasis on South East Asia and
Australia) operating in the energy (including solar and alternative energy)
industry, or target businesses in such industry operating outside of those
geographic locations which we believe would benefit from expanding their 
operations to such locations. We do not have any specific business combination 
under consideration and we have not (nor has anyone on our behalf), directly or
indirectly, contacted any prospective target business or had any discussions, 
formal or otherwise, with respect to such a transaction.

We will either (1) seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination
at a meeting called for such purpose at which public shareholders may seek to
convert their public shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the
proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount
then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable) or (2) provide our
public shareholders with the opportunity to sell their public shares to us by
means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a shareholder vote) for
an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit
in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the
limitations described herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our initial
shareholders have agreed, pursuant to written letter agreements with us, not to
convert any public shares held by them into their pro rata share of the
aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account. The decision as to
whether we will seek shareholder approval of our proposed business combination
or allow shareholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made
by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such
as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would
otherwise require us to seek shareholder approval. Unlike other blank check
companies which require shareholder votes and conduct proxy solicitations in
conjunction with their initial business combinations and related conversions of
public shares for cash upon consummation of such initial business combinations
even when a vote is not required by law, we will have the flexibility to avoid
such shareholder vote and allow our shareholders to sell their shares pursuant
to the tender offer rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. In
that case, we will file tender offer documents with the SEC which will contain
substantially the same financial and other information about the initial
business combination as is required under the SEC’s proxy rules. We will
consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets
of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, solely if we seek shareholder
approval, a majority of the outstanding ordinary shares voted are voted in favor
of the business combination.

We will have until 18 months from the consummation of this offering to
consummate our initial business combination. If we are unable to consummate our
initial business combination within this time period, we will liquidate the
trust account and distribute the proceeds held therein to our public
shareholders and dissolve. If we are forced to liquidate, we anticipate that we
would distribute to our public shareholders the amount in the trust account
calculated as of the date that is two days prior to the distribution date
(including any accrued interest). Prior to such distribution, we would be
required to assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us by our
creditors for amounts they are actually owed and make provision for such
amounts, as creditors take priority over our public shareholders with respect to
amounts that are owed to them. We cannot assure you that we will properly assess
all claims that may be potentially brought against us. As such, our shareholders
could potentially be liable for any claims of creditors to the extent of
distributions received by them as an unlawful payment in the event we enter an
insolvent liquidation.

Pursuant to the Nasdaq listing rules, our initial business combination must be
with a target business or businesses whose collective fair market value is at
least equal to 80% of the balance in the trust account at the time of the
execution of a definitive agreement for such business combination, although this
may entail simultaneous acquisitions of several target businesses. The fair
market value of the target will be determined by our board of directors based
upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such
as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or book value). The
target business or businesses that we acquire may have a collective fair market
value substantially in excess of 80% of the trust account balance.

We are not required to obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated third party that
the target business we select has a fair market value in excess of at least 80%
of the balance of the trust account unless our board of directors cannot make
such determination on its own. We are also not required to obtain an opinion
from an unaffiliated third party indicating that the price we are paying is fair
to our shareholders from a financial point of view unless the target is
affiliated with our officers, directors, initial shareholders or their
affiliates.

We currently anticipate structuring our initial business combination to acquire
100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We
may, however, structure our initial business combination where we merge directly
with the target business or where we acquire less than 100% of such interests or
assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target
management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete
such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% 
or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires
a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to 
register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as 
amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company 
owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our 
shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority 
interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to 
the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could
pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in 
exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we 
would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target; however, as a result of
the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately
prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our 
outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 
100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are 
owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, only the portion of such 
business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for 
purposes of the 80% of net assets test. 

We view all of the provisions relating to our proposed offering, structure 
and business plan which are contained in our amended and restated memorandum 
and articles of association as binding obligations to our shareholders and 
neither we, nor our officers or directors, will take any action to amend or 
waive any of these provisions unless we provide dissenting public shareholders 
with the opportunity to convert their public shares into the right to receive 
cash from the trust account in connection with any such vote. The foregoing is 
set forth in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association 
and cannot be amended.

VivoPower International and Arowana Inc. Announce Completion of Business Combination


LONDON & SYDNEY--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

      VivoPower International PLC (“VivoPower” or the “Company”), a global 
      next generation solar power company, and Arowana Inc. (Nasdaq:ARWA) 
      (“ARWA”), today announced the closing of their business combination 
      transaction.
    

      Pursuant to the transaction, ARWA contributed approximately $16.8 
      million in cash to VivoPower in exchange for 6,088,200 newly issued 
      VivoPower ordinary shares, which are to be distributed to holders of 
      ARWA’s ordinary shares, rights and warrants as of 28 December 2016 (the 
      “record date”). Holders of ARWA’s ordinary shares on the record date 
      will receive one VivoPower ordinary share for each ARWA share, or 
      4,769,850 shares in the aggregate. Holders of ARWA’s rights on the 
      record date will receive one-tenth of one VivoPower ordinary share for 
      each right, or 878,900 shares in the aggregate. Holders of ARWA’s 
      warrants on the record date will receive one-twentieth of one VivoPower 
      ordinary share for each warrant, or 439,450 shares in the aggregate.
    

      In connection with the transaction, VivoPower promptly will acquire 
      approximately 80.1% of the outstanding shares of VivoPower Pty Ltd 
      (“VivoPower Australia”) for a purchase price of 1,750,308 VivoPower 
      ordinary shares. VivoPower Australia operates photovoltaic (“PV”) solar 
      array projects in Australia. In addition, VivoPower will also promptly 
      acquire all of the outstanding shares of Aevitas O Holdings Pty Ltd 
      (“Aevitas Holdings”), which is a holding company that, promptly 
      following its acquisition by VivoPower, will acquire 99.9% of the 
      outstanding shares of Aevitas Group Limited (“Aevitas”), a provider of 
      power services throughout Australasia, for a purchase price of $9.1 
      million. In addition to its own operations, Aevitas owns the 19.9% of 
      VivoPower Australia’s outstanding shares not being acquired directly by 
      VivoPower.
    

      The contribution of cash by ARWA to VivoPower and the acquisitions by 
      VivoPower of VivoPower Australia and Aevitas Holdings, and the issuances 
      of VivoPower ordinary shares in connection therewith, are referred to 
      collectively as the “Business Combination.”
    

      Prior to the Business Combination, VivoPower was wholly owned by Arowana 
      International Limited (“AWN”), a publicly traded company on the 
      Australian Securities Exchange (“ASX”) that is an affiliate of certain 
      officers, directors and shareholders of ARWA. Upon completion of the 
      Business Combination, there will be 13,557,387 ordinary shares of 
      VivoPower issued and outstanding, with AWN and entities affiliated with 
      AWN owning a majority of such shares.
    

      VivoPower’s ordinary shares are scheduled to commence trading on The 
      Nasdaq Capital Market on or about 29 December 2016 under the symbol 
      “VVPR.” ARWA’s securities will cease trading on The Nasdaq Capital 
      Market as of 28 December 2016.
    

      Dr. Philip Comberg, Chief Executive Officer of VivoPower, commented, “We 
      are pleased to have completed the business combination transaction with 
      Arowana Inc. and to introduce as a public company this innovative next 
      generation solar company. The Nasdaq listing will provide VivoPower with 
      a platform to accelerate the execution of its strategic plan in the 
      coming months, which we believe will establish the Company as a leading 
      global solar power company and generate positive results for our 
      shareholders.”
    

      Kevin Chin, Non-Executive Chairman of the Board of VivoPower and 
      Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of ARWA, commented, 
      “VivoPower’s innovative and capital efficient business model has the 
      potential to deliver significant growth and maximize the performance and 
      value of solar assets for its customers. In under two years, development 
      and performance of the Company’s solar assets have exceeded 
      expectations. We are excited by the Company’s strong momentum and large 
      and growing global addressable market. We look forward to contributing 
      to and participating in the rollout of the Company’s plan to acquire, 
      build, finance and operate solar assets worldwide.”
    

      Upon the closing of the Business Combination, ARWA has no further 
      ongoing business operations and intends to dissolve and liquidate as 
      soon as practicable and to deregister its ordinary shares, rights, 
      warrants and units under Section 12(b), and suspend its periodic 
      reporting obligations under Section 15(d), of the Securities Exchange 
      Act of 1934, as amended.
    

      Following the closing, VivoPower’s Board of Directors plans to promptly 
      seek shareholder approval as required by U.K. law for the Company’s 
      repurchase of up $10 million of VivoPower’s outstanding ordinary shares. 
      Repurchased shares are expected to be held in treasury and used to seed 
      a dual listing of VivoPower’s ordinary shares on the ASX and be 
      available for reissuance under VivoPower’s proposed equity incentive 
      plan. Such repurchases are expected to be funded with operating cash 
      flow available to VivoPower. Share repurchases, if implemented, would 
      occur from time to time as market and business conditions warrant in 
      open market, negotiated or block transactions, and would be subject to 
      the availability of shares at prices which are acceptable to the 
      Company. Whether the Company makes any repurchases will depend on many 
      factors, including, but not limited to, the receipt of shareholder 
      approval, the availability of operating cash flow, VivoPower’s business 
      and financial performance, the business and market conditions at the 
      time, the price of the Company’s ordinary shares and other factors that 
      management considers relevant. Accordingly, there is no guarantee as to 
      the timing or number of shares that would be repurchased.
    

About VivoPower


      VivoPower is a global next generation solar power company that operates 
      a build, transfer and operate (“BTO”) model to establish an installed 
      solar power asset base in a capital efficient manner. VivoPower does 
      this by aggregating small and medium sized PV solar projects underpinned 
      by long term power purchasing agreements and then arranges corporate and 
      project financing, engineering design and equipment procurement and 
      manages the build out of such solar PV projects for asset owners. 
      VivoPower intends to leverage this asset base to sell distributed 
      generation power, manage power support services (encompassing 
      operations, maintenance and optimization) and data driven energy 
      services for commercial, industrial and government customers, pursuant 
      to long term contracts with the asset owners so as to maximize the 
      performance and value of their solar assets.
