Kelly Ortberg
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer





Leadership








Kelly Ortberg is chairman, president and chief executive officer of Rockwell
Collins, a global leader in aviation and high-integrity solutions. When Ortberg
was named CEO in 2013, his number one mission was to accelerate the company's
growth by capitalizing on strong positions Rockwell Collins has secured on the
world's leading aircraft, expanding global business initiatives, repositioning
the company's Government Systems portfolio, and leading the charge to transform
the aviation ecosphere through new information management services.
Under Ortberg's leadership, Rockwell Collins has been added to the Fortune
500 list with more than $5 billion in annual revenues; has been named one of
"America's Best Large Employers" by Forbes magazine two years in a row; and is
the only aerospace and defense company named as one of the "World's Most Ethical
Companies" by The Ethisphere Institute.
He also guided Rockwell Collins through the largest acquisitions in the
company's history with the purchase of B/E Aerospace in 2017 and ARINC in 2013. The moves marked new
strategic directions for the company with the creation of two business segments, Interior Systems and Information
Management Services, which diversified and broadened Rockwell Collins' product and service offerings for the aerospace and defense industry. 
Ortberg's experience leading teams throughout his career at Rockwell Collins,
which began as a program manager in 1987, taught him the importance of an
engaged and motivated workforce. As executive vice president and chief operating
officer of the company's Government Systems business, a position he held from
2010 to 2012, Ortberg was challenged with managing through the effects of
sequestration, and yet was able to keep his team focused on achieving key
program wins that are helping fuel the company's long-term growth.
As chief operating officer of the company's Commercial Systems business from
2006 to 2010, Ortberg motivated his teams to innovate and create Rockwell
Collins' highly successful Pro Line Fusion® integrated avionics system, selected
by leading aircraft manufacturers for platforms ranging from turboprop, light
jet and rotary-wing aircraft to air transport and military tanker aircraft. 
Ortberg's dedication to superior customer value played a key role in a string
of high profile program wins under his leadership, including Airbus A350 XWB,
Bombardier C Series, Boeing 787, Boeing 737 MAX and Boeing 777X. In addition,
Rockwell Collins has been named as a supplier of choice by aircraft original
equipment manufacturers across the globe.
A native of Dubuque, Iowa, Ortberg earned a Bachelor of Science degree in
Mechanical Engineering from The University of Iowa. Today, he continues to
encourage students to pursue STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math)
careers. He serves on The University of Iowa Engineering Advisory Board; is
co-chairman of the board of directors of FIRST® (For Inspiration and Recognition
of Science and Technology); and is a member of the Iowa Business Council and the
Governor's STEM Advisory Council. Ortberg also serves on the Board of Governors
of the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA) and is a member of The Business
Council.

          Kelly Ortberg        











BS 1982 in Mechanical EngineeringKelly Ortberg is chief executive officer, president, and chairman of the board of Rockwell Collins, Inc.. He was appointed president in September 2012, elected CEO in July 2013, and elected chairman in November 2015.
Mr. Ortberg joined the company in 1987 as a program manager and held various leadership positions of increasing responsibility over the course of his career. Among other achievements, he played a pivotal role in milestone contracts for Rockwell Collins in both Commercial and Government Systems, launched innovative product lines that continue to transform commercial and military operations, and helped set the strategy for the future direction of the company.
Before becoming president, he served as executive vice president and chief operating officer of Government Systems from February 2010 to September 2012. Government Systems provides airborne and surface solutions to the U.S. Department of Defense, ministries of defense throughout the world and manufacturers of military platforms. In that role, he led major contract wins, including avionics business on the KC-4A, KC-10 and the Embraer KC-390.
Previously, Mr. Ortberg served as executive vice president and chief operating officer of Commercial Systems for Rockwell Collins, which produces aviation electronics and communications for the air transport, business aviation and regional airline market segments. He was appointed to this position in October 2006 and oversaw pursuit and development programs for the Airbus A350 XWB, Boeing 787 and Bombardier CSeries. He also oversaw the launch of Rockwell Collins’ highly successful Pro Line Fusion® integrated avionics system, which has been selected for more than 15 platforms ranging from turbo props and light jets to air transport and tanker aircraft for manufacturers across the globe.
A native of Dubuque, IA, Mr. Ortberg serves on the board of directors for the Rockwell Collins Good Government Committee, The University of Iowa Engineering Advisory Board, the Hawkeye Area Council of the Boy Scouts of America, and FIRST® (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology).  He also serves on the Board of Governors of the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA), is a member of the Iowa Business Council, and the Governor’s STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) Advisory Council.
