Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/26/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

LAS VEGAS, Feb. 16, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- MGM Growth Properties LLC ("MGP" or the "Company") (NYSE:    MGP) today reported financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016. Net income attributable to MGP Class A shareholders for the quarter was $12.4 million, or $0.21 per dilutive share.








Financial highlights for the fourth quarter of 2016:

Rental revenue was $163.2 million; 
Net income was $51.0 million; 
Funds From Operations(1) ("FFO") was $114.8 million, or $0.47 per diluted Operating Partnership unit; 
Adjusted Funds From Operations(2) ("AFFO") was $118.7 million, or $0.49 per diluted Operating Partnership unit; 
Adjusted EBITDA(3) was $159.0 million; and 
General and administrative expenses were $3.4 million.

"2016 was an extraordinary debut year for MGM Growth Properties and our shareholders. The Company's $1.2 billion initial public offering was one of the largest of the year and was named International Financing Review magazine's 2016 U.S. IPO of the year. We acquired the real property of the Borgata, increased our dividend 8 percent, strengthened our balance sheet, and were added to the MSCI U.S. REIT Index," said James Stewart, CEO of MGM Growth Properties. "Looking ahead into 2017, we remain focused on further driving shareholder value and strategically growing our premier asset portfolio."
On December 15, 2016, the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.3875 per Class A share (based on a $1.55 dividend on an annualized basis), which was paid on January 16, 2017 to holders of record on December 30, 2016.
In January 2017, the Company announced that Robert "Bob" W. Smith was elected to serve as the third independent director to the Company's Board of Directors. Mr. Smith has nearly thirty years of investment experience, serving in various roles at T. Rowe Price, including as Vice President of T. Rowe Price Group, Inc., Vice President and Portfolio Manager at T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. and as a Lead Portfolio Manager at T. Rowe Price International, Inc. In addition, Mr. Smith served as a Vice President at T. Rowe Price Trust Company. Prior to joining T. Rowe Price, he was as an Investment Analyst at MFS Investment Management.
The following table provides a reconciliation of MGP's net income to FFO, AFFO and Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended December 31, 2016 (in thousands, except unit and per unit amounts):

Financial Position
The Company had $360.5 million of cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2016. Cash received from rent payments under the master lease for the three-month period ending December 31, 2016 was $162.5 million. 
On October 14, 2016, MGM Growth Properties Operating Partnership LP (the "Operating Partnership") made a cash distribution of $94.1 million relating to the third quarter dividend declared with respect to the Operating Partnership units, $71.8 million of which was paid to subsidiaries of MGM Resorts International and $22.3 million was paid to MGP. Simultaneously, MGP paid a cash dividend of $0.3875 per Class A share.
On December 6, 2016, with respect to debt outstanding under term loan B facility, the Operating Partnership entered into interest rate swap agreements that mature in November 2021 with a total $500 million notional amount. The weighted average fixed rate paid is 1.825%, and the variable rate received resets monthly to the one-month LIBOR subject to a minimum rate of 0.75%. On January 26, 2017, the Operating Partnership entered into additional interest rate swap agreements that mature in November 2021 with a total $700 million notional amount to pay a fixed rate of 1.964% and receive the 1-month LIBOR rate.
On February 2, 2017, Moody's Investor Service upgraded the corporate family rating of MGP from B1 to Ba3.  As a result of this upgrade, the Operating Partnership's term loan B facility received a 25 basis point reduction in pricing  from LIBOR plus 2.75% with a LIBOR floor of 0.75% to LIBOR plus 2.50%, with a LIBOR floor of 0.75%.
"We are extremely proud of the progress we've made over the course of the quarter in further positioning our balance sheet for sustained value creation,"  said Andy Chien, CFO of MGM Growth Properties. "The successful execution of our term loan B repricing, interest rate swaps and subsequent to the quarter, credit rating upgrade, have put us in position to continue to drive shareholder value."

Funds From Operations ("FFO") is net income (computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP), excluding gains and losses from sales or disposals of property (presented as property transactions, net), plus real estate depreciation, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"). 
Adjusted Funds From Operations ("AFFO") is FFO as adjusted for amortization of financing costs and the net amortization of the above market lease, non-cash compensation expense, acquisition related expenses, provision for income taxes and the net effect of straight-line rents and amortization of deferred revenue. 
Adjusted EBITDA is net income (computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP) as adjusted for gains and losses from sales or disposals of property (presented as property transactions, net), real estate depreciation, interest income, interest expense (including amortization of financing costs and the net amortization of the above market lease), non-cash compensation expense, acquisition related expenses, provision for income taxes and the net effect of straight-line rents and amortization of deferred revenue.

Management believes that FFO, FFO per unit, AFFO, AFFO per unit and Adjusted EBITDA are useful supplemental performance measures that have not been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP") to investors in comparing operating and financial results between periods. Management believes that this is especially true since these measures exclude real estate depreciation and amortization expense and management believes that real estate values fluctuate based on market conditions rather than depreciating in value ratably on a straight-line basis over time. The Company believes such a presentation also provides investors with a more meaningful measure of the Company's operating results in comparison to the operating results of other REITs. Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors to further supplement AFFO and FFO and to provide investors a performance metric which excludes interest expense. In addition to non-cash items, beginning with the third quarter of 2016, the Company revised its calculations of AFFO and Adjusted EBITDA for acquisition-related expenses. While we do not label these expenses as non-recurring, infrequent or unusual, management believes that it is helpful to adjust for these expenses when they do occur to allow for comparability of results between periods because each acquisition is (and will be) of varying size and complexity and may involve different types of expenses depending on the type of property being acquired and from whom. This revision to such calculations had no significant impact on our AFFO and Adjusted EBITDA as reported in prior periods.
FFO, FFO per unit, AFFO, AFFO per unit and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent cash flow from operations as defined by U.S. GAAP, should not be considered as an alternative to net income as defined by U.S. GAAP and are not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs. Investors are also cautioned that FFO, FFO per unit, AFFO, AFFO per unit and Adjusted EBITDA as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other REITs due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions.
Reconciliations of net income (loss) to FFO, AFFO and Adjusted EBITDA are included in this release.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
