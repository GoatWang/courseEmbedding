We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the ADSs or preferred shares
by the selling shareholders. If the underwriters and the Brazilian underwriters
exercise their over-allotment option, we will use the proceeds from the sale of
over-allotment shares (approximately U.S.$18 million, if the over-allotment
option is exercised in full) for planned capital expenditures.

 

Ultrapar’s planned capital expenditures in 2005 are R$299 million. Of this
amount, investments in Ultragaz should amount to approximately R$83 million, a
7% reduction as compared to 2004, as part of its strategy of focusing on
productivity and efficiency. At Oxiteno, investments are expected to amount to
approximately R$181 million in 2005, higher than in recent years mainly due to
investments in expanding our production capacity of specialty chemicals and in
the new production plant of fatty alcohol. In 2005, Ultracargo will maintain its
strategy of investing in storage facilities and truck fleet. Ultracargo expects
to invest approximately R$35 million in 2005.


LPG competes with natural gas, wood, diesel, fuel oil and electricity. Natural
gas is currently the principal source of energy against which we compete.
Natural gas is currently less expensive than LPG for industrial consumers who
purchase large volumes, but more expensive for residential consumers. In
addition, supply of natural gas requires significant investments in pipelines.
The development of alternatives sources of energy in the future may adversely
affect the LPG market and consequently our business, financial results and
results of operations. 
-----

Ultragaz’s main competitors are:

†   SHV Gas, formed by the merger of Minasgs S.A. and Supergasbrs S.A. and        
    controlled by SHV Energy, a major multinational LPG distributor, which        
    operates through its two separate brands, “Minasgs” and “Supergasbrs”;        

†   Liquigs, formerly controlled by ENI Group and acquired by Petrobras in June   
    2004, which has been operating in the Brazilian LPG distribution sector for   
    more than 40 years; and                                                       

†   Butano, a domestic Brazilian LPG distributor which has been present in the    
    market for more than 45 years.

  (2)   Proportional to SHV equity stakes in the operating companies. As of July 
        2004, SHV Gas owned 100% of its operating subsidiaries in Brazil.        

Prior to 1990, the government specified the areas in which LPG distributors were
permitted to operate and each LPG distributor was allocated a limit in its LPG
sales for each Brazilian geographic region in which it operated. These limits
impacted the growth of larger LPG distributors and limited competition among LPG
distributors. These restrictions were removed as part of the deregulation
process, resulting in a substantial increase in competition among domestic LPG
distributors.
-----

Oxiteno competes largely with imported products. Since 1990, it has had to
operate in an increasingly competitive environment due to imports from
international and transnational petrochemical industries. As imported products
are mostly commodity chemicals, competition is based principally on price.
Importers incur additional costs when selling their products in the Brazilian
market, due to import tariffs which generally range between 12% and 14%, and
additional freight charges. However, factors such as product quality, timely
delivery, reliability of supply and technical service and support are also
important competitive factors. Because it is a local producer, Oxiteno believes
it has a particular competitive advantage over imports with regard to timely
delivery and reliability of supply.

In the case of specialty chemicals, Oxiteno competes primarily with other
Brazilian producers (which buy ethylene oxide from Oxiteno) and pricing is a
less decisive competitive factor than with true commodity chemicals, while
conformity with specifications, product performance and reliability of service
are comparatively more important. Access to technology and research and
development are important factors with regard to conformity to specifications
and product performance, especially in the development of new products to meet
customers’ needs. As Oxiteno’s competitors have research and development
resources, Oxiteno’s strategy involves ensuring access to technology through its
own research and development activity, licensing and joint ventures, if
appropriate opportunities become available.

Oxiteno’s principal competitors are Shell Brasil Ltda., Exxon Mobil Qumica
Ltda., Dow Brasil S.A., Lyondell Qumica do Brasil Ltda., Cognis Brasil Ltda.,
Clariant S.A. and BASF S.A.

Our origins date to 1937 when our founder, Ernesto Igel, brought LPG to be used
as cooking gas in Brazil. In 1966, we formed the operating subsidiaries of
Ultracargo to satisfy the demand for high quality transportation services for
chemicals and LPG. We were also one of the pioneers in developing Brazil’s
petrochemical industry with the creation of Oxiteno in 1970.

Leading market positions across businesses

Ultragaz is the largest LPG distributor in Brazil and the sixth largest
independent distributor in the world in terms of volume sold. It has a national
market share of 24% and is present in every state, excluding the Amazon region,
reaching more than 10.5 million homes. For the year ended December 31, 2004,
Ultragaz’s total volume sold reached 1.5 million tons of LPG.

Oxiteno is the sole producer of ethylene oxide and its principal derivatives in
the Mercosur region and is also a major producer of specialty chemicals. Our
chemical operations supply a broad range of market segments, particularly
agricultural chemicals, food, cosmetics, leather, detergents, packaging for

varnishes. For the year ended December 31, 2004, Oxiteno sold approximately 518
thousand tons of chemical products. In the Brazilian market for these products
we compete principally with imports. Imports of ethylene glycol and
methyl-ethyl-ketone, two of our most important products, represented
approximately 30% and 10% respectively, of the volumes sold in Brazil during the
year ended December 31, 2004.

SWOT Analysis
SWOT, which stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats, is an analytical framework that identifies the internal and external factors that are favorable and unfavorable for a company.

Enhanced SWOT Analysis
Enhanced SWOT is a 3×3 grid that arranges strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats into one scheme:

How to use the strengths to take advantage of the opportunities?
How to use the strengths to reduce likelihood and impact of the threats?
How to overcome the weaknesses that obstruct taking advantage of the opportunities? 
How to overcome the weaknesses that can make the threats a reality?

Upon answering these questions a company can develop a project plan to improve its business performance.

PESTEL Analysis
PESTEL (also termed as PESTLE) is an ideal tool to strategically analyze what influence different outside factors – political, economic, sociocultural, technological, environmental and legal – exert on a business to later chart its long term targets.
Being part of the external analysis when carrying out a strategic assessment or performing a market study, PESTEL gives an overview of diverse macro-environmental factors that any company should thoughtfully consider. By perceiving these outside environments, businesses can maximally benefit from the opportunities while minimizing the threats to the organization.
Key Factors Examined by PESTEL Analysis:

Political – What opportunities and pressures are brought by political bodies and what is the degree of public regulations’ impact on the business?
Economic – What economic policies, trends and structures are expected to affect the organization, what is this influence’s degree?
Sociological – What cultural and societal aspects will work upon the demand for the business’s products and operations?
Technological – What impact do the technological aspects, innovations, incentives and barriers have on the organization?
Environmental – What environmental and ecological facets, both locally and farther afield, are likely to predetermine the business?
Legal – What laws and legislation will exert influence on the style the business is carried out?


IFE, EFE, IE Matrices
The Internal Factor Evaluation matrix (IFE matrix) is a strategic management tool helping audit or evaluate major weaknesses and strengths in a business’s functional areas. In addition, IFE matrix serves as a basis for identifying and assessing relationships amongst those areas. The IFE matrix is utilised in strategy formulation.
The External Factor Evaluation matrix (EFE matrix) is a tool of strategic management that is typically utilised to assess current market conditions. It is an ideal instrument for visualising and prioritising the threats and opportunities a firm is facing.
The essential difference between the above mentioned matrices lies in the type of factors incorporated in the model; whilst the latter is engaged in internal factors, the former deals exceptionally with external factors – those exposed to social, political, economic, legal, etc. external forces. 
Being a continuation of the EFE matrix and IFE matrix models, the Internal External matrix (IE matrix) rests upon an investigation of external and internal business factors integrated into one suggestive model. 

Porter Five Forces Analysis
The Porter’s five forces analysis studies the industry of operation and helps the company find new sources of competitive advantage. The analysis surveys an industry through five major questions:

What composes a threat of substitute products and services?
Is there a threat of new competitors entering the market?
What is the intensity of competitive rivalry?
How big is the bargaining power of buyers?
How significant is the bargaining power of suppliers?


VRIO Analysis
VRIO stands for Value, Rarity, Imitability, Organization. This analysis helps to evaluate all company’s resources and capabilities and bring them together into one aggregate table that includes:

Tangible resources
Financial
Physical
Technological
Organizational

Intangible resources
Human
Innovation and Creativity
Reputation

Organizational capabilities

The result of the analysis gives a clear picture of company’s competitive and economic implications, answering the questions if the resources mentioned above are:

Valuable?
Rare? 
Costly to imitate? 
Organized properly?

Each Fortune 500 company receives a score based on a ratio of favorable to unfavorable impressions among U.S. adults and its overall favorability. This ensures that a score takes into account how well-liked a company is among people who have an opinion of it without penalizing companies that are not consumer-facing.Morning Consult polls thousands of adults across the country each week. The surveys are conducted online using large, established online survey vendors. The data is weighted to approximate a nationally representative sample based on age, race/ethnicity, gender, educational attainment, region, annual household income, home ownership status and marital status.487Ultrapar HoldingsUGP Brazil Revenues ($M)$22,167Revenue Change-2.3%Profits ($M)$447.5Assets ($M)$7,426Profit Change-0.8%Employees15,173Previous Rank474Looking for leads, investment insights, or competitive intelligence?GET PREMIUM ACCESSCEOThilo MannhardtSectorEnergyIndustryEnergyHQ LocationSao Paulo, BrazilWebsitewww.ultra.com.brYears on Global 500 List8Employees15,173Figures prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standards.SPONSOR CENTERUltrapar Holdings: Global 500 RANK HISTORY  Key Financials (Last Fiscal Year)($ Millions)% changeRevenues ($M)$22,167-2.3%Profits ($M)$447.5-0.8%Assets ($M)$7,426Total Stockholder Equity ($M)$2,621Profit RatiosProfit as % of Revenues2.0%Profits as % of Assets6.0%Profits as % of Stockholder Equity17.1%STOCK QUOTE ()0.00 0.00 (0)Previous Close: Market Cap: NaNBNext Earnings Date: High: Low: 52 Week High: 52 Week Low: 52 Week Change %: 0.00P/E Ratio: n/aEPS: Dividend Yield: n/a486Share488Customer ServiceSite MapPrivacy PolicyFeedbackAd ChoicesAdvertisingYour California Privacy RightsReprints & PermissionsTerms of UseCareersAll products and services featured are based solely on editorial selection.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
