Forward Looking Statements









This press release may contain forward-looking statements within the 
      meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements 
      relate to expectations, beliefs, projections, future plans and 
      strategies, anticipated events or trends and similar expressions 
      concerning matters that are not historical facts. In some cases, you can 
      identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking 
      terminology such as "believes," "expects," "may," "will," "should," 
      "seeks," "approximately," "intends," "plans," "pro forma," "estimates" 
      or "anticipates" or the negative of these words and phrases or similar 
      words or phrases that are predictions of or indicate future events or 
      trends and that do not relate solely to historical matters. 
      Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, 
      uncertainties, assumptions and contingencies, many of which are beyond 
      CoreSite's control that may cause actual results to differ significantly 
      from those expressed in any forward-looking statement. These risks 
      include, without limitation: any adverse developments in local economic 
      conditions or the demand for data center space in these markets; 
      operational difficulties, including difficulties relating to information 
      systems, internal processes and information security; significant 
      industry competition; financial market fluctuations; and other factors 
      affecting the real estate industry generally. All forward-looking 
      statements reflect CoreSite's good faith beliefs, assumptions and 
      expectations, but they are not guarantees of future performance. 
      Furthermore, CoreSite disclaims any obligation to publicly update or 
      revise any forward-looking statement to reflect changes in underlying 
      assumptions or factors, of new information, data or methods, future 
      events or other changes. For a further discussion of these and other 
      factors that could cause CoreSite's future results to differ materially 
      from any forward-looking statements, see the section entitled "Risk 
      Factors" in CoreSite's most recent annual report on Form 10-K, and other 
      risks described in documents subsequently filed by CoreSite from time to 
      time with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Forward Looking Statements


      This press release may contain forward-looking statements within the 
      meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements 
      relate to expectations, beliefs, projections, future plans and 
      strategies, anticipated events or trends and similar expressions 
      concerning matters that are not historical facts. In some cases, you can 
      identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking 
      terminology such as "believes," "expects," "may," "will," "should," 
      "seeks," "approximately," "intends," "plans," "pro forma," "estimates" 
      or "anticipates" or the negative of these words and phrases or similar 
      words or phrases that are predictions of or indicate future events or 
      trends and that do not relate solely to historical matters. 
      Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, 
      uncertainties, assumptions and contingencies, many of which are beyond 
      CoreSite's control that may cause actual results to differ significantly 
      from those expressed in any forward-looking statement. These risks 
      include, without limitation: any adverse developments in local economic 
      conditions or the demand for data center space in these markets; 
      operational difficulties, including difficulties relating to information 
      systems, internal processes and information security; significant 
      industry competition; financial market fluctuations; and other factors 
      affecting the real estate industry generally. All forward-looking 
      statements reflect CoreSite's good faith beliefs, assumptions and 
      expectations, but they are not guarantees of future performance. 
      Furthermore, CoreSite disclaims any obligation to publicly update or 
      revise any forward-looking statement to reflect changes in underlying 
      assumptions or factors, of new information, data or methods, future 
      events or other changes. For a further discussion of these and other 
      factors that could cause CoreSite's future results to differ materially 
      from any forward-looking statements, see the section entitled "Risk 
      Factors" in CoreSite's most recent annual report on Form 10-K, and other 
      risks described in documents subsequently filed by CoreSite from time to 
      time with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
