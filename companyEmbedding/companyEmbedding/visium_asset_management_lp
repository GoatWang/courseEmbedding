                Jury convicts Stefan Lumiere for inflating prices in portfolio
            



                Conviction comes as U.S. steps up policing of bond markets
            



A onetime portfolio manager for hedge fund firm Visium Asset Management LP was convicted of federal securities-fraud charges in the culmination of a three-year case that included the suicide of a fellow executive who was also charged.The jury deliberated for a little more than 90 minutes before finding Stefan Lumiere guilty on all three counts related to inflating the price of bonds in the firm’s credit fund to hide losses from investors. His conviction comes as the U.S. steps up efforts to police multitrillion-dollar bond markets, where securities are traded between parties and not over an exchange.Lumiere, 46, didn’t react as the verdict was read. His sentencing is scheduled for May 23, and he could face as much as 45 years in prison and a $5 million fine, though maximum penalties are rarely imposed. Jurors declined to comment.








“I can tell you he’s innocent,” said Alexandra Lumiere Gottlieb, as she left the courtroom after the verdict was read. She sat behind her brother during the trial. “This is not a court looking for the truth.”A Visium spokesman declined to comment.In the week-long trial, prosecutors said Lumiere solicited sham quotes from brokers to justify inflated valuations on distressed-debt holdings. Jurors rejected his claim that he thought the prices he was assigning were legitimate and done at the behest of his boss, who pleaded guilty and testified against him.




Confidential InformantThe case was launched after Jason Thorell, a junior trader who told jurors he was asked to field fake quotes from brokers to justify the portfolio’s inflated prices, became a confidential informant for authorities. The U.S. investigation grew to include charges of insider trading based on leaks of pending health-care policy changes by the government.The government claimed the firm reaped more than $32 million from trades on drug companies.




Visium, which managed $8 billion at its peak, returned money to investors after the charges were filed last year. Christopher Plaford, the portfolio manager who oversaw the $480 million credit fund and Lumiere’s supervisor, pleaded guilty and cooperated with prosecutors during the trial. Sanjay Valvani, a more senior portfolio manager, killed himself days after he was indicted.Prosecutors claimed Lumiere and other Visium executives inflated the value of holdings in the firm’s credit portfolio from 2011 to 2013. They allegedly did so by getting brokers to furnish fake quotes for securities hundreds of times, allowing them to override the valuation of the fund’s independent administrator.The inflated valuations enabled the firm to generate more than $5.9 million in extra fees and juiced bonuses for the executives who oversaw it, according to the U.S. The credit fund, which oversaw $470 million, wound down in 2013 after a wave of investor redemptions.For more on the whistle-blower’s guilty conscience, click hereAfter Thorell agreed to act as a government informant, he wore a hidden device to record conversations with former colleagues and supervisors. Thorell, who was the government’s star witness, stands to receive a financial payout under the whistle-blower reward program operated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.Lumiere was the brother-in-law of firm founder Jacob Gottlieb, who has not been accused of wrongdoing. After Lumiere’s apartment was raided by FBI agents in early 2014, he initially agreed to cooperate, but ultimately the agreement faltered.Visium notified investors and clients of the investigation in March and wound down operations after the charges were filed in June, liquidating some funds and selling another to AllianceBernstein Holding LP.After Lumiere was convicted, Creizman said, “We thought we tried our case as best as we possibly could.”The case is U.S. v. Lumiere, 16-cr-00483, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).— With assistance by Bob Van Voris, and Katherine Burton

Jury selection is set to begin on Wednesday in Manhattan federal court in the case of Stefan Lumiere, Visium founder Jacob Gottlieb's former brother-in-law, who is accused of engaging in a scheme to falsely inflate the value of securities in a bond fund. The trial follows a criminal probe that prompted the $8 billion investment firm's wind-down and charges against three others, including Sanjay Valvani, a Visium portfolio manager who committed suicide in June after being accused of insider trading. According to court papers, Lumiere, 46, served as the portfolio manager for a fund called Visium Credit Opportunities Fund from May 2009 to April 2013. From 2011 to 2013, prosecutors said, Lumiere and others, including portfolio manager Christopher Plaford, schemed to defraud investors by mismarking the value of securities held by the fund, which invested in debt issued by healthcare companies. Prosecutors said the practices caused the fund's net asset value to be overstated by tens of millions of dollars each month and deceived investors into believing the bonds were relatively liquid, when they were not. Lumiere, who was arrested in June, has pleaded not guilty to conspiracy, securities fraud and wire fraud charges. His lawyers are expected at trial to challenge prosecutors' claims that the securities' prices were mismarked and unreasonable, according to court papers. At trial, prosecutors are likely to call as a cooperating witnesses Plaford, who pleaded guilty in June in connection with the mismarking scheme and the separate insider trading matter. Prosecutors are also expected to call a former Visium trader who has been cooperating with authorities since 2013 and covertly recorded Lumiere. The cooperating witness has been helping authorities in hopes of recovering a monetary reward, according to court papers. While not named in court papers, the witness is Jason Thorell, a person familiar with the matter said. Lumiere's lawyers say the details of the potential reward indicates he is seeking a recovery from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which can award whistleblowers up to 30 percent of any money it collects in a case. The SEC declined comment. Thorell did not respond to a request for comment. The case is U.S. v. Lumiere, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 16-cr-00483.
