Headnote
Registration exemption where Ontario firm provides advice exclusively to clients that are (i) resident in the United States or (ii) affiliates of the firm and resident in Hong Kong or Japan. Individuals advising on behalf of the firm are currently registered in Ontario as advising representatives or associate advising representatives of an affiliated firm that is registered in Ontario as a portfolio manager (among other registration categories), and must remain so. Exempted firm and its advising individuals must maintain appropriate registration or licensing in the United States, Hong Kong and Japan or otherwise be permitted under applicable United States, Hong Kong or Japanese legislation to act as an adviser to the clients.
Applicable Ontario Statutory Provision
Securities Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.5., as am., ss. 25(3), 74(1).

IN THE MATTER OF
THE SECURITIES ACT, ONTARIO
(the Act)
AND
IN THE MATTER OF
MANULIFE ASSET MANAGEMENT
(NORTH AMERICA) LIMITED
(the Filer)
ORDER
Background
The Ontario Securities Commission (the Commission) has received an application from the Filer for a ruling under subsection 74(1) of the Act for an exemption from the adviser registration requirement in section 25(3) of the Act for:

(a) the Filer, and
(b) any individuals engaging in, or holding themselves out as engaging in, the business of advising others when acting on behalf of the Filer, who are also registered under the Act to act as advising representatives or associate advising representatives of Manulife Asset Management Limited (MAML) (the Advising Representatives),

in respect of advice to persons or companies that are (i) resident in the United States of America (United States) or (ii) affiliates of the Filer and resident in Hong Kong (Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China) (Hong Kong) or Japan (Non-Canadian Clients) (the Requested Exemption).
Representations of the Filer

1. The Filer is incorporated under the laws of Canada and is a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of The Manufacturers Life Insurance Company (MLI). Its head office is in Toronto, Ontario.
2. The Filer is registered as an investment adviser under section 203 of the United States Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to carry on the business of an adviser in the United States.
3. The Filer is able to rely on an exemption from registration as an adviser under applicable securities law in Japan for the advisory activities it proposes to provide to the Non-Canadian Clients resident in Japan.
4. In Hong Kong, there is no applicable registration requirement in respect of the advisory activities the Filer proposes to provide to the Non-Canadian Clients resident in Hong Kong.
5. The Filer is not a registrant under the Act.
6. MAML is incorporated under the laws of Ontario. MAML is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of MLI and as such is an affiliate of the Filer. MAML and the Filer share the same head office in Toronto, Ontario.
7. MAML is registered in each province of Canada as an adviser in the category of portfolio manager and as a dealer in the category of exempt market dealer. MAML is also registered in Ontario and Newfoundland and Labrador as a dealer in the category of mutual fund dealer (under certain terms and conditions). Additionally, MAML is registered in Ontario as an adviser in the category of commodity trading manager and as an investment fund manager.
8. The Filer and the Advising Representatives will only advise or act as sub-adviser to Non-Canadian Clients that are:

(a) appropriately registered, licensed or otherwise permitted under applicable securities laws in the United States, Hong Kong or Japan, as applicable, to act as an adviser; or
(b) sophisticated persons or companies that are institutional clients (including an insurance company and a trust) or high net worth clients.

9. The Filer does not advise or act as a sub-adviser for any individuals that do not meet the definition of "accredited investor" in National Instrument 45-106 Prospectus and Registration Exemptions.
10. The Filer does not act as an adviser to any person or company that is resident in a jurisdiction of Canada and is not, and will not be, held out in a jurisdiction of Canada as being engaged in any advising activities.
11. Clients of the Filer will not be clients of MAML.
12. The Filer and the Advising Representatives will act as advisers or sub-advisers to the Non-Canadian Clients out of the Filer's head office in Toronto.
13. The Filer and the Advising Representatives will comply with all registration and other requirements of applicable securities laws of the United States, Hong Kong and Japan in respect of advising Non-Canadian Clients.
14. None of the Advising Representatives will act as an adviser to a Non-Canadian Client unless the Advising Representative is an advising representative or associate advising representative of MAML.
15. All Non-Canadian Clients of the Filer will enter into an investment management agreement or similar documentation with the Filer, at which time the Non-Canadian Clients will also receive disclosure that explains the relationship between the Filer and MAML.
16. To avoid client confusion with respect to MAML or any other affiliate, the investment management agreement or similar documentation, account statements, performance reporting, contracts and disclosure documents of the Filer will clearly identify the Filer as the adviser to the Non-Canadian Clients. In addition, a dedicated relationship manager is assigned to the Non-Canadian Clients and is the primary contact person for the Non-Canadian Clients on behalf of the Filer.
17. Non-Canadian Clients will be advised at the time they enter into an investment management agreement or similar documentation with the Filer, and periodically thereafter, that if they relocate to a jurisdiction of Canada their accounts will have to be transferred to MAML or another adviser that is appropriately registered, or relying on an exemption from registration, in that jurisdiction of Canada.
18. Neither the Filer, nor any individual acting on its behalf, will act as an adviser to persons or companies resident in Ontario unless they are appropriately registered, or relying on an exemption from registration, under Ontario securities law.
19. The Filer is, to the best of its knowledge, not in default under any requirements under Ontario securities law.

Order
The Commission, being satisfied that it would not be prejudicial to the public interest for it to grant the Requested Exemption, rules that the Requested Exemption is granted provided that:

(a) in acting as an adviser to the Non-Canadian Clients, the Filer acts only through the Advising Representatives;
(b) the Filer and each of the Advising Representatives is appropriately registered, licensed or otherwise permitted to act as an adviser to the Non-Canadian Clients under applicable laws of the United States, Hong Kong and Japan;
(c) the Filer and MAML remain affiliates and MAML remains a registrant; and
(d) each of the Advising Representatives maintains registration under the Act as an advising representative or associate advising representative of MAML.

October 28, 2011
"Edward P. Kerwin"
Commissioner
Ontario Securities Commission
 
"Judith Robertson"
Commissioner

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).

History[edit]
Manulife was incorporated as "The Manufacturers Life Insurance Company" by Act of Parliament on 23 June 1887 and was headed by Canada's prime minister, Sir John A. Macdonald, and Ontario's lieutenant-governor, Sir Alexander Campbell (there were no conflict-of-interest guidelines at the time and it was not unusual for public persons to be involved in private industry). The idea for the company came from J.B. Carlile, who came to Canada as an agent for the North American Life Assurance Company. It was his first-hand experience on which the new company's product portfolio was based.[5]
Private stock company[edit]
The firm was founded as The Manufacturers Life Insurance Company in 1887. Its first president was Sir John A. Macdonald, the first Prime Minister of Canada. The company sold its first policy outside of Canada in Bermuda in 1893. In 1894, policies were sold in Grenada, Jamaica and Barbados; Trinidad and Tobago, and Haiti in 1895; and British Honduras, British Guiana, China and Hong Kong in 1897.[6][7]
In 1901, Manulife amalgamated with the Temperance and General Life Assurance Company,[5] a Toronto-based Canadian life insurer that provided preferred rates to abstainers of alcohol. Manulife continued to offer abstainers rates into the 1920s.[7]
In 1931, it opened its first southern China branch in British Hong Kong. Shortly thereafter, it established itself as a leading life insurer in the region with branches in Macau, Swatow and Amoy.[8]
Mutual company[edit]
In 1958, shareholders voted to change its legal form from a joint stock company to a mutual organization, making the company privately owned by its policyholders.[9][10]
In 1984, Manulife announced that it had acquired Waterloo, Ontario-based Dominion Life Assurance Company: a deal that included the purchase of all of the outstanding stock of the company from Lincoln National.[11][12] Dominion Life was founded in Waterloo in 1889, and Manulife made a commitment to the community to retain a significant presence in Waterloo. In 1988, Manulife opened a new five-storey office building at 500 King St. North in Waterloo to house its Canadian Division.[13]
In 1996, the company entered an agreement with Sinochem to form Shanghai-based Zhong Hong Life Insurance Co. Ltd., China’s first joint venture life insurance company, and was granted a license that made it the second foreign insurer[14] to be allowed re-entry into China.[15]
Demutualization and public company[edit]
In 1999, its voting eligible policyholders approved demutualization, and the shares of Manulife, the holding company of The Manufacturers Life Insurance Company and its subsidiaries, began trading on The Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) under the ticker 'MFC', and on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (SEHK) under the ticker ‘945’.[16]
In 2002, Manulife–Sinochem Life Insurance Co. Ltd. was granted approval by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC) to open a branch office in Guangzhou, China, the first branch license granted to a foreign invested joint–venture life insurance company. In 2003, Manulife-Sinochem received approval for a branch office in Beijing, the first multiple-branch license granted to a foreign-invested joint venture life insurance company. The firm is now licensed to operate in more than 50 Chinese cities.[16]
In 2003, Manulife and John Hancock Financial Services, Inc. (including its Canadian subsidiary Maritime Life) announced a tax–free stock–for–stock merger of the companies, creating a global insurance franchise. Completed in April 2004, the merger created the largest life insurer in Canada, second largest in North America, and fifth largest in the world at the time.[16]
In 2013 Richard DeWolfe became the Chair of the company’s board,[17] succeeding Gail Cook-Bennett, who retired after serving 34 years on the board.[18] In 2009, Donald Guloien, the Chief Investment Officer, succeeded Dominic D’Alessandro as President and CEO of the company. Shortly before his departure, D’Alessandro modified his retirement package; the restricted units would only vest for a total of $10 million if the shares reached $36 by the end of 2011, and he would receive $5 million if the shares hit $30. This was in response to shareholders’ reaction to the first quarterly loss ever posted by the firm in its public history. Under Guloien's leadership, the first initiatives were a dividend cut and an equity offering to bolster Manulife's capital levels, making it difficult for the share price to reach the target levels needed to vest.[19]
In September 2009, the company purchased AIC’s Canadian retail investment fund business.[20] In October 2009, it purchased Pottruff & Smith Travel Insurance Brokers Inc., a Canadian broker and third party administrator of travel insurance.[21]
In 2010, the company announced that it had purchased Fortis Bank SA/NV’s1 49 per cent ownership in ABN AMRO TEDA Fund Management Co. Ltd. The new joint venture, Manulife TEDA Fund Management Company Ltd. (Manulife TEDA), provides traditional retail and institutional asset management for clients in China. The other 51 per cent is owned by Northern International Trust, part of Tianjin TEDA Investment Holding Co., Ltd. (TEDA).[22]
In June 2012, the company opened Manulife Cambodia, with headquarters in Phnom Penh.[23][24]
In September 2014, Manulife agreed to acquire the Canadian operations of Standard Life for a fee of around $3.7 billion.[25]
In 2014, Manulife Financial simplified its logo and brand to refer to itself only as Manulife outside of the United States.[26]
In April 2015, the company announced a partnership with DBS Bank, providing Manulife exclusive access to DBS customers in Singapore, Hong Kong, China and Indonesia in exchange for an initial payment of $1.2 billion USD.[27]
In June 2015, Manulife-Sinochem became the first foreign invested joint-venture life insurance company in China authorized to sell mutual funds.[28]
The company has recently revived discussions of listing a real estate investment trust (REIT) backed by its US office property portfolio on the Singapore Exchange. There were discussions to have the IPO last summer, however the economic climate was lacking for REITs.[29]
In 2016, Manulife became the first Canadian insurance company to offer life insurance to people who are HIV-positive, insuring people who have tested HIV-positive, who are between the ages of 30 and 65, and meet certain other criteria for life insurance policies that would pay up to $2 million upon death.
