Manning & Napier Announces Agreement to Acquire Majority Interest in Rainier Investment Management, LLC | Business Wire
























































      Manning & Napier Announces Agreement to Acquire Majority Interest in 
      Rainier Investment Management, LLC
    





December 18, 2015 07:30 AM Eastern Standard Time



FAIRPORT, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Manning & Napier, Inc. (NYSE:MN), (“Manning & Napier” or “the 
      Company”) today announced an agreement to acquire a majority interest in 
      Rainier Investment Management, LLC (“Rainier”), a Seattle, Washington 
      based, active investment management firm with more than $3 billion in 
      capitalization-based U.S. and non-U.S. equity strategies and fixed 
      income products. The acquisition will further diversify Manning & 
      Napier’s product offerings, enhance the firm’s positioning as a provider 
      to defined contribution plans, and broaden its geographic coverage of 
      the western U.S. The investment teams of both Manning & Napier and 
      Rainier will remain autonomous, and the transaction will not result in 
      changes to either firm’s investment personnel or processes. Rainier will 
      continue to operate from their Seattle headquarters.
    


      Under the terms of the transaction, key professionals at Rainier will 
      maintain a 25% ownership stake in Rainier, with Manning & Napier owning 
      the remaining 75%. The transaction is structured with an initial upfront 
      cash payment funded through the Company’s available cash position, with 
      additional payments based on Rainier achieving certain financial targets 
      over a four year period. The transaction is expected to close in the 
      first half of 2016, subject to customary regulatory approvals and 
      closing conditions. Additional financial terms of the transaction were 
      not disclosed.
    

      Patrick Cunningham, Chief Executive Officer of Manning & Napier 
      commented, “Rainier’s investment expertise provides us the opportunity 
      to continue to grow and diversify our business while keeping our 
      research team focused on the investment strategies and processes that 
      have driven Manning & Napier’s success for 45 years. In particular, we 
      are excited to expand the product solutions we offer to defined 
      contribution plan sponsors and participants with market 
      capitalization-based equity strategies, which are often the foundation 
      of a broad participant menu and custom target date products built by 
      advisors and consultants. Rainier’s fundamental approach to active 
      management is an ideal complement to Manning & Napier’s capabilities.”
    

      Jim Ridgeway, President of Rainier added, “We believe the transaction 
      with Manning & Napier will provide the financial, structural and 
      distribution resources to continue to serve our valued clients at a high 
      level, while meaningfully growing our business. All of us at Rainier 
      feel a strong cultural fit with the team at Manning & Napier.”

Reasons to Consider International Small Cap EquitiesToday, many portfolios include domestic small cap and international large cap equities. However, international small cap stocks have frequently been left out of investor's allocations despite offering a number of potential benefits. Learn more. 
 
International Discovery Fund (RAIIX) received a 4-Star Overall Morningstar Rating™ ! 
Overall rating out of 108Foreign Small/Mid Growth funds as of 3-31-17.  
The Overall Morningstar Rating is based on risk-adjusted returns derived from a weighted average of the Fund's 3-year and 5-year Morningstar metrics. 
 

 






Disclosure For Individual InvestorsFor each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Ratingä based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund’s monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads, and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance.  The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) The Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five- and ten-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. Rainier International Discovery Fund was rated against the following numbers of Foreign Small/Mid Growth funds over the following time period: 107 funds in the last three years.  With respect to these Foreign Small/Mid Growth funds, Rainier International Discovery Fund received a Morningstar Rating of four stars for the three-year period. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Ratings for other share classes may differ.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
