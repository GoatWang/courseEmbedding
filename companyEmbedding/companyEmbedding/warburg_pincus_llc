By Iris Dorbian






Warburg Pincus is exploring a possible secondary deal that would involve selling up to $1 billion from a private equity fund that closed at $11.2 billion in 2013, according to the Wall Street Journal. The Warburg Private Equity XI has about $5 billion in stakes in companies based in China, India and other parts of Asia. Among the companies in the portfolio are Beijing Amcare Women’s & Children’s Hospital and trucking company Shanghai ANE Logistics Co. Warburg Pincus has reportedly hired Lazard to start shopping the pool to interested investors, said the news outlet.

More From Livemint »Mint had reported on Warburg Pincus’s investment plans on Thursday. Confirming that it has secured equity financing of up to $100 million from an affiliate of Warburg Pincus, a statement from the solar power developer said, “CleanMax will use the funds to continue its rapid growth in the rooftop and open access solar power markets in India, while pursuing growth in select international markets (Middle East and South-East Asia), and growing the nascent, yet promising energy storage solutions business.”The deal will provide dry powder to the firm at a time when financing at low costs has become key to success. CleanMax Solar claims to be India’s largest on-site solar power provider with a combined on-site capacity of around 100 megawatts (MW). Warburg Pincus’s interest in CleanMax Solar stems from India’s ambitious clean energy target of adding 175 gigawatts (GW) by 2022. Of this, 40GW is to come from rooftop solar projects.“CleanMax Solar is a leader in the Indian solar rooftop market, providing customers with cost-efficient and environmentally friendly solutions to meet their energy requirements,” Saurabh Agarwal, a Warburg Pincus managing director, said in a statement.Subscribe to Our Newsletter »The last big deal in the solar rooftop space was by global infrastructure investment manager I Squared Capital, with an investment in Amplus Energy Solutions Pvt. Ltd. Mint reported on 24 August 2015 about I Squared Capital’s plans to invest $150 million in Amplus, which sets up distributed solar power generation projects in India. The record low tariff of Rs2.44 per unit arrived at the auction of 500MW capacity at the Bhadla solar park in Rajasthan in May has made investors wary; there are growing concerns that electricity offtake commitments at higher tariffs may not be honoured. The solar energy business in India has seen a significant decline in tariffs from Rs10.95-12.76 per kilowatt hour in 2010-11.First Published: Fri, Jul 14 2017. 01 17 AM ISTTopics:  CleanMax Solar Warburg Pincus solar power rooftop solar renewable energy Editor's Picks »With effectively free JioPhone, Reliance Jio rings in disruption beyond telecom For Reliance Jio, free services did wonders.

CleanMax, which has about a quarter of the South Asian nation’s market for rooftop solar systems, will use the private equity investment to fund growth opportunities outside India and to improve product offerings, Kuldeep Jain, managing director of the renewable energy firm, said in the emailed statement. Warburg, which oversees more than $44 billion in private equity assets globally, did not disclose the stake it will hold after the investment.Prime Minister Narendra Modi is working to make renewables a major energy source with a solar energy target of 100 gigawatts by 2022, second only to China, enticing overseas investment. Under the Paris Agreement signed by more than 190 countries, India has promised to boost the amount of power coming from sources other than fossil fuels to 40 percent from about 30 percent.




Six-year-old CleanMax has a combined on-site capacity of 100 megawatt, which could go up to 250 megawatt in the year to March 31, according to the statement. India’s installed rooftop solar capacity exceeded 1 gigawatt, solar researcher Bridge reported in October. Rooftop solar costs have fallen 12 percent annually in the last four years.

Founding and early history[edit]
In 1939 Eric Warburg of the Warburg banking family founded a company under the name E.M. Warburg & Co. Its first address was 52 William Street, New York, the Kuhn Loeb building. Throughout the early post-war period, the firm was a small office of 20 employees. In 1966, E.M. Warburg merged with Lionel I. Pincus & Co, forming a new company that eventually became known as E.M. Warburg, Pincus & Co.[11] In 1965, when Eric Warburg retired to Germany, control was handed to Lionel Pincus, a partner in the Ladenburg Thalmann investment bank, and the working language of the office switched from German to English. Lionel ran the company from 1966 to 2002, and died in 2009. [12]
Warburg Pincus began investing in Europe in 1983 and opened its first office in Asia in 1994. It has invested more than $5 billion in Europe; more than $3 billion in India[13] and more than $3.3 billion in China. The firm is headquartered in New York and has offices in Beijing, Hong Kong, London, Mumbai, San Francisco, São Paulo, Shanghai and Singapore, with administrative offices in Amsterdam, Luxembourg and Mauritius.[14]
The firm is structured as a global partnership led by co-presidents Charles Kaye and Joseph Landy.[15] Kaye has been with Warburg Pincus since 1986 and worked to launch the Asian operations. Landy has been with the firm since 1985, focusing on investments in information technology, communications applications and structured investments. Approximately 35% of the firm’s investments are outside of the U.S.[16]
Initial public offerings[edit]
Warburg Pincus has completed more initial public offerings with its companies than any other global private equity firm.[17] More than 140 Warburg Pincus companies have listed on exchanges, raising approximately $30 billion in public markets.[18] In each of these IPOs, the firm was the principal financial investor in the portfolio company. The companies have listed on 13 exchanges, including at least 30 IPOs outside the U.S. In August 2010, a six-year partnership between management and Warburg Pincus led to MEG Energy’s successful IPO.[19]
Venture capital[edit]
Warburg Pincus has a history of venture capital investing. The firm is a founding member of the venture capital associations in the U.S. and China, and offers a global entrepreneur in residence program to help start up new businesses.[citation needed]
In October 2014, Reuters reported that Warburg Pincus had raised $4 billion for its first energy-focused private equity fund.[20]
Growth capital[edit]
Warburg Pincus has invested in companies such as Harbin Pharmaceutical in China,[21] Bharti Telecommunications in India, AmRest in Poland[22] and Nuance Communications in the U.S.[23] In Bharti Airtel, Warburg Pincus had invested $292 million across multiple tranches and exited with $1.9 billion in 2005, which is considered to be the largest Private Equity exit in India.[24]
Fight over the Warburg name[edit]
During the post-war period, Eric Warburg vied with his cousin Siegmund Warburg, founder of S.G. Warburg, over the use of the Warburg name in New York. Siegmund wished to expand the S.G. Warburg franchise into New York but was blocked by the existence of E.M. Warburg & Co. Following the effective sale of the business to Pincus, Siegmund Warburg accused Eric of prostituting the Warburg name. "Complicating matters was that Siegmund thought Pincus the wrong kind of Jew - of Eastern European ancestry, with a garment-district background. Professionally, he thought Pincus well below haute banque stature in the venture capital world."[25]
In January 1970, Siegmund finally got the name changed to E.M. Warburg, Pincus & Company to differentiate it from S.G. Warburg & Company. "In the end, however, Lionel Pincus had the last laugh on Siegmund. He expanded Eric's tiny firm into a giant, thriving business, with three and a half billion dollars of venture capital partnerships."[25]
In 1999, they attempted to purchase English Premier League football (soccer) team Everton.[26]
