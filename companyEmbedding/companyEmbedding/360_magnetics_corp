    CERAMIC (HARD FERRITE) MAGNETS


    Ceramic magnets made of Barium and Strontium Ferrite has been available since 

    the 1950's. Their principal advantage is that they are very inexpensive and 

    they have great magnetic and environmental stability. Ceramic magnets are 

    brittle, very hard, black in color, and are very resistant to corrosion. 
Due to their 

    low cost, Ferrite magnets enjoy a very wide range of applications, from motors 

    and loudspeakers to toys and crafts, and are the most widely used permanent 

    magnets today.
