This rare disease drug was just given a $35,000-a-year price tag. But it’s unclear whether that’s an improvement

May. 8, 2017 at 2:06 p.m. ET
by Emma Court










Corrected            
CORRECTED: PTC Therapeutics' DMD drug Emflaza to cost $35,000 a year and launch within the coming weeks
PTC Therapeutics Inc.  said early Monday that it plans to launch the Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug Emflaza at a price of $35,000 a year and within the coming weeks. The price tag comes in below the controversial $89,000-a-year price set by Emflaza's previous owner, privately-held Marathon Pharmaceuticals, which faced so much backlash on the drug's price tag that it delayed Emflaza's launch. The price tag was especially controversial because the drug is part of a class of corticosteroids used for DMD in other parts of the world and available as cheaply as $1,000 a year. PTC Therapeutics said it believes the new price is "sustainable" and "balances providing access to all eligible patient in the United States in an ultra-orphan population while maintaining sufficient infrastructure and programs, including continued investment in Duchenne," said Chief Executive Officer Stuart Peltz, according to the FactSet earnings call transcript. "The factors in our decision include a consideration of the resources required to provide access to Emflaza for a small patient population to improve the standard of care and further the Duchenne community's educational need while enabling continual investment in therapies for rare diseases and providing financial return for our shareholders." PTC Therapeutics announced its plan to buy Emflaza in mid-March for about $75 million in cash and $65 million in PTC common stock. But it's possible the new, lower price tag may still prove controversial. "The question is how low is low enough, especially when patients (and now politicians, given all the noise) know that the drug is available overseas for $1,000/year?" RBC Capital Markets analyst Simos Simeonidis said in March. PTC Therapeutics shares were not yet active in pre-market trade on Monday. Shares have declined 7.5% over the last three months, compared with a 4.6% rise in the S&P 500 . An earlier version of this report said Emflaza would launch in the coming week, due to an error in the earnings call's FactSet transcript.

How These Biotechs Are Dodging Payor Pushback In Muscular Dystrophy

This rare disease drug was just given a $35,000-a-year price tag. But it’s unclear whether that’s an improvement

May. 8, 2017 at 2:06 p.m. ET
by Emma Court










Corrected            
CORRECTED: PTC Therapeutics' DMD drug Emflaza to cost $35,000 a year and launch within the coming weeks
PTC Therapeutics Inc.  said early Monday that it plans to launch the Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug Emflaza at a price of $35,000 a year and within the coming weeks. The price tag comes in below the controversial $89,000-a-year price set by Emflaza's previous owner, privately-held Marathon Pharmaceuticals, which faced so much backlash on the drug's price tag that it delayed Emflaza's launch. The price tag was especially controversial because the drug is part of a class of corticosteroids used for DMD in other parts of the world and available as cheaply as $1,000 a year. PTC Therapeutics said it believes the new price is "sustainable" and "balances providing access to all eligible patient in the United States in an ultra-orphan population while maintaining sufficient infrastructure and programs, including continued investment in Duchenne," said Chief Executive Officer Stuart Peltz, according to the FactSet earnings call transcript. "The factors in our decision include a consideration of the resources required to provide access to Emflaza for a small patient population to improve the standard of care and further the Duchenne community's educational need while enabling continual investment in therapies for rare diseases and providing financial return for our shareholders." PTC Therapeutics announced its plan to buy Emflaza in mid-March for about $75 million in cash and $65 million in PTC common stock. But it's possible the new, lower price tag may still prove controversial. "The question is how low is low enough, especially when patients (and now politicians, given all the noise) know that the drug is available overseas for $1,000/year?" RBC Capital Markets analyst Simos Simeonidis said in March. PTC Therapeutics shares were not yet active in pre-market trade on Monday. Shares have declined 7.5% over the last three months, compared with a 4.6% rise in the S&P 500 . An earlier version of this report said Emflaza would launch in the coming week, due to an error in the earnings call's FactSet transcript.

How These Biotechs Are Dodging Payor Pushback In Muscular Dystrophy

PTC Therapeutics, Inc. Key Developments

PTC Therapeutics, Inc. Announces Preliminary Phase 2 Data from Spinal Muscular Atrophy Program
Jul 1 17
PTC Therapeutics, Inc. announced the presentation of preliminary clinical data from the company's joint development program with Roche and the SMA Foundation in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) at the Cure SMA Meeting in Orlando, FL. Preliminary results from an early analysis of Part 1 of the Phase 2 SUNFISH trial evaluating oral RG7916, a small molecule modifier of Survival Mo tor Neuron 2 (SMN2) splicing, were highlighted in an oral presentation titled "Clinical Studies of RG7916 in Patients with Spinal Muscular Atrophy: Study Update." SMA is a rare genetic disorder that results in neuromuscular disability beginning in infancy and is the leading genetic cause of mortality in infants and young children. Preliminary results from an early analysis from the ongoing Part 1 of the RG7916 SUNFISH study in Type 2/3 SMA patients demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in SMN2 full length/?7 mRNA ratio of ~ 400% versus baseline, as measured in whole blood. These results provided proof of mechanism for oral small molecule SMN2 splicing modifiers. No drug-related adverse events leading to withdrawal have been observed to date for RG7916. SUNFISH is a two-part phase 2 clinical study. Part 1 is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, exploratory dose-finding study in Type 2/3 pediatric and adult SMA patients. The primary objective of the first part of the study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of RG7916 in patients, and to select the dose for the second part of the study. The pivotal second part is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, confirmatory study in Type 2/3 SMA patients followed by an open-label extension. The primary objective of the pivotal second part of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of RG7916 compared to placebo. SUNFISH is one of three ongoing clinical trials of RG7916, along with FIREFISH and JEWELFISH. The SMA program was initially developed by PTC Therapeutics in partnership with the SMA Foundation in 2006 to accelerate the development of a treatment for SMA. In November 2011, Roche gained an exclusive worldwide license to the PTC/SMA Foundation SMN2 alternative splicing program. The development of these compounds is being executed by Roche and overseen by a joint steering committee with members from PTC, Roche, and the SMA Foundation.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

          Our mission is to unlock access to valuable research on stocks for all retail investors.
