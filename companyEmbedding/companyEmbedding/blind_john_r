GlaxoSmithKline Attacks Cold Turkey Quitting

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - Tuesday, December 13, 2005
Charleston, South Carolina

Editorial
GlaxoSmithKline Attacks Cold Turkey Quitting
by John R. Polito
WhyQuit News - Tuesday, December 13, 2005 - 1400 EST
Millions of New Year's quit smoking resolutions are about to be tested and those selling quitting cures want a slice of the pie. But how?  GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare (GSK) markets Nicorette gum, the NicoDerm  patch and the Commit nicotine lozenge.  On December 5, 2005 GSK issued a press release asserting that almost all cold turkey quitters fail.  

What GSK's press release conveniently fails to mention is that almost all of its product users fail too, that rates for repeat nicotine product users are even worse, that NRT studies were not blind as claimed, or that cold turkey was the quitting method used by almost all successful long-term ex-smokers - roughly 90%.


According to GSK's press release, "An estimated three out of four smokers would like to quit and each year about 15 million smokers do quit for at least one day.  Yet fewer than 5% of them successfully remain tobacco-free for three to 12 months.  Most smokers try to quit using cold turkey even though quitting without the right product or support is the lease effective way to succeed.  Studies show nearly all cold turkey quit attempts (97 percent) fail."

Now for the rest of the story.  All "real-world" quitting surveys continue to find that, outside of clinical studies, which were allegedly double-blind, quitters buying and using replacement nicotine products such as the gum, patch and lozenge have yet to perform better than those quitting cold turkey.  

An extensive review of California quitter survey data was published in the September 11, 2002 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).  It concluded that, "NRT appears no longer effective in increasing long-term successful cessation in California smokers."

Subsequent smoker quitting surveys in Minnesota, London, Quebec, and Maryland continue to confirm the California findings.  In no quitter suvery assessing cessation at six months or beyond have those quitting while using NRT products performed better than those quitting entirely on their own.  

But recently, replacement nicotine has failed to measure up to marketing hype even in rather intense ongoing support settings.  A study entitled "The English smoking treatment services: one-year outcomes" was published in the April 2005 issue of Addiction.  It examines chemically validated quit smoking rates after one year for quitters who received one-on-one counseling or group treatment for up to eight weeks.

Table six of the English study compares quitting rates for various quitting methods.  It shows that 25.5% of those who employed "willpower" and  did not use any pharmaceutical quitting product were still not smoking at one year.   In stark contrast, only 15.2% who used NRT were still not smoking at one year.   

By almost any measure, the wording of GKS's press release grossly distorts America's quitting picture.  First it implies that 5% of all quitters are able to quit for one year while only 3% of cold turkey quitters succeed in doing so.   This is a horrible example of just how low pharmaceutical interests will stoop in attempting to obtain market share from America's most productive quitting method. 

Those marketing quit smoking products almost invariably attribute the lowest one-year quitting  rate they can locate to cold turkey (usually 2 to 3%) - as GSK has done - and then conveniently fail to tell readers the one-year quitting rate for their own product.  In fact, almost all objective quitting authorities include cold turkey quitters within the historic 5% one-year quitting rate that we've each heard for decades.  

Look closely at the GlaxoSmithKline press release.  After assigning 3% to cold turkey, isn't it interesting that GSK never once mentions the one year quit smoking rate for its nicotine gum, patch or lozenge?  GSK isn't stupid.  It knows that such openness and honesty would kill its golden nicotine producing goose. 

The one-year quitting rate for over-the-counter nicotine products is one of the world's best kept secrets.  What we do know is the six-month rate as determined by paid consultants to GlaxoSmithKline, Dr. Hughes and  Shiffman.   Their March 2003 study,  published in Tobacco Control, combined and averaged the results of the seven over-the-counter nicotine patch and gum studies.  

The study disclosure states, "Dr Hughes has received speaking and consulting fees and grants from Glaxo-SmithKline ..." "Dr Shiffman serves as a consultant to GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare (GSKCH) on an exclusive basis regarding matters relating to smoking cessation."   Dr. Hughes and Shiffman found that, on average,  just 7% of over-the-counter (OTC) nicotine patch and gum study participants were still not smoking at six months.

If only 7% of NRT users are still not smoking at six months then how many succeed in quitting for one year?   The only way to make an educated guess is to look at older non-OTC clinical studies.  

In those studies it wasn't at all unusual to see 40% of successful six-month NRT quitters relapse to smoking between 6 months and one year.   If a 40% relapse rate is applied to the 7% six-month rate then only 4.2% of over-the-counter patch and gum quitters are still not smoking at one year.  

If the 4.2% figure is anywhere near accurate, imagine the average smoker's reaction to a GSK press release asserting that 4.2% of NRT quitters quit smoking for one year versus only 3% of cold turkey quitters.  It would suggest why GSK would not want cold turkey quitters to be part of the 5% one-year quitting rate noted in its release.

It's beyond time for the entire pharmaceutical industry to begin leveling with smokers about their odds while using over-the-counter nicotine quitting products.  They need to come clean about two other important factors.  It needs to be widely known that unlike repeat attempts at cold turkey quitting, a quitter's odds of success actually decline with repeat NRT use.  They also should stop telling quitters that double-blind clinical studies have proven that NRT "doubles their chances" when they know that the studies were not blind as claimed.  
If you have already tried quitting with the nicotine patch once then what are your odds during a second or subsequent patch attempt?  Only two nicotine patch studies have ever looked at what the NRT industry terms "recycling."  A 1993 study (Tonnesen) found that 0% of second-time patch users succeeded in quitting for 6 months and a 1995 study (Gourlay) reported a 1.6% six-month quitting rate.  But why?

Almost all online quit smoking authorities carry statements such as this one from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.  "Nicotine is a very addictive drug, and usually people make two or three tries, or more, before they successfully quit.  Each time you try to quit, you can learn what works for you and what situations are problematic."

The key lesson eventually learned is the amazing power of one puff of nicotine to completely destroy a quitting attempt.  It's called the "Law of Addiction." Eventually successful quitters learn to stop treating their dependency as though it were some "nasty little habit" capable of being controlled or manipulated, and start treating it like a true chemical addiction.  

But what lesson could possibly be learned from repeat toying with pharmaceutical grade nicotine?  The Tonnesen and Gourlay studies suggest "none."  It's why even with an extremely low 5% one year quitting rate for uneducated and unsupported cold turkey quitters, an endless river of cold turkey school of hard-quitting-knocks learning leads to ocean of success (90% of all successful quitters), while NRT's river of attempts trickle into insignificance before almost totally evaporating.

It is also time for the pharmaceutical industry to stop and reflect upon  whether or not it is false and deceptive advertising to continue to tell smokers that NRT "doubles their chances" when it knows that those odds ratio victories were generated by studies that were not blind as claimed.

The industry knew since the first nicotine gum studies in the early 80s that it had serious study blinding concerns on its hands.  Nicotine is a psychoactive chemical producing alert dopamine/adrenaline intoxication.  Smokers with any prior quitting history know what it's like to have their expectations of receiving nicotine fulfilled or denied.

Smokers were often coaxed into quitting studies by being promised a 50/50 chance of receiving weeks or months of free replacement nicotine products. Half were randomly assigned to receive an inert placebo and the other half the "Real McCoy" - pharmaceutical grade nicotine.  How many minutes would it have taken any experienced quitter to determine whether or not their gum contained nicotine?   

Would frustrated and fulfilled expectations have impacted both placebo group drop-out rates and rates for active group members who decided to remain?  In many early studies counseling, telephone support and/or group therapy -- interventions with proven effectiveness --  were offered for weeks or sometimes months, when most of the placebo group dropped-out of the study within the first couple of weeks. 

A study appearing in the June 2004 edition of Addictive Behaviors identified 73 double-blind placebo controlled NRT trials and found that only 17 had conducted blinding assessments. During assessments participants were asked to surmise whether they had been using a real nicotine delivery device or an empty placebo.

According to the authors, 12 of the 17 studies (71%) reported blinding failures as "subjects accurately judged treatment assignment at a rate significantly above chance." 

If true, and NRT studies were not blind as claimed, should the pharmaceutical industry continue to assert that NRT doubles a quitter's chances when there is absolutely no credible evidence that those odds ratio victories reflect anything other than frustrated and fulfilled participant expectations? 

If you are among the 7% who previously succeeded in quitting long-term with NRT before later relapsing, and want to give it another shot, then by all means go for it.   But if you are among the 14 out of 15 prior patch or gum users who relapsed to smoking within six months then you have every right to know that your odds of success during a second attempt would be vastly worse.

If you want to join the more than 40 million Americans who successfully quit smoking cold turkey, you'd be wise to spend a bit of time reading their insights and mastering the art, science and psychology of ending all nicotine use. Visit WhyQuit.com, the Internet's leading cold turkey quitting resource and make one complete read of Joel's Library, a free online collection of one-hundred short quitting articles on almost every cessation topic imaginable.   

Regardless of how any successful nicotine quitter begins their journey to lasting freedom it eventually ends the same for all ... no nicotine just one day at a time, Never Take Another Puff ... Dip, Chew, Patch or Lozenge!

Have Smokers Been Hoodwinked and Bamboozled by Placebos?

Have Smokers Been Hoodwinked and Bamboozled by Placebos?
November 14, 2008

Has the greatest medical research sham in history been perpetrated upon smokers?  Have tens of millions purchased and used expensive quitting products that were actually less effective than quitting without them?    If so, how could this happen?

Canada's leading medical journal is hosting a debate as to whether or not participants in nearly 200 placebo-controlled quit smoking studies could tell if they had been randomly assigned to use an inert placebo device or a real replacement nicotine delivery device (an NRT product) such as the gum, lozenge or patch.  

The current issue of the Canadian Medical Association Journal (CMAJ) shares a letter submitted by this writer (John R. Polito), which contends that the onset or absence of physical withdrawal destroys blinding, that "pharmacologic treatment of chemical dependency may be the only known research area in which blinding is impossible."  

Cessation pharmacology experts responded to the letter by asserting that "blinding is undoubtedly a key component of the validity of inferences drawn from randomized controlled trials" and that "maintaining blinding may be difficult, particularly if study participants experience withdrawal symptoms."

The experts closed by asserting that "incomplete blinding is a potential limitation to most clinical trials."  I responded pointing out how smoking cessation clincal trials differ from "most clinical trials."

If successful study blinding is key to the scientific validity of 26 years of pharmacology study findings then why is no expert willing to assert that NRT, Zyban or Chantix studies have been blind?  Frankly, they can't. The only study to review clinical trials that assessed blinding was published in 2004.  It found that "subjects accurately judged treatment assignment at a rate significantly above chance." 
 
Pharmaceutical quitting products easily and routinely defeat placebo users inside clinical trials, yet fall flat on their face when going head-to-head against cold turkey quitters in real-world use (see this July 2013 Gallup Poll; this chart from Pierce JP, 2012, also see 2006 Unpublished U.S. National Cancer Institute Survey of 8,200 quitters, as reported in the Wall Street Journal, Page A1, February 8, 2007; also see Doran CM, et al, Smoking status of Australian general practice patients and their attempts to quit [PubMed Abstract], Addict Behav., 2006 May;31(5):758-66; also see, 
Ferguson J, The English smoking treatment services: one-year outcomes, Addiction [PubMed abstract], 2005 Apr;100 Suppl 2:59-69 [see Table 6]; also see, Alberg AJ, et al, Nicotine replacement therapy use among a cohort of smokers [PubMed abstract], J Addict Dis., 2005;24(1):101-13; also see, SmokeFree London, Tobacco In London, Facts and Issues, [online PDF report, see Figure 14], November 26, 2003; also see Boyle RG, et al, Does insurance coverage for drug therapy affect smoking cessation? [free full-text], Health Aff (Millwood), 2002 Nov-Dec;21(6):162-8; also see, Pierce JP, et al, Impact of Over-the-Counter Sales on Effectiveness of Pharmaceutical Aids for Smoking Cessation [free full text], JAMA, September 11, 2002;288:1260-1264). 
   

Clearly, placebo is not a real quitting method, and cold turkey quitters normally do not join clinical studies seeking medications that promise to lessen their withdrawal syndrome. Their objective is to endure withdrawal and move beyond it.   

While the pharmacology quitting product era promised to double quitting rates it has instead brought decline in the U.S. smoking rate to a standstill.  How many thousands of smokers repeatedly believed the "double your chances" slogan, repeatedly relied on it in using "medicines," and died trying?  How many  believed that the quitting aid they purchased had been scientifically proven to be the best option available?

The question at the center of the debate is really rather simple. Can a nicotine addict who is badly in need of nicotine fix tell whether or not nicotine replenishment has occurred?  If so, and they can do so within a few hours of quitting, have researchers been honest in labeling their studies blind and declaring them "science-based?" 

Principle 32 of the World Medical Association's (WMA) Declaration of Helsinki commands that the "benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new intervention must be tested against those of the best current proven intervention" and that placebos should not be used unless "compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons" are demonstrated. 

The pharmaceutical industry and FDA contend that nicotine gum was proven effective prior to 1984.  If true, why the need for 200 placebo controlled trials since 1984?  Is it because placebo is easiest to beat, or that stockholders are more important than the lives of the tens of thousands smokers assigned to placebos since 1984?  

If researchers refuse to honor the smoker's human rights, do they assume responsibility for the demise of relapsing placebo users left so demoralized that there wasn't sufficient time, prior to being claimed by their addiction, to muster the confidence to try a truly effective method?

The problem is that U.S. cessation research is an utter mess, that locating a clincal trial involving "real" cold turkey quitters is nearly impossible.  Any researcher whose research findings damage pharmaceutical industry financial interests can probably forget industry study funding for the rest of their life. 

We need common sense laws and ethics that protect the independence and integrity of clincal trial researchers.  We need greater government funding of research that's medically indicated, not just research with potential to handsomely reward corporate shareholders.  Our nation's leading cause of premature demise, the time is now for serious and immediate independent research into whether or not 200 placebo controlled quit smoking studies reflect true science or history's greatest study sham ever.

Information for manufacturers
Consumer Electronics - Accessibility for the Blind
During the past century, advances in technology, such as talking books, faster production of Braille, access to computers and the Internet, and reading machines, have afforded the blind better access to the world around them.  In spite of the advances of the last twenty-five years, developments in consumer electronics technology have made consumer electronics difficult or often impossible to operate without vision, leaving blind people unable to perform seemingly routine tasks.

The Problem
Until the past couple of decades, blind people could operate virtually all electronic devices intended for the broad consumer market, even those of a highly specialized nature.  In contrast, today's home electronic devices use multi-level menus, providing only visual feedback by which all tasks are performed.  Rather than making access easier, new technology is complicating and oftentimes prohibiting access for the blind.  However, it does not have to be this way.

Due to computerized control systems, devices such as today's audio/video receivers have become much more complicated than similarly priced units of twenty years ago.  Besides the development of microprocessor-based control and switching systems, this increased capability has been accomplished through multifunction control buttons, menu systems, and displays that can convey a variety of information.  While some of today's cost-saving designs can annoy sighted people, they actually prohibit the enjoyment of home entertainment by the blind.  

Well into the 1980's the average blind consumer could operate the typical stereo system without help.  The use of Braille labels and other tactilely discernable markings (filing a notch or painting nail polish on a dial) allowed blind consumers to easily adjust the many settings of a stereo.  In addition, the status of switches could be determined by touch using their physical position, in or out, up or down, etc., with each performing known consistent functions.  

Today's stereos may contain knobs and switches, but their use is not intuitive through nonvisual means.  For example, a volume control knob may rotate continuously providing no indication of volume level.  When one presses the "ON" button, will the sound be produced at the level of the last noisy party?  Although some devices possess jog wheels with discernible clicks (which theoretically render them accessible to the blind), these clicks often do not provide reliable information to the blind about the settings.  This is because the electronics do not consistently register all the clicks, making the clicks just another frustration for the blind.  While sequences of button presses can sometimes be memorized, this is only possible after extensive experimentation and research with the aid of a sighted person.  To make matters worse, many of today's devices simply have too many functions to memorize.  Additionally, some functions can only be addressed by answering inaccessible screen prompts.  
TVs and DVD players are other examples of home electronic equipment that now provide challenges for use by the blind.  Menus and channel information are displayed on-screen and the user has to navigate through the multi-level menus with the remote control. Even such basic audio controls as adjustments of tone and balance on some televisions are submerged two or three levels deep in on-screen menus.  Separate dedicated knobs for these functions have largely disappeared.  The chances of successfully entering a program into today's TVs, DVD players, Tivo boxes and the like are remote without the benefit of prompts and access to the on-screen menus.  

Home appliances, which have long been easily usable by the blind, are, like home theatre equipment, becoming less so every day, as more and more of them introduce touch panels and layered menus. Refrigerators with touch panels can be hard to label and often provide no audio or tactile feedback, and without a clear/cancel button that makes it impossible for a blind user to detect the current settings. Many washers and dryers use menus that you cycle through, and which give you no feedback when you reach the end or beginning - and so it becomes tough to do something as simple as set the load size or soil level.

The Market
As the Baby Boomers - the largest consumer group in the United States, which even in the current climate preserves much of its discretionary spending power - age, age-related blindness and low vision become ever-more common. Conservative estimates suggest that by 2030, there will be 2.4 million blind seniors (people aged 65 and over) alone. The number of Americans with low vision has already reached 10 million. 6.5 million of low vision Americans are seniors, and this number is expected to double by 2030. The market in specialized products for low vision and blind seniors, such as video magnification and reading machines, has grown rapidly, but the mainstream market has lagged, leaving this growing section of the baby boomers unserved.

Working Toward A Solution
"Those who are blind or low vision purchase and utilize consumer electronics like everyone else.  However, for this group, the decision over which product to spend their money on is tightly linked to which one will provide the greatest level of independence in its usability.  Our experience is that those we find most usable as blind people are also highly usable, and desirable, by many other consumers.  Therefore, we believe that nonvisual access features improve product usability in the general market place--a true win-win."

Mark Riccobono, Executive Director of the NFB Jernigan Institute

The Jernigan Institute provides leadership in sharing best practices in nonvisual access to consumer electronics. We believe that testing appliances for nonvisual access at an early stage not only ensures a broader appeal for the product without necessarily adding to the cost, but also provides all consumers with a more user friendly device. The Jernigan Institute offers manufacturers to opportunity to improve their product with our help. With the experiences of the NFB membership to support it, the Jernigan Institute brings unparalleled expertise in nonvisual access to the table. Since the inception of the Institute, we have consulted on a number of products from the earliest development and design stages, and have organized user testing for these products.

There are many examples of technologies that originated in nonvisual access and which now benefit all consumers - optical character recognition, flatbed scanners and audiobooks are only a few of the examples available in the market now.  In the Jernigan Institute, manufacturers of consumer electronics and blind users now have a common resource available to continue this tradition of technological innovation, and to make sure that a good product reaches the largest possible group of consumers.

As the largest and most trusted organization of blind people, the NFB is a logical choice as a partner in reaching out to this underserved population and its untapped discretionary income. We invite manufacturers interested in making accessible consumer electronics to join the dialogue and get direct feedback from experts in the blind community. We can provide user testing on existing electronics which the manufacturer considers or believes to be usable. We also disseminate information on consumer electronics that prove usable to the NFB membership. 

The NFB Jernigan Institute hosts the Accessible Home Showcase, a facility displaying a selection of usable mainstream consumer electronics, where manufacturers and users alike can explore different ways to achieve nonvisual accessibility.
