Metal Nitrides 



Refractory metal nitride films are widely used in applications requiring materials with good conductivity and resistant to high temperatures and oxidizing ambients. These films are used for electrodes in devices such as capacitors and transistors, and as an adhesion / barrier layer for interconnects in semiconductor chips. The properties that make them useful are low resistivity (<100uohm-cm), high melting points (>1200C), oxidation resistance, and limited reactivity with  either oxides or metals such as Al and Cu.
The most widely used metal nitride film is TiN, followed by TaN and MoN. These films have been deposited at IMI either by reactive physical vapor deposition (PVD) , where a metal target is sputtered in an Ar-N2 mixture, or by atomic layer deopistion (ALD), where metal containing precursors react with NH3 cycle-by-cycle, to build up the film one atomic layer at a time.
Choosing a deposition depends on the specific application. PVD can be done at relatively low temperatures and allows for the tuning of the properties based on the substrate temperature (Ar/N2 ratio, deposition pressure, etc.). ALD  requires much higher deposition temperatures (above 400C), and  is used when the films have to be deposited on nanoscale high aspect ratio structures.
Each application determines the important properties of the metal nitride studied. IMI performs exhaustive characterization for every film in order to tune the films to specific applications. Crystal orientation and texture is determined by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). The exact stoichiometry is determined by X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). The density  of the films is measured by X-ray reflectivity (XRR).
In addition to the sheet resistance of the film, the Work Function provides an important electrical parameter for many device applications. This function affects the barrier height to oxides and semiconductors, which, in turn, controls the  threshold voltages for transistors and leakage in  MOS and MIM capacitors. The barrier height can be affected by other phenomena at the interface, such as surface states and dipoles. IMI’ s engineers use internal photoemission (IPE) to measure the actual barrier height. 
The following examples illustrate how IMI optimizes metal nitride films for different semiconductor technology applications.
DRAM
Nitride films are used as the bottom and top electrodes in capacitors with high-k oxides as the main dielectric. The high aspect ratio of the capacitors require nitride films to be deposited by ALD. The dielectric constant of the oxide, which is critical for achieving high capacitance, can be impacted by the underlying electrode.
The  crystal texture of the bottom electrode can enhance the formation of oxide phases that have a high dielectric constant. In order to reduce leakage, the  electrode material must have a high barrier height relative to the oxide. Therefore, IPE measurements are critical in optimizing the deposition and processing of the  nitride films.
Another factor contributing to leakage is oxygen vacancies in the dielectric, which can be created by the nitride reducing the oxides (both during  deposition and post deposition anneals). IMI models simulate the measured I-V curves to infer the defect density and distribution in the dielectric layer. This allows the electrode material  and process to be optimized.
Logic Transistors
Advanced MOS transistors, including FinFets, use high-k oxides such as HfO2 in conjunction with metal gates. These metal gates consist of a thin layer of metal nitride (usually TiN around 10nm thick), followed by a metal with higher conductivity such as W  or Al.
The performance of the transistor is determined by the  Effective Work function of the nitride layer. Leakage and reliability are affected by interaction with the metal oxide. Controlling the stoichiometry of the TiN, including the level of O incorporated in it, greatly influences the  Effective Gate Oxide Thickness (EOT). In a gate-last sequence, currently used  logic processes, the gate stack (including the TiN layer) has to be deposited in a trench with high aspect ratio, making ALD the preferred deposition method. IMI’s expertise in ALD, combined with the ability to simulate the material properties, interactions, and defect generation, enable us to help customers optimize their gate stacks. 
Interconnects 
State-of-the-art semiconductor processes use Cu based interconnects deposited into trenches and etched into a dielectric like SiO2. Cu ions can easily diffuse through the SiO2  causing shorts and transistor failures. Encapsulating the Cu lines with barrier materials prevents this phenomenon. 
The three sides of the trench have to be lined with a very  thin metal nitride layer  blocking the diffusion of Cu. The metal nitride has to possess low resistivity to allow Cu to form a continuous film with the right crystal orientation, and to not react with the Cu during subsequent process steps. The preferred metal nitride is TaN, which is typically deposited using PVD; however, as line widths shrink PVD is being replaced by ALD. 
As the above examples illustrate, the deposition and properties of nitride films require fine-tuning for  different applications, taking into consideration not only the overall process integration constraints, but also the impact on the circuits’ electrical properties.

Metal Oxides 



Thin film binary and ternary oxides are a major component of many electronic devices. The specific properties required of the film are determined by the specific applications, which determine the material ( e.g., SiO2 , HfO2, or TiO2) and the method of deposition, physical vapor deposition (PVD) or atomic layer deposition (ALD.
Some of the more important material properties for electronic applications are composition, dielectric constant, refractive index, bandgap, breakdown field, and leakage.  Many of these properties are affected by the phase and microstructure of the film, as well as point defects such as vacancies and interstitials.
The phase of the film includes whether it is amorphous or crystalline. If crystalline, the phase is the lattice structure, which may be cubic,  tetragonal, orthorhombic, etc.  Under microstructure it is important to know whether the film is single crystalline or polycrystalline. If it is crystalline, the grain size and preferred orientation of the grains are determined. For many devices, it is also important to know properties of interfaces such as the barrier height between a metal electrode and the oxide conduction/valence band edges. 
 Characterizing the oxide’s material properties requires a wide range of metrology techniques.

 X-ray fluorescence (XRF) , energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) are used for composition.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) provide valuable information on the structure.
Refractive index can be measured using ellipsometry.
Bandgaps can be determined from wavelength dependent ellipsometry or absorption using spectrophotometers.
Dielectric constants and leakage need electrical measurements on Capacitor stacks; barrier heights can be determined using internal photoemission (IPE) on the same stacks. 

By combining the ability to deposit different types of oxides and simultaneously measuring various material properties, it is possible to identify relationships between properties that can be used to select a particular material for a specific application. An example in the figure below shows the breakdown electrical field strength of 7nm ALD deposited films ranging from Al2O3 to TiO2, plotted against the measured static dielectric constant. 

The breakdown strength Ebd decreases with dielectric constant κ and our measurements indicate that it is accurately described by the relation 
Ebd = 25.4 κ-0.46
Based on this relationship, in an application where the capacitor is used as an energy storage device and the maximum voltage is not a constraint, SiO2 films are the best candidate. On the other hand, if voltages are low (as in advanced node DRAM and logic) materials with higher dielectric constants such as ZrO2 and HfO2 are the best solution. 
IMI has investigated many different oxides. We illustrate further IMI capabilities by focusing on work done on transition metal oxides for different applications, with particular emphasis on  the use of Hafnium Oxide and Zirconium Oxides in semiconductor technology.
DRAM:
The key material requirements for the dielectric for DRAM include a high dielectric constant with a low leakage at thicknesses less than 10nm. Since the capacitor structures have nm dimensions (but large aspect ratios (%):1 or more), the only deposition technique is ALD.
IMI has investigated ZrO2 based films and optimized them for successive generations of DRAM. A wide range of ALD precursors to provide optimum performance and manufacturability were investigated.  For future nodes, the stringent leakage requirements require a deeper understanding of the leakage mechanisms.
Key parameters are the barrier height between the metal electrode and the dielectric, as well as the density of defects. IPE was utilized to directly measure the barrier height. Combined with simulation of the leakage due to vacancies, this allows optimization of the overall capacitor stack and anneal process. The effect of dopants and thin interfacial layers are being investigated as part of our ongoing research, 
Resistive RAM (ReRAM)
The cells for this type of future NVM utilize the unique properties of metal oxides that have undergone a soft electrical breakdown called “forming”.  The resistance of the cell can be toggled between a high resistance state and a low resistance state by applying a positive or negative pulse respectively.
IMI evaluated  a wide variety of  metal oxides and was the first to show that a HfO2 film of the right composition  has  all the desired  characteristics needed  for future NVM cells. In combination with appropriate electrodes, the cells can be programmed at low power and show good endurance and retention. Simulation of the defect kinetics during forming and programming, also allowed the optimization of the electrical operation in an actual memory array.
Ferroelectric RAM 
Thin films composed of mixtures of HfO2:ZrO2 have been shown to have excellent ferroelectric properties. They retain bulk polarization after the application of a critical electric field, and the direction of the polarization can be switched by reversing the field. By varying the exact composition of the two components, it is possible to tune the exact properties of the film.
Pure HfO2 films are paraelectric , while pure ZrO2  are Antiferroelectric. By choosing the right electrodes (both bottom and top), composition and annealing conditions, record-setting polarization numbers were achieved. These films can be used in a NVM cell, either as a capacitor in series with a switching transistor, or as part of the gate stack in a single transistor. This allows for much smaller cell sizes than the current commercial FeRAM cells, which use much thicker PZT oxides.
Logic Transistors
By incorporating transition metal oxides with high dielectric constants, such as HfO2 as the gate oxide of MOS transistors, it is possible to aggressively shrink the feature size of the transistors, while controlling the gate leakage.
In order to meet the stringent requirements of performance, reproducibility, and reliability, the properties of the HfO2 has to be finely tuned. A deep understanding of the defects generated in the films during deposition and post processing, and interaction with the metal gate, is critical. 
With current Finfets, step coverage on high aspect fins is also very important and ALD is the preferred method of deposition. IMI has done intensive work on ALD processes, including assessment of different precursors, to develop a suite of characterization techniques to fully evaluate the films. By combining experimental IPE results, leakage data, and threshold voltage measurements with simulations of defect density, the optimum conditions for transistor performance can be determined. 
While different applications may ostensibly use the same metal oxide, the specific needs require tailoring of the properties. This is done at IMI by rapid design of Design of Experiments  guided by  sophisticated material and device simulations, and an extensive database of material properties.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Growth Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.      Key Stock Data    P/E Ratio (TTM) N/A     EPS (TTM)  $-0.40      Market Cap $47.58 M     Shares Outstanding 49.56 M     Public Float 31.89 M     Yield IMI has not issued dividends in more than 1 year.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    1.36      Net Money Flow ($)  586    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock. A ratio above one suggests greater buying pressure, below one suggests greater selling.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
