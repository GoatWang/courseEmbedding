History[edit]
GrafTech’s business was founded in 1886 as the National Carbon Company, which then merged with Union Carbide in 1917, and the business that would later become GrafTech began to operate as the Carbon Products Division of Union Carbide.
In 1914, the company introduced the first 12-inch diameter graphite electrodes.
In 1956, the company received an Academy Award for the development and production of a high-efficiency yellow flame carbon for motion picture color photography.
Between 1956–1978, the company Develops high performance carbon fibers; this work is recognized in 2003 with a National Historic Chemical Landmark from the American Chemical Society.
In 1985, the company Develops advanced technology for carbon/carbon composites used in spacecraft.
Union Carbide was reorganized in 1989, with the Carbon Products Division renamed as the UCAR Carbon Company.[2]
In 1990, the company introduced first 30-inch diameter graphite electrodes for UHP DC arc furnaces
In 1995, the company developed new graphite for the US Advanced Battery Consortium for lithium batteries in electric vehicles.
In 1995, the company went public via an initial public offering.[3]
In 1999, the company developed first natural graphite-based heat spreaders for electronic thermal management.
In 2002, the company changed its name from UCAR to Graftech.[3]
In 2004, the company introduced optimized pinless joint design for large-diameter graphite electrodes.[4]
In 2007, the company commercialized high-temperature insulation solutions for the polysilicon and solar industries .
In 2010, the company launched high thermal conductivity SPREADERSHIELD™ products for electronics and lighting applications.
In late 2010, GrafTech acquired two companies: Seadrift Coke LP, a manufacturer of needle coke, which is an essential component in the production of graphite electrodes; and C/G Electrodes LLC, which manufactures graphite electrodes.[5]
In February 2011, the company acquired Micron Research Corporation, a manufacturer of superfine-grained graphite.[6]
In October 2011, GrafTech acquired advanced carbon composite manufacturer Fiber Materials. Fiber Materials was sold in 2016.[7]
Between 2003–2011, the company won 7 R&D 100 Awards in 9 years.
In 2011, the company Dedicated two historical markers awarded by the Ohio Historical Society. One is for pioneering battery research made at Parma by Lewis Urry and National Carbon Company. The other recognizes the Lakewood facility’s long history and National Carbon Company.
In August 2015, GrafTech was purchased by Brookfield Asset Management.[8]
Controversies[edit]
On April 1, 1998, the company was subject to a class action lawsuit for allegedly artificially inflating stock price. In 2000, the class members won a settlement of $40.5 million.[9]
In 2001, the company was fined €50.4 million by the European Commission[10] and $110 million by the United States Department of Justice[11] for participating in an international price-fixing cartel with seven other firms in the market for graphite electrodes.

History[edit]
GrafTech’s business was founded in 1886 as the National Carbon Company, which then merged with Union Carbide in 1917, and the business that would later become GrafTech began to operate as the Carbon Products Division of Union Carbide.
In 1914, the company introduced the first 12-inch diameter graphite electrodes.
In 1956, the company received an Academy Award for the development and production of a high-efficiency yellow flame carbon for motion picture color photography.
Between 1956–1978, the company Develops high performance carbon fibers; this work is recognized in 2003 with a National Historic Chemical Landmark from the American Chemical Society.
In 1985, the company Develops advanced technology for carbon/carbon composites used in spacecraft.
Union Carbide was reorganized in 1989, with the Carbon Products Division renamed as the UCAR Carbon Company.[2]
In 1990, the company introduced first 30-inch diameter graphite electrodes for UHP DC arc furnaces
In 1995, the company developed new graphite for the US Advanced Battery Consortium for lithium batteries in electric vehicles.
In 1995, the company went public via an initial public offering.[3]
In 1999, the company developed first natural graphite-based heat spreaders for electronic thermal management.
In 2002, the company changed its name from UCAR to Graftech.[3]
In 2004, the company introduced optimized pinless joint design for large-diameter graphite electrodes.[4]
In 2007, the company commercialized high-temperature insulation solutions for the polysilicon and solar industries .

In February 2011, the company acquired Micron Research Corporation, a manufacturer of superfine-grained graphite.[6]
In October 2011, GrafTech acquired advanced carbon composite manufacturer Fiber Materials. Fiber Materials was sold in 2016.[7]
Between 2003–2011, the company won 7 R&D 100 Awards in 9 years.
In 2011, the company Dedicated two historical markers awarded by the Ohio Historical Society. One is for pioneering battery research made at Parma by Lewis Urry and National Carbon Company. The other recognizes the Lakewood facility’s long history and National Carbon Company.

History[edit]
GrafTech’s business was founded in 1886 as the National Carbon Company, which then merged with Union Carbide in 1917, and the business that would later become GrafTech began to operate as the Carbon Products Division of Union Carbide.
In 1914, the company introduced the first 12-inch diameter graphite electrodes.
In 1956, the company received an Academy Award for the development and production of a high-efficiency yellow flame carbon for motion picture color photography.
Between 1956–1978, the company Develops high performance carbon fibers; this work is recognized in 2003 with a National Historic Chemical Landmark from the American Chemical Society.
In 1985, the company Develops advanced technology for carbon/carbon composites used in spacecraft.
Union Carbide was reorganized in 1989, with the Carbon Products Division renamed as the UCAR Carbon Company.[2]
In 1990, the company introduced first 30-inch diameter graphite electrodes for UHP DC arc furnaces
In 1995, the company developed new graphite for the US Advanced Battery Consortium for lithium batteries in electric vehicles.
In 1995, the company went public via an initial public offering.[3]
In 1999, the company developed first natural graphite-based heat spreaders for electronic thermal management.
In 2002, the company changed its name from UCAR to Graftech.[3]
In 2004, the company introduced optimized pinless joint design for large-diameter graphite electrodes.[4]
In 2007, the company commercialized high-temperature insulation solutions for the polysilicon and solar industries .
In 2010, the company launched high thermal conductivity SPREADERSHIELD™ products for electronics and lighting applications.
In late 2010, GrafTech acquired two companies: Seadrift Coke LP, a manufacturer of needle coke, which is an essential component in the production of graphite electrodes; and C/G Electrodes LLC, which manufactures graphite electrodes.[5]
In February 2011, the company acquired Micron Research Corporation, a manufacturer of superfine-grained graphite.[6]
In October 2011, GrafTech acquired advanced carbon composite manufacturer Fiber Materials. Fiber Materials was sold in 2016.[7]
Between 2003–2011, the company won 7 R&D 100 Awards in 9 years.
In 2011, the company Dedicated two historical markers awarded by the Ohio Historical Society. One is for pioneering battery research made at Parma by Lewis Urry and National Carbon Company. The other recognizes the Lakewood facility’s long history and National Carbon Company.
In August 2015, GrafTech was purchased by Brookfield Asset Management.[8]
Controversies[edit]
On April 1, 1998, the company was subject to a class action lawsuit for allegedly artificially inflating stock price. In 2000, the class members won a settlement of $40.5 million.[9]
In 2001, the company was fined €50.4 million by the European Commission[10] and $110 million by the United States Department of Justice[11] for participating in an international price-fixing cartel with seven other firms in the market for graphite electrodes.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Minerals Market Research Reports & Industry Analysis
Minerals are solid, naturally occurring chemical substances with structures that are highly organized atomically. They also have very specific physical properties, and are formed through biogeochemical processes. Though they may look like rocks to the untrained eye, minerals differ from rocks substantially in that they have only one specific chemical composition, while rocks are a mix of many kinds of minerals or mineraloids. 
	 Some of the many chemical compositions minerals can have, ordered approximately by their abundance in the Earths crust from highest to lowest, include the Silicate class, the Carbonate class, the Sulfate class, the Halide class, the Oxide class, the Sulfide class, the Phosphate class, the Element class, and the Organic class. Minerals are a critical commodity to many industries following their mining and processing and form a material input to chemicals manufacturing, metallurgy, building materials manufacturing, electrical grid infrastructure, electronics, glass products, vehicles, and high-technology. Rare earth minerals or rare earth elements are particularly crucial to numerous energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies.
Common oxide minerals include chromite, hematite, and magnetite. Economically, minerals from the Sulfide class are arguably just as valuable as metal ores, and include chalcopyrite, or copper iron sulfide, galena, or lead sulfide, and pentlandite, or nickel iron sulfide. The Element class is home to those minerals called native metals or intermetallic elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, as well as natural alloys. The Element class is also where one could find semi-metals and non-metals, such as bismuth, graphite, and sulfur.

What Are Graphite Electrodes?ProcessChoosingShippingTechnical ServicesValue Added ServicesPatentsDownloads



What is a Graphite Electrode?
Graphite electrodes are used almost exclusively within the electric arc furnace of a steel mill. So, to understand a graphite electrode, first you must understand what an electric arc furnace is.

OK. What is an Electric Arc Furnace?

An electric arc furnace is essentially a big recycling machine. Simply put, it’s a large pot into which scrap steel, like old cars, bicycles, and refrigerators, are dumped. The furnace operator loads (called charging the furnace) carefully screened and selected scrap steel into this big pot. Then, the operator swings the furnace lid back over the pot and lowers it into place.

The electrodes are part of the furnace roof structure. Electrodes can be small, 75 millimeters (3 inches) in diameter, or quite large, up to 750 millimeters (30 inches) in diameter and as much as 2800 millimeters long. The largest weigh more than two metric tons (4,400 lbs.). The manufacturer of the furnace determines the size the electrode should be.

The electrodes are assembled into columns, usually 3 to a column. Graphite connecting pins-tapered and threaded on each end screw two electrodes together. Some furnace operators assemble the columns on the shop floor and lift them into place whole. Others add electrodes one at a time to the top of the column while it is still on the furnace. Each electrode column has a large steel arm which moves it up and down.

Furnaces using 3-phase AC (alternating current) electricity have 3 electrode columns; DC (direct current) furnaces only need one column of electrodes, but they are generally larger in diameter.

Once the furnace lid is in place, the electrodes are lowered until the tip of the electrode column almost touches the top of the scrap steel. Huge amounts of electricity–large furnaces use enough electricity for a town of 40,000 people–flow through large water-cooled cables into the electrodes. At the bottom of the electrode column, the electricity jumps (or arcs) from the electrode tip to the nearest piece of scrap steel. The intense heat of this electric arc melts the scrap steel, hence the name of the electric arc furnace.

The tip of the electrode will reach 3,000 degrees Celsius or 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit, half the temperature of the surface of the sun. Electrodes are made of graphite because only graphite can withstand this incredible temperature.

Eventually, all the steel is melted. The furnace operator turns off the power and raises the electrode columns. The furnace is then tipped on its side to pour the molten steel into giant buckets called ladles. The ladles quickly carry the molten steel to the steel mill’s caster which is the next step in making new and useful products from recycled scrap steel.

To answer the question, then, what is a graphite electrode? A graphite electrode is a device to conduct electricity down into an electric arc furnace which generates sufficient heat to melt scrap steel.

For more information, be sure to look through our new Graphite Electrodes Brochure.
 
Making a UCAR® Graphite Electrode

Mill, Mix & Forming
Premium quality calcined coke is crushed, screened, and hot-blended with pitch in controlled proportions. The resulting plastic mass is extruded through a forming press and cut into specified lengths before being water-cooled in a temperature controlled bath.
 
Baking
Green electrodes are placed in large cans called saggers (pronounced say gers) and baked to over 800° C (1400° F) in specially designed, computer-controlled furnaces. It takes 1-to-2 weeks to carbonize the pitch depending upon the size of the electrodes being made. After cooling, the carbon electrodes are cleaned, inspected, and sample-tested.
 
Impregnation
Next, the baked electrodes are impregnated with a special pitch to give them the higher density, mechanical strength, and electrical conductivity they will need to withstand the severe operating conditions inside our customers’ electric arc furnaces.
 
Rebake
A second baking cycle, or “rebake,” is required to carbonize the pitch impregnation and to drive off any remaining volatiles. Rebake temperatures reach almost 750°C (1300° F).
 
Graphitizing
The rebaked carbon electrodes are further processed in long electric resistance furnaces. Laid end-to-end, or “longitudinally,” the electrodes are heated to over 3000° C (5000° F). This ultra high temperature restructures the carbon to its crystalline form—graphite. Then the electrodes are once again cooled, cleaned, inspected, and sample-tested under GrafTech’s rigorous control procedures.
 
Machining
In Machining, the electrodes outer dimension are turned to its finished dimension. The two end faces are also machined to tolerance and given threaded sockets. The sockets accept GrafTech’s double-tapered, machine-threaded graphite connecting pins which allow our customers to join electrodes together into columns.
 
Shipping
After machining, the finished graphite electrodes are inspected, protectively capped and palletized. Each electrode prominently displays the GrafTech™ UCAR® Graphite Electrode logo as it is sent on its way to our customers.

 

Selecting the proper UCAR® electrode grade
UCAR® GRADE AGX™ GRAPHITE ELECTRODE – A premium grade recommended for high power, ultra-high power and DC furnaces operating under severe electrical and/or mechanical conditions. AGX is graphite electrodes are also recommended for ladle furnace applications because of its increased current-carrying capacity. UCAR® GRADE ALX™ GRAPHITE ELECTRODE – A unique grade addressing applications where stub losses and column breakage is an issue. UCAR® GRADE LFX™ GRAPHITE ELECTRODE – A premium grade recommended for ladle furnaces or for low-power melting applications where standard electrodes fail to perform. The charts on this page (for melting furnaces and ladle furnaces) are based on the heating effect in a graphite electrode column by applying an assumed average phase current.

Typical Current Carrying Ranges
 

Size & Grade Selection
