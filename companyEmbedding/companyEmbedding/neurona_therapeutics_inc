About Us
Neurona Therapeutics is a pre-clinical stage biotechnology company that was founded by four leading-edge neuroscientists and stem cell pioneers at The University of California, San Francisco. We are focused on the discovery and development of cell-based therapies to treat intractable neurological disease. Our initial aim is to generate therapeutic compositions of a specific type of nerve cell (or neuron) for targeted delivery into the injured nervous system. Based on nearly two decades of research, we believe that particular subpopulations of neurons have the unique ability to integrate and repair dysregulated neural circuits. Our talented team of scientists, scientific advisors, and board directors is working to accelerate breakthrough treatments for patients with significant unmet medical needs.

Arturo Álvarez-Buylla, PhD
Co-Founder and Scientific Advisor
Dr. Arturo Álvarez-Buylla is a Professor in the Department of Neurological Surgery at the University of California, San Francisco, where he also serves as the Heather and Melanie Muss Endowed Chair and Principal Investigator in the Brain Tumor Research Center.  Dr. Álvarez-Buylla’s research specializes in developmental neuroscience and stem cell neurobiology with special interests in neurogenesis in the adult mammalian brain, the assembly of the brain circuits, origin of brain tumors, and interneuron transplantation.  His research identified the neural stem cells in the adult brain, their origin in the embryo, long-range neuronal migration in the postnatal brain and new mechanisms of neuronal translocation.  His laboratory also identified the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) as a source of young neurons that after transplantation can migrate and integrate in the postnatal and adult brain.  In collaboration with other groups at UCSF, his laboratory has shown that MGE cells can induce new periods of brain plasticity, ameliorate epileptic seizures and increase pain thresholds.  An ongoing interest of the Álvarez-Buylla Lab is understanding how adult neural stem cells are regulated, studying how cells derived from these progenitor cells integrate into the adult brain and which populations of MGE-derived neurons can be used therapeutically.
Dr. Álvarez-Buylla joined the UCSF faculty in 2000. Prior to that he was head of lab at Rockefeller University. Dr. Álvarez-Buylla obtained his PhD degree at Rockefeller University in 1988 and a Bachelor degree in Biomedical Research at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (Mexico City, Mexico) in 1983.

Approach
The central nervous system (CNS) contains both excitatory cells (primarily neurons that express glutamate) and inhibitory cells (primarily neurons that express GABA).  Normal brain and spinal cord function depends on a delicate balance between these two types of neurons.  This balance is normally established during embryonic development and just after birth when the nervous system is still assembling and developing neurologic connections.  During this time, neurons are born, migrate to proper locations, and form connections or synapses, creating complex circuits that are maintained into adulthood.  Problems arise when genetic mutations and/or external traumas result in aberrant development and/or degeneration of particular CNS cell types, leading to the dysregulation of neural circuits. Epileptic seizures, neuropathic pain, spasticity, and certain types of cognitive impairments and psychoses can be symptomatic of dysregulated neural activity.  Because the genesis of new neurons and synapses, or plasticity, is limited in the adult CNS, these diseases persist and lack effective treatment. Notably, effective drugs are lacking for many patients with neuropathic pain, and one-third of epilepsy patients do not respond to current anti-epileptic drugs. 
Neurona’s founders have discovered that transplantation of specialized neurons in the adult CNS can rebalance neural activity and induce plasticity to repair neural circuits.  Neurona is using human stem cell technologies to develop novel cell-based therapeutics.

Unlike more traditional therapeutic modalities such as small molecules or antibodies, Neurona is focused on unique compositions of cells that can be precisely targeted, integrated into damaged neural circuits, and provide activity-dependent regulation."We believe there is an unprecedented opportunity to create a novel class of therapeutics with the potential to permanently repair dysfunctional neural circuits," said Tim Kutzkey, interim Chief Executive Officer of Neurona and a Partner at The Column Group. "We are leveraging the rigorous scientific work and deep knowledge base of Neurona's founders to develop therapies with distinct advantages over existing approaches."Neurona is founded by internationally recognized neuroscientists and stem cell pioneers from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF):Arturo Alvarez-Buylla, PhD, Professor in the Department of Neurological Surgery, Heather and Melanie Muss Endowed Chair and Principal Investigator in the Brain Tumor Research CenterArnold Kriegstein, MD, PhD, John Bowes Distinguished Professor in Stem Cell and Tissue Biology and the Department of Neurology, and Founding Director of the Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regeneration Medicine and Stem Cell ResearchJohn Rubenstein, MD, PhD, Professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Distinguished Professor in Child Psychiatry at the Nina Ireland Laboratory of Developmental NeurobiologyCory Nicholas, PhD, VP of Research at Neurona Therapeutics and Assistant Professor (Adjunct) in the Department of Neurology at UCSF.Neurona's founders have discovered that certain types of neuron transplants can rebalance nervous system activity, repair neural circuits, and rescue multiple animal models of disease. Neurona will utilize human stem cell derivatives for the treatment of diseases caused by dysregulated neural activity.Neurona's Board of Directors includes: Tim Kutzkey, PhD, interim Chief Executive Officer of Neurona and Partner at The Column Group; David Goeddel, PhD, Managing Partner at The Column Group; Leo Guthart, PhD, Founder and Senior Advisor at Topspin Partners; Arnold Kriegstein, MD, PhD, Co-Founder, Professor of Neurology and Director of the stem cell center at UCSF; and Stephen Hauser, MD, Chair of Neurology at UCSF."Two decades of discoveries in the fields of stem cell biology, cortical brain development, and cell transplantation have revealed the potential for particular types of neurons to repair the nervous system, representing a possible breakthrough therapy for patients with devastating neurological diseases," said Cory Nicholas, Co-Founder, VP of Research at Neurona. "Neurona's talented team is working tirelessly towards making cell-based therapeutics a reality for these patients."Neurona's leadership team is well-versed in the advancement of cell-based therapies and supported by a Scientific Advisory Board with deep expertise in stem cell and developmental neurobiology. Dr. Nicholas pioneered methods to derive specialized neuronal populations from human stem cells while an Assistant Professor at UCSF. Catherine Priest, PhD, VP of Preclinical Development at Neurona, filed the first successful IND application for a human pluripotent stem cell-based therapeutic as a former Senior Director at Geron Corporation. Neurona's Scientific Advisory Board features Allan Basbaum, PhD, Chair and Professor of Anatomy at UCSF; Lorenz Studer, MD, PhD, Professor and Director of the Center for Stem Cell Biology at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center; and Oscar Marin, PhD, Professor and Director of MRC Center for Developmental Neurobiology at King's College London.About Neurona Therapeutics Neurona Therapeutics is a pre-clinical stage biotechnology company focused on regenerative cell-based therapeutics to treat intractable neurological disease. Neurona's initial aim is to develop therapeutic compositions of specialized nerve cells for targeted delivery into the injured nervous system. The Company's founders comprise thought leaders in neuroscience and stem cell biology and are responsible for key advances in these fields. Neurona Therapeutics is located in South San Francisco, CA.
