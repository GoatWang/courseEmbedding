			Thomas A. Lacey, 57, has served as one of our directors since May 2012.  Since May 2013, Mr. Lacey has served as Chief Executive Officer and a director of Xperi Corporation (NASDAQ: XPER), a technology licensor in areas such as mobile computing and communications, memory and data storage, and 3-D integrated circuit technologies. He formerly was the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Components Direct, a provider of cloud-based product life cycle solutions, and served in those capacities from May 2011 to April 2013. Mr. Lacey served on the board of directors and the audit committee of International Rectifier Corporation, a leader in power management technology, and has served in those capacities from March 2008 to January 2015 when the company was sold to Infineon. Previously, Mr. Lacey served as the President, Chief Executive Officer and a director of Phoenix Technologies Ltd., a global provider of basic input-output software for personal computers, from February 2010 to February 2011. Prior to joining Phoenix Technologies Ltd., Mr. Lacey was the Corporate Vice President and General Manager of the SunFab(TM) Thin Film Solar Products group of Applied Materials, Inc., from September 2009. Mr. Lacey previously served as President of Flextronics International's Components Division, now Vista Point Technologies, from 2006 to 2007. Mr. Lacey joined Flextronics in connection with the sale to Flextronics of publicly-traded International Display Works, where Mr. Lacey had been Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer from 2004 to 2006. Prior to International Display Works, Mr. Lacey held various management and executive positions at Intel Corporation for 13 years, including Vice President Sales and Marketing, President of Intel Americas, and Vice President and General Manager, Flash Products.

His books say you have to have certain qualities to become rich, while Social Darwinism believes the sameDo Americans Today Believe in Social Darwinism What is Social Darwinism?The belief that humans, like animals and plants, compete in a struggle for existence in  which natural selection says, "Survival of the Fittest".Social Darwinists would argue with the government, saying they should not be able to interfere with human competitions by attempting to regulate the economy and cure social ills, such as povertyHoratio AlgerHe was known for writing stories about rags to riches, which he wrote in the late nineteenth century.Natural Selection was his main theory. He thought that change happens due to the production of variation in each generation.He thought that the people with more survival skills will be able to reproduce, and their offspring will also get the  heritable advantageous gene.The Gilded AgeSocial DarwinistsHoratio AlgerYes, only certain qualities can stand certain things. Like the saying, "Survival of the fittest". You have to be fit for the things you try to do, to be able to survive them. An example would be, imagine a construction worker trying to be a doctor, he/she would not be fit for something they had never done, and knew nothing about.Social Darwinism and Horatio AlgerCharles Darwins Theory of Evolutionhttp://darwin200.christs.cam.ac.uk/pages/index.php?page_id=d3They favor competition, and self interest.http://autocww.colorado.edu/~flc/E64ContentFiles/SociologyAndReform/SocialDarwinism.htmlSome titles are the following:Office Boy:  a boy named Frank met men that  had  went from being poor to rich, it is less descriptive compared to most of his books because it is for children.Adrift in New York, The Young Outlaw, Sam's Chance, etc.http://chemknitsblog2.hubpages.com/hub/horatio-algerhttp://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/ALAN/v31n3/mcglinn.htmlFull transcriptMore presentations by
