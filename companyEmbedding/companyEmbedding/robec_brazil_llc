having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all Units entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and shall be delivered to the Company by delivery to its
registered office in Delaware by hand or certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, to its principal place of business or to an officer or agent of the Company having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of Members are
recorded. Each such written consent shall bear the date of signature of each Member who signs the consent. No written consent shall be effective to take the action referred to therein unless written consents signed by a number of Members sufficient
to take such action are delivered to the Company in the manner specified in this paragraph within sixty days of the earliest dated consent so delivered.  If action is taken by consent of Members and in accordance with the foregoing, there shall be filed with the records of the meetings of Members the writing or writings comprising such consent. 
If action is taken by less than unanimous consent of Members, prompt notice of the taking of such action without a meeting shall be given
to those who have not consented in writing and a certificate signed and attested to by the Secretary that such notice was given shall be filed with the records of the meetings of Members.  7. Proxy Representation. Every Member may authorize another person or persons to act for such Member by proxy in all matters in which a Member is entitled to participate, whether by waiving notice
of any meeting, objecting to or voting or participating at a meeting, or expressing consent or dissent without a meeting. Every proxy must be signed by the Member or by such Members attorney-in-fact. No proxy shall be voted or acted upon after
three years from its date unless such proxy provides for a longer period. A duly executed proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and, if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an
irrevocable power. A proxy may be made irrevocable where the interest with which it is coupled is an interest in the Interest of such Member. The authorization of a proxy may but need not be limited to specified action; provided, however, that if a
proxy limits its authorization to a meeting or meetings of Members, unless otherwise specifically provided such proxy shall entitle the holder thereof to vote at any adjourned session but shall not be valid after the final adjournment thereof.



8. Resolution of Issues. To the extent that any dispute shall arise with respect thereto, the Board
of Managers shall be entitled to decide all issues such as the existence of a quorum, the validity of proxies, the number of votes, the Members entitled to vote or consent and other similar procedural questions that are raised at any meeting of
Members. 


Exhibit 6.1  BOARD OF MANAGERS  1. Number: Appointment. The Board of Managers initially shall
consist of four members (each such member, along with any other members appointed from time to time, the Board Members). Thereafter, the Board of Managers shall be elected either at the Annual Meeting of Members or at a special
meeting called for such purposes. The Board of Managers may increase or decrease the number of Board Members from time to time upon a vote of the Board of Managers.  2. Initial Board of Managers. The following individuals will be the initial Board Members:  Thomas Gutierrez  Michael ODonnell 
Michael Stick 
John Cormier  3. Tenure.
Each Board Member shall, unless otherwise provided by law, hold office until the next Annual Meeting of Members and until such Board Members successor is elected and qualified, or until such Board Member sooner dies, resigns, is removed or
becomes disqualified. Any Board Member may be removed by the Members, at any time without giving any reason for such removal. A Board Member may resign by written notice to the Company which resignation shall not require acceptance and, unless
otherwise specified in the resignation notice, shall be effective upon receipt by the Company. Vacancies and any newly created positions on the Board of Managers resulting from any increase in the number of the Board of Managers may be filled by
vote of the Members or by a majority of the Board Members then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining Board member. 
4. Meetings. Meetings of the Board of Managers may be held at any time at such places within or without the State of Delaware designated in the
notice of the meeting, when called by the Chair of the Board of Managers, if any, the President or any two Board Members acting together, reasonable notice thereof being given to each Board Member. 
5. Notice. It shall be reasonable and sufficient notice to a Board Member to send notice by overnight delivery at least forty-eight hours or by
facsimile at least twenty-four hours before the meeting addressed to such Board Member at such Board Members usual or last known business or residence address or to give notice to such Board Member in person or by telephone at least
twenty-four hours before the meeting. Notice of a meeting need not be given to any Board Member if a written waiver of notice, executed by such Board Member before or after the meeting, is filed with the records of the meeting, or to any Board
Member who attends the meeting without protesting prior thereto or at its commencement the lack of notice to such Board Member. Neither notice of a meeting nor a waiver of a notice need specify the purposes of the meeting. 


6. Quorum. Except as may be otherwise provided by law, at any meeting of the Board of Managers a
majority of the Board Members then in office shall constitute a quorum. Any meeting may be adjourned from time to time by a majority of the votes cast upon the question, whether or not a quorum is present, and the meeting may be held as adjourned
without further notice.  7. Action by Vote. Except as may be otherwise provided by law, when a quorum is present at any meeting the
vote of a majority of the Board Members present shall be the act of the Board of Managers.  8. Action Without a Meeting. Any action
required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Managers may be taken without a meeting if all the Board Members consent thereto in writing, and such writing or writings are filed with the records of the meetings of the Board of
Managers. Such consent shall be treated for all purposes as the act of the Board of Managers.  9. Participation in Meetings by Conference
Telephone. Board Members may participate in a meeting of the Board of Managers by means of conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other or by any other
means permitted by law. Such participation shall constitute presence in person at such meeting.  10. Interested Transactions.
 (a) No contract or transaction between the Company and one or more of the Board Members or officers, or between the Company
and any other company, partnership, association, or other organization in which one or more of the Board Members or officers are directors or officers, or have a financial interest, shall be void or voidable solely for this reason, or solely because
the Board Member or officer is present at or participates in the meeting of the Board of Managers which authorizes the contract or transaction, or solely because his or their votes are counted for such purpose, if: 
(i) The material facts as to such Board Members relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are
known to the Board of Managers, and the Board of Managers in good faith authorizes the contract or transaction by the affirmative votes of a majority of the disinterested Board Members, even though the disinterested Board Members be less than a
quorum; or  (ii) The contract or transaction is fair as to the Company as of the time it is authorized, approved or ratified,
by the Board of Managers. 


(b) Common or interested Board Members may be counted in determining the presence of a
quorum at a meeting of the Board of Managers which authorizes the contract or transaction.
