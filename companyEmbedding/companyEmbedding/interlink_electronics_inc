Force Sensing
Force Sensing Resistor® technology from Interlink Electronics is the most versatile force sensing technology on the market today. These innovative sensors provide an inverse change in resistance in response to an increase/decrease in applied force. Interlink's standard range of sensors provides engineers and designers with a durable, reliable, easy to measure, thin form factor and low cost solution for human machine interface (HMI) touch solutions and analog data capture for machines. The sensors are available in a range of sizes, shapes and lengths. Several connection options are also available as standard.
								

Position Sensing
Force sensing linear potentiometers (FSLP) are sensors which can be used for menu navigation and control. Interlink's use of force allows for high rate scrolling and a more intuitive user experience. The FSLP is an easy to integrate, high resolution, ultra low power based solution that brings intuitive user controls to reduced form factor hand-held consumer electronic devices. These sensors are available in multiple lengths as standard. Interlink also offers a ring sensor for full 360-degree position sensing. These sensors are designed to be integrated into a device's host processor without the need for a dedicated microprocessor.
								

Mouse, Pointing & Touchpad
Integrated mouse modules & pointing solutions from Interlink Electronics can add touchpad or 360-degree pointing control to virtually any electronic device. Ranging from simple Mouse Button integration to NEMA-rated industrial pointing devices, these solutions are ideal for applications away from the desktop. The modules use Force Sensing Resistor technology and measurement firmware in a four-zone sensor or 4-wire resistive touchpad configuration along with a micro-controller to provide pressure sensitive cursor direction and speed control in a durable and easy to integrate form factor.

Interlink Electronics, Inc. Announces the Hire of Vice President of Global Product Development
Mar 24, 2015
OTC Disclosure & News Service

                            
                                - 

      Interlink Electronics, Inc. (OTC: LINK), a global technology leader and 
      trusted advisor in Human Machine Interface (HMI) solutions, is pleased 
      to announce that Mr. Mark Graham has joined the company in the new role 
      of Vice President of Product Development. Mr. Graham, who is based in 
      the United Kingdom, will be responsible for all global product 
      development activities of Interlink Electronics. Mr. Graham will report 
      directly to Mr. Steven N. Bronson, Chairman and CEO of Interlink 
      Electronics.
    

      Mr. Graham brings over 20 years of experience in new product development 
      across a wide range of established and emerging markets. Prior to 
      joining Interlink Electronics, Mr. Graham was Vice President of Product 
      Development at Peratech Ltd, a UK-based innovator and intellectual 
      property licensor of HMI sensor materials and software. In that role, 
      Mr. Graham was responsible for managing all internal and external 
      product development programs and customer projects, and delivering 
      innovative and disruptive HMI sensor solutions, concepts and materials 
      to the company’s OEM and Tier1 customers. Over the course of his career, 
      Mr. Graham has been fundamental in securing a number of key patent 
      applications and he has continuously pushed the boundaries of 
      innovation, engineering and science.
    

      Mr. Graham studied Mechanical Engineering at The University of 
      Nottingham in the UK, and has been published in multiple prestigious 
      science and engineering journals on topics concerning fluid dynamics.
    

"Interlink Electronics is delighted to have Mr. Mark Graham join our 
      team as he brings a proven track record in product development, as well 
      as an in-depth history in product management and operations. With over 
      20 years’ experience, we expect Mark’s unique expertise will be 
      instrumental in cultivating and advancing the future of Interlink,” 
      stated Mr. Steven N. Bronson, Chairman and CEO of Interlink Electronics.

      FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS: This release contains "forward-looking 
      statements" involving a number of risks and uncertainties as defined in 
      the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The following are 
      among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially 
      from the forward-looking statements: historical losses and negative cash 
      flow, the success of business divestitures and acquisitions, the 
      ownership of the majority of our stock by a small group of investors, 
      our success in predicting new markets and the acceptance of our new 
      products, efficient management of our infrastructure, the pace of 
      technological developments and industry standards evolution and their 
      effect on our target product and market choices, the effect of 
      outsourcing technology development, changes in the ordering patterns of 
      our customers, a decrease in the quality and/or reliability of our 
      products, protection of our proprietary intellectual property, 
      competition by alternative sophisticated as well as generic products, 
      historical weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting, 
      continued availability of raw materials for our products at competitive 
      prices, disruptions in our manufacturing facilities, risks of 
      international sales and operations including fluctuations in exchange 
      rates, compliance with regulatory requirements applicable to our 
      manufacturing operations, and customer concentrations. The 
      forward-looking statements contained in this release should be 
      considered in light of these risk factors.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Force Sensing
Force Sensing Resistor® technology from Interlink Electronics is the most versatile force sensing technology on the market today. These innovative sensors provide an inverse change in resistance in response to an increase/decrease in applied force. Interlink's standard range of sensors provides engineers and designers with a durable, reliable, easy to measure, thin form factor and low cost solution for human machine interface (HMI) touch solutions and analog data capture for machines. The sensors are available in a range of sizes, shapes and lengths. Several connection options are also available as standard.
								

Position Sensing
Force sensing linear potentiometers (FSLP) are sensors which can be used for menu navigation and control. Interlink's use of force allows for high rate scrolling and a more intuitive user experience. The FSLP is an easy to integrate, high resolution, ultra low power based solution that brings intuitive user controls to reduced form factor hand-held consumer electronic devices. These sensors are available in multiple lengths as standard. Interlink also offers a ring sensor for full 360-degree position sensing. These sensors are designed to be integrated into a device's host processor without the need for a dedicated microprocessor.
								

Mouse, Pointing & Touchpad
Integrated mouse modules & pointing solutions from Interlink Electronics can add touchpad or 360-degree pointing control to virtually any electronic device. Ranging from simple Mouse Button integration to NEMA-rated industrial pointing devices, these solutions are ideal for applications away from the desktop. The modules use Force Sensing Resistor technology and measurement firmware in a four-zone sensor or 4-wire resistive touchpad configuration along with a micro-controller to provide pressure sensitive cursor direction and speed control in a durable and easy to integrate form factor.
