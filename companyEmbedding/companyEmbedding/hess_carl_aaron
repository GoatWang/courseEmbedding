Carol M. Gold Is Bride of Carl A. Hess
Published: June 1, 1987









                    In the Penthouse of the Student Union Building at Brooklyn College yesterday, Carol M. Gold, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Al Gold of Brooklyn, was married to Carl A. Hess, a son of Dr. Robert L. Hess, president of Brooklyn College, and Mrs. Hess of Brooklyn and Katonah, N.Y. Judge Joseph W. Bellacosa of the State Court of Appeals performed the ceremony.        

                    Mrs. Hess, who will retain her name professionally, is the portfolio manager and an assistant vice president for investment and banking at the Amalgamated Life Insurance Company in New York. She graduated from Brooklyn College. Her previous marriage ended in divorce. Her father, who is retired, owned several retail businesses.        

                    Mr. Hess, an actuary and consultant for William M. Mercer-Meidinger-Hansen in Manhattan, graduated cum laude from Yale College. His mother, Frances Aaron Hess, was until recently the president of the Alumnae and Alumni of Vassar College. The bridegroom is a grandson of Henry A. Hess of Palm Beach, Fla., who is retired from the Hess Oil Company in New York, and of Mr. and Mrs. Marcus L. Aaron of Pittsburgh; Mr. Aaron is president of the Homer Laughlin China Company in Newell, W.Va. Mr. Hess's great-grandfather the late Mores Hess founded the Hess Oil Company, now the Amerada Hess Corporation, and his maternal great-grandfather the late Emil Goldmark was counsel to The New York Times.
