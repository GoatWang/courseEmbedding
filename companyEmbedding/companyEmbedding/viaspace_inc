								VIASPACE Giant King Grass is a low-carbon fuel for electricity generating power plants; for energy pellets; and as a feedstock for biomethane production and cellulosic biofuels, biochemicals and biomaterials. Giant King Grass, when cut more frequently, is an excellent animal feed for cattle, dairy cows, sheep, goats, camels and other animals. Proprietary Giant King Grass is the highest yielding biomass crop in the world and thus the lowest cost feedstock. Bioelectricity, biogas, biofuels, biochemicals, bioplastics, and biomaterials all need biomass as feedstock, and Giant King Grass is suitable for these applications. Equally important, Giant King Grass provides the reliable and well-characterized feedstock that is required by banks and investors in order to provide financing for these bioenergy projects. Giant King Grass is a natural plant, and is not genetically modified and not an invasive species.

Giant King&reg Grass Pellets & Biocoal to Replace Coal in Existing Power Plants

					Over 40% of electricity worldwide is generated by coal-fired power plants. Coal has the largest carbon dioxide emissions per unit energy of all fossil fuels, and coal-fired power plants are a major source of man-made carbon dioxide emissions. Coal-fired power plants generally have a life of 20 to 50 years and represent a huge global capital investment. It is not economically feasible to retire these coal-fired power plants and replace them with greener technology. It is possible, however, to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions by replacing some of the coal with biomass - burning both fuels together which is called co-firing. 
					

					Several European countries and Japan and Korea have mandated carbon dioxide emissions reductions from their power plants and have provided incentives, subsidies and feed in tariffs that make co-firing of biomass with coal financially feasible. Biomass pellets are considerably more expensive than coal and would not be an attractive option on price alone.
					

					An older and larger market for pellets is for residential and business heating in winter. Some countries have district heating where the heat is generated in a central location and distributed in the form of hot water or steam. Combined heat and power (CHP) systems generate both heat and electricity. There are also residential heating systems designed for pellets and these can be domestic boilers that generate hot water, or simple pellet stoves.
					
					The vast majority of pellets produced and consumed in the world are made from wood.
					


Global wood pellet consumption. About 60% of the pellets are used for heating, and 40% for industrial uses mostly electricity generation.



					For comparison, 2015 the worldwide coal production was about 7500 million metric tons-- 278 times larger than the global biomass pellet reduction.  Europe is the largest producer of biomass pellets, and also the largest consumer. The demand for pellets in Europe is larger than supply, and Europe is the largest importer of pellets. The United States is the second largest producer of pellets and Canada is third. To assure a supply of biomass for their power plants, several European utilities have set up pellet mills in the US near the source of sawdust and other waste wood.
					Japan and Korea are importing wood pellets, and China is both producing and using pellets.
					
Giant King Grass Pellets
					Giant King Grass has been made into pellets which have been tested by several independent laboratories. Pictures of Giant King Grass pellets and a typical analysis are shown below.
					











						Giant King Grass pellets have the same size and shape as wood pellets.
					














						Analysis of Giant King Grass pellets by Biomass Energy Lab
					


					Note that a local Giant King Grass power plant does not need to make pellets.  Chopped and dried Giant King Grass can be used directly which avoids the cost of making pellets. Pellets are only needed if the biomass must be shipped over long distances.
					

Biocoal
					The use of biomass pellets is well established, but has some limitations. Traditional biomass pellets have lower energy density per ton compared to coal, and they cannot be stored outdoors in the rain because they absorb moisture and disintegrate. New processes including torrefaction and hydrothermal catalysis convert biomass into biocoal which is pelletized and has properties very similar to ordinary coal.  It has the same energy density and can be stored outdoors. Biocoal can be mixed in any proportion with coal and pulverized in the same machines. Biocoal burns cleanly and does produce the mercury or sulfur emissions of coal. Giant King Grass has been converted into biocoal and has the same energy density as good metallurgical quality coal.

History[edit]
Viaspace was founded in 1998 as a Caltech/NASA spin-off. The company began with the objective of transforming space and defense technologies that were originally developed at JPL into commercial products.[2]
In 1998, Viaspace signed a memorandum of understanding with RGC to commercialize a Quantum well infrared photodetector. This led to a joint venture partnership between the two companies called QWIP Technologies (QWIPTECH), which was incorporated in December 1998.[4] Dr. Carl Kukkonen, CEO of Viaspace, served as initial CEO of QWIP Technologies until RGC acquired 100% of QWIPTECH in 2000.[5][6][7] Since RGC's QWIPTECH acquisition, Viaspace has had no stake in QWIPTECH nor holds any Quantum Well Infrared Photodetector patents.[8]
In the summer of 1998, Viaspace also signed a memorandum of understanding with Omicron Technologies to form a joint venture for the commercialization of applications of a technology known as Active Pixel Sensors (APS).[4] It was anticipated at the time of the joint venture that APS technology would be a strong competitor in its field and ultimately have a chance of replacing the widely used Charged Coupled Devices (CCDs) used in imaging technology.[4] However, in 2000, Omicron announced that it had dropped out of the project due to financial issues.[9] Viaspace decided to discontinue commercialization efforts for APS technology because it would be too costly.[9] Commercialization of the APS technology by Omicron and Viaspace never materialized; however, Viaspace reacquired three patents from the failed Omicron partnership. These three patents are not associated with the imaging technology, but rather, in the field of radio satellite technology.[10] The three radio satellite technology patents reacquired through the failed Omicron/ViaSpace Joint Venture are being applied toward Viaspace's inactive eCARmerce Inc. subsidiary, although there are no plans to further develop the eCARmerce subsidiary toward commercialization at this time.
In 1999, a company called Spectrasensors Inc acquired exclusive patent rights from NASA and Caltech to commercialize gas sensor technology. SpectraSensors became a Viaspace subsidiary in which Dr. Carl Kukkonen was CEO. In 2001 a company called Tunable Photonics was spun off from SpectraSensors. Dr. Carl Kukkonen served as CEO of ViaSpace, SpectraSensors, and Tunable Photonics during 2001. In 2002, a company called FiberSpace acquired Tunable Photonics. In 2003, SpectraSensors reacquired the remaining intellectual property from Tunable Photonics. Presently, SpectraSensors is a profitable company separate from Viaspace.
On August 14, 2000, Viaspace and Hewlett Packard announced a strategic alliance in which HP would provide US$10 million to Viaspace for commercialization of new technologies.[11] Five million of HP's $10 million went to the development of Viachange.com, which Viaspace no longer operates.[11]
In 2002, a new company, Direct Methanol Fuel Cell Corporation (DMFCC) was formed. DMFCC, Caltech and USC signed a letter of intent for DMFCC to acquire rights to 22 issued and over 40 pending U.S. and foreign patents. These include the original and fundamental patent for using methanol dissolved in water as the fuel for Direct Methanol Fuel Cells. In exchange, Caltech and USC became equity shareholders in DMFCC and receive a royalty on sales. Dr. Carl Kukkonen was and continues to operate as CEO of DMFCC.[12]
In 2005, Viaspace became a public company through a merger between ViaSpace and Global Wide Production. The name ViaSpace was changed to Viaspace (all caps). Dr. Carl Kukkonen remained CEO, Mr. Amjad Abdallat took the position of vice president and chief operating officer, and Mr. Stephen Muzi became the chief financial officer, Secretary, and Treasurer of Viaspace.[13] At the beginning of 2006, DMFCC exercised an option for a worldwide license to 50 issued and 50 pending fuel cell patents from Caltech and USC.[14] DMFCC currently owns 65 issued and 33 pending patents related to fuel cells.[15]
In 2006, Viaspace's wholly owned security and homeland defense subsidiary, Arroyo Sciences Inc., was renamed Viaspace Security Inc.[16] In 2007, Viaspace Security's expert system software, "SHINE Expert System", licensed from Caltech, was awarded the NASA Space Act Award.[17]
In May 2007, Viaspace established a new subsidiary Viaspace Energy.[18] In October 2008, Viaspace entered the biofuels market with the announcement of the acquisition of Inter-Pacific Arts Corp (IPA), a company with a license to grow a fast-growing grass.[19] IPA also sells framed art.[19] The framed art business of IPA is Viaspace's only non-high-technology business unit and is being used to fund the growth of the grass segment of the business.[19] Viaspace sold its humidity sensor line in April 2008 in order to focus on near term projects.[19]
Viaspace created Viaspace Green Energy in 2009 as its alternative energy subsidiary.[20] Viaspace is currently seeking or already has undisclosed contracts for DMFCC products and Giant King Grass products. In 2010 Viaspace announced the launch of its first product, Green Logs.[21] About a month later, Viaspace Green Energy announced its first power plant MOU.[22]
Presently, two of the three Viaspace business units (the alternative energy and chemical sensing units) are based on exclusive technologies developed by JPL and funded by NASA and the DOD. The renewable energy business unit is based on a worldwide license granted by China Gate to grow Giant King Grass, a non-genetically modified hybrid grass.
Subsidiaries[edit]
Direct Methanol Fuel Cell Corporation[edit]
For the alternative energy market, Viaspace subsidiary Direct Methanol Fuel Cell Corporation develops and manufactures disposable fuel cartridges for fuel cell powered electronic devices such as notebook computers, mobile phones and military systems.[23][24] Caltech and USC are equity shareholders in DMFCC and will receive royalties on any sales.[25] DMFCC currently owns 65 issued and 33 pending patents related to fuel cells.[15]
Laws forbidding methanol and other fuels onboard aircraft has deterred large OEMs from proceeding with commercialization of fuel cell powered devices. The regulation and safety standards of fuel cells is one cause of the long delay for the roll out of Direct Methanol Fuel Cell powered devices. The decisions to allow Direct Methanol Fuel Cells onboard aircraft will enhance the future prospect of Viaspace.[26][27]
Viaspace Green Energy[edit]
For the renewable energy markets, its subsidiary, Viaspace Green Energy, is cultivating Giant King Grass, a proprietary, fast-growing perennial grass for the production of liquid biofuels for transportation, and as a renewable substitute or replacement for coal as the heat source in stationary electricity generating power plants.[28][29] By June 2010, the company had 279 acres (113 ha) of land under cultivation.[30]
Ionfinity[edit]
Through its subsidiary Ionfinity, Viaspace is involved in collaborations with Caltech and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory to develop and commercialize new sensor technology that can detect very small amounts of hazardous materials such as explosives, chemical/biological weapons, toxic gases and drugs.[31][32] Ionfinity's sensors are based on mass spectrometry technology. Ionfinity is partnered with General Dynamics Corp., Sionex Corp., and Imaginative Technologies LLC.[31]

History[edit]
Viaspace was founded in 1998 as a Caltech/NASA spin-off. The company began with the objective of transforming space and defense technologies that were originally developed at JPL into commercial products.[2]
In 1998, Viaspace signed a memorandum of understanding with RGC to commercialize a Quantum well infrared photodetector. This led to a joint venture partnership between the two companies called QWIP Technologies (QWIPTECH), which was incorporated in December 1998.[4] Dr. Carl Kukkonen, CEO of Viaspace, served as initial CEO of QWIP Technologies until RGC acquired 100% of QWIPTECH in 2000.[5][6][7] Since RGC's QWIPTECH acquisition, Viaspace has had no stake in QWIPTECH nor holds any Quantum Well Infrared Photodetector patents.[8]
In the summer of 1998, Viaspace also signed a memorandum of understanding with Omicron Technologies to form a joint venture for the commercialization of applications of a technology known as Active Pixel Sensors (APS).[4] It was anticipated at the time of the joint venture that APS technology would be a strong competitor in its field and ultimately have a chance of replacing the widely used Charged Coupled Devices (CCDs) used in imaging technology.[4] However, in 2000, Omicron announced that it had dropped out of the project due to financial issues.[9] Viaspace decided to discontinue commercialization efforts for APS technology because it would be too costly.[9] Commercialization of the APS technology by Omicron and Viaspace never materialized; however, Viaspace reacquired three patents from the failed Omicron partnership. These three patents are not associated with the imaging technology, but rather, in the field of radio satellite technology.[10] The three radio satellite technology patents reacquired through the failed Omicron/ViaSpace Joint Venture are being applied toward Viaspace's inactive eCARmerce Inc. subsidiary, although there are no plans to further develop the eCARmerce subsidiary toward commercialization at this time.
In 1999, a company called Spectrasensors Inc acquired exclusive patent rights from NASA and Caltech to commercialize gas sensor technology. SpectraSensors became a Viaspace subsidiary in which Dr. Carl Kukkonen was CEO. In 2001 a company called Tunable Photonics was spun off from SpectraSensors. Dr. Carl Kukkonen served as CEO of ViaSpace, SpectraSensors, and Tunable Photonics during 2001. In 2002, a company called FiberSpace acquired Tunable Photonics. In 2003, SpectraSensors reacquired the remaining intellectual property from Tunable Photonics. Presently, SpectraSensors is a profitable company separate from Viaspace.
On August 14, 2000, Viaspace and Hewlett Packard announced a strategic alliance in which HP would provide US$10 million to Viaspace for commercialization of new technologies.[11] Five million of HP's $10 million went to the development of Viachange.com, which Viaspace no longer operates.[11]
In 2002, a new company, Direct Methanol Fuel Cell Corporation (DMFCC) was formed. DMFCC, Caltech and USC signed a letter of intent for DMFCC to acquire rights to 22 issued and over 40 pending U.S. and foreign patents. These include the original and fundamental patent for using methanol dissolved in water as the fuel for Direct Methanol Fuel Cells. In exchange, Caltech and USC became equity shareholders in DMFCC and receive a royalty on sales. Dr. Carl Kukkonen was and continues to operate as CEO of DMFCC.[12]
In 2005, Viaspace became a public company through a merger between ViaSpace and Global Wide Production. The name ViaSpace was changed to Viaspace (all caps). Dr. Carl Kukkonen remained CEO, Mr. Amjad Abdallat took the position of vice president and chief operating officer, and Mr. Stephen Muzi became the chief financial officer, Secretary, and Treasurer of Viaspace.[13] At the beginning of 2006, DMFCC exercised an option for a worldwide license to 50 issued and 50 pending fuel cell patents from Caltech and USC.[14] DMFCC currently owns 65 issued and 33 pending patents related to fuel cells.[15]
In 2006, Viaspace's wholly owned security and homeland defense subsidiary, Arroyo Sciences Inc., was renamed Viaspace Security Inc.[16] In 2007, Viaspace Security's expert system software, "SHINE Expert System", licensed from Caltech, was awarded the NASA Space Act Award.[17]
In May 2007, Viaspace established a new subsidiary Viaspace Energy.[18] In October 2008, Viaspace entered the biofuels market with the announcement of the acquisition of Inter-Pacific Arts Corp (IPA), a company with a license to grow a fast-growing grass.[19] IPA also sells framed art.[19] The framed art business of IPA is Viaspace's only non-high-technology business unit and is being used to fund the growth of the grass segment of the business.[19] Viaspace sold its humidity sensor line in April 2008 in order to focus on near term projects.[19]

These three patents are not associated with the imaging technology, but rather, in the field of radio satellite technology.[10] The three radio satellite technology patents reacquired through the failed Omicron/ViaSpace Joint Venture are being applied toward Viaspace's inactive eCARmerce Inc. subsidiary, although there are no plans to further develop the eCARmerce subsidiary toward commercialization at this time.
In 1999, a company called Spectrasensors Inc acquired exclusive patent rights from NASA and Caltech to commercialize gas sensor technology. SpectraSensors became a Viaspace subsidiary in which Dr. Carl Kukkonen was CEO. In 2001 a company called Tunable Photonics was spun off from SpectraSensors. Dr. Carl Kukkonen served as CEO of ViaSpace, SpectraSensors, and Tunable Photonics during 2001. In 2002, a company called FiberSpace acquired Tunable Photonics. In 2003, SpectraSensors reacquired the remaining intellectual property from Tunable Photonics. Presently, SpectraSensors is a profitable company separate from Viaspace.
On August 14, 2000, Viaspace and Hewlett Packard announced a strategic alliance in which HP would provide US$10 million to Viaspace for commercialization of new technologies.[11] Five million of HP's $10 million went to the development of Viachange.com, which Viaspace no longer operates.[11]
In 2002, a new company, Direct Methanol Fuel Cell Corporation (DMFCC) was formed. DMFCC, Caltech and USC signed a letter of intent for DMFCC to acquire rights to 22 issued and over 40 pending U.S. and foreign patents. These include the original and fundamental patent for using methanol dissolved in water as the fuel for Direct Methanol Fuel Cells. In exchange, Caltech and USC became equity shareholders in DMFCC and receive a royalty on sales. Dr. Carl Kukkonen was and continues to operate as CEO of DMFCC.[12]
In 2005, Viaspace became a public company through a merger between ViaSpace and Global Wide Production. The name ViaSpace was changed to Viaspace (all caps). Dr. Carl Kukkonen remained CEO, Mr. Amjad Abdallat took the position of vice president and chief operating officer, and Mr. Stephen Muzi became the chief financial officer, Secretary, and Treasurer of Viaspace.[13] At the beginning of 2006, DMFCC exercised an option for a worldwide license to 50 issued and 50 pending fuel cell patents from Caltech and USC.[14] DMFCC currently owns 65 issued and 33 pending patents related to fuel cells.[15]
In 2006, Viaspace's wholly owned security and homeland defense subsidiary, Arroyo Sciences Inc., was renamed Viaspace Security Inc.[16] In 2007, Viaspace Security's expert system software, "SHINE Expert System", licensed from Caltech, was awarded the NASA Space Act Award.[17]
In May 2007, Viaspace established a new subsidiary Viaspace Energy.[18] In October 2008, Viaspace entered the biofuels market with the announcement of the acquisition of Inter-Pacific Arts Corp (IPA), a company with a license to grow a fast-growing grass.[19] IPA also sells framed art.[19] The framed art business of IPA is Viaspace's only non-high-technology business unit and is being used to fund the growth of the grass segment of the business.[19] Viaspace sold its humidity sensor line in April 2008 in order to focus on near term projects.[19]
Viaspace created Viaspace Green Energy in 2009 as its alternative energy subsidiary.[20] Viaspace is currently seeking or already has undisclosed contracts for DMFCC products and Giant King Grass products. In 2010 Viaspace announced the launch of its first product, Green Logs.[21] About a month later, Viaspace Green Energy announced its first power plant MOU.[22]
Presently, two of the three Viaspace business units (the alternative energy and chemical sensing units) are based on exclusive technologies developed by JPL and funded by NASA and the DOD. The renewable energy business unit is based on a worldwide license granted by China Gate to grow Giant King Grass, a non-genetically modified hybrid grass.
Subsidiaries[edit]
Direct Methanol Fuel Cell Corporation[edit]
For the alternative energy market, Viaspace subsidiary Direct Methanol Fuel Cell Corporation develops and manufactures disposable fuel cartridges for fuel cell powered electronic devices such as notebook computers, mobile phones and military systems.[23][24] Caltech and USC are equity shareholders in DMFCC and will receive royalties on any sales.[25] DMFCC currently owns 65 issued and 33 pending patents related to fuel cells.[15]
Laws forbidding methanol and other fuels onboard aircraft has deterred large OEMs from proceeding with commercialization of fuel cell powered devices. The regulation and safety standards of fuel cells is one cause of the long delay for the roll out of Direct Methanol Fuel Cell powered devices. The decisions to allow Direct Methanol Fuel Cells onboard aircraft will enhance the future prospect of Viaspace.[26][27]
Viaspace Green Energy[edit]
For the renewable energy markets, its subsidiary, Viaspace Green Energy, is cultivating Giant King Grass, a proprietary, fast-growing perennial grass for the production of liquid biofuels for transportation, and as a renewable substitute or replacement for coal as the heat source in stationary electricity generating power plants.[28][29] By June 2010, the company had 279 acres (113 ha) of land under cultivation.[30]
Ionfinity[edit]
Through its subsidiary Ionfinity, Viaspace is involved in collaborations with Caltech and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory to develop and commercialize new sensor technology that can detect very small amounts of hazardous materials such as explosives, chemical/biological weapons, toxic gases and drugs.[31][32] Ionfinity's sensors are based on mass spectrometry technology. Ionfinity is partnered with General Dynamics Corp., Sionex Corp., and Imaginative Technologies LLC.[31]

VIASPACE to Produce Giant King Grass in Pellet Form to Replace Coal for Power Plants in U.S. & Europe Supports U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Proposal, European Efforts to Control Carbon Dioxide and Other Emissions Blamed for Global Warming   Press Release   Source: VIASPACE Inc.   On Monday October 5, 2009    IRVINE, Calif., Oct. 5 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- VIASPACE Inc. (OTC Bulletin Board: VSPC - News), a clean energy company growing Giant King Grass as a renewable, high yield biomass energy crop, today announced plans to produce pellets made from Giant King Grass as an alternative to coal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants across the U.S. and Europe.   According to the U.S. Department of Energy, pellets made from Giant King Grass and other biomass can potentially replace up to 20% of the coal in an existing coal-fired power plant. Giant King Grass and other plants absorb carbon dioxide during their growth. When the grass is burned, it emits carbon dioxide, but the next crop of grass 90 days later absorbs the carbon dioxide, and the overall process can be nearly carbon neutral, and therefore reduces the carbon dioxide emissions of the power plant significantly. Many existing coal-fired power plants can be adapted at modest cost to replace part of the coal with biomass pellets in a process called co-firing. In a single 2,000-megawatt coal-fired power plant, replacing 20% of the coal with Giant King Grass pellets would require approximately 2.3 million tons of pellets per year and yield revenue of approximately $2.3 million at today's prices for biomass pellets.   As reported by the Associated Press on Sept. 30, 2009, the Environmental Protection Agency (E.P.A.) announced a proposal to reduce emissions--primarily carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels--from hundreds of electric power plants and other large factories and refineries in the U.S. According to the E.P.A., these large sources are responsible for 70% of the greenhouse gas emissions that are released each year. "By using the power and authority of the Clean Air Act, we can begin reducing emissions from the nation's largest greenhouse-gas emitting facilities without placing an undue burden on the businesses that make up the vast majority of our economy," E.P.A. Administrator Lisa Jackson said.   VIASPACE Chief Executive Dr. Carl Kukkonen commented: "Co-firing with biomass pellets is probably the simplest and least expensive way to reduce the carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants, because it can be accomplished by modifying existing coal plants, and not replacing them. Alternatives such as carbon dioxide capture from the smokestack and storage underground are considered much more expensive and not expected to occur for many years. As a result, co-firing with biomass pellets is now being implemented in Europe.   "As discussed in prior announcements, independent analysis of Giant King Grass has shown it to have excellent energy content and confirmed its suitability for burning in electric power plants," Kukkonen continued. "With this in mind, VIASPACE has produced a prototype of the pellets for evaluation.   "Worldwide, 41% of electricity is generated from coal, which produces the greatest carbon dioxide emissions per unit of energy of any fossil fuel," Kukkonen added. "Replacing just 20% of coal worldwide would require approximately two billion tons of Giant King Grass pellets per year, which represents a market potential of more than $200 billion a year. With a high-yield crop like Giant King Grass, to grow the amount of grass would require only modest additional acreage equal to 1% of current world cropland. Giant King Grass can be cultivated on marginal land where it would not compete with food crops."   In addition to co-firing, 100% dedicated biomass power plants are being built throughout the world, and coal-fired power plants are being converted to run on much larger amounts of biomass. According to a Global Climate Law posting on Sept. 9, 2009, at globalclimatelaw.com, company officials at Ohio Edison, an electric utility serving customers in central and northeastern Ohio, say that one of its coal-firing plants--to be retrofitted for up to 80% biomass to be co-fired with a maximum of 20% coal--is expected to reduce yearly emissions of carbon dioxide by 1.3 million tons to 400,000 tons, most of which should be offset by the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by the biomass crops during their growth. The cost of converting the facility to biomass was expected to be materially lower than installing scrubbers or reconfiguring for natural gas.   Updated pictures of Giant King Grass are available on VIASPACE's website at www.VIASPACE.com   About VIASPACE Inc.: VIASPACE is an alternative energy company providing products and technology for renewable and clean energy that reduce or eliminate dependence on fossil and high-risk-pollutant energy sources.

(OTC: VSPC) announced today that it has reached an agreement to work in closer collaboration with Guangzhou Inter-Pacific Arts Corporation (IPA) and VIASPACE Green Energy (VGE). IPA, VGE and VIASPACE have taken steps to greatly strengthen, expand and simplify their licensing agreement for Giant King Grass (GKG). The license has been expanded to include 3 types of high yield, non-genetically modified grasses (Giant King Grasses or GKG) that were received and licensed by IPA under its original parent license. All existing intellectual property (IP) is now freely cross licensed and restrictions on new IP have been removed.  VIASPACE and IPA/VGE will continue to maintain distinct operating territories with IPA/VGE operating in China, Taiwan, Cambodia,Thailand, Myanmar, Malaysia, Laos, Vietnam and Singapore while VIASPACE’s territory includes the entire world other than IPA/VGE territory.      VIASPACE Chairman, Dr. Kevin Schewe stated, "VIASPACE is ready to diversify its product line and having the ability to develop, grow, market and sell multiple grasses gives us this flexibility and competitive edge. Having the GKG license in perpetuity and free of milestones provides security and certainty for our partners and clients going forward. The modification of royalties to VGE will improve our internal financials and lift our future profit margins.”   Mr. Haris Basit, VIASPACE CEO, commented, "There are significant opportunities available for both companies that will clearly be enhanced by closer collaboration and a simplified IP agreement.  I look forward to working closely with Mr. Sung Chang and IPA/VGE on this effort.  This new agreement allows us to combine our efforts in a partnership where our interests are very closely aligned.  The prior license imposed several financial and IP constraints to rapid business expansion while also impeding both companies R&D. This new agreement largely eliminates those business constraints and also allows for a more robust product road map for both companies.”   Mr. Sung Chang, President of VGE, also commented, "We are excited about the direction that VIASPACE is taking and Mr. Basit’s focus on the creation of meaningful revenue. We are pleased to work more closely with VIASPACE going forward from here and to assist in helping the company succeed."   Dr. Schewe concluded, "We (VIASPACE) now have a Giant King Grass license that gives us the flexibility to succeed on more fronts and further expand our business and IP portfolio. Having VIASPACE and IPA/VGE working more closely together should also help to energize our business outreach. We plan to continue to move forward with both the GKG-based animal feed and biomass energy business lines."    VIASPACE CTO & Wife Support Mother Teresa Missionaries of Charity School in Nicaragua as Biomass Power Plant Project Advances February 23, 2016   February 23, 2016 - Walnut, California - On January 11, 2016, VIASPACE Inc. (OTC: VSPC) issued a press release providing an update on the Energia Reino Verde biomass power plant project being developed by VIASPACE and partners in Nicaragua. Energia Reino Verde is a 12 MW biomass power plant that will be co-located with the 834 hectare (2,060 acre) Giant King® Grass plantation project. VIASPACE Inc. owns a 50% interest in Energia Reino Verde (Green Kingdom Energy in English), the special-purpose company that will own and operate the project. The other 50% is owned by investors and executives of AGRICORP - a large agribusiness company in Nicaragua. An offer for project debt financing has been received from a partnership of two global development banks. An EPC contract has been signed with a well-known company. The Ministry of Energy and Mines of Nicaragua is currently evaluating the Energia Reino Verde application for a provisional generation permit.   VIASPACE Chief Technology Officer Dr. Kukkonen reports, “VIASPACE business interests are the clean renewable energy power plant and Giant King Grass plantation, which require me to travel frequently to Nicaragua.  On some trips, my wife, Noreen, accompanies me.  She often spends time assisting the Missionaries of Charity in Granada, Nicaragua. This order of nuns founded by Mother Teresa in India operates a program in the poorest area of Granada. They shelter and educate teenage girls who have been victims of abuse.  They also run a day care for the poor, where the children get a safe environment and healthy meals, and they operate a soup kitchen for the community. My wife and I bring them donated clothing collected from our community, which the missionaries distribute in the Granada area.  VIASPACE and Agricorp have donated computers considered obsolete in the U.S. to the school, which had none before.”   Kukkonen continued, “In the fall of 2015 we were made aware of a particular need that we could help with.  A young woman who had lived with the sisters for more than ten years had been attending college and was ready to graduate.  Many schools in Nicaragua require an additional “module” of education following completion of degree requirements in order to obtain the diploma vital to their employment possibilities.  We funded this woman and another who supports her family by working at the mission. They are the first college graduates and serve as a role model for the younger girls living at the mission.  These young women both received diplomas in Tourism and Hotel Administration from the University Hispanoamericana in Granada and are currently seeking employment and the opportunity to begin life outside the protective environment of the mission.”   Pictures from the graduation and the Missionaries of Charity in Nicaragua are available on the VIASPACE Facebook page "" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">; rel="nofollow">www.facebook.com/viaspaceinc.        Additional donations would be welcomed.

(OTC: VSPC) reported that Board Chairman, Dr. Kevin Schewe, issued a corporate update to inform shareholders of recent corporate developments and strategic direction. Dr. Schewe stated, "On September 30, 2012, I entered into a loan agreement with VIASPACE to provide up to $1,000,000 in convertible loans to the Company over a five-year time frame. On January 13, 2016, that loan agreement was completed with a cumulative $1,000,000 loaned to VIASPACE and converted to common shares over a 3 year and 4 month time frame. I have purposely converted that entire loan amount to common shares in an effort to keep debt off our books. Including the 100 million common shares that I had previously purchased on the open market, I now preferentially hold nearly 530 million common shares or roughly 26% of the 2.04 billion outstanding shares. I have not sold a single share of VSPC common stock and have no near-term plans to sell shares. My shares are not trading, and to the contrary, I plan to increase my share holdings." "On January 25, 2016, I have entered into a new loan agreement to continue to help fund the Company's operations for the near future. This new convertible loan agreement provides up to an additional $300,000 through the end of January 2017. This money will be used for working capital related to general operations and also including the ongoing commercialization of the Giant King Grass (GKG) business. In addition to assisting the Company with its capital needs, I have been a hands-on, active Board Chairman working directly with the Management Team and I am always available to them. Since becoming Chairman, I have personally traveled to meet with clients/business partners, reviewed various contracts/agreements, supported our management team and I have reviewed and/or edited every VIASPACE press release." Dr. Schewe continued, "We have come a long way these past three years in a business space where many companies have failed. The biomass and bioenergy business has incredible scientific merit to reduce greenhouse emissions and evolve into a spearhead to reduce the forces of global warming. Despite the current phenomenon of low global oil prices and oil oversupply, the truth is that burning oil and fossil fuels at any price adds to CO2 emissions and global warming. It is our desire to be part of the global warming solution. Making this work economically is a challenge that we are addressing and plan to accomplish. In late December 2015, our CEO, Mr. Haris Basit, and our CTO, Dr. Carl Kukkonen, both came to Denver and we met to review and establish our strategy for 2016. We have divided our business strategy into two lines of business, namely bioenergy and animal feed." "Our Energia Reino Verde (ERV) 12.3MW Giant King Grass fueled power plant project in Nicaragua has required much of our efforts and resources the past 3 years. We have learned a lot along with our Nicaraguan partners to make this amazing project a reality. We know that baseload power is important (as opposed to intermittent solar or wind power), that all electricity is not priced equally -- that baseload power may cost more than intermittent power, and that with private developers, the financial partners need to make an adequate return on investment. This project is ready to go and is awaiting final government approval. We are not static and waiting, but actively seeking the final government approval. Our Nicaraguan partners have excellent working relationships with the government in Nicaragua." "One of our corporate strategies to address the economic challenges of this business space is to couple animal feed business activities with biomass and bioelectricity business. In other words, we can create cash flow using GKG animal feed while establishing a GKG plantation for biomass/bioelectricity purposes. We are working with our Nicaraguan partners to advance this concept and believe that our overall project in Nicaragua will be an attractive global business model that can be replicated anywhere that GKG can be successfully cultivated. We are partnered with Almaden Energy Group (AEG) and we are growing GKG for animal feed in California's Central Valley and Imperial Valley. We are moving into the animal feed business ourselves so that we are the experts and self-reliant but can also effectively partner with others as the middle-man. We are rapidly developing significant supportive data and proprietary processes related to our budding animal feed business." Dr. Schewe concluded, "Last year, we had two long-term shareholders (who were qualified investors) make significant investments in VIASPACE and directly purchase discounted, restricted VSPC shares from the Company. Any qualified investor potentially wanting to make a significant direct investment in VIASPACE can inquire and do the same. We are on the cusp of success and that is why I have committed to another significant loan to VIASPACE. We have active projects and new projects (both bioenergy and animal feed) underway on multiple continents. Every week we receive multiple inquiries from parties interested in biomass, bioenergy and animal feed projects. We have been working with a lobbying firm in Washington DC, since August 2015 to try and participate in government-funded grants and develop government-sponsored partnerships. A successful entrepreneur, Mr. Haris Basit, became our CEO in July 2015 and he and I together know that new revenue creation is our number one priority and job number one. We will continue to work hard to grow the value of this Company and make this Company a green energy and animal feed success." About VIASPACE Inc.

(VSPC) reported that CEO, Mr. Haris Basit, visited the Energia Reino Verde Giant King Grass power plant project under development in Nicaragua in December 2015. Chief Technology Officer, Dr. Carl Kukkonen, accompanied him during the visit.       Energia Reino Verde (ERV) is a planned 12.3 MW biomass power plant co-located with a 2,100 acre Giant King Grass plantation that is part of a larger 10,000 acre rice plantation and rice mill that provides rice to Agri-Corp, a large diversified food company that has more than 50% of the rice market in Nicaragua. VIASPACE is co-developing this project with Agri-Corp executives and investors. VIASPACE and the Agri-Corp team are equal partners in ERV. The project has received a letter of intent from two international development banks which are working together to provide the debt financing, and the Nicaraguan partners will arrange the majority of the equity financing. The boiler technology has been selected and an engineering, procurement and construction contract has been signed. Giant King Grass has been growing in Nicaragua for more than two years. The project is ready to go, upon approval of the Nicaraguan government. Mr. Basit met with Mr. Amilcar Ybarra, CEO of Agri-Corp, in Managua to receive a briefing on the ERV project, and visited the rice plantation where the Giant King Grass is growing and met with the agriculture team. Mr. Basit stated, "I was very impressed with the overall capabilities of Agri-Corp and we are pleased to have them as a partner. I want to thank Mr. Ybarra for hosting my visit. It is clear that the project is very far along and that we will be able to proceed very quickly once we get government approval.  The visit to the rice plantation was very informative.  They plant and harvest about 6,000 acres of rice twice each year. They are extremely professional with top-quality equipment and trained agronomists. It is a large operation that includes an on-site rice mill. Giant King Grass has been growing on the plantation for more than two years, and the power plant will also be co-located on the plantation so that the furthest field will only be 2 miles from the power plant. This makes logistics much simpler and financially efficient." The Giant King Grass project in Nicaragua will provide reliable 24/7 base electricity that is renewable with zero net carbon dioxide emissions. The project will replace imported oil which is the source of base electricity today, and provide more than 400 rural jobs in Nicaragua. Other renewable energy sources such as solar and wind are intermittent sources that cannot be relied upon continuously and require oil backup electricity to compensate for intermittency.  Mr. Basit concluded, "The Energia Reino Verde project will be our showroom for customers for future projects throughout the world. VIASPACE has the capability to develop the entire project including the plantation and power plant, and is working with customers and development partners on similar projects around the globe. We and our partners can do everything from a prefeasibility study and financial model through Engineering Procurement and Construction and commissioning of the power plant."       ♦ December 21, 2015  VIASPACE Update On Giant King Grass Electricity Projects  http://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/VSPC/news    WALNUT, Calif., Dec. 21, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- VIASPACE Inc. (VSPC) provides an update on electricity projects being pursued by VIASPACE and partners around the world. Several of the projects have been publicly discussed previously and some are new projects. All of the projects have customer sensitivity and some are completely confidential at the request of the customers. The confidential projects will only be described at a high level.       Biomass electricity projects using Giant King Grass as the fuel have many unique and favorable characteristics.  Renewable energy -- Giant King Grass is a high-yield perennial crop that regrows after cutting and is harvested 2 to 4 times per year for energy. 	Provides 24 hour-per-day, reliable base electricity throughout the year. Other renewable energy sources such as solar and wind are intermittent sources that cannot be relied upon continuously. 	Does not require oil backup electricity to compensate for intermittency. 	Carbon neutral -- Direct combustion of Giant King Grass or burning biogas releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Plants breathe carbon dioxide and the regrowth of the Giant King Grass re-absorbs the same amount of carbon dioxide that was emitted. 	Money stays in the country. In most cases, Giant King Grass replaces imported oil or coal. Growing in country means that the money stays in the country rather than going overseas to pay for oil. 	Creates jobs -- the Giant King Grass plantation creates needed rural agricultural employment in addition to employment at the power plant.  These are important factors for all of our customers. A major negative factor for renewable energy over this recent year has been low oil prices. Many developing countries depend on oil for their electricity. In mid-2014, Giant King Grass electricity was at a much lower price than oil electricity. Today, oil electricity is less expensive than biomass, solar and wind. Electricity producers recognize that oil is not likely to stay at a low price for the 25 year life of a power plant, but they are profiting from the low oil prices while they last. The recent climate conference in Paris has brought new emphasis on clean renewable energy and this is very encouraging. Current Giant King Grass power plant projects fall into two types.  One method is direct combustion, which produces heat that boils water to make high-pressure steam which turns a turbine connected to a generator which makes electricity. The other method is anaerobic digestion which uses a biological process to convert Giant King Grass into a methane rich biogas which is burned in an engine that turns a generator to make electricity. Direct combustion projects range from 10 MW to 35 MW and even higher. Typical anaerobic digestion projects are from 1 MW to 7 MW. Direct Combustion Power Plant Projects  Energia Reino Verde in Nicaragua is a 12.3 MW project co-located with a 2,100 acre Giant King Grass plantation that is part of a larger 10,000 acre rice plantation.  VIASPACE is co-developing this project with prominent Nicaraguan partners. The project has received a letter of intent from two international development banks which are working together to provide for 70% debt financing, and the Nicaraguan partners will arrange the majority of the equity financing. The boiler technology has been selected and an engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract has been signed. Giant King Grass has been growing in Nicaragua for more than two years. The project is ready to go and is awaiting approval from the Nicaraguan government. 	VIASPACE was retained by a customer to conduct a prefeasibility study to essentially reproduce the Nicaragua project in Africa. The prefeasibility study was completed and the customer has indicated that they plan to pursue the project. VIASPACE will provide the Giant King Grass and training for their 2,100 acre plantation. 	Another customer has contracted for a formal feasibility study for a 35 MW Giant King Grass power plant and 6,400 acre Giant King Grass plantation. A draft feasibility study has been delivered to the customer and the final product will be delivered in January 2016. This project is in the Americas. 	VIASPACE is at an earlier stage in providing information for potential projects in Asia and Africa.  Biogas Power Plant Projects  Tibbar Energy USVI, LLC is developing an anaerobic digestion (AD), renewable energy facility that will produce a Net of 7MW of base load power that will be sold to Virgin Island Water and Power Authority (WAPA) for the next 25 years on the island of St. Croix. The project will provide almost 20% of the island's base load power. Tania Tomyn, the CEO of Tibbar Energy said, "We have just about finished a 4-month full scale pilot giving us our biogas yields and fertilizer management design." The AD facility will produce its own fertilizer for the farm land Tibbar will grow GKG on and provide small farmers on the island of St. Croix with fertilizer for free.  Tibbar has been growing Giant King Grass on St. Croix for three years.  The project has a fully executed power purchase agreement, and approval from the Virgin Island Public Service Commission (PSC), 27 local and federal permits approved, and the project is in final stages of financial close which is anticipated in early 2016. The carbon neutral project will be a testament to GKG crop production and baseload power production in the Caribbean. 	Clean Energy Solutions Pacific is developing a 2 MW anaerobic digestion power plant in Papua New Guinea. Giant King Grass will be the exclusive fuel. The company has contracted with VIASPACE for a design and engineering study and operations plan of the power plant. These have been completed. The company has a power purchase agreement and is in discussions on the financing of the power plant. 	VIASPACE is pursuing other biogas opportunities in the Americas and elsewhere.  VIASPACE Chief Technology Officer, Dr. Carl Kukkonen, reports, "There are many opportunities for Giant King Grass as a fuel for power plants and as a feedstock for biofuels and biochemicals. The high-yield of Giant King Grass, combined with the logistical and cost advantages of co-location of the power plant and plantation, and continuous just-in-time harvesting, make Giant King Grass the least expensive biomass energy crop. Giant King Grass can also be co-fired with seasonal agricultural waste such as rice straw or sugarcane bagasse. VIASPACE has the ability to deliver an entire biomass power plant solution including the Giant King Grass plantation and the power plant itself which is available from our well-known partners.  The recent climate conference in Paris should make zero carbon biomass electricity more attractive. Giant King Grass can also be used to make pellets and bio coal for co-firing with coal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions." VIASPACE Chairman, Dr. Kevin Schewe, commented, "Zero carbon biomass energy projects have been facing economic headwinds given the recent low cost of oil. We know that oil prices fluctuate and will eventually go up again. On December 12, 2015, 195 countries agreed by consensus to a global climate pact, the Paris Agreement, to reduce emissions as part of the method for reducing greenhouse gas. In the 12-page document, the members agreed to reduce their carbon output 'as soon as possible' and to do their best to keep global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius. France's Foreign Minister, Laurent Fabius, said this 'ambitious and balanced' plan was a 'historic turning point' in the goal of reducing global warming. We are hopeful that this renewed international emphasis on global warming and reduction of CO2 levels will translate into bonafide economic stimulus or carbon credits that will accelerate the attractiveness of our business model for biomass derived electricity. We are making every effort to finalize the projects in our immediate pipeline which will serve as excellent carbon neutral examples for the global community." About VIASPACE Inc.

(VSPC) has been working intensively on growing Giant King® Grass (GKG) in California at the VIASPACE nursery, the University of California Desert Research and Extension Center, and with our partner Almaden Energy Group, LLC (AEG) for the past six months. This press release outlines the progress so far in this effort.       A detailed analysis of GKG for animal feed has been conducted using GKG grown at the VIASPACE nursery and independently at University of California research farm in Holtville, CA.  This study, done in concert with professional agronomists and animal nutritionists, helped determine the optimum time to harvest so as to maximize yield and feed value and thus revenue. The study included analysis of dozens of samples, taken at various maturities, for the yield as well as for the concentration of over thirty different nutrients and minerals.  Peak nutritional value and yield versus maturity were determined. In addition to the nutrition studies, GKG at UC Holtville was mechanically harvested using a conventional swather, dried in the field and then baled into hay. Some GKG bales were sent to a local dairy for feed trials and some were used to produce animal feed pellets using a commercial pellet company. The pellets were analyzed for nutritional content and palatability. Animal feed can be used in the form of fresh chopped GKG, silage, hay or pellets.  Samples of GKG from multiple harvests in 2015 have been provided to local farmers and successfully fed to cows, goats and pigs.  The nutrition analysis shows that GKG is also suitable for horses. AEG has leased a twenty-six acre plot of land in Imperial County, CA and also engaged a professional grower to grow Giant King Grass.  Twenty acres were planted in August 2015 utilizing several different techniques and planting densities.  Both manual and automated planting techniques were utilized.  Careful measurement of the cost and effectiveness of each technique has been performed.  This is a necessary step prior to scaling GKG for large production acreage.  Additional planting techniques have been tested in October and more will be tested in spring of 2016.  Testing to determine optimum harvesting and baling techniques will be carried out in the first half of 2016. Furthermore, these 26 acres have been outfitted with equipment to accurately measure water utilization and confirm the water efficiency of GKG on a larger scale. A second smaller plot of land has been planted in California's Central Valley in the heart of the largest and most concentrated dairy region within the United States.  Dairies are particularly sensitive to the nutritional content of their feed and usually benefit the most from quality feed with high protein content.  The purpose of this plot is to determine if GKG can be cost effectively grown this far north in a climate that is significantly cooler than Imperial County.  We are working closely with a major dairy and their professional nutritionists to establish the value of GKG within the dairy industry.  If GKG can be cost effectively grown in this region, it may be able to replace crops that consume far greater amounts of water than GKG, thus alleviating a crucial water shortage in that region. VIASPACE Chief Executive Officer, Haris Basit, stated, "VIASPACE is excited about the potential for using GKG as animal feed.  Early tests indicate that GKG provides high quality animal nutrition using less acreage and water than existing forage crops. This potentially addresses the most important problems facing agriculture in California today. We have gotten excellent cooperation from major dairies and are hopeful that animal feed will open up a new major market for us." VIASPACE board chairman, Dr. Kevin Schewe, commented, "We have strategically divided our business into two lines, animal feed and bioenergy. We believe that animal feed will represent an expedient and economically viable pathway to drive our business forward. VIASPACE and AEG are investing the necessary effort and resources to insure that we are responsible for our own success in commercializing GKG for animal feed. I am very pleased with the entrepreneurship and business enterprise skills that Mr. Basit has brought to VIASPACE. We mutually understand and agree on the importance and priority to get more significant revenues moving through this company. VIASPACE will be providing an update on energy related projects separately in the coming weeks." AEG is focused on commercializing GKG for animal feed within the continental United States. AEG and VIASPACE have equity ownership in each other, three VIASPACE board members are also board members in AEG, and Haris Basit is CEO of both VIASPACE and AEG. About VIASPACE Inc.
