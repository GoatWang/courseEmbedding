WOW! This is amazing! I cannot believe how super simple it is to research and create a family tree with very little information in hand. This is simply above and beyond anything else I've seen on the web! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
R. Sloan, Gallatin, Tennessee, USA


I have been trying to piece together my family for over 35 years and Smart Matches made it go past my wildest dreams. Thanks to MyHeritage, this is a wonderful and really exciting hobby to really dig deep into.
D. Henry, North Lauderdale, Florida, USA


MyHeritage is a great place to develop a family tree. In less than two weeks time I was able to track my family back to 1877. This is in no small part due to the vast storehouse of data that is available through MyHeritage.
W. Vacca, Bonita Springs, Florida, USA


I am having the time of my life. Thanks for offering such a fabulous site that is going to help so many!
K. N. Mathias , South Fulton, Tennessee, USA


Thanks to your site I finally was able to unlock the mystery! It has been a great revelation to find so many family members after so many years.
A. Horst, Charlotte, North Carolina, USA
