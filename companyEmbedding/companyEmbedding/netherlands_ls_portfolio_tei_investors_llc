Man Launches New US Tax Exempt Hedge Fund Product
by Phillip Morton, Investors Offshore.com
06 April 2004









Man Group, the world’s largest listed hedge fund manager, last Friday announced the launch of a new fund of hedge funds designed specifically for tax-exempt US investors.

The fund, the latest in a series of registered products that the firm is launching in the US, will provide qualified investors access to the portfolio of an already established multi-strategy fund-of-hedge funds which has a ten year track record. 

Man Investments Inc., a US subsidiary of Man Group plc, is the fund's primary distributor and will distribute through a nationwide channel of intermediaries.

"We expect that Man-Glenwood Lexington TEI, LLC will satisfy the high demand for fund-of-hedge funds among tax-deferred and tax-exempt investors,” commented Stanley Fink, Chief Executive of Man Group plc.

According to Fink, the fund has attracted “significant interest” from tax exempt US investors. “Thus, we felt Man-Glenwood Lexington TEI, LLC would offer qualified tax-deferred and tax-exempt investors a product designed to address their specific tax requirements," he added.

The structure of the fund allows eligible investors with tax-advantaged status - pension plans, employee benefit plans, foundations and endowments, and individual retirement accounts (IRAs) - to invest with a minimum of $25,000. This is Man Group plc’s first registered fund designed to eliminate unrelated business taxable income (UBTI) which is otherwise taxable to tax-advantaged investors. 

The fund is a closed-end investment company that uses a fund-of-hedge-funds strategy designed to preserve capital and generate attractive returns that have low correlation with traditional stock and bond markets.

NEWS RELEASE - Commercial real estate venture gets funded for $250K from funded.com's funding provider. Comment: I was very pleased with the speed and professional attitude of the site. I will recommend this to anyone in the future.

"Funded.com has been great and my project is in the final stages of being funded by an investor I found on here. I was surprized at the quick process and how fast investors funded my project. Website was a big help!" 

Rick R 
Entreprenuer





Let me first start by saying I believe your site is THE BEST there is for connecting Entrepreneurs and Investors.  It is the site I've had most success with.  I had about 6 Investors either respond back or contact me because of your site with an interest in investing in my company. Thank you very much!  I love your site and will recommend it to any of my Colleagues.  I love the fact that we are able to contact the Investors directly (which many of the sites joining Entrepreneurs and Investors don't allow).  It looks like I'm about to go into contract with an Investor because of your site.  Thank you again. 

Faith D
Entreprenuer





I am grateful I had the opportunity to access your network of investors. I am reasonably confident that the current negotiations with one of your investors will go through for our film production. I will be back for my next production.
