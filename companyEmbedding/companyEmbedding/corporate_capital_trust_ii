Corporate Capital Trust II Expands Investment Opportunities with Exemptive Relief Order
The SEC order will allow the company to co-invest in originated transactions alongside other KKR Credit accounts



























Orlando, Fla., Jun 21, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) --


                                        








The Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order granting exemptive relief to Corporate Capital Trust II, a business development company that offers individuals the unique opportunity to invest in the debt of privately owned American companies.


                                        








The order permits Corporate Capital Trust II to participate in directly negotiated investments alongside other pools of capital managed by its advisors and their affiliates, including Corporate Capital Trust and other investment funds managed by sub-advisor KKR. This will provide Corporate Capital Trust II's shareholders access to additional investment opportunities.


                                        








In addition to the ability to invest alongside KKR, the order also allows Corporate Capital Trust II to invest in transactions where KKR has greater control over the structure and terms of deals. This provides Corporate Capital Trust II an opportunity to create more value for its shareholders through proprietary sourcing, credit selection, underwriting and ongoing monitoring.


                                        








"With exemptive relief, Corporate Capital Trust II will now have the ability to diversify and expand its investment opportunities more than ever before," said Thomas K. Sittema, CEO of Corporate Capital Trust II. "We believe this will provide a broader range of opportunities and better enable us to deliver quality, risk-adjusted earnings to our shareholders."

Corporate Capital Trust II is a non-traded business development company that invests in the debt of privately owned U.S. companies.

1 The public offering price is as of July 27, 2017. The public offering price of the common stock of Corporate Capital Trust II is referred to as Class T shares.
                                    

2 The distribution rate shown does not represent the total return of Corporate Capital Trust II. Distributions are not guaranteed in frequency or amount. Annualized distribution rate is calculated by annualizing the quarterly distribution amount on March 31, 2017 and dividing by the most recently published public offering price as of the same date. Distributions are declared for weekly record dates and monthly payment dates. Distributions represent the annualized distribution rate as of the date indicated. Since inception, distributions have been supported by the advisors in the form of fee waivers and operating expense support waivers, and are not estimated to be a return of capital or supported by borrowed funds. Distributions exceed earnings and are not based on the investment performance; there can be no assurance that distributions will be sustained at current levels or at all. Near-term distributions will be paid from fee waivers or deferrals, expense support waivers, offering proceeds, borrowings and cash from operations. Corporate Capital Trust II is typically obligated to repay the advisors over several years, reducing future distributions and potentially diluting value for shareholders entering the fund at a later date.

                                    Proven Partnership
                                

                                    The investment advisors of Corporate Capital Trust II are CNL Fund Advisors II, LLC, which is responsible for the overall management of activities, and KKR Credit Advisors (US) LLC, which is responsible for the day-to-day management of the investment portfolio. CNL Fund Advisors II, LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary of CNL Financial Group, a private investment management firm providing real estate and alternative investments. KKR Credit Advisors (US) LLC is a subsidiary of KKR & Co. L.P., an investment firm with a 40-year history of investment experience.
                                

Highlights:


CNL and KKR joined forces in 2010 with the creation of Corporate Capital Trust. They have partnered once more to establish Corporate Capital Trust II, which launched in 2016.
                                    
CNL and KKR each have a history of serving institutional and individual investors.
                                    
This partnership provides access to institutional investing from KKR, a distinguished private equity pioneer.3



                                     
                                





                                    Corporate Capital Trust II is advised by CNL Fund Advisors II, LLC and subadvised by KKR Credit Advisors (US) LLC (KKR), affiliates of CNL Financial Group and KKR & Co. L.P., respectively and may not replicate the success of those entities. CNL and KKR have limited experience in managing a non-traded BDC. In connection with the management of the issuer, these entities may encounter potential conflicts of interest related to compensation arrangements, diversion of time and resources, and consideration of investment opportunities, among other things.
                                

1 The public offering price is as of July 27, 2017. The public offering price of the common stock of Corporate Capital Trust II is referred to as Class T shares.
                                

2 The distribution rate shown does not represent the total return of Corporate Capital Trust II. Distributions are not guaranteed in frequency or amount. Annualized distribution rate is calculated by annualizing the quarterly distribution amount on March 31, 2017 and dividing by the most recently published public offering price as of the same date. Distributions are declared for weekly record dates and monthly payment dates. Distributions represent the annualized distribution rate as of the date indicated. Since inception, distributions have been supported by the advisors in the form of fee waivers and operating expense support waivers, and are not estimated to be a return of capital or supported by borrowed funds. Distributions exceed earnings and are not based on the investment performance; there can be no assurance that distributions will be sustained at current levels or at all. Near-term distributions will be paid from fee waivers or deferrals, expense support waivers, offering proceeds, borrowings and cash from operations. Corporate Capital Trust II is typically obligated to repay the advisors over several years, reducing future distributions and potentially diluting value for shareholders entering the fund at a later date.
                                

3 Institutional investors typically invest with strategies, terms and conditions different from those of individual investors, who typically have a shorter investment time horizon, lower risk capacity, greater liquidity needs and pay higher fees and expenses for retail offerings.

                                        Risk Factors
                                    

Risk Factors Relating to the Offering of our Securities


                                        An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk and may be considered speculative. You should carefully consider the information found in the Risk Factors within our filings  before deciding to invest in shares of our common stock. Risks involved in an investment in us include (among others) the following:
                                    

We are a relatively new company and are subject to all of the business risks and uncertainties associated with any business with a relatively short operating history, including the risk that we will not achieve our investment objective and that the value of our common stock could decline substantially.
                                        
You should not expect to be able to sell your shares regardless of how we perform.
                                            
If you are able to sell your shares of common stock, you will likely receive less than your purchase price and the current net asset value per share. Because you will be unable to sell your shares, you will be unable to reduce your exposure on any market downturn.
                                                
We do not intend to list our common stock on any securities exchange during or for what may be a significant time after the offering period, and we do not expect a secondary market in the shares to develop.
                                                
We have implemented a share repurchase program, but only a limited number of shares of common stock are eligible for repurchase by us. In addition, any such repurchases will be at a price less than the current offering price in effect on the date that we initiate each quarterly repurchase offer.
                                                
You should consider that you may not have access to the money you invest for an indefinite period of time. 
                                                
An investment in our shares of common stock is not suitable for you if you need access to the money you invest.
                                                
Our distributions in our initial year of investment operations were not based on our investment performance, but were supported by our Advisor in the form of operating expense support payments. Now we are obligated to repay our Advisors and these repayments will reduce the current and future distributions that you should otherwise receive from your investment.
                                                


Our portfolio companies may request our assistance in the management of their affairs, however we may not have director or shareholder controls over the business affairs of the companies to which we loan capital. In addition, our investments in portfolio companies will be structured to be held until maturity and may not provide us with favorable terms for short term liquidity of the capital that we invest in them.
                                        
 We have not established any limit on the extent to which we may use borrowings or offering proceeds to fund distributions to shareholders, which may reduce the amount of capital we ultimately invest in assets, and there can be no assurances that we will be able to sustain distributions at any particular level. Our distributions may exceed our earnings, particularly during the period before we have substantially invested our net offering proceeds, which may result in commensurate reductions in net asset value per share.
                                        
This is a “best efforts” offering and, if we are unable to raise substantial funds we will be more limited in the number and type of investments we may make. As a result, our ability to diversify will be constrained.
                                        
Our investments may include original issue discount instruments. To the extent original issue discount constitutes a portion of our income, we will be exposed to typical risks associated with such income being required to be included in taxable and accounting income prior to receipt of the cash representing such income.
                                        
You should not rely on your own broker-dealer to make an independent review and investigation of the terms of this offering. Because you should not rely on your broker-dealer, you will not have the benefit of any independent review and evaluation of the terms of this offering by our Managing Dealer. In addition, we do not, and do not expect to, have research analysts reviewing our performance or our securities on an ongoing basis. Therefore, you will not have an independent review of our performance and the value of our common stock relative to other publicly traded companies.
                                        


Risk Factors Relating to Forward-Looking Statements


                                        The information on this website includes "forward looking statements." All statements other than statements of historical facts included on this website regarding the prospects of our industry and our prospects, plans, financial position and business strategy may constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of our management and on the information currently available to our management at the time of such statements. Forward looking statements generally can be identified by the words "believes," "expects," "anticipates," "intends," "plans," "estimates" or similar expressions that indicate future events and trends.
                                    

                                        Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that these expectations will prove to be correct, and our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations include those disclosed in our current  prospectus in connection with the offering of common stock. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements. Our forward-looking statements are based on information available to us at the time such statements are made. We will not update these statements unless required by law to do so.
                                    

In addition to these risk factors, please also review our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use Policy for additional information particularly concerning links to other websites, limitation of liability and securities advice.

2 The Distribution Reinvestment Price is determined by the Company’s board of directors, or a committee thereof, in its sole discretion, and is (i) not less than the net asset value per share determined in good faith by the board of directors or a committee thereof, in its sole discretion, immediately prior to the payment of the distribution (the “Net Asset Value (NAV) Per Share”) and (ii) not more than 2.5 percent greater than the NAV Per Share as of such date.

                                            Class T Share Price: $9.801   Annualized Distribution Rate: 5.97%2


                                             
                                        




                                        SEC Filings
                                    


SEC Filings


Section 16 Filings



1 The public offering price is as of July 27, 2017. The public offering price of the common stock of Corporate Capital Trust II is referred to as Class T shares.
                                    

2 The distribution rate shown does not represent the total return of Corporate Capital Trust II. Distributions are not guaranteed in frequency or amount. Annualized distribution rate is calculated by annualizing the quarterly distribution amount on March 31, 2017 and dividing by the most recently published public offering price as of the same date. Distributions are declared for weekly record dates and monthly payment dates. Distributions represent the annualized distribution rate as of the date indicated. Since inception, distributions have been supported by the advisors in the form of fee waivers and operating expense support waivers, and are not estimated to be a return of capital or supported by borrowed funds. Distributions exceed earnings and are not based on the investment performance; there can be no assurance that distributions will be sustained at current levels or at all. Near-term distributions will be paid from fee waivers or deferrals, expense support waivers, offering proceeds, borrowings and cash from operations. Corporate Capital Trust II is typically obligated to repay the advisors over several years, reducing future distributions and potentially diluting value for shareholders entering the fund at a later date.

Your Core BDC®


                                                    Through the combined efforts of CNL and KKR, Corporate Capital Trust II presents a compelling opportunity for investors. This non-traded business development company (BDC) intends to provide shareholders with monthly income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation.1 Alternative investments, including non-traded BDCs, may provide diversification in portfolios comprised of traditional assets and potentially mitigate the impact of rising interest rates. 
                                                

                                                    Corporate Capital Trust II intends to meet its objective by:
                                                

Investing primarily in the debt of privately owned American companies.
                                                    
Offering a diversified portfolio with a strategy to create risk-adjusted returns. 
                                                    
Conducting extensive due diligence.
                                                    
Actively managing the portfolio.

1 Distributions are not guaranteed in frequency or amount. Since inception, distributions have been supported by the advisors in the form of fee waivers and operating expense support waivers, and are not estimated to be a return of capital or supported by borrowed funds. Distributions exceed earnings and are not based on the investment performance; there can be no assurance that distributions will be sustained at current levels or at all. Near-term distributions will be paid from fee waivers or deferrals, expense support waivers, offering proceeds, borrowings and cash from operations. Corporate Capital Trust II is obligated to repay the advisors over several years, reducing future distributions and potentially diluting value for shareholders entering the fund at a later date. The offering price will be adjusted to ensure shares are not sold at a value that is below the NAV of Corporate Capital Trust II.
2 The offering price will be adjusted to ensure shares are not sold at a value that is below the NAV of Corporate Capital Trust II.
3 There is no assurance that this objective will be met.
4 The board of trustees for Corporate Capital Trust II may, but is not required to, implement an SRP, which is expected to be limited to 2.5 percent of the weighted average number of shares outstanding in any quarter. The SRP, when implemented, may be suspended, modified or terminated by the board of trustees at any time. Any repurchase of shares pursuant to the SRP will be at a price per share that is less than the current public offering price in effect on the date that Corporate Capital Trust II initiates the repurchase offer.

                                            Investing in Corporate Capital Trust II may be considered speculative and involves a high degree of risk, including the risk of a substantial loss of investment.

Investing in Corporate Capital Trust II is not a short-term investment and requires investors to meet the minimum suitability standards.

2 The distribution rate shown does not represent the total return of Corporate Capital Trust II. Distributions are not guaranteed in frequency or amount. Annualized distribution rate is calculated by annualizing the quarterly distribution amount on March 31, 2017 and dividing by the most recently published public offering price as of the same date. Distributions are declared for weekly record dates and monthly payment dates. Distributions represent the annualized distribution rate as of the date indicated. Since inception, distributions have been supported by the advisors in the form of fee waivers and operating expense support waivers, and are not estimated to be a return of capital or supported by borrowed funds. Distributions exceed earnings and are not based on the investment performance; there can be no assurance that distributions will be sustained at current levels or at all. Near-term distributions will be paid from fee waivers or deferrals, expense support waivers, offering proceeds, borrowings and cash from operations. Corporate Capital Trust II is typically obligated to repay the advisors over several years, reducing future distributions and potentially diluting value for shareholders entering the fund at a later date.

                                    Corporate Capital Trust II seeks to invest in companies that may provide risk-adjusted returns. Adding assets to the portfolio is done through a careful investment selection process and an extensive due diligence process. Each investment opportunity will be considered independently; however, there will be a focus on portfolio companies that share the following characteristics:
                                




1 The public offering price is as of July 27, 2017. The public offering price of the common stock of Corporate Capital Trust II is referred to as Class T shares.
                                

2 The distribution rate shown does not represent the total return of Corporate Capital Trust II. Distributions are not guaranteed in frequency or amount. Annualized distribution rate is calculated by annualizing the quarterly distribution amount on March 31, 2017 and dividing by the most recently published public offering price as of the same date. Distributions are declared for weekly record dates and monthly payment dates. Distributions represent the annualized distribution rate as of the date indicated. Since inception, distributions have been supported by the advisors in the form of fee waivers and operating expense support waivers, and are not estimated to be a return of capital or supported by borrowed funds. Distributions exceed earnings and are not based on the investment performance; there can be no assurance that distributions will be sustained at current levels or at all. Near-term distributions will be paid from fee waivers or deferrals, expense support waivers, offering proceeds, borrowings and cash from operations. Corporate Capital Trust II is typically obligated to repay the advisors over several years, reducing future distributions and potentially diluting value for shareholders entering the fund at a later date.

Investor Alert: Corporate Capital Trust II




(Last Updated On: June 28, 2016)Have you suffered losses investing in Corporate Capital Trust II BDC?  If so, the securities attorneys of The White Law Group may be able to help you recover those losses through a FINRA arbitration claim against the brokerage firm or financial advisor that recommended the investment to you.
Corporate Capital Trust II is a non-traded business development company (BDC) that provides individuals an opportunity to invest in the debt of privately owned American companies.
A Business Development Company (“BDC”) is a form of investment company that invests in small and mid-sized businesses. Investors can buy shares in a BDC, and the money from their investments is used to fund the businesses. In turn, investors can profit from dividends paid on their investments, or, in some cases, the sale of their shares. BDCs are a relatively new investment product, they were created in 1980 after Congress approved a series of amendments to the Investment Act of 1940. The creation of BDCs was meant to spur investment in smaller companies that couldn’t attract traditional forms of capital. BDCs have become increasingly popular in recent years, in part due to their ability to create strong returns on investment. However, BDCs are not without their risks and pitfalls.
Business Development Companies operate much in the same was as REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) with non-traded BDCs having many of the same problems for investors as non-traded REITs – like high-risk, high commissions, and lack of liquidity.
The White Law Group has represented a number of investors over the last few years in non-traded REITs and has concerns that BDCs may be the next new wave of problem investments for investors – in large part because of their high commission structure and the possibility that nefarious financial advisors will push these products unsuitably to maximize their own commissions.  As such, the firm is investigating the liability that brokerage firms may have for recommending high-risk BDCs, like Corporate Capital Trust II BDC.
Brokerage firms are required to perform adequate due diligence on any investment they recommend and to ensure that all recommendations are suitable for the investor in light of that particular investor’s age, investment experience, net worth, risk tolerance, investment objectives, and income.  Firms that fail to perform adequate due diligence or that make unsuitable recommendations can be held responsible for investment losses in a FINRA arbitration claim.
If you suffered losses investing in a Corporate Capital Trust II and would like to discuss your litigation options, please call the securities attorneys of The White Law Group at 888-637-5510 for a free consultation.
The White Law Group is a national securities fraud, securities arbitration, and investor protection law firm with offices in Chicago, Illinois and Vero Beach, Florida.  The firm represents investors in FINRA arbitration claims throughout the country.  For more information on the firm, visit http://www.whitesecuritieslaw.com.
