Technology
 

Our technology exploits the phenomenon of electrowetting – the ability to electronically manipulate the way liquids behave when in contact with a solid or porous surface. Water will bead up on a surface that is superhydrophobic, but can be made to move or spread out by electrowetting. The same is true for an organic liquid if the surface is superlyophobic.
It is noteworthy that research groups across the country and at several esteemed universities including MIT, Rutgers and the University of Wisconsin are now publicizing their work on electrowetting and superhydrophobicity and superlyophobicity to create so-called “smart” structures on metal, ceramic or polymer surfaces that resist getting dirty, fogging up, or forming ice. They also can be used for displays, lenses and other applications.
Bringing Nanotechnology to the Market
We are committed to bringing this technology to the marketplace as rapidly as possible.  Nanotechnology will enable military applications, consumer products and advanced systems with amazing new capabilities for long life and miniature size because of its unique characteristics.
Traditional Reserve Battery Technology
Many applications require a reserve battery. Typical implementations use a mechanical mechanism to combine the materials to create the battery. These technologies have a long shelf life, high reliability, high power densities, wide range of chemistries and wide operational range. However, there are several problems:

Cannot be easily miniaturized
Incompatible with semiconductor processes (Cannot be integrated onto “chips”.)
Based upon mechanical activation, are slow to ramp up power.
Have to maintain separate electrolyte storage and activation mechanism taking up internal space.
Often are expensive.

Nanotechnology Will Enable a Virtually Unlimited Shelf Life, Easy Miniaturization, and Inexpensive Mass Production
A battery depends upon a chemical reaction. A variety of chemistries can be used. Nanotechnology provides a unique mechanism to combine the chemicals and control the characteristics of the reaction. Using tubes to provide a “Superhydrophobic NanoStructured Surface” atop of which can be placed an electrolytet.
The electrolyte sits above the tubes and with careful engineering the electrolyte can be made to fall within the space between the tubes encountering a greatly increased surface area and interacting with the tubes themselves to causing current to flow. The fall can be engineered to occur upon a variety of stimuli: voltage, RF and/or others. We believe the primary advantages of this technology include:

Long shelf life
Easy to miniaturize
Quick ramp up to full power
Compatible with Semiconductor Processing
High Power and Energy Density
Wide range of chemistries can be used
Inexpensive to mass produce

This technical paper – Nano Grass Tech White Paper – describes the technology in more detail.
Upon external stimulus the electrolyte spreads over the surface, essentially creating battery action.

The mPhase Smart Nanobattery has proven adaptable to a wide range of chemistries, with the initial development based on zinc manganese dioxide (Zn/MnO2), similar to the typical alkaline battery used in a flashlight or TV remote control, and the current development focused on the higher-energy density, more costly lithium manganese dioxide (Li/MnO2), as found in laptops, cell phones and digital cameras. The future rechargeable battery is a lithium-based chemistry that can be implemented with the same proven architecture.
These correlate to first launch of a reserve battery, then a primary cell with the Zn/MnO2 or Li/MnO2 chemistries, and later a secondary (rechargeable) battery. At that point, the family of mPhase Smart Nanobatteries will be complete (reserve, primary and secondary) serving a wide range of applications.
As shown in the figure below, in the Reserved or Initial State there is zero output voltage. The triggerable membrane is the “barrier” that keeps the electrolyte separated from the positive and negative electrodes. In the Activated State, a trigger has been applied across the membrane to allow the electrolyte to flow into the electrode chamber to start the chemical reaction and hence producing the output voltage (1.5 V for Zn/MnO2 and 3V for Li/MnO2)
Basic operating principle of the Smart NanoBattery:

Smart NanoBattery Power Management:
A key differentiating feature of the mPhase Technologies Smart NanoBattery is Power On Command™. This feature is the ability of the user to locally or remotely activate the battery, in effect turning it on from an inactive or reserve state. Prior to activation, the battery’s chemicals remain separate, therefore supplying no power. Activation is initiated on the user’s command causing the chemicals to mix, electrochemical reactions to occur, and power to be supplied to an electronic device.
Our battery’s arrayed cell configuration extends control via Power on Command™ from a single cell to multiple cells. The array concept is a method of segmenting the battery into groups of individual cells that can be independently addressed and activated at different times, as needed. Because they are independent in form and function, each cell in the array can be of a different energy density or even a different chemistry (electrodes and electrolytes). This potentially allows for a battery array to be built in which individual cells address the unique power requirements of different subsystems, or can adapt to deliver power continuously under varying temperature extremes from very hot to very cold. In these cases, portions of the battery array are addressed and consumed sequentially as needed, thus preserving remaining power for later use and extending the useful life of the electronic device it is powering.
As an example to demonstrate extremely long active life, a  Smart NanoBattery that is designed to provide power continuously for ten years can be clustered into an array of identical cells that are designed to turn-on sequentially as one group dissipates and eventually dies. Just before one group of cells dies it triggers on a neighboring group. Therefore, three cells will provide up to 30 years (3 x 10 years each) of uninterrupted service. Six cells will provide up to 60 years. The effect is shown below for a three-cell array.

In a Smart NanoBattery consisting of a three-cell array, when the first cell in the battery is activated, it begins producing power. When it dies, the second cell is triggered. When it dies, the third cell is turned on. The battery is fully discharged when all three cells are depleted.
The selective activation of cells can be programmed electronically. For continuous operation in a changing environment from very hot to very cold, different electrode and electrolyte chemistries can be employed that can be triggered on as needed to match environmental conditions. This programmable feature can be used effectively to power remotely deployed sensors for military and other specialty applications, as well as implantable medical devices.

Significance of the Technology Innovation Award
Key Industry Challenges Addressed by mPhase Technologies Inc.
Energy storage systems, such as batteries, are crucial for the realization of modern policies toward higher utilization of non-fossil energy sources, including renewable energy. Conventional batteries utilize nickel (Ni)-cadmium (Cd), Ni-zinc (Zn), and lithium (Li)-ion batteries. While these are effective for normal day-to-day use, they are quite inefficient when used as high performance power sources. In addition, the electrolytes used in these batteries are toxic and produce significant amounts of battery waste that are hazardous to the environment.

About
 

“mPhase overcomes the relevant industrial challenges of conventional batteries – efficient, cost effective, longer shelf life and power on command.”
– Frost & Sullivan

mPhase Technologies, Inc. is an innovative development company specializing in the fabrication of Smart Surfaces enabled by breakthroughs in microfluidics, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and nanotechnology. A public company trading under the stock symbol XDSL, mPhase was founded in 1996 and has offices in Clifton, New Jersey; and Norwalk, Connecticut.
mPhase has a patent portfolio consisting of 11 patent (solely and jointly owned) and patent applications in the United States, covering Smart Surfaces, an innovative platform technology to control the flow of fluids by electronically (and other means) manipulating the way liquids behave when in contact with a solid or porous surface.
To date, mPhase has concentrated its Smart Surface platform technology on developing a Smart NanoBattery (SNB), which has several distinct advantages over current conventional batteries including:

“mPhase Technologies’ Smart Nanobattery solution give it a definitive edge over the other competitors in the market.”
– Frost & Sullivan


Potentially Infinite Shelf Life
Lower Manufacturing Cost
Power Management Functionality
Fast Ramp to Power
Wide Operating Temperature
High Energy Density
High Reliability Activation and Initiation Mechanisms
Flexible Arrayed Configurations
Versatile / Scalable Packaging
Electronic Integration
Ability to Mix Chemistries Within the Same Package
Ultra Miniaturization
 “Green” (Environmentally Friendly)


“The Smart Nanobattery can be used in a wide range of sectors including energy, electronics, health, defense, and transportation.”
– Frost & Sullivan

mPhase has completely revamped the conventional idea of the battery with our Smart NanoBattery (SNB) and is focused on commercializing its first Smart Surface enabled product for military and commercial applications: the Smart NanoBattery providing Power On Command™.
The mPhase platform technology, which is still in development, provides huge upside potential for advanced battery technologies as well as future smart drug delivery systems.
mPhase intends to advance current drug delivery systems utilizing its’ patented smart surface technology.

mPhase Technologies, Inc. Stock Alert (OTC: XDSL) - 
November 3, 2015

mPower Technologies Sees Pre-order Activity on the FastCharge 


 CLIFTON, New Jersey, October 27, 2015 
/PRNewswire/ --mPower Technologies Inc. (
http://mpowertech.com/ ), the consumer 
products division of mPhase Technologies, Inc. (OTC:
XDSL), announced today 
that consumer pre-orders are being placed for the mPower FastCharge through the 
company’s website 
www.mpowertech.com/fast-charge/ There is consumer and reseller interest 
in the FastCharge that is being demonstrated with pre-order activity.

The unit is retailing at $59.95. The mPower FastCharge is being offered in an 
upscale, brushed aluminum finish in four colors; black, blue, orange and green. 
With the holiday season approaching this product is timed for the gift-giving 
season. The unit fits in the small electronics category, a desirable niche for 
holiday shoppers.

The mPower FastCharge has a unique technology feature that allows the mPower 
FastCharge product to charge in 6 minutes through a 12V car cigarette lighter. 
The hi-speed charging input in the cigarette lighter port is 14V/10A which 
charges 5-6 times faster than the standard input of 5V/2A for traditional wall 
charging. The unit offers the consumer a solution for a backup power bank that 
can charge quickly and be taken on-the-go for electronic charging when no wall 
power is available. This battery technology goes beyond the lithium ion 
capabilities present in mPower’s portable jumpstarter line.

Consumer pre-orders are now being accepted through the website and are available 
for single unit purchases. Pre-orders are already being received from 
distributors and resellers at wholesale pricing. Those orders are in 10-pack 
minimums with a branded display box for retailers. Each unit comes in a blister-pak 
designed for the option of a hanging display in-store. Distributor inquiries can 
be directed to dealer@mpowertech.com. 

To learn more about the full line of mPower products go to the company’s website 
at www.jumpitnow.com. Wherever you go, you’re in charge.

mPhase Technologies Successfully Brands mPower Jump Product Line




Sales of $1,343,354 in calendar year 2014






February 19, 2015 09:20 AM Eastern Standard Time



CLIFTON, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--mPhase Technologies Inc., (XDSL), (http://mphasetech.com/),

      mPower has expanded into 1300 retail outlets of a major automotive 
      distributor. Total product sales of $1,343,354 occurred in calendar year 
      2014.
    

      The mPower Jump was the kick-off anchor product as the year began and 
      revenue started to “jump” with the addition of the Mini Jumpstarter. By 
      the fall, the mPower Jump Plus was introduced and the combination of the 
      fully branded line, along with winter promotional pricing, positioned 
      the company for its growth.
    

      mPower will be introducing a fourth product into the already successful 
      line. The new unit will be available for retailer’s shelves by early 
      spring. This exciting product will extend mPower’s Jumpstarter brand to 
      an even broader market.
    

      mPower has three products strongly branded in the marketplace that are 
      meeting the consumer’s demand in the portable emergency jumpstarter 
      category. The mPower Jump can jumpstart a 12V vehicle, car or 
      boat, up to 30 times on a single charge. The Mini Jump, smaller 
      in size, targets an additional market by offering a jumpstarter that has 
      the added capabilities of charging electronics. The third product is the Jump 
      Plus. The Plus is marketed to a high volume user such as vehicle 
      fleets and commercial repair and combines the high volume jumpstarter 
      with features for charging electronics and an LED flashlight with SOS 
      flasher. The Jump Plus even runs 12V mini refrigerators and 12V pumps 
      and inflators.
    

      The mPower products can be found on the company’s website at www.jumpitnow.com 
      along with a store locator. Wholesale pricing is available for resellers 
      and distributors. Distributor inquiries can be directed to dealer@mpowertech.com


      Wherever you go, you’re in charge.
