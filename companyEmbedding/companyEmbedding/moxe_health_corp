        Tech and Biotech: Sonic Foundry's Mediasite goes health-tech; Madison Vaccines shows good early results with prostate cancer vaccine
    


Judy Newman | Wisconsin State Journal

Sonic Foundry, the Madison company that morphed from music-editing software to streaming video, is diving into the health tech field — at least, indirectly.Sonic Foundry has signed a strategic partnership with Noordhoff Health, a Dutch company that provides training and education to health care professionals.A division of Noordhoff Publishers, Noordhoff Health offers services to more than 4,000 hospitals, nursing schools and health care organizations in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Austria and Switzerland.
Noordhoff says it will use Sonic Foundry’s Mediasite technology to create and sell a package of 100 training videos to health care organizations, and will offer its clients Mediasite Video Cloud subscriptions to produce their own content.“Our new partnership with Noordhoff Health is exciting because it massively expands our footprint in European hospitals and health care organizations. Countless providers and educators from over 4,000 European organizations are using our technology to create their own training videos, and ... our product captures will be preserved and used for years to come,” Sonic Foundry executive vice president Rob Lipps said, in an email.There’s no estimate from the company on the potential financial impact of the Noordhoff arrangement, but it’s not Sonic Foundry’s first health- related partnership.In Wisconsin, for example, the Marshfield Clinic uses Mediasite to record staff training sessions. In Madison, ABC for Health holds live webcasts via Mediasite to educate Wisconsin residents about health care and government issues.Madison Vaccinesreports early resultsInitial results of the first 13 patients in a clinical trial for a prostate cancer vaccine developed by Madison Vaccines Inc. show the patients’ immune response is higher and they’ve suffered no adverse health effects.The Madison company presented its early findings at the annual Prostate Cancer Foundation Scientific Retreat in Carlsbad, California on Thursday.The phase 1 study of MVI-118 is being conducted at the UW-Madison under the direction of Douglas McNeel, whose laboratory developed the vaccine.“Although these are very early findings, it is encouraging any time we get news that one of our treatments may be helping in the fight against prostate cancer,” said Richard Lesniewski, Madison Vaccines president, in a news release.
A second location, at Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, will also start enrolling patients to test the vaccine.Madison Vaccines is developing two vaccines against prostate cancer. The second, MVI-816, is in a phase 2 study and is aimed at men with signs of a cancer recurrence.Healthfinch swoopsforward with SwoopMadison startup healthfinch says its Swoop app, being tested on athenahealth’s platform, has graduated from pilot status to the main Marketplace after meeting requirements for technical performance and customer satisfaction.
Swoop, healthfinch’s primary product, automates the workflow for prescription refill requests. Since it became available on athenahealth, eight health systems have begun using the app, healthfinch said.Athenahealth is an electronic health records company and a competitor to Verona-based Epic Systems Corp.Cologuard draws honorsExact Sciences’ Cologuard blood and stool DNA test for colorectal cancer has won the 2016 10th Annual Prix Galien USA Award for best medical technology product, awarded by the Galien Foundation.The prize recognizes “biomedical and technology product achievement associated with improving the human condition,” the organization says. Cologuard was up against products from companies that included Boston Scientific Corp. and Johnson & Johnson.BrightStar invests in MoxeBrightStar Wisconsin Foundation says it has invested in Moxe Health, a Madison health IT startup that facilitates patient data exchange between health care providers and insurance companies.BrightStar did not say when the $250,000 investment occurred but it preceded finalizing a $5.5 million funding round for Moxe Health earlier this month, led by Safeguard Scientifics, a Philadelphia venture capital firm.

Your personalized new promotional products will do more than offer people an item that they can use constantly; they will promote your business and remind people that you are just a phone call away.

At National Pen, we have several new promotional products that will impress anyone who receives them. As with all our pens, you can personalize the new promotional products to bear your company's name, the street address, the telephone number and your website address. These pens can even be printed with your logo in full color. Our online tools with a wide selection of colors and fonts makes it easy to customize a new promotional product that will market your brand and help people remember you.

All our custom new promotional products are low priced to easily fit into your advertising budget. They are highly cost-effective, but they are also of extremely high quality. National Pen products are built to last so that they can keep your company's name in your customers' minds. You will always be proud to hand out our personalized pens to promote your company.

Sending your regular customers promotional pens is a great way to remind them that you appreciate their business. Customized products are also good for attracting new clients. If you're going to participate in a trade show, giving away pens would encourage the passers-by to remember your booth and select your services. Any time that you need to market your business at a corporate event, customized pens will be a gift that the recipient can remember. Whether as a giveaway prize or part of a marketing set, new promotional products by National Pen can help set your company apart from the competition.
