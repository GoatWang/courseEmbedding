About Clarke | Clarke Living          About ClarkeFor more than 50 years...              Clarke has been a cornerstone of the appliance industry in New England. In 1955, Jim Clarke Sr. opened his own appliance store…The Clarke Electric Company, in Stamford, CT. Four years later, he went to a trade show in Chicago and met Westye Bakke, the founder of Sub-Zero…he soon became their number one independent sales rep.Fast-forward to 1991, when Tom Clarke (Jim’s son) launched Clarke Distribution Corporation when he was chosen as Sub-Zero’s first wholesale distributor in New England. From just 6 employees and one small showroom, Clarke has grown to be the nation’s most exemplary distributor with three award-winning showrooms (known as the region’s ultimate kitchen resource centers), a Culinary Center teaching cooking to homeowners throughout New England, a nationally known appliance service company and a network of stellar independent retail dealers. Clarke now represents high-performance brands including: Sub-Zero, Wolf, Asko, Best, Dawn, Waterstone, and Scotsman. Tom Clarke has won various kitchen industry honors and the prestigious Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award in New England.With Tom as Clarke President and CEO, his son, Sean, joined Clarke as general manager of the company and has continued his father’s reputation as an innovator in the industry. Under their leadership, Clarke has reinvented the Clarke Experience for the design trade so that architects, designers and developers no longer just specify appliances, they redefine the luxury residential experience with Clarke’s help and innovation. Sean was distinguished with a New England Real Estate Journal “Industry Leader Spotlight” and named one of DealerScope magazine’s “Top 40 Under 40” business leaders.The Clarke family’s approach to business has never changed. Their passion for excellence has been unwavering since 1955. As Tom Clarke says, “I think my dad would be very proud of what we’ve done, because we do business the way he did business.”We were welcomed by a consultant at Clarke from the moment we walked in; to the point that we did not hesitate coming back twice with more questions -that were all answered precisely and to our satisfaction. One of the chefs even hand wrote a recipe for us before leaving the showroom.We will come back and we will recommend Clarke to friends and family.I love visiting the showroom. I have done two kitchens, one 4 years ago and one this year. I always come away better informed and excited about my kitchens and my new appliances.A visit to the showroom is a definite must for anyone building or remodeling, with a high end kitchen in mind. The experience was not only phenomenal in terms of product, but having a personal and extremely knowledgeable consultant to answer every question was over the top.What's eminently clear is that, side by side or from afar, the Wolf line stands head and shoulders over it's competitors…and this affirmation is not only because of the product, but because of your professionalism, hospitality, and congeniality.Wandering through the showroom is an absolute droolfest, it takes your breath away as you look at all the incredible examples of epicurean elegance. One spectacular kitchen features icy white, almost glittery countertops composed of quartz embedded in resin, looking like something straight out of a winter palace. Duel refrigerators encased in handtooled Douglas Fir, inlaid with leather and copper details...Luscious.We felt fortunate to be able to visit your showroom a number of times to compare different products and finalize our selections. We are very pleased with our Sub-Zero refrigerator and Wolf stove as well as Wolf cooktop. Our salesperson was quite knowledgeable and happy to answer our questions.Very customer oriented, very well trained, and knowledgeable. Did not consider even buying Sub-Zero, Wolf or Asko until I visited Clarke. Sold my Husband!Awesome experience. Thank you for allowing me to visit so many times designing our kitchen renovation.It was a great way to see the products first hand. My husband and I were building a house and the showroom gave us a great feel for what we wanted. Our consultant was outstanding. She was knowledgeable and helpful even after our visit.From the time my wife and I walked into the South Norwalk showroom, Clarke was a 10! Marco was knowledgeable and told us everything we needed to know. We went to several cooking demonstrations and now that our appliances are installed, we love them. The Sub-Zero refrigerators we have are the best we've ever owned. And the Wolf Dual-Fuel Range and Warming Drawer are perfect. I would recommend Clarke to anyone designing a new ktichen.

                    Andy Clarke has led Asda for six years
                

Asda owner Walmart has said the UK supermarket's chief executive, Andy Clarke, is stepping down to be replaced by the head of Walmart's Chinese business, Sean Clarke.Walmart said Sean Clarke's experience would allow him to "reposition the business" in a competitive market.Sean Clarke started his retail career at Asda in 2001 and has also worked for Walmart in Japan and Canada.Asda has now reported seven straight quarters of declining sales.The appointment comes as a surprise after Andy Clarke said last week in an interview that he would be succeeded by Roger Burnley, who is joining Asda from Sainsbury's.



Mr Burnley has been named as Asda's deputy chief executive and chief operating officer.David Cheesewright, president and chief executive of Walmart International, said Mr Burnley was "a top talent and a future CEO".Competitive marketplaceAndy Clarke has served as Asda's chief executive for six years in an increasingly tough market.Last month, the retailer said like-for-like sales in the first quarter of the year fell 5.7% in the face of  "fierce competition".Analysis, Emma Simpson, business correspondentIt seems that Andy Clarke is going earlier than he anticipated. Although he moved faster than his main rivals to try to counter the threat of the discounters, Asda has been haemorrhaging sales for the last seven quarters. Mr Clarke promised to narrow the price gap but the discounters are still the cheapest grocers on the high street meanwhile Tesco, Sainsbury's and Morrisons have all upped their game, leaving Asda trailing behind. Sean Clarke is described as a rising star within Walmart, someone who is experienced in dealing with major structural change. Clearly Walmart thinks a fresh pair of eyes is now needed to revive Asda's performance and he's been parachuted in. Parent company Walmart will hope his successor can grab back some of their market share.Mr Cheesewright said: "Sean is one of our most experienced global executives, and through his leadership we will build upon the momentum of Project Renewal to reposition Asda in a very competitive market place."Project Renewal is a programme designed to overhaul Asda's product range, modernise its 95 largest stores and reduce costs.

Asda is attempting to recoup sales by narrowing the price gap with the discounters and widen its price advantage over its three biggest rivals.All of the four major UK supermarket chains - Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons - have been engaged in a long-running price war as part of an attempt to slow gains in market share by discounters such as Aldi and Lidl.Last week, online retailer Amazon launched its fresh grocery service in the UK, adding to competition in the sector.

Sean Farrell


Monday 13 June 2016 07.11 EDT


Last modified on Friday 14 July 2017 15.15 EDT






Asda has replaced its chief executive in an attempt to reverse a long run of falling sales at the supermarket amid intense competition between food retailers.
Walmart, Asda’s US owner, said Andy Clarke will be replaced by Sean Clarke, a former Asda employee who most recently ran Walmart’s Chinese business.
Andy Clarke has worked for Asda for more than 20 years and has run the business since 2010. He will work at Asda until the end of July and act as an adviser to Britain’s third-biggest supermarket until the end of the year.
Asda has been the main casualty of the supermarket price war as customers defect to rivals such as the German discounters Aldi and Lidl. Walmart said last month that price cuts had failed to stop sales falling for the seventh quarterly period in a row as shoppers opted to shop in rivals’ smaller shops instead of Asda’s large stores.
Andy Clarke launched a plan called “project renewal” to revive the business in October, including cutting prices, refurbishing big stores, scrapping products and shelving expansion plans. Asda announced 750 job cuts in stores and its head office in March and said it would close staff canteens to cut costs.
Asda also opted out of the pre-Christmas Black Friday discount bonanza to protect profit margins and hired the TV chef James Martin to appear in advertisements.
Pressure grew on Clarke as trading failed to show a turnaround from a worst-ever quarterly sales fall, recorded during the period over Christmas. The competition watchdog also criticised Asda in April for offering deals that could mislead shoppers.
Asda recruited Roger Burnley, Sainsbury’s operations head, last October and some analysts expected the former Asda man to replace Clarke once his year-long notice period from Sainsbury’s was over. Burnley will become deputy chief executive of Asda when he arrives in October.
Walmart said: “Andy Clarke has decided the timing is right to step aside from his role with the company. Sean’s leadership will allow Asda to build upon the momentum of project renewal and reposition the business in a very competitive market place.”
Sean Clarke started his retail career at Asda in 1996 and worked for Walmart in Japan and Canada before running the Chinese operation of America’s biggest retailer. He will take over at Asda on 11 July.
He said: “Rejoining Asda at such a critical point in the development of the UK retail market is both a challenge and a privilege. After spending the last 15 years in Walmart’s global retail markets, I’m looking forward to returning to the business that got me hooked on grocery retail.”

Adulticides for Public Health


Larvicides for Public Health


Diluents / Equipment Flushes


Homeowner Products








More mosquito product choices, better mosquito controlClarke offers the broadest selection of product offerings in the industry. Plain and simple. Choice matters. It's the foundation for effective long-term mosquito control, for today and into the future.
From backyards to backwaters, there isn't just one control method that is guaranteed to work across all mosquito populations. And to maintain optimal efficacy, products should be used ona rotational program specific to your habitats. From conventional to Clarke NextGen chemistries, the ability to choose the right combination of products puts you in control. 
It's more than controlling mosquitoes. It's the choice to control your budget, community health, environmental impact, and results.
About Our Products 
Formulas for Cities, Farms, and Homes Anywhere
Target mosquitos at any stage of the life-cycle with our variety of larvicides and adulticides. Our formulas are developed in response to your unique needs. We will ask about the conditions of the environment you are treating so we can recommend the most effective treatment.  
From Sprays to Equipment, We Have What You Need
Whether you are managing mosquitos on public lands or for a private business, our diluents and equipment flushes help professionals deliver proper application of our products. For homeowners, we offer specific products and treatments to control mosquitos all season long or for one-time events, like summer BBQs or outdoor parties.
Our Passion is Our Difference
We're passionate about sustainability. That's why we invest in pioneering new chemistries, so we can offer you the most complete and environmentally responsible line of mosquito control products. It's so you have the option to choose a better product. Here's what we're doing:

Putting People First. Mosquitos are a very real threat to public health. They spread life-threatening diseases, like West Nile virus, dengue, and malaria. These diseases are preventable. Our products can help communities prevent transmission by keeping mosquito populations in check.
Combating Resistance. No matter where you stand on the topic of resistance, one fact can’t be argued: rotating products in your adulticide or larvicide program ensures you can maintain consistent performance levels. Our variety of producsts give you more options. Learn the 4 ways resistance is expressed in this infographic.
Being Friendly to the Earth. More effective and targeted formulas reduce insecticide load and toxicity to water, soil, and beneficial insects. It just makes sense: you use less and do less harm to the environment while getting superior results. 


For Clarke, we define sustainability as striving to do business in a way that benefits communities, supports our employees and better serves the Earth. — J. Lyell Clarke III, President & CEO
 



Best Fit Products for Controling Container Breeding Mosquitoes

Zika Requires Making the Most of Your Resources. 
To suppress populations of container breeding Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus means having the tools and resouces to fight them in back yards. That's feet on the ground. That's also why educating homeowners on steps they can take to reduce breeding sites is so important.
When your ground crews have to respond to travel related cases or local transmission, choosing the right product formulation can increase your cost efficiency. Use this product guide to tailor your program.



Green Choices

 “Can that be made organic?”
The answer from our Product Development team was a resounding "yes!"—and that was over ten years ago. We now have four formulations of Natular® larvicide listed by the OMRI (Organic Materials Review Institute).
It's the only complete portfolio of larvicides with a naturally derived active ingredient, spinosad.  Natular® can be used in and around organic crops and gardens, giving organic farmers more options without putting their organic certification status at risk.



Clarke Eco-Tier™ Index

Our sustainability vision demanded that we find better way to see forward—to define with more purpose what we wanted to discover and develop—and the Clarke Eco-Tier™ Index was born. 
How it helps you: The index ranks products, equipment and services based on their impact on the environment. This helps you make choices that best meet your own sustainability goals.
