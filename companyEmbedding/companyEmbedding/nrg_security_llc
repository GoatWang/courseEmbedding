Home security systems
Home security is not a subject to be taken lightly. You put a lot of time and effort into purchasing, building, and decorating a home – now it’s time to protect your investment. With a wide variety of home security systems to choose from, you can get peace of mind knowing your family and valuables are being protected in exactly the way you want. Think you’re ready for a home security system? Complete the form above to get free quotes from local pros.

        Alarm system installation
Home security alarm systems help offer protection against burglary and other unwanted intrusions. With the latest technology, you can even choose between a hardwired or wireless alarm. Alarms usually require a keypad and control panel. They’re available in both hardwired and wireless options.

        Equipment options
With all the brands and tech options on the market, your home security equipment can be as minimal or robust as you’d like. The best way to decide what you need is to talk to home security companies about their package and a la carte offerings. There’s a huge range of equipment choices from installing a camera to having a smart lock on your door to 24-hour monitoring and motion detectors.

        Cameras
Installing a camera is a one of the basic equipment options you’ll encounter, so it’s important to know how extensive or minimal you might want your camera system to be. Looking into some of the most popular brands, figuring out which entry points in your home you may want monitored, and deciding if an indoor or outdoor camera would be better for you are some good first steps into researching your camera needs.

        How to get started
Once you’ve done your online research, we recommend talking to a few security companies to see what they think you need for your home’s size and location. This will also help you nail down how best to work within your budget while getting everything you need for your home security. They can walk you through equipment recommendations (like alarm types and cameras) as well as answer all your questions. If you’re considering purchasing a home security system, complete the above form to review free quotes from local professionals.

Security Labels & Stickers


Product Overview
Security labels and stickers provide an anti-tamper seal for file cabinets, doors, windows, equipment, boxes, and many other containers. All of our security labels have pressure-sensitive adhesive -- just peel and stick.

Protect Your Products and Equipment
Control Access to Files, Doors, & Containers
Indicates Tampering or Pilfering

After applying  a security  label, the security label will indicate tampering. The tamper evident feature varies for each product.





See the product listing below for all of our security labels, which are offered in both stock and customized versions.

Choosing Your Security Label

The Custom Printed Security Labels are intended for most non-porous (glass, metal, etc) surfaces; they show tamper evidence from a hidden pattern (dots pattern, OPENED VOID, etc) that is revealed when the label is removed. The OPENED VOID pattern is shown in the film and in the adhesive residue left on the surface.
Our Non-Residue Security Labels reveal a hidden pattern (OPENED VOID) in the film when removed, but they do not leave an adhesive residue on the affixed surface. They are ideal for windows, doors, access panels, files, cabinets, aircraft hatches, etc.
Also a Non-Residue Label, our Secure-Guard Plus Security Labels are designed for plastic surfaces and textured surfaces (metal and plastic). Often these are the most difficult surfaces to adhere a security label.
Our Secure-Guard Plus Labels are also suitable as a non-residue label for many porous surfaces such as paper, paperboard and cardboard.
Our Pilfer-Guard Seals have two key tampering features for shipping cartons with high value contents.  The hidden pattern (OPENED) is revealed when removed. Plus, if the the carton is slit and re-sealed with clear tape, the word OPEN will appear 2 hours later to indicate tampering.
TamperStrips are primarily used to detect slitting or slight tampering.   The thin strips will break to show a broken seal. The ends also have a hidden pattern (dots) to show if the label is removed.
Custom Self-Voiding Labels are conventional security labels (or non-residue labels), but with a customized hidden pattern.  Instead of the usual hidden pattern (OPENED VOID), we can create a CUSTOM hidden pattern with your company name and/or logo. 
The Acetate Security Tapes & Labels show tampering from being torn or broken. Acetate is the most affordable security tape and labels we offer. They are often used to seal porous surfaces such as paper envelopes, paperboard containers, or cardboard. 
We offer a variety of Frangible Paper Labels which will indicate tampering by tearing or delaminating. Some include fluorescing fibers as a hidden anti-counterfeiting feature. These low cost seals are often used to seal envelopes, product packages, etc.
Our Block Out Privacy Labels are intended  to cover printed confidential information.  If removed, the labels are designed to delaminate, but leaving the black adhesive in place to visually block the underlying confidential information.
Our Water Detection Labels change color from direct water contact.
We provide specialty labels and tapes for Certified Cargo Screening Facilities.
For increased security:

Add custom text and graphics
Add a serial number

We recommend all applications be tested before product is shipped. We offer free samples so you can test and verify the product will meet your specific needs.
We also offer a product line of Mechanical Security Seals which operate on the principal of a "broken seal" and are used to mechanically secure a variety of containers. Typical applications include truck doors, trailer doors, railcar doors, totes, valves, coin bags, inner drum bags, crime scene evidence storage bags, zippers, and any container with a hasp or loop.



Specifications and Intended Use

Please see the Specifications and Intended Use for more details.
Troubleshooting Guide
If the tamper evident feature is not working to your satisfaction, please review the Security Label Troubleshooting Guide for suggestions, or give us a call.
Product Returns and Claims
See Ordering Info for more details.



Fast Service

Most stock products (without customizations) are available for same-day EXPRESS SERVICE. Place your order by 2pm EST, pay by credit card and the material ships the same day — no waiting and no RUSH fee.
Typical delivery for custom-imprinted stock products is one week. However, many stock products can be customized on a RUSH basis for a nominal fee — in as fast as 24 hours or just a few days.



Affordable Pricing

Our unique stock products are competitively priced to assure you get a quality product at a low price. For customized products, our pricing is affordable and with low minimum order quantities.



Warning to Counterfeiters

If NovaVision is requested to produce custom security products or branded packaging, we require proof to substantiate that you are authorized to purchase that product. We independently verify your contact information and legitimacy. If you are not authorized to purchase the product, your contact information may be provided to law enforcement authorities without further notice. NovaVision cooperates with all local, state, federal and international law enforcement agencies to catch and prosecute fraudulent purchases and counterfeiting.
Counterfeiting is illegal and is defined as any attempt to copy an original with the intent to defraud. It is illegal to purchase a fake identification product, an unauthorized custom hologram, an unauthorized duplicate security label, or counterfeit packaging which uses a copyrighted brand name or logo. Further, in the USA, legislation is pending to expand the criminal law so that federal prosecutors will have an easier time prosecuting counterfeiters that manufacture bogus product labels and packaging.

Tamper Evident Security Labels & Stickers




Product Overview
Tamper evident seals and  security labels are often used to detect tampering of containers and access points. When removed, the tamper evident seal will self-destruct to indicate that the seal has been broken.





Our security labels feature superior tamper evident performance, which is designed to function within one (1) minute of application on the recommended surfaces.  Unlike competitive products, there is no long waiting period for the tamper evidence feature to be functional.
We have the largest selection of stock security labels in the world. Choose from 3 stock product versions and 9 stock sizes.  Custom security labels are also available.		

Choosing Your Security Label

When tampered, the security labels featured on this page transfer adhesive to the surface.  The primary difference of the 3 stock versions is the amount of adhesive residue left on the surface.
For disposable packaging or containers, the amount of adhesive is not an issue.
However, if the container or surface will be re-used, cleaning up the adhesive residue will be more difficult and time consuming for "high residue" labels. See the "Ease of Clean Up" recommendations if the surface is to be re-used.
Using the "Table of Recommended Surfaces" (see below), select the security label  version based on the intended surface.
High residue stickers (S28) offer the best security. The tamper evident feature is more sensitive. Also, this label construction is more versatile because it is effective on a wide range of surfaces and materials.
For plastic surfaces, reference the recycle code stamped on your container (usually on the bottom). The recycle code is also referenced in the table of recommended surfaces.
 However, we recommend testing  samples in actual conditions before product is ordered. We offer free samples so you can test and verify the selected label will meet your specific needs.
Our express labels are ideal for RUSH projects. Order by 2pm and your order ships the same day.
Adding a custom logo or custom text improves security.
Custom imprints are offered in black, blue, green, red, or white ink. We also offer a hidden fluorescing ink, which is visible with a black light.
For added security, include a serial number. Record the serial number for future reference.
An optional lamination  protects imprinted text from chemical exposure. Laminated labels are recommended for outdoor applications beyond 1 year.
The silver metallic stickers (S05 and STV19) may not be suitable for use on printed circuit boards (or other electrical applications). The silver metallic layer is conductive and can cause issues if in direct contact with the circuitry.
The 3 different versions of security stickers on this page are priced the same for the same size sticker. Click on the  to see pricing details and available sizes.
We offer pricing discounts for higher quantity orders. For the best value, we recommend purchasing at least 1 year's supply. When stored properly, our labels have a MINIMUM 2 year shelf life.
If you are unsure which label best fits your needs, please send us an email or give us a call (see the CONTACT INFO at the bottom of this page).
Choosing a Size and Shape
If wrapping the security label over the edge of a box, use a  long and narrow shape.  The narrow width seals the edge of the box; the longer length is applied equally to the sides of the box. The ideal shape is a bar bell, but a rectangle is equally effective.
For complex shapes, a custom label may be required with a perforation at each change of direction.



Warning to Counterfeiters

If NovaVision is requested to produce custom security products or branded packaging, we require proof to substantiate that you are authorized to purchase that product. We independently verify your contact information and legitimacy. If you are not authorized to purchase the product, your contact information may be provided to law enforcement authorities without further notice. NovaVision cooperates with all local, state, federal and international law enforcement agencies to catch and prosecute fraudulent purchases and counterfeiting.
Counterfeiting is illegal and is defined as any attempt to copy an original with the intent to defraud. It is illegal to purchase a fake identification product, an unauthorized custom hologram, an unauthorized duplicate security label, or counterfeit packaging which uses a copyrighted brand name or logo. Further, in the USA, legislation is pending to expand the criminal law so that federal prosecutors will have an easier time prosecuting counterfeiters that manufacture bogus product labels and packaging.

Security Labels & Stickers


Product Overview
Security labels and stickers provide an anti-tamper seal for file cabinets, doors, windows, equipment, boxes, and many other containers. All of our security labels have pressure-sensitive adhesive -- just peel and stick.

Protect Your Products and Equipment
Control Access to Files, Doors, & Containers
Indicates Tampering or Pilfering

After applying  a security  label, the security label will indicate tampering. The tamper evident feature varies for each product.





See the product listing below for all of our security labels, which are offered in both stock and customized versions.

Choosing Your Security Label

The Custom Printed Security Labels are intended for most non-porous (glass, metal, etc) surfaces; they show tamper evidence from a hidden pattern (dots pattern, OPENED VOID, etc) that is revealed when the label is removed. The OPENED VOID pattern is shown in the film and in the adhesive residue left on the surface.
Our Non-Residue Security Labels reveal a hidden pattern (OPENED VOID) in the film when removed, but they do not leave an adhesive residue on the affixed surface. They are ideal for windows, doors, access panels, files, cabinets, aircraft hatches, etc.
Also a Non-Residue Label, our Secure-Guard Plus Security Labels are designed for plastic surfaces and textured surfaces (metal and plastic). Often these are the most difficult surfaces to adhere a security label.
Our Secure-Guard Plus Labels are also suitable as a non-residue label for many porous surfaces such as paper, paperboard and cardboard.
Our Pilfer-Guard Seals have two key tampering features for shipping cartons with high value contents.  The hidden pattern (OPENED) is revealed when removed. Plus, if the the carton is slit and re-sealed with clear tape, the word OPEN will appear 2 hours later to indicate tampering.
TamperStrips are primarily used to detect slitting or slight tampering.   The thin strips will break to show a broken seal. The ends also have a hidden pattern (dots) to show if the label is removed.
Custom Self-Voiding Labels are conventional security labels (or non-residue labels), but with a customized hidden pattern.  Instead of the usual hidden pattern (OPENED VOID), we can create a CUSTOM hidden pattern with your company name and/or logo. 
The Acetate Security Tapes & Labels show tampering from being torn or broken. Acetate is the most affordable security tape and labels we offer. They are often used to seal porous surfaces such as paper envelopes, paperboard containers, or cardboard. 
We offer a variety of Frangible Paper Labels which will indicate tampering by tearing or delaminating. Some include fluorescing fibers as a hidden anti-counterfeiting feature. These low cost seals are often used to seal envelopes, product packages, etc.
Our Block Out Privacy Labels are intended  to cover printed confidential information.  If removed, the labels are designed to delaminate, but leaving the black adhesive in place to visually block the underlying confidential information.
Our Water Detection Labels change color from direct water contact.
We provide specialty labels and tapes for Certified Cargo Screening Facilities.
For increased security:

Add custom text and graphics
Add a serial number

We recommend all applications be tested before product is shipped. We offer free samples so you can test and verify the product will meet your specific needs.
We also offer a product line of Mechanical Security Seals which operate on the principal of a "broken seal" and are used to mechanically secure a variety of containers. Typical applications include truck doors, trailer doors, railcar doors, totes, valves, coin bags, inner drum bags, crime scene evidence storage bags, zippers, and any container with a hasp or loop.

HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The smart home is more accessible than ever with the launch of Reliant’s 
      new suite of home security packages and automation tools. These 
      solutions help customers connect anywhere, anytime, to what is often 
      their largest investment – their home.
    


      Retail electricity customers can now sign up for a customizable security 
      package from Reliant, or enroll in a new electricity plan that offers a
home automation package. These new advances provide a broad 
      customer-focused platform for integrating emerging and future home 
      technology innovations.
    

      “We are passionate about powering people at home and on the go and with 
      these new security and home automation solutions, we can make life 
      easier and more comfortable for consumers,” said Elizabeth Killinger, 
      president of NRG Retail and Reliant. “Customers can conveniently and 
      remotely control devices in their home through a new app – all from the 
      comfort of their couch or from thousands of miles away.”
    

      The security solution offers 24/7 professional, live security 
      monitoring services, expert installation and remote access via mobile 
      devices and computers. Customers on the go can use the app to:
    


        Arm/disarm their security system;
      

        Open/close their garage door and know when it’s open or closed;
      

        Turn on/off their lights even when away from home;
      

        Unlock/lock their doors remotely to let family, friends, contractors 
        or others into their home; and
      

        Keep an eye on their home with video cameras that record based on 
        specific actions, such as when the alarm is triggered.
      


      In addition to the new security offering, customers who want home 
      automation can sign up for a select Reliant Free WeekendsSM 
      24 plan that includes an easy to install package with a smart 
      thermostat, smart plug and gateway device. Customers can then use the 
      mobile app to:
    


        Connect to devices via the gateway;
      

        Set schedules for appliances and lights using their smart plug; and
      

        Lower cooling and heating bills by setting a smart schedule for their 
        thermostat, which can reduce costs up to 10% annually according to a 
        Department of Energy study.
      


      Consumers can call 1.844.758.7674 for more information on products and
services.

Home security systems
Home security is not a subject to be taken lightly. You put a lot of time and effort into purchasing, building, and decorating a home – now it’s time to protect your investment. With a wide variety of home security systems to choose from, you can get peace of mind knowing your family and valuables are being protected in exactly the way you want. Think you’re ready for a home security system? Complete the form above to get free quotes from local pros.

        Alarm system installation
Home security alarm systems help offer protection against burglary and other unwanted intrusions. With the latest technology, you can even choose between a hardwired or wireless alarm. Alarms usually require a keypad and control panel. They’re available in both hardwired and wireless options.

        Equipment options
With all the brands and tech options on the market, your home security equipment can be as minimal or robust as you’d like. The best way to decide what you need is to talk to home security companies about their package and a la carte offerings. There’s a huge range of equipment choices from installing a camera to having a smart lock on your door to 24-hour monitoring and motion detectors.

        Cameras
Installing a camera is a one of the basic equipment options you’ll encounter, so it’s important to know how extensive or minimal you might want your camera system to be. Looking into some of the most popular brands, figuring out which entry points in your home you may want monitored, and deciding if an indoor or outdoor camera would be better for you are some good first steps into researching your camera needs.

        How to get started
Once you’ve done your online research, we recommend talking to a few security companies to see what they think you need for your home’s size and location. This will also help you nail down how best to work within your budget while getting everything you need for your home security. They can walk you through equipment recommendations (like alarm types and cameras) as well as answer all your questions. If you’re considering purchasing a home security system, complete the above form to review free quotes from local professionals.

Security Labels & Stickers


Product Overview
Security labels and stickers provide an anti-tamper seal for file cabinets, doors, windows, equipment, boxes, and many other containers. All of our security labels have pressure-sensitive adhesive -- just peel and stick.

Protect Your Products and Equipment
Control Access to Files, Doors, & Containers
Indicates Tampering or Pilfering

After applying  a security  label, the security label will indicate tampering. The tamper evident feature varies for each product.





See the product listing below for all of our security labels, which are offered in both stock and customized versions.

Choosing Your Security Label

The Custom Printed Security Labels are intended for most non-porous (glass, metal, etc) surfaces; they show tamper evidence from a hidden pattern (dots pattern, OPENED VOID, etc) that is revealed when the label is removed. The OPENED VOID pattern is shown in the film and in the adhesive residue left on the surface.
Our Non-Residue Security Labels reveal a hidden pattern (OPENED VOID) in the film when removed, but they do not leave an adhesive residue on the affixed surface. They are ideal for windows, doors, access panels, files, cabinets, aircraft hatches, etc.
Also a Non-Residue Label, our Secure-Guard Plus Security Labels are designed for plastic surfaces and textured surfaces (metal and plastic). Often these are the most difficult surfaces to adhere a security label.
Our Secure-Guard Plus Labels are also suitable as a non-residue label for many porous surfaces such as paper, paperboard and cardboard.
Our Pilfer-Guard Seals have two key tampering features for shipping cartons with high value contents.  The hidden pattern (OPENED) is revealed when removed. Plus, if the the carton is slit and re-sealed with clear tape, the word OPEN will appear 2 hours later to indicate tampering.
TamperStrips are primarily used to detect slitting or slight tampering.   The thin strips will break to show a broken seal. The ends also have a hidden pattern (dots) to show if the label is removed.
Custom Self-Voiding Labels are conventional security labels (or non-residue labels), but with a customized hidden pattern.  Instead of the usual hidden pattern (OPENED VOID), we can create a CUSTOM hidden pattern with your company name and/or logo. 
The Acetate Security Tapes & Labels show tampering from being torn or broken. Acetate is the most affordable security tape and labels we offer. They are often used to seal porous surfaces such as paper envelopes, paperboard containers, or cardboard. 
We offer a variety of Frangible Paper Labels which will indicate tampering by tearing or delaminating. Some include fluorescing fibers as a hidden anti-counterfeiting feature. These low cost seals are often used to seal envelopes, product packages, etc.
Our Block Out Privacy Labels are intended  to cover printed confidential information.  If removed, the labels are designed to delaminate, but leaving the black adhesive in place to visually block the underlying confidential information.
Our Water Detection Labels change color from direct water contact.
We provide specialty labels and tapes for Certified Cargo Screening Facilities.
For increased security:

Add custom text and graphics
Add a serial number

We recommend all applications be tested before product is shipped. We offer free samples so you can test and verify the product will meet your specific needs.
We also offer a product line of Mechanical Security Seals which operate on the principal of a "broken seal" and are used to mechanically secure a variety of containers. Typical applications include truck doors, trailer doors, railcar doors, totes, valves, coin bags, inner drum bags, crime scene evidence storage bags, zippers, and any container with a hasp or loop.



Specifications and Intended Use

Please see the Specifications and Intended Use for more details.
Troubleshooting Guide
If the tamper evident feature is not working to your satisfaction, please review the Security Label Troubleshooting Guide for suggestions, or give us a call.
Product Returns and Claims
See Ordering Info for more details.



Fast Service

Most stock products (without customizations) are available for same-day EXPRESS SERVICE. Place your order by 2pm EST, pay by credit card and the material ships the same day — no waiting and no RUSH fee.
Typical delivery for custom-imprinted stock products is one week. However, many stock products can be customized on a RUSH basis for a nominal fee — in as fast as 24 hours or just a few days.



Affordable Pricing

Our unique stock products are competitively priced to assure you get a quality product at a low price. For customized products, our pricing is affordable and with low minimum order quantities.



Warning to Counterfeiters

If NovaVision is requested to produce custom security products or branded packaging, we require proof to substantiate that you are authorized to purchase that product. We independently verify your contact information and legitimacy. If you are not authorized to purchase the product, your contact information may be provided to law enforcement authorities without further notice. NovaVision cooperates with all local, state, federal and international law enforcement agencies to catch and prosecute fraudulent purchases and counterfeiting.
Counterfeiting is illegal and is defined as any attempt to copy an original with the intent to defraud. It is illegal to purchase a fake identification product, an unauthorized custom hologram, an unauthorized duplicate security label, or counterfeit packaging which uses a copyrighted brand name or logo. Further, in the USA, legislation is pending to expand the criminal law so that federal prosecutors will have an easier time prosecuting counterfeiters that manufacture bogus product labels and packaging.

Tamper Evident Security Labels & Stickers




Product Overview
Tamper evident seals and  security labels are often used to detect tampering of containers and access points. When removed, the tamper evident seal will self-destruct to indicate that the seal has been broken.





Our security labels feature superior tamper evident performance, which is designed to function within one (1) minute of application on the recommended surfaces.  Unlike competitive products, there is no long waiting period for the tamper evidence feature to be functional.
We have the largest selection of stock security labels in the world. Choose from 3 stock product versions and 9 stock sizes.  Custom security labels are also available.		

Choosing Your Security Label

When tampered, the security labels featured on this page transfer adhesive to the surface.  The primary difference of the 3 stock versions is the amount of adhesive residue left on the surface.
For disposable packaging or containers, the amount of adhesive is not an issue.
However, if the container or surface will be re-used, cleaning up the adhesive residue will be more difficult and time consuming for "high residue" labels. See the "Ease of Clean Up" recommendations if the surface is to be re-used.
Using the "Table of Recommended Surfaces" (see below), select the security label  version based on the intended surface.
High residue stickers (S28) offer the best security. The tamper evident feature is more sensitive. Also, this label construction is more versatile because it is effective on a wide range of surfaces and materials.
For plastic surfaces, reference the recycle code stamped on your container (usually on the bottom). The recycle code is also referenced in the table of recommended surfaces.
 However, we recommend testing  samples in actual conditions before product is ordered. We offer free samples so you can test and verify the selected label will meet your specific needs.
Our express labels are ideal for RUSH projects. Order by 2pm and your order ships the same day.
Adding a custom logo or custom text improves security.
Custom imprints are offered in black, blue, green, red, or white ink. We also offer a hidden fluorescing ink, which is visible with a black light.
For added security, include a serial number. Record the serial number for future reference.
An optional lamination  protects imprinted text from chemical exposure. Laminated labels are recommended for outdoor applications beyond 1 year.
The silver metallic stickers (S05 and STV19) may not be suitable for use on printed circuit boards (or other electrical applications). The silver metallic layer is conductive and can cause issues if in direct contact with the circuitry.
The 3 different versions of security stickers on this page are priced the same for the same size sticker. Click on the  to see pricing details and available sizes.
We offer pricing discounts for higher quantity orders. For the best value, we recommend purchasing at least 1 year's supply. When stored properly, our labels have a MINIMUM 2 year shelf life.
If you are unsure which label best fits your needs, please send us an email or give us a call (see the CONTACT INFO at the bottom of this page).
Choosing a Size and Shape
If wrapping the security label over the edge of a box, use a  long and narrow shape.  The narrow width seals the edge of the box; the longer length is applied equally to the sides of the box. The ideal shape is a bar bell, but a rectangle is equally effective.
For complex shapes, a custom label may be required with a perforation at each change of direction.



Warning to Counterfeiters

If NovaVision is requested to produce custom security products or branded packaging, we require proof to substantiate that you are authorized to purchase that product. We independently verify your contact information and legitimacy. If you are not authorized to purchase the product, your contact information may be provided to law enforcement authorities without further notice. NovaVision cooperates with all local, state, federal and international law enforcement agencies to catch and prosecute fraudulent purchases and counterfeiting.
Counterfeiting is illegal and is defined as any attempt to copy an original with the intent to defraud. It is illegal to purchase a fake identification product, an unauthorized custom hologram, an unauthorized duplicate security label, or counterfeit packaging which uses a copyrighted brand name or logo. Further, in the USA, legislation is pending to expand the criminal law so that federal prosecutors will have an easier time prosecuting counterfeiters that manufacture bogus product labels and packaging.

Security Labels & Stickers


Product Overview
Security labels and stickers provide an anti-tamper seal for file cabinets, doors, windows, equipment, boxes, and many other containers. All of our security labels have pressure-sensitive adhesive -- just peel and stick.

Protect Your Products and Equipment
Control Access to Files, Doors, & Containers
Indicates Tampering or Pilfering

After applying  a security  label, the security label will indicate tampering. The tamper evident feature varies for each product.





See the product listing below for all of our security labels, which are offered in both stock and customized versions.

Choosing Your Security Label

The Custom Printed Security Labels are intended for most non-porous (glass, metal, etc) surfaces; they show tamper evidence from a hidden pattern (dots pattern, OPENED VOID, etc) that is revealed when the label is removed. The OPENED VOID pattern is shown in the film and in the adhesive residue left on the surface.
Our Non-Residue Security Labels reveal a hidden pattern (OPENED VOID) in the film when removed, but they do not leave an adhesive residue on the affixed surface. They are ideal for windows, doors, access panels, files, cabinets, aircraft hatches, etc.
Also a Non-Residue Label, our Secure-Guard Plus Security Labels are designed for plastic surfaces and textured surfaces (metal and plastic). Often these are the most difficult surfaces to adhere a security label.
Our Secure-Guard Plus Labels are also suitable as a non-residue label for many porous surfaces such as paper, paperboard and cardboard.
Our Pilfer-Guard Seals have two key tampering features for shipping cartons with high value contents.  The hidden pattern (OPENED) is revealed when removed. Plus, if the the carton is slit and re-sealed with clear tape, the word OPEN will appear 2 hours later to indicate tampering.
TamperStrips are primarily used to detect slitting or slight tampering.   The thin strips will break to show a broken seal. The ends also have a hidden pattern (dots) to show if the label is removed.
Custom Self-Voiding Labels are conventional security labels (or non-residue labels), but with a customized hidden pattern.  Instead of the usual hidden pattern (OPENED VOID), we can create a CUSTOM hidden pattern with your company name and/or logo. 
The Acetate Security Tapes & Labels show tampering from being torn or broken. Acetate is the most affordable security tape and labels we offer. They are often used to seal porous surfaces such as paper envelopes, paperboard containers, or cardboard. 
We offer a variety of Frangible Paper Labels which will indicate tampering by tearing or delaminating. Some include fluorescing fibers as a hidden anti-counterfeiting feature. These low cost seals are often used to seal envelopes, product packages, etc.
Our Block Out Privacy Labels are intended  to cover printed confidential information.  If removed, the labels are designed to delaminate, but leaving the black adhesive in place to visually block the underlying confidential information.
Our Water Detection Labels change color from direct water contact.
We provide specialty labels and tapes for Certified Cargo Screening Facilities.
For increased security:

Add custom text and graphics
Add a serial number

We recommend all applications be tested before product is shipped. We offer free samples so you can test and verify the product will meet your specific needs.
We also offer a product line of Mechanical Security Seals which operate on the principal of a "broken seal" and are used to mechanically secure a variety of containers. Typical applications include truck doors, trailer doors, railcar doors, totes, valves, coin bags, inner drum bags, crime scene evidence storage bags, zippers, and any container with a hasp or loop.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
