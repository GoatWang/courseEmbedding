History[edit]
Founded by Robert Addison Day in 1971 and headquartered in Los Angeles, TCW manages a broad range of investment products.[1] The TCW Group was originally known as Trust Company of the West. TCW clients include many of the largest corporate and public pension plans, financial institutions, endowments and foundations in the U.S., as well as foreign investors and high-net-worth individuals.[2]
In 2001, Société Générale (SocGen) acquired a controlling interest in The TCW Group.[3][4]
On February 24, 2010, TCW announced the completion of its acquisition of Metropolitan West Asset Management LLC (MetWest), a leading fixed income investment management firm.[5]
In February 2013, TCW management and alternative asset manager The Carlyle Group acquired TCW Group from Société Générale.[6] As a result of the transaction, TCW management and employees increased their ownership in the firm to approximately 40% on a fully diluted basis, better aligning interests with clients. Equity for the investment came from two Carlyle investment funds and from TCW management.[7]
As of March 31, 2017, TCW had $194.3 billion of assets under management or committed to management.[8] The CEO of The TCW Group is David Lippman.[9]

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

History[edit]
Founded by Robert Addison Day in 1971 and headquartered in Los Angeles, TCW manages a broad range of investment products.[1] The TCW Group was originally known as Trust Company of the West. TCW clients include many of the largest corporate and public pension plans, financial institutions, endowments and foundations in the U.S., as well as foreign investors and high-net-worth individuals.[2]
In 2001, Société Générale (SocGen) acquired a controlling interest in The TCW Group.[3][4]
On February 24, 2010, TCW announced the completion of its acquisition of Metropolitan West Asset Management LLC (MetWest), a leading fixed income investment management firm.[5]
In February 2013, TCW management and alternative asset manager The Carlyle Group acquired TCW Group from Société Générale.[6] As a result of the transaction, TCW management and employees increased their ownership in the firm to approximately 40% on a fully diluted basis, better aligning interests with clients. Equity for the investment came from two Carlyle investment funds and from TCW management.[7]
As of March 31, 2017, TCW had $194.3 billion of assets under management or committed to management.[8] The CEO of The TCW Group is David Lippman.[9]

2016 Year-End Distribution


            As disclosed in the annual report and SAI, distributions are determined in accordance with income tax regulations which may differ from GAAP accounting. These differences are primarily due to differing treatments for foreign currency transactions, market discount and premium, losses deferred due to wash sales, excise tax regulations and employing equalization in determining amounts to be distributed to fund shareholders.

2016 Year-End Distribution


            As disclosed in the annual report and SAI, distributions are determined in accordance with income tax regulations which may differ from GAAP accounting. These differences are primarily due to differing treatments for foreign currency transactions, market discount and premium, losses deferred due to wash sales, excise tax regulations and employing equalization in determining amounts to be distributed to fund shareholders.

2016 Year-End Distribution


            As disclosed in the annual report and SAI, distributions are determined in accordance with income tax regulations which may differ from GAAP accounting. These differences are primarily due to differing treatments for foreign currency transactions, market discount and premium, losses deferred due to wash sales, excise tax regulations and employing equalization in determining amounts to be distributed to fund shareholders.
