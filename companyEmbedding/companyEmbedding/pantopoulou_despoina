Abstract
We compared the lipid profiles and serum levels of leptin, adiponectin and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in rats with/without hyperlipidemia and with/without concomitant diabetes mellitus. Forty 10-wk-old male Wistar rats were divided into four groups. Groups A and C received standard food for 12 wks. Groups B and D received a high-fat diet enriched with 2 % additional cholesterol. Moreover, insulin-deficient (type I) diabetes mellitus was induced in rats in groups C and D with intraperitoneal injections of streptozotocin. Fasting serum leptin levels were decreased in diabetic groups (groups C and D) compared with controls. Fasting serum adiponectin levels were decreased in groups C and D compared with group A. Serum TNF-α levels were augmented in groups B and D, those fed with an atherogenic diet. By contrast, TNF-α levels were decreased in group C. Our data suggest that serum leptin, adiponectin and TNF-α levels may serve as markers of obesity and type I diabetes mellitus.

	On December 23, 2016, the Reporting Persons received payment in the aggregate amount of $3,058,943 from the Issuer in exchange for the cancellation of the Debenture and the termination of all obligations of the Issuer under the Debenture.

	There have been no material changes to the information previously reported under Item 4 in the Schedule 13D with respect to the Reporting Persons.








	 






	 









	Item 5.








	Interest in Securities of the Issuer.









	Item 5. Interest in Securities of the Issuer of the Schedule 13D is hereby amended and restated to read in its entirety as follows:




	 




	(a)


	                                


	According to information provided by the Issuer, 50,684,095 shares of the Issuers Common Stock were outstanding as of November 14, 2016.  As of December 23, 2016, the Reporting Persons directly beneficially own, as Joint Tenants with the Right of Survivorship, 1,621,664 shares, or 3.2%, of the Issuers outstanding Common Stock. 




	 




	(b)

Abstract:
																						Amalia E Yanni1, Eleutherios Margaritis2, Nikolaos Liarakos2, Alkisti Pantopoulou2, Maria Poulakou2, Maria Kostakis2, Despoina Perrea2, Alkis Kostakis31Department of Science of Dietetics and Nutrition, Harokopio University of Athens, Athens, Greece, 2Laboratory of Experimental Surgery and Surgical Research, School of Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece, 32nd Department of Propedeutic Surgery, School of Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, GreeceObjective: To study the effect of oral administration of a nitric oxide (NO) donor L-arginine (L-Arg), a NO synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) and an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase, allopurinol (Allo), on serum NO concentration and catalase activity after intestinal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) in rats.Methods: Male Wistar rats received per os L-Arg (800 mg/kg) or L-NAME (50 mg/kg) or Allo (100 mg/kg) 24 hrs, 12 hrs and 1 hr before underwent 1 hr occlusion of superior mesenteric artery followed by 1 hr of reperfusion (L-Arg(IR1), L-NAME(IR1) and Allo(IR1) respectively) or 1 hr occlusion followed by 8 hrs of reperfusion (L-Arg(IR8), L-NAME(IR8) and Allo(IR8) respectively). There was one group underwent 1 hr occlusion (I), a group underwent 1 hr occlusion followed by 1 hr reperfusion (IR1), a group subjected to 1 hr occlusion followed by 8 hrs of reperfusion (IR8) and a last group that served as control (C). Serum NO concentration and catalase activity were measured.Results: After 1 hr of reperfusion serum NO concentration was elevated in IR1 and L-Arg(IR1) groups compared with group C but not in L-NAME(IR1) and Allo(IR1) group. Catalase activity was enhanced in L-NAME(IR1) group. Interestingly, serum NO concentration was increased after 8 hrs of reperfusion in all groups (IR8, L-Arg(IR8), L-NAME(IR8) and Allo(IR8)) compared with control while catalase activity did not show significant difference in any group.Conclusions: The results of the present study show that NO concentration is elevated in serum after intestinal I/R and the elevation sustained after administration of L-Arg but not after administration of L-NAME or Allo after 1 hr reperfusion. However, after 8 hrs of reperfusion NO concentration was increased in all groups studied, focusing attention on its possible important role in a complicated situation such as intestinal I/R that involves intestine and other organs. Serum catalase activity does not seem to be affected by per os supplementation of L-Arg or Allo in intestinal I/R.Keywords: intestine, ischemia-reperfusio

Abstract:
																						Male C57bl/6 mice were assigned to the following groups: (NC) control group, (HC) group receiving test diet supplemented with 2% cholesterol and 0.5% cholic acid for 8 weeks, (HCN) group receiving the test diet with NAC supplementation (230 mg/kg p.o.) and (HCS) group fed the test diet enriched with 10% sesame oil. Total serum cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides were assayed at the beginning and at the end of the experiment. Total peroxides and nitric oxide (NO) levels were measured in the serum at the end of the experiment. Hepatic and aortic lesions were evaluated by haematoxylin-eosin staining.Higher serum levels of total and LDL-cholesterol were recorded in all groups fed the high cholesterol diet. The HCN group presented reduced lipid levels compared to HC and HCS groups. No differences were observed between HCS and HC groups. Peroxide content in serum was markedly increased in mice consuming high cholesterol diet. NAC and sesame oil administration led to a significant decrease of serum lipid peroxidation in the levels of control group, whereas only NAC restored NO bioavailability. In terms of liver histology, the lesions observed in HCN group were less severe than those seen in the other high cholesterol groups.Co-administration of NAC, but not sesame oil, restored the disturbed lipid profile and improved hepatic steatosis in the studied diet-induced hypercholesterolemic mice. Both agents appear to ameliorate serum antioxidant defense.Hypercholesterolemia in combination with raised LDL-cholesterol concentration represent major risk factors for the development and progression of atherosclerosis and consequently of cardiovascular disease [1]. Based on this evidence, scientific research is targeting the discovery of new drugs with hypocholesterolemic effects. Plant based dietary therapies and natural food components are being proposed nowadays for the prevention of dyslipidemia. The antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC), an organosulfur f

Abstract:
																						SUMMARY: Introduction: Upon use of monopolar electrosurgery or CO2-laser high-frequency, current or infrared light respectively are converted to heat, inducing beneficial and undesired tissue effects. Purpose: This study aimed to investigate histologically and immunohistochemically the effects of monopolar electrosurgery and CO2-laser upon skin and oral mucosa and to compare them with those of scalpel. Material and methods: 5 healthy swine were used. Standardized incisions were made by scalpel and the above instruments at 3 surgical sites. Results: Lateral thermal damage to CO2-laser-incisions and the inflammatory extent in skin sections were significantly greater than scalpel incisions, but inflammation did not differ significantly between electrosurgical and scalpel incisions. Conclusions: CO2-laser was associated with greater thermal damage, impinging or epithelial proliferation and postoperative inflammation.

Abstract:
																						Chondrosarcomas of the spine are rare and difficult to treat. In this paper a case of thoracic chondrosarcoma is presented. Chondrosarcomas of the spine are generally smaller, more difficult to excise and are followed by higher local recurrence compared with chondrosarcomas of the peripheral skeleton. The tumor is radio- and chemoresistant, making the surgical treatment of utmost importance. The most important prognostic factor for local control is wide or marginal tumor resection. Our patient was treated in two stages, with total excision of the tumor, using cryosurgery. Liquid nitrogen was used to freeze the damaged tissue at a cellular level and made the excision more efficient.

Methods: The right eye of 20 rabbits was injected intravitreally with 1.25 mg/0.05 mL bevacizumab. Both eyes of four rabbits each time were enucleated at days 1, 3, 8, 15, and 29. Bevacizumab concentrations were measured in serum, aqueous humor, and vitreous. Results: Maximum vitreous (406.25 μg/mL) and aqueous humor (5.83 μg/mL) concentrations of bevacizumab in the right eye were measured at day 1. Serum bevacizumab concentration peaked at day 8 (0.413 μg/mL) and declined to 0.032 μg/mL at 4 weeks. Half-life values in right vitreous, right aqueous humor, and serum were 6.61, 6.51, and 5.87 days, respectively. Concentration of bevacizumab in the vitreous of the noninjected eye peaked at day 8 (0.335 ng/mL) and declined to 0.218 ng/mL at 4 weeks. In the aqueous humor of the noninjected eye, maximum concentration of bevacizumab was achieved at day 8 (1.6125 ng/mL) and declined (to 0.11 ng/mL) at 4 weeks. Conclusion: The vitreous half-life of 1.25 mg/0.05 mL intravitreal bevacizumab was 6.61 days in this rabbit model. Maximum concentrations of bevacizumab were reached at day 1 in both vitreous and aqueous humor of the right eye and at day 8 in the serum. Very low concentrations of bevacizumab were measured in the fellow noninjected eye.

Abstract:
																						Objectives. Recent advances in perioperative management, antibiotics, and surgical materials, including mechanical staplers, have decreased the operative risk of pulmonary resection. However, bronchopleural fistula can still occur in some instances, the occurrence often being lethal. This study investigated whether platelet-rich plasma (PRP) promotes granulation of the bronchial stump after pneumonectomy. Methods. Ten pigs were randomized into two groups: (A) control or non-PRP group (pneumonectomy) and (B) PRP group (pneumonectomy and PRP application). PRP was obtained by spinning down the animal’s own blood and collecting the buffy coat containing platelets and white blood cells. Results. Increased platelet concentration triggered the healing process. The percentage of granulation tissue formed at the stumps was significantly higher in the PRP group of animals. This observation was confirmed when statistical analysis using Mann-Whitney U test was performed ( ). Conclusions. PRP is easily produced with minimal basic equipment and is useful in accelerating granulation of the bronchial stump, although the timing and optimum number of applications in humans require further study. Autologous PRP is a safe, feasible, and reliable new healing promoter with potential therapeutic effects. 1. Introduction Since the first pneumonectomy performed by Graham and Singer in 1933 [1], the mortality of this procedure has decreased progressively [2]. The improvements in the surgical technique have contributed significantly to this decrease. Although parallel declines in the incidence of bronchopleural fistula (BPF) have been reported, this complication remains a major concern for the thoracic surgeon with associated high morbidity and mortality rates [3]. Most bronchial stump fistulas appear early after pneumonectomy [3]. One of the promising but clinically challenging areas of therapeutic advances involves the topical application of growth factors to enhance normal healing. A new strategy to better support and promote the wound-healing cascade is to prepare an autologous platelet concentrate suspended in plasma (platelet-rich plasma (PRP)) for application to wound sites in a wide variety of surgeries. The therapeutic effects of PRP are believed to result from the elevated levels of growth factors, for example, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) [4]. Using a porcine model, this study evaluated the feasibility of generating PRP with gravitational platelet separation and investigated the granulation process after application on the bronchial stump. 2.
