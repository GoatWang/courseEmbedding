                    a day. Client transactions are executed on a voice basis, where we specialize in

BTIG Expands Preferred Product Capabilities




Hires Specialist Allen Hassan as Managing Director






April 04, 2011 08:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--BTIG LLC, a global financial services firm specializing in institutional 
      trading and related brokerage services, today announced it has hired 
      industry veteran Allen Hassan as Managing Director on the Preferred 
      Products Desk.
    


      “We have seen increased flows in the preferred market across our diverse 
      client base as investors continue to seek higher yields,” said Robert 
      Langer, Head of the High Yield and Distressed Desk. “Allen brings a 
      unique level of experience in the preferred markets and will be 
      instrumental in BTIG’s growth in this area.”
    

      Hassan joins BTIG from Jefferies & Co., where he started the Preferred 
      Desk in 2003. Prior to that he was with Prudential Securities, where he 
      was instrumental in its preferred business and distribution 
      capabilities. Earlier in his career, Hassan worked in the Fixed Income 
      and Equity Sales at Lehman Brothers. Hassan received a Bachelor of 
      Science from Touro College, where he specialized in Finance.
    

      The addition of Hassan is part of BTIG’s strategy to grow its platform 
      based on client demand and needs, and in areas where it can add superior 
      value and service to its clients.
    

      BTIG’s Preferred Product capabilities complement the firm’s existing 
      equities, fixed income and prime brokerage offerings. The Preferred 
      Products desk is part of BTIG’s Fixed Income Group, which provides 
      expertise and seamless execution across the capital structure for a 
      broad range of institutional investors.

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
