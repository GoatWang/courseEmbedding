Terms and conditionsShow or hide terms and conditions

* Offer begins on May 1, 2017 at 12:01 a.m. (ET) and ends on August 31, 2017 at 11:59 p.m. (ET). Offer only open to Canadian residents who have reached the age of majority, who are not holders or joint holders of a CIBC chequing account. To qualify, open a CIBC Smart™ Account. Next, within 3 calendar months, you must set up and complete within the CIBC Smart™ Account at least one (1) eligible recurring direct deposit OR at least two (2) different eligible recurring pre-authorized debits within the same calendar month. Offer cannot be combined with any other offer, reward or rebate except the CIBC Homeowner® Banking Bundle or the CIBC Smart™ Account fee waiver. The cash reward will be deposited into your CIBC Smart™ Account within 12-14 weeks of your completion of the required transactions. Other conditions apply. For full offer details, see the Terms and conditions (PDF, 44 KB) . 
1 A transaction includes cheques, withdrawals, transfers, pre-authorized payments, bill payments (including CIBC Credit Cards and CIBC Personal Lines of Credit) and debit purchases. For CIBC eAdvantage Savings Accounts, a transaction does not include transfers to your other CIBC bank account(s) using the transfer function on CIBC Online Banking®, CIBC Mobile Banking®, CIBC Telephone Banking and at CIBC ATMs. Additional fee(s) apply to withdrawals from non-CIBC ATMs, Interac e-Transfer transactions and transactions in foreign currency (including cheques written in currencies other than the account currency).
2 The additional $1.50 service fee has been removed for sending Interac e-Transfers®. Each Interac e-Transfer you send counts as a transaction for calculating your monthly fee.
3 “Paperless” record-keeping is a paper-free alternative to printed statements. This option enables clients to track account activity online or by phone or CIBC bank machine. Please note, no printed statements will be sent to clients selecting this option. Clients must review their account transactions through CIBC Online Banking, CIBC Mobile Banking (where available), CIBC Telephone Banking or CIBC bank machines at least once every 30 days and examine all entries and balances at that time. If there are any errors, omissions or irregularities, clients must notify CIBC in writing within 60 days after the date on which the entry was, or should have been, posted to the account.

Changes made across its mutual funds and private pools to enhance investor offering, including new suite of lower-cost passive portfolios 
TORONTO, July 21, 2017 /CNW/ - CIBC (TSX: CM) (NYSE: CM) -- To improve value and accessibility for Canadian investors, CIBC Asset Management Inc. (CAM) is introducing a suite of new, lower-cost CIBC Passive Portfolios. CAM is also making changes to its investment lineup that include management fee reductions, lower investment minimums and a simplified product offering across its mutual funds lineup. 






"Canadians are looking for value and choice when it comes to investment solutions, which is why we made a number of enhancements to our product lineup to improve cost and accessibility," says David Scandiffio, President and CEO, CIBC Asset Management. "The changes announced today are driven by our clients' changing needs." 
CIBC Passive Portfolios 
As part of its commitment to offer diversified solutions to Canadian investors, CAM is launching CIBC Passive Portfolios on July 31, 2017. This new suite of portfolios is competitively priced and has been designed to meet a range of investor risk profiles. These portfolios will be available to regular and fee-based investment accounts, and to self-directed investors with accounts at CIBC Investor's Edge, a division of CIBC Investor Services Inc.
Management fee reductions
To provide additional value to Canadian investors, CAM is implementing management fee reductions of up to 40 basis points (bps) on 18 funds across its mutual fund and private pool lineup effective September 1, 2017. These changes follow management fee reductions implemented in September 2016. 
In addition, CAM will waive a portion of its management fee or absorb certain expenses, or both, on an additional 48 funds (ranging from 5—40 bps) beginning September 1, 2017. The decision to continue to waive management fees or absorb operating expenses is at the discretion of CAM. 
Lower initial investment minimums 
CAM is reducing the minimum initial investment on certain investment solutions. 
The Renaissance Private Investment Program (RPIP) will have a new minimum requirement of $100,000, lowered from $150,000. Families with at least $250,000, previously $500,000, in one or more Renaissance Private Pools will be exempted from the minimum requirement of $100,000 per pool.The minimum initial investment for Axiom Portfolios will be reduced significantly from $25,000 to $500. There are eight Axiom Portfolios, and each managed solution provides diversification by asset class, geographical region, investment style and market capitalization.
The full details of the management fee reductions, and the minimum investment and RPIP changes effective September 1, 2017, can be found here. 
Termination of several mutual fund classes 
To simplify its product offer, CAM is terminating several mutual fund classes with relatively small asset size and a limited number of unitholders. 
Effective end of business day today, classes designated for termination will be closed to new purchases, including purchases through regular investment plans. These classes will subsequently be terminated on or about October 13, 2017. All investors of the terminating classes will be sent a written notice of the termination at least 60 days prior to October 13, 2017.Investors have the right to redeem or switch out of an affected mutual fund class up to the close of business prior to the effective date of termination and will not be required to pay any redemption fees, sales charges or other fees associated with the class termination. 
CAM is also capping several mutual fund classes, which will be closed to new purchases, including through regular investment plans, effective September 1, 2017.
The full details of all mutual fund classes to be terminated and capped can be found here.

History[edit]
The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, as it is known today, came into being in 1961. The bank was formed through the merger of the Canadian Bank of Commerce and the Imperial Bank of Canada. At the time, they were two of Canada's largest banks.
Origins[edit]




Commerce Building (c. 1930), now known as Commerce Court North in Toronto


Main articles: Canadian Bank of Commerce and Imperial Bank of Canada
The Honourable William McMaster founded the Canadian Bank of Commerce which opened on May 15, 1867, in Toronto as competition for the Bank of Montreal; by 1874 it had 24 branches.
The Imperial Bank of Canada opened in Toronto on March 18, 1875, founded by former Commerce Vice-president Henry Stark Howland.
By the end of 1895, the Canadian Bank of Commerce had grown to 58 branches and the Imperial Bank of Canada to 18.
The 1896 gold strike in the Yukon prompted the Dominion Government to ask the Canadian Bank of Commerce to open a branch in Dawson City. Acquisitions in the 1920s caused the Commerce Bank to become one of the strongest branch networks in Canada with over 700 local branches; and the bank opened international branches in Cuba, Jamaica, Barbados and Trinidad during the same period.
Wood, Gundy & Company, the precursor of CIBC's investment banking arm, opened its doors on February 1, 1905. During World War I, it took a prominent and active role in the organization of Victory Loans.
The Canadian Bank of Commerce opened its new head office in Toronto in 1931. An observation gallery on the 32nd floor attracted visitors who could get an aerial view of the city.
In 1936, the Commerce was the first Canadian bank to establish a personal loans department.
Following World War II, both banks opened new branches. Although the banks had been barred from the mortgage business since 1871, the Canadian government now called upon them to provide mortgage services. So, in 1954, Canadian banks started offering mortgages for new construction.
Forming Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce[edit]
In 1960, Imperial chairman Stuart Mackersy approached Neil McKinnon the President of the Commerce with a proposal to merge the two banks. This followed a decade of expansion in the Canadian economy and Canada's capitalization of the industrialization of its natural resources. They quickly reached a deal between the two banks.




The newly merged CIBC commissioned a new logo to commemorate its 100th year of operation. The "chevron" logo was in use until 1994[12]


On June 1, 1961, the Canadian Bank of Commerce and the Imperial Bank of Canada merged to form the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce with over 1,200 branches across Canada. The new bank possessed the greatest resources and the most branches of any bank in the country.
Following the merger, the new bank commissioned a new head office. While planning to retain Commerce Court North, the bank hired architect I. M. Pei to design a three-building complex. The result was Commerce Court consisting of a landscaped courtyard complementing the existing building and included the newly built 786 feet (240 m) Commerce Court West. When completed in 1973, the 57-storey building was the tallest in Canada, and the largest stainless-steel-clad building in the world.
In 1967, both Canada and CIBC celebrated their centenaries and CIBC was the only chartered bank to have a branch on-site at Expo 67. Also at this time computerization began to change banking services and the Yonge and Bloor branch in Toronto was the first Canadian bank branch to update customer bank books via computer. This also marked the introduction of inter-branch banking. Before the decade was out, CIBC had introduced the first 24-hour cash dispenser, which would eventually become the ATM.
Changes to federal and provincial regulations ending the separation of banks, investment dealers, trust companies and insurance companies came in 1987. CIBC quickly took advantage of this and became the first Canadian bank to operate an investment dealer, CIBC Securities, offering services to the public.
In 1988, CIBC acquired a majority interest in Wood Gundy which brought a well-respected name and reputation in underwriting. Shortly thereafter, the corporation merged Wood Gundy and CIBC Securities under the name CIBC Wood Gundy which became CIBC Oppenheimer in 1997[13] and later, CIBC World Markets.
In 1992, CIBC introduced automated telephone banking; in 1995 the bank launched its website, and shortly thereafter began offering banking services online. In 1998, CIBC joined with Loblaws to create President's Choice Financial which it launched in 28 Ottawa area stores.
Present[edit]
CIBC agreed to merge with the Toronto-Dominion Bank in 1998. However the Government of Canada, at the recommendation of then Finance Minister Paul Martin, blocked the merger – as well as another proposed by the Bank of Montreal with the Royal Bank of Canada – as not in the best interest of Canadians.[14]
CIBC sold its corporate and purchasing credit card business to U.S. Bank Canada in October 2006 which joined it with business charge cards it previously acquired from Royal Bank of Canada.
In 2006, the stock ticker symbol on the New York Stock Exchange changed from BCM to CM to bring it in line with the ticker symbol on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
In December 2006, CIBC acquired majority control of its publicly held joint venture FirstCaribbean International Bank for just over US$1 billion, (Bds$2 billion), when it purchased the 43.7% stake owned by Barclays Bank.[15] CIBC rebranded the division CIBC FirstCaribbean International Bank in 2011.[16]
On February 12, 2009, the Trinidad and Tobago Express reported that CIBC was pursuing discussions to buy CL Financial's stake in the Republic Bank of Trinidad and Tobago.[17] As part of a "bail out" agreement of CL Financial by the government of Trinidad and Tobago during the Global financial crisis of 2008–2009, the corporation was required to sell Republic and other assets. As of February 2011, CL Financial had yet to agree to a sale.[18]
In February, 2010 CIBC became the first chartered bank in Canada to launch a mobile banking iPhone App. It surpassed 100,000 downloads in just over one month following launch, with over 1 million client logins to CIBC Mobile Banking since its introduction.[19][20]
Four months later, the bank announced it signed a deal to buy a C$2.1-billion credit card portfolio from Citigroup's Citibank Canada MasterCard business.[21]
Finally in October of that year, CIBC announced that it would be the first bank in Canada to introduce the internationally used Visa-branded debit card.[22]
In April 2013, CIBC reached an agreement with Invesco to acquire Atlantic Trust, the company's wealth management unit for US$210 million.[23]
CIBC announced in June 2016 that it would acquire the Chicago-based commercial bank PrivateBancorp for US$3.8 billion.[24]
In April 2017, it was announced that CIBC would be moving its headquarters to CIBC Square.[25]

Main article: CIBC FirstCaribbean International Bank




CIBC FirstCaribbean branch in Bridgetown, Barbados


In 1920, Canadian Bank of Commerce established its first branches in the West Indies in Bridgetown, Barbados and in Kingston, Jamaica. That same year it also opened branches in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Havana, Cuba. Its first branch in Mexico City opened in 1910. In 1957, the bank opened a branch in Nassau, the Bahamas, and in the subsequent years expanded its operations in Jamaica.
Between 1963 and 1988, the bank expanded its branch network in Barbados opened branches in St. Vincent, Antigua, and St Lucia. In 1988, CIBC sold 45% of its shares in CIBC Jamaica via a public share issue. Between 1993 and 1996, the bank restructured its holdings in the Caribbean, with the incorporation of CIBC West Indies Holdings Limited and CIBC Caribbean Limited. CIBC West Indies Holdings then sold 30% of its shares to the public. In 1997, CIBC issued 5 million shares in CIBC Bahamas Limited to the public.
On October 31, 2001, Barclays and CIBC agreed to combine their Caribbean operations to establish FirstCaribbean International Bank. CIBC bought Barclays' stake in 2006 to give it control of approximately 92% of FirstCaribbean, which was rebranded as CIBC FirstCaribbean International Bank.[16] In 2010, CIBC acquired a 22.5% equity of Butterfield Bank of Bermuda.[27]

Miscellaneous[edit]
Li Ka Shing, Hong Kong billionaire was the largest foreign shareholder in the bank for over two decades, but in early 2005 he sold his portion (est. C$1.2 billion) to establish a Canadian charity, the Li Ka Shing Foundation. CIBC was Mr. Li's choice for financing many of his Canadian ventures, like Husky Energy. Mr. Li had reportedly backed personal and commercial banking head Holger Kluge to succeed Al Flood as CEO of CIBC in 1999.
Corporate governance[edit]
CIBC is well known for its publicized battles of succession to the top position of President and CEO (formerly styled chairman and CEO until 2003 when the positions were separated). When Al Flood became CEO, one of his first acts was to fire his chief rival Paul Cantor. In 1999, the company saw a competition between Wood Gundy (now CIBC World Markets) chief John S. Hunkin and Personal/Commercial banking head Holger Kluge, with Kluge retiring after Hunkin became chairman. In February 2004, Hunkin forced his friend and heir-apparent, David Kassie, to resign as chairman and CEO of World Markets after several scandals in the US. Both men had waived their bonuses in 2002 after that year produced the worst results in the history of the bank. Kassie afterwards founded Genuity Capital and was alleged to have raided 20 key employees from World Markets for his new startup, causing CIBC to file suit.[29] Gerald T. McCaughey became Kassie's replacement heading World Markets and in February 2004, was promoted to President and chief operating officer, assuring his succession as CEO.[30] Shortly after assuming his position, McCaughey reportedly dismissed Jill Denham, Vice Chair of Retail Markets and a potential rival for the CEO post. Denham was reportedly a close ally of Hunkin and Kassie and McCaughey wanted to build his own senior executive team.[31]

Sponsorships[edit]

CIBC partnered with Air Canada in 1991 to offer credit cards as part of the airline's loyalty program, Aeroplan. In 2009, the program announced that a new agreement with Toronto-Dominion Bank would be effective January 1, 2014.[34]

Credit agency ratings[edit]
On October 26, 2012, rating agency Moody's Investors Service announced it would review the long-term ratings of CIBC along with other Canadian banks, because of concerns about consumer debt levels, housing prices, a sizable exposure to capital markets and more. The review resulted in a downgrade from Aa2 to Aa3 on January 28, 2013.[37]
Settlements and controversies[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (August 2010)


Enron[edit]
On December 22, 2003, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) fined CIBC US$80 million for its role in the manipulation of Enron financial statements. This consists of $37.5 million to repay ill-gotten gains, a $37.5 million penalty and $5 million in interest. The money is intended to be returned to Enron fraud victims pursuant to the Fair Fund provisions of Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.[38]
The SEC also sued three of CIBC's executives. CIBC Executive Vice President Daniel Ferguson and former CIBC Executive Director Mark Wolf agreed to settle for US$563,000 and US$60,000, respectively. Ian Schottlaender, former managing director in CIBC's corporate leveraged finance group in New York initially contested the charges[39] but on July 12, 2004 he agreed to pay US$528,750 as well as be barred from serving as an officer or director of a publicly traded company for a period of five years.[40] Under these agreements the individuals neither admit nor deny wrongdoing.
The SEC complaint charges that "CIBC and the three executives with having helped Enron to mislead its investors through a series of complex structured finance transactions over a period of several years preceding Enron's bankruptcy." The agreement reached between the SEC and CIBC permanently enjoins CIBC from violating the antifraud, books and records, and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws.[38][39]
On August 2, 2005, CIBC paid US$2.4 billion to settle a class action lawsuit brought by a group of pension funds and investment managers, including the University of California, which claims that "systematic fraud by Enron and its officers led to the loss of billions and the collapse of the company."[41]
Market timing[edit]
On July 25, 2005 CIBC confirmed it would pay US$125 million to settle an investigation into its role in the 2003 Mutual-fund scandal. Linda Chatman Thomsen, director of the SEC's division of enforcement, said, "by knowingly financing customers' late trading and market timing, as well as providing financing in amounts far greater than the law allows, CIHI and World Markets boosted their customers' trading profits at the expense of long-term mutual fund shareholders."[42] Under the settlement, CIBC neither admitted nor denied the allegations.[43]
Visa cardholders[edit]
On August 27, 2004, CIBC confirmed that it would settle a class-action lawsuit on behalf of CIBC Visa cardholders. The plaintiffs alleged that the conversion of foreign-currency transactions resulted in an undisclosed or inadequately disclosed mark-up. After approval by an Ontario Superior Court judge, CIBC announced October 15, 2004, that the settlement would result in the bank paying C$13.85 million to its cardholders, $1 million to the United Way, $1.65 million to the Class Action Fund of the Law Society of Upper Canada, and $3 million in legal fees. The bank also announced that it has not admitted any liability and is settling to avoid further litigation with its cardholders.[44]
Voluntary refund of erroneous charges[edit]
On May 20, 2004, CIBC announced that it would refund C$24 million to some of its customers as a result of erroneous overdraft and mortgage charges which were discovered in the course of an internal review. "This is being done as part of CIBC's effort to correct its error and to ensure that it distributes to customers all of the money it received in error," the bank said.[45]
In a similar incident, CIBC announced April 27, 2006 that it's refunding an additional C$27 million to about 200,000 clients who were overcharged for certain overdraft fees and other borrowing transactions, some of which date back to 1993. In cases where clients were undercharged, the bank decided not to seek reimbursement.[46]
Privacy[edit]
2005[edit]
On April 18, 2005 the Privacy Commissioner of Canada expressed disappointment in the way CIBC dealt with incidents involving the bank misdirecting faxes containing customers' personal information.[47] One involved misdirecting faxes to a scrap yard operator in West Virginia from 2001 to 2004. The misdirected faxes contained the social security numbers, home addresses, phone numbers, and detailed bank account data of several hundred bank customers.[48]
The second incident involved a Dorval businessman and allegedly took place from 2000 to 2004. In both cases, the commissioner noted that the bank did not inform the affected clients, whose personal information was compromised, until the incidents became public and an investigation was underway.[49]
Within days of reports by CTV News and The Globe and Mail, CIBC management announced a directive that banned employees from using fax machines to transmit any documents containing confidential customer information.[50]
2007[edit]
On January 18, 2007, CIBC Asset Management announced that the personal information of about 470,000 current and former clients of Talvest Mutual Funds, a CIBC subsidiary, had gone missing. The information may have included client names, addresses, signatures, dates of birth, bank account numbers, beneficiary information and/or Social Insurance Numbers.[51] The incident stemmed from the disappearance of a hard drive containing information on "the process used to open and administer" customer accounts as it was traveling between the bank's Montreal and Toronto offices.[52] The Privacy Commissioner of Canada stated, "Although I appreciate that the bank notified us of this incident and that it is working cooperatively with my Office, I am nevertheless deeply troubled, especially given the magnitude of this breach, which puts at risk the personal information of hundreds of thousands of Canadians." She immediately launched a privacy investigation.[53]
Employee overtime[edit]
In June 2007, Dara Fresco, a Toronto teller, named CIBC in a $600 million class-action lawsuit regarding the lack of overtime pay to its customer service staff. Fresco v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce is a class action brought on behalf of current and former non-management, non-unionized employees of CIBC in Canada who are or were tellers or other front-line customer service employees working at CIBC retail branch office across Canada. The lawsuit alleges that class members are assigned heavier workloads than could be completed within their standard working hours. They were required or permitted to work overtime to meet the demands of their jobs and CIBC failed to pay for the overtime work in direct contravention of the Canada Labour Code under which they are regulated.[54]
The Ontario Superior Court dismissed the suit June 18, 2012, stating the evidence '"provides no basis in fact that there is a systemic practice of unpaid overtime at CIBC."'[55]
An employee of the Bank of Nova Scotia (Scotiabank) filed a similar suit which the Superior Court certified. Fresco and Scotiabank each appealed their adverse, and contradictory, rulings and the Ontario Court of Appeal ruled that both cases could proceed.[56]
Both banks appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada which on March 21, 2013, denied their requests and allowed the lawsuits to proceed.[57] The cases are awaiting further action as of late 2013.

History[edit]
The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, as it is known today, came into being in 1961. The bank was formed through the merger of the Canadian Bank of Commerce and the Imperial Bank of Canada. At the time, they were two of Canada's largest banks.
Origins[edit]




Commerce Building (c. 1930), now known as Commerce Court North in Toronto


Main articles: Canadian Bank of Commerce and Imperial Bank of Canada
The Honourable William McMaster founded the Canadian Bank of Commerce which opened on May 15, 1867, in Toronto as competition for the Bank of Montreal; by 1874 it had 24 branches.
The Imperial Bank of Canada opened in Toronto on March 18, 1875, founded by former Commerce Vice-president Henry Stark Howland.
By the end of 1895, the Canadian Bank of Commerce had grown to 58 branches and the Imperial Bank of Canada to 18.
The 1896 gold strike in the Yukon prompted the Dominion Government to ask the Canadian Bank of Commerce to open a branch in Dawson City. Acquisitions in the 1920s caused the Commerce Bank to become one of the strongest branch networks in Canada with over 700 local branches; and the bank opened international branches in Cuba, Jamaica, Barbados and Trinidad during the same period.
Wood, Gundy & Company, the precursor of CIBC's investment banking arm, opened its doors on February 1, 1905. During World War I, it took a prominent and active role in the organization of Victory Loans.
The Canadian Bank of Commerce opened its new head office in Toronto in 1931. An observation gallery on the 32nd floor attracted visitors who could get an aerial view of the city.
In 1936, the Commerce was the first Canadian bank to establish a personal loans department.
Following World War II, both banks opened new branches. Although the banks had been barred from the mortgage business since 1871, the Canadian government now called upon them to provide mortgage services. So, in 1954, Canadian banks started offering mortgages for new construction.
Forming Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce[edit]
In 1960, Imperial chairman Stuart Mackersy approached Neil McKinnon the President of the Commerce with a proposal to merge the two banks. This followed a decade of expansion in the Canadian economy and Canada's capitalization of the industrialization of its natural resources. They quickly reached a deal between the two banks.




The newly merged CIBC commissioned a new logo to commemorate its 100th year of operation. The "chevron" logo was in use until 1994[12]


On June 1, 1961, the Canadian Bank of Commerce and the Imperial Bank of Canada merged to form the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce with over 1,200 branches across Canada. The new bank possessed the greatest resources and the most branches of any bank in the country.
Following the merger, the new bank commissioned a new head office. While planning to retain Commerce Court North, the bank hired architect I. M. Pei to design a three-building complex. The result was Commerce Court consisting of a landscaped courtyard complementing the existing building and included the newly built 786 feet (240 m) Commerce Court West. When completed in 1973, the 57-storey building was the tallest in Canada, and the largest stainless-steel-clad building in the world.
In 1967, both Canada and CIBC celebrated their centenaries and CIBC was the only chartered bank to have a branch on-site at Expo 67. Also at this time computerization began to change banking services and the Yonge and Bloor branch in Toronto was the first Canadian bank branch to update customer bank books via computer. This also marked the introduction of inter-branch banking. Before the decade was out, CIBC had introduced the first 24-hour cash dispenser, which would eventually become the ATM.
Changes to federal and provincial regulations ending the separation of banks, investment dealers, trust companies and insurance companies came in 1987. CIBC quickly took advantage of this and became the first Canadian bank to operate an investment dealer, CIBC Securities, offering services to the public.
In 1988, CIBC acquired a majority interest in Wood Gundy which brought a well-respected name and reputation in underwriting. Shortly thereafter, the corporation merged Wood Gundy and CIBC Securities under the name CIBC Wood Gundy which became CIBC Oppenheimer in 1997[13] and later, CIBC World Markets.
In 1992, CIBC introduced automated telephone banking; in 1995 the bank launched its website, and shortly thereafter began offering banking services online. In 1998, CIBC joined with Loblaws to create President's Choice Financial which it launched in 28 Ottawa area stores.
Present[edit]
CIBC agreed to merge with the Toronto-Dominion Bank in 1998. However the Government of Canada, at the recommendation of then Finance Minister Paul Martin, blocked the merger – as well as another proposed by the Bank of Montreal with the Royal Bank of Canada – as not in the best interest of Canadians.[14]
CIBC sold its corporate and purchasing credit card business to U.S. Bank Canada in October 2006 which joined it with business charge cards it previously acquired from Royal Bank of Canada.
In 2006, the stock ticker symbol on the New York Stock Exchange changed from BCM to CM to bring it in line with the ticker symbol on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
In December 2006, CIBC acquired majority control of its publicly held joint venture FirstCaribbean International Bank for just over US$1 billion, (Bds$2 billion), when it purchased the 43.7% stake owned by Barclays Bank.[15] CIBC rebranded the division CIBC FirstCaribbean International Bank in 2011.[16]
On February 12, 2009, the Trinidad and Tobago Express reported that CIBC was pursuing discussions to buy CL Financial's stake in the Republic Bank of Trinidad and Tobago.[17] As part of a "bail out" agreement of CL Financial by the government of Trinidad and Tobago during the Global financial crisis of 2008–2009, the corporation was required to sell Republic and other assets. As of February 2011, CL Financial had yet to agree to a sale.[18]
In February, 2010 CIBC became the first chartered bank in Canada to launch a mobile banking iPhone App. It surpassed 100,000 downloads in just over one month following launch, with over 1 million client logins to CIBC Mobile Banking since its introduction.[19][20]
Four months later, the bank announced it signed a deal to buy a C$2.1-billion credit card portfolio from Citigroup's Citibank Canada MasterCard business.[21]
Finally in October of that year, CIBC announced that it would be the first bank in Canada to introduce the internationally used Visa-branded debit card.[22]
In April 2013, CIBC reached an agreement with Invesco to acquire Atlantic Trust, the company's wealth management unit for US$210 million.[23]
CIBC announced in June 2016 that it would acquire the Chicago-based commercial bank PrivateBancorp for US$3.8 billion.[24]
In April 2017, it was announced that CIBC would be moving its headquarters to CIBC Square.[25]

Caribbean and the West Indies[edit]
Main article: CIBC FirstCaribbean International Bank




CIBC FirstCaribbean branch in Bridgetown, Barbados


In 1920, Canadian Bank of Commerce established its first branches in the West Indies in Bridgetown, Barbados and in Kingston, Jamaica. That same year it also opened branches in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Havana, Cuba. Its first branch in Mexico City opened in 1910. In 1957, the bank opened a branch in Nassau, the Bahamas, and in the subsequent years expanded its operations in Jamaica.
Between 1963 and 1988, the bank expanded its branch network in Barbados opened branches in St. Vincent, Antigua, and St Lucia. In 1988, CIBC sold 45% of its shares in CIBC Jamaica via a public share issue. Between 1993 and 1996, the bank restructured its holdings in the Caribbean, with the incorporation of CIBC West Indies Holdings Limited and CIBC Caribbean Limited.

On October 31, 2001, Barclays and CIBC agreed to combine their Caribbean operations to establish FirstCaribbean International Bank. CIBC bought Barclays' stake in 2006 to give it control of approximately 92% of FirstCaribbean, which was rebranded as CIBC FirstCaribbean International Bank.[16] In 2010, CIBC acquired a 22.5% equity of Butterfield Bank of Bermuda.[27]

Miscellaneous[edit]
Li Ka Shing, Hong Kong billionaire was the largest foreign shareholder in the bank for over two decades, but in early 2005 he sold his portion (est. C$1.2 billion) to establish a Canadian charity, the Li Ka Shing Foundation. CIBC was Mr. Li's choice for financing many of his Canadian ventures, like Husky Energy. Mr. Li had reportedly backed personal and commercial banking head Holger Kluge to succeed Al Flood as CEO of CIBC in 1999.
Corporate governance[edit]
CIBC is well known for its publicized battles of succession to the top position of President and CEO (formerly styled chairman and CEO until 2003 when the positions were separated). When Al Flood became CEO, one of his first acts was to fire his chief rival Paul Cantor. In 1999, the company saw a competition between Wood Gundy (now CIBC World Markets) chief John S. Hunkin and Personal/Commercial banking head Holger Kluge, with Kluge retiring after Hunkin became chairman. In February 2004, Hunkin forced his friend and heir-apparent, David Kassie, to resign as chairman and CEO of World Markets after several scandals in the US. Both men had waived their bonuses in 2002 after that year produced the worst results in the history of the bank. Kassie afterwards founded Genuity Capital and was alleged to have raided 20 key employees from World Markets for his new startup, causing CIBC to file suit.[29] Gerald T. McCaughey became Kassie's replacement heading World Markets and in February 2004, was promoted to President and chief operating officer, assuring his succession as CEO.[30] Shortly after assuming his position, McCaughey reportedly dismissed Jill Denham, Vice Chair of Retail Markets and a potential rival for the CEO post. Denham was reportedly a close ally of Hunkin and Kassie and McCaughey wanted to build his own senior executive team.[31]

Sponsorships[edit]
As a founding partner of the Toronto Blue Jays baseball club, CIBC was the team's official bank until selling its ownership stake in 2000.[33]
CIBC partnered with Air Canada in 1991 to offer credit cards as part of the airline's loyalty program, Aeroplan. In 2009, the program announced that a new agreement with Toronto-Dominion Bank would be effective January 1, 2014.[34]
As part of its purchase of MasterCard from Citibank Canada in 2010, CIBC acquired the co-branded Petro-Canada rewards credit card and continues to jointly market the card.[21]
On October 27, 2011, CIBC announced a partnership with the PANAM Toronto 2015 Organizing Committee to become lead partner of the 2015 Pan American Games and 2015 Parapan American Games[35]
CIBC is an industry partner of the University of Waterloo Stratford Campus.[36]
Credit agency ratings[edit]
On October 26, 2012, rating agency Moody's Investors Service announced it would review the long-term ratings of CIBC along with other Canadian banks, because of concerns about consumer debt levels, housing prices, a sizable exposure to capital markets and more. The review resulted in a downgrade from Aa2 to Aa3 on January 28, 2013.[37]
Settlements and controversies[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (August 2010)


Enron[edit]
On December 22, 2003, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) fined CIBC US$80 million for its role in the manipulation of Enron financial statements. This consists of $37.5 million to repay ill-gotten gains, a $37.5 million penalty and $5 million in interest. The money is intended to be returned to Enron fraud victims pursuant to the Fair Fund provisions of Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.[38]
The SEC also sued three of CIBC's executives. CIBC Executive Vice President Daniel Ferguson and former CIBC Executive Director Mark Wolf agreed to settle for US$563,000 and US$60,000, respectively. Ian Schottlaender, former managing director in CIBC's corporate leveraged finance group in New York initially contested the charges[39] but on July 12, 2004 he agreed to pay US$528,750 as well as be barred from serving as an officer or director of a publicly traded company for a period of five years.[40] Under these agreements the individuals neither admit nor deny wrongdoing.
The SEC complaint charges that "CIBC and the three executives with having helped Enron to mislead its investors through a series of complex structured finance transactions over a period of several years preceding Enron's bankruptcy." The agreement reached between the SEC and CIBC permanently enjoins CIBC from violating the antifraud, books and records, and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws.[38][39]
On August 2, 2005, CIBC paid US$2.4 billion to settle a class action lawsuit brought by a group of pension funds and investment managers, including the University of California, which claims that "systematic fraud by Enron and its officers led to the loss of billions and the collapse of the company."[41]
Market timing[edit]
On July 25, 2005 CIBC confirmed it would pay US$125 million to settle an investigation into its role in the 2003 Mutual-fund scandal. Linda Chatman Thomsen, director of the SEC's division of enforcement, said, "by knowingly financing customers' late trading and market timing, as well as providing financing in amounts far greater than the law allows, CIHI and World Markets boosted their customers' trading profits at the expense of long-term mutual fund shareholders."[42] Under the settlement, CIBC neither admitted nor denied the allegations.[43]
Visa cardholders[edit]
On August 27, 2004, CIBC confirmed that it would settle a class-action lawsuit on behalf of CIBC Visa cardholders. The plaintiffs alleged that the conversion of foreign-currency transactions resulted in an undisclosed or inadequately disclosed mark-up. After approval by an Ontario Superior Court judge, CIBC announced October 15, 2004, that the settlement would result in the bank paying C$13.85 million to its cardholders, $1 million to the United Way, $1.65 million to the Class Action Fund of the Law Society of Upper Canada, and $3 million in legal fees. The bank also announced that it has not admitted any liability and is settling to avoid further litigation with its cardholders.[44]
Voluntary refund of erroneous charges[edit]
On May 20, 2004, CIBC announced that it would refund C$24 million to some of its customers as a result of erroneous overdraft and mortgage charges which were discovered in the course of an internal review. "This is being done as part of CIBC's effort to correct its error and to ensure that it distributes to customers all of the money it received in error," the bank said.[45]
In a similar incident, CIBC announced April 27, 2006 that it's refunding an additional C$27 million to about 200,000 clients who were overcharged for certain overdraft fees and other borrowing transactions, some of which date back to 1993. In cases where clients were undercharged, the bank decided not to seek reimbursement.[46]
Privacy[edit]
2005[edit]
On April 18, 2005 the Privacy Commissioner of Canada expressed disappointment in the way CIBC dealt with incidents involving the bank misdirecting faxes containing customers' personal information.[47] One involved misdirecting faxes to a scrap yard operator in West Virginia from 2001 to 2004. The misdirected faxes contained the social security numbers, home addresses, phone numbers, and detailed bank account data of several hundred bank customers.[48]
The second incident involved a Dorval businessman and allegedly took place from 2000 to 2004. In both cases, the commissioner noted that the bank did not inform the affected clients, whose personal information was compromised, until the incidents became public and an investigation was underway.[49]
Within days of reports by CTV News and The Globe and Mail, CIBC management announced a directive that banned employees from using fax machines to transmit any documents containing confidential customer information.[50]
2007[edit]
On January 18, 2007, CIBC Asset Management announced that the personal information of about 470,000 current and former clients of Talvest Mutual Funds, a CIBC subsidiary, had gone missing. The information may have included client names, addresses, signatures, dates of birth, bank account numbers, beneficiary information and/or Social Insurance Numbers.[51] The incident stemmed from the disappearance of a hard drive containing information on "the process used to open and administer" customer accounts as it was traveling between the bank's Montreal and Toronto offices.[52] The Privacy Commissioner of Canada stated, "Although I appreciate that the bank notified us of this incident and that it is working cooperatively with my Office, I am nevertheless deeply troubled, especially given the magnitude of this breach, which puts at risk the personal information of hundreds of thousands of Canadians." She immediately launched a privacy investigation.[53]
Employee overtime[edit]
In June 2007, Dara Fresco, a Toronto teller, named CIBC in a $600 million class-action lawsuit regarding the lack of overtime pay to its customer service staff. Fresco v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce is a class action brought on behalf of current and former non-management, non-unionized employees of CIBC in Canada who are or were tellers or other front-line customer service employees working at CIBC retail branch office across Canada. The lawsuit alleges that class members are assigned heavier workloads than could be completed within their standard working hours. They were required or permitted to work overtime to meet the demands of their jobs and CIBC failed to pay for the overtime work in direct contravention of the Canada Labour Code under which they are regulated.[54]
The Ontario Superior Court dismissed the suit June 18, 2012, stating the evidence '"provides no basis in fact that there is a systemic practice of unpaid overtime at CIBC."'[55]
An employee of the Bank of Nova Scotia (Scotiabank) filed a similar suit which the Superior Court certified. Fresco and Scotiabank each appealed their adverse, and contradictory, rulings and the Ontario Court of Appeal ruled that both cases could proceed.[56]
Both banks appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada which on March 21, 2013, denied their requests and allowed the lawsuits to proceed.[57] The cases are awaiting further action as of late 2013.

History[edit]
The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, as it is known today, came into being in 1961. The bank was formed through the merger of the Canadian Bank of Commerce and the Imperial Bank of Canada. At the time, they were two of Canada's largest banks.
Origins[edit]




Commerce Building (c. 1930), now known as Commerce Court North in Toronto


Main articles: Canadian Bank of Commerce and Imperial Bank of Canada
The Honourable William McMaster founded the Canadian Bank of Commerce which opened on May 15, 1867, in Toronto as competition for the Bank of Montreal; by 1874 it had 24 branches.
The Imperial Bank of Canada opened in Toronto on March 18, 1875, founded by former Commerce Vice-president Henry Stark Howland.
By the end of 1895, the Canadian Bank of Commerce had grown to 58 branches and the Imperial Bank of Canada to 18.
The 1896 gold strike in the Yukon prompted the Dominion Government to ask the Canadian Bank of Commerce to open a branch in Dawson City. Acquisitions in the 1920s caused the Commerce Bank to become one of the strongest branch networks in Canada with over 700 local branches; and the bank opened international branches in Cuba, Jamaica, Barbados and Trinidad during the same period.
Wood, Gundy & Company, the precursor of CIBC's investment banking arm, opened its doors on February 1, 1905. During World War I, it took a prominent and active role in the organization of Victory Loans.
The Canadian Bank of Commerce opened its new head office in Toronto in 1931. An observation gallery on the 32nd floor attracted visitors who could get an aerial view of the city.
In 1936, the Commerce was the first Canadian bank to establish a personal loans department.
Following World War II, both banks opened new branches. Although the banks had been barred from the mortgage business since 1871, the Canadian government now called upon them to provide mortgage services. So, in 1954, Canadian banks started offering mortgages for new construction.
Forming Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce[edit]
In 1960, Imperial chairman Stuart Mackersy approached Neil McKinnon the President of the Commerce with a proposal to merge the two banks. This followed a decade of expansion in the Canadian economy and Canada's capitalization of the industrialization of its natural resources. They quickly reached a deal between the two banks.




The newly merged CIBC commissioned a new logo to commemorate its 100th year of operation. The "chevron" logo was in use until 1994[12]


On June 1, 1961, the Canadian Bank of Commerce and the Imperial Bank of Canada merged to form the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce with over 1,200 branches across Canada. The new bank possessed the greatest resources and the most branches of any bank in the country.
Following the merger, the new bank commissioned a new head office. While planning to retain Commerce Court North, the bank hired architect I. M. Pei to design a three-building complex. The result was Commerce Court consisting of a landscaped courtyard complementing the existing building and included the newly built 786 feet (240 m) Commerce Court West. When completed in 1973, the 57-storey building was the tallest in Canada, and the largest stainless-steel-clad building in the world.
In 1967, both Canada and CIBC celebrated their centenaries and CIBC was the only chartered bank to have a branch on-site at Expo 67. Also at this time computerization began to change banking services and the Yonge and Bloor branch in Toronto was the first Canadian bank branch to update customer bank books via computer. This also marked the introduction of inter-branch banking. Before the decade was out, CIBC had introduced the first 24-hour cash dispenser, which would eventually become the ATM.
Changes to federal and provincial regulations ending the separation of banks, investment dealers, trust companies and insurance companies came in 1987. CIBC quickly took advantage of this and became the first Canadian bank to operate an investment dealer, CIBC Securities, offering services to the public.
In 1988, CIBC acquired a majority interest in Wood Gundy which brought a well-respected name and reputation in underwriting. Shortly thereafter, the corporation merged Wood Gundy and CIBC Securities under the name CIBC Wood Gundy which became CIBC Oppenheimer in 1997[13] and later, CIBC World Markets.
In 1992, CIBC introduced automated telephone banking; in 1995 the bank launched its website, and shortly thereafter began offering banking services online. In 1998, CIBC joined with Loblaws to create President's Choice Financial which it launched in 28 Ottawa area stores.
Present[edit]
CIBC agreed to merge with the Toronto-Dominion Bank in 1998. However the Government of Canada, at the recommendation of then Finance Minister Paul Martin, blocked the merger – as well as another proposed by the Bank of Montreal with the Royal Bank of Canada – as not in the best interest of Canadians.[14]
CIBC sold its corporate and purchasing credit card business to U.S. Bank Canada in October 2006 which joined it with business charge cards it previously acquired from Royal Bank of Canada.
In 2006, the stock ticker symbol on the New York Stock Exchange changed from BCM to CM to bring it in line with the ticker symbol on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
In December 2006, CIBC acquired majority control of its publicly held joint venture FirstCaribbean International Bank for just over US$1 billion, (Bds$2 billion), when it purchased the 43.7% stake owned by Barclays Bank.[15] CIBC rebranded the division CIBC FirstCaribbean International Bank in 2011.[16]
On February 12, 2009, the Trinidad and Tobago Express reported that CIBC was pursuing discussions to buy CL Financial's stake in the Republic Bank of Trinidad and Tobago.[17] As part of a "bail out" agreement of CL Financial by the government of Trinidad and Tobago during the Global financial crisis of 2008–2009, the corporation was required to sell Republic and other assets. As of February 2011, CL Financial had yet to agree to a sale.[18]
In February, 2010 CIBC became the first chartered bank in Canada to launch a mobile banking iPhone App. It surpassed 100,000 downloads in just over one month following launch, with over 1 million client logins to CIBC Mobile Banking since its introduction.[19][20]
Four months later, the bank announced it signed a deal to buy a C$2.1-billion credit card portfolio from Citigroup's Citibank Canada MasterCard business.[21]
Finally in October of that year, CIBC announced that it would be the first bank in Canada to introduce the internationally used Visa-branded debit card.[22]
In April 2013, CIBC reached an agreement with Invesco to acquire Atlantic Trust, the company's wealth management unit for US$210 million.[23]
CIBC announced in June 2016 that it would acquire the Chicago-based commercial bank PrivateBancorp for US$3.8 billion.[24]
In April 2017, it was announced that CIBC would be moving its headquarters to CIBC Square.[25]

Caribbean and the West Indies[edit]
Main article: CIBC FirstCaribbean International Bank




CIBC FirstCaribbean branch in Bridgetown, Barbados


In 1920, Canadian Bank of Commerce established its first branches in the West Indies in Bridgetown, Barbados and in Kingston, Jamaica. That same year it also opened branches in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Havana, Cuba. Its first branch in Mexico City opened in 1910. In 1957, the bank opened a branch in Nassau, the Bahamas, and in the subsequent years expanded its operations in Jamaica.
Between 1963 and 1988, the bank expanded its branch network in Barbados opened branches in St. Vincent, Antigua, and St Lucia. In 1988, CIBC sold 45% of its shares in CIBC Jamaica via a public share issue. Between 1993 and 1996, the bank restructured its holdings in the Caribbean, with the incorporation of CIBC West Indies Holdings Limited and CIBC Caribbean Limited. CIBC West Indies Holdings then sold 30% of its shares to the public. In 1997, CIBC issued 5 million shares in CIBC Bahamas Limited to the public.
On October 31, 2001, Barclays and CIBC agreed to combine their Caribbean operations to establish FirstCaribbean International Bank. CIBC bought Barclays' stake in 2006 to give it control of approximately 92% of FirstCaribbean, which was rebranded as CIBC FirstCaribbean International Bank.[16] In 2010, CIBC acquired a 22.5% equity of Butterfield Bank of Bermuda.[27]

Miscellaneous[edit]
Li Ka Shing, Hong Kong billionaire was the largest foreign shareholder in the bank for over two decades, but in early 2005 he sold his portion (est. C$1.2 billion) to establish a Canadian charity, the Li Ka Shing Foundation. CIBC was Mr. Li's choice for financing many of his Canadian ventures, like Husky Energy. Mr. Li had reportedly backed personal and commercial banking head Holger Kluge to succeed Al Flood as CEO of CIBC in 1999.
Corporate governance[edit]
CIBC is well known for its publicized battles of succession to the top position of President and CEO (formerly styled chairman and CEO until 2003 when the positions were separated). When Al Flood became CEO, one of his first acts was to fire his chief rival Paul Cantor. In 1999, the company saw a competition between Wood Gundy (now CIBC World Markets) chief John S. Hunkin and Personal/Commercial banking head Holger Kluge, with Kluge retiring after Hunkin became chairman. In February 2004, Hunkin forced his friend and heir-apparent, David Kassie, to resign as chairman and CEO of World Markets after several scandals in the US. Both men had waived their bonuses in 2002 after that year produced the worst results in the history of the bank. Kassie afterwards founded Genuity Capital and was alleged to have raided 20 key employees from World Markets for his new startup, causing CIBC to file suit.[29] Gerald T. McCaughey became Kassie's replacement heading World Markets and in February 2004, was promoted to President and chief operating officer, assuring his succession as CEO.[30] Shortly after assuming his position, McCaughey reportedly dismissed Jill Denham, Vice Chair of Retail Markets and a potential rival for the CEO post. Denham was reportedly a close ally of Hunkin and Kassie and McCaughey wanted to build his own senior executive team.[31]

Sponsorships[edit]

CIBC partnered with Air Canada in 1991 to offer credit cards as part of the airline's loyalty program, Aeroplan. In 2009, the program announced that a new agreement with Toronto-Dominion Bank would be effective January 1, 2014.[34]

Credit agency ratings[edit]
On October 26, 2012, rating agency Moody's Investors Service announced it would review the long-term ratings of CIBC along with other Canadian banks, because of concerns about consumer debt levels, housing prices, a sizable exposure to capital markets and more. The review resulted in a downgrade from Aa2 to Aa3 on January 28, 2013.[37]
Settlements and controversies[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (August 2010)


Enron[edit]
On December 22, 2003, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) fined CIBC US$80 million for its role in the manipulation of Enron financial statements. This consists of $37.5 million to repay ill-gotten gains, a $37.5 million penalty and $5 million in interest. The money is intended to be returned to Enron fraud victims pursuant to the Fair Fund provisions of Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.[38]
The SEC also sued three of CIBC's executives. CIBC Executive Vice President Daniel Ferguson and former CIBC Executive Director Mark Wolf agreed to settle for US$563,000 and US$60,000, respectively. Ian Schottlaender, former managing director in CIBC's corporate leveraged finance group in New York initially contested the charges[39] but on July 12, 2004 he agreed to pay US$528,750 as well as be barred from serving as an officer or director of a publicly traded company for a period of five years.[40] Under these agreements the individuals neither admit nor deny wrongdoing.
The SEC complaint charges that "CIBC and the three executives with having helped Enron to mislead its investors through a series of complex structured finance transactions over a period of several years preceding Enron's bankruptcy." The agreement reached between the SEC and CIBC permanently enjoins CIBC from violating the antifraud, books and records, and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws.[38][39]
On August 2, 2005, CIBC paid US$2.4 billion to settle a class action lawsuit brought by a group of pension funds and investment managers, including the University of California, which claims that "systematic fraud by Enron and its officers led to the loss of billions and the collapse of the company."[41]
Market timing[edit]
On July 25, 2005 CIBC confirmed it would pay US$125 million to settle an investigation into its role in the 2003 Mutual-fund scandal. Linda Chatman Thomsen, director of the SEC's division of enforcement, said, "by knowingly financing customers' late trading and market timing, as well as providing financing in amounts far greater than the law allows, CIHI and World Markets boosted their customers' trading profits at the expense of long-term mutual fund shareholders."[42] Under the settlement, CIBC neither admitted nor denied the allegations.[43]
Visa cardholders[edit]
On August 27, 2004, CIBC confirmed that it would settle a class-action lawsuit on behalf of CIBC Visa cardholders. The plaintiffs alleged that the conversion of foreign-currency transactions resulted in an undisclosed or inadequately disclosed mark-up. After approval by an Ontario Superior Court judge, CIBC announced October 15, 2004, that the settlement would result in the bank paying C$13.85 million to its cardholders, $1 million to the United Way, $1.65 million to the Class Action Fund of the Law Society of Upper Canada, and $3 million in legal fees. The bank also announced that it has not admitted any liability and is settling to avoid further litigation with its cardholders.[44]
Voluntary refund of erroneous charges[edit]
On May 20, 2004, CIBC announced that it would refund C$24 million to some of its customers as a result of erroneous overdraft and mortgage charges which were discovered in the course of an internal review. "This is being done as part of CIBC's effort to correct its error and to ensure that it distributes to customers all of the money it received in error," the bank said.[45]
In a similar incident, CIBC announced April 27, 2006 that it's refunding an additional C$27 million to about 200,000 clients who were overcharged for certain overdraft fees and other borrowing transactions, some of which date back to 1993. In cases where clients were undercharged, the bank decided not to seek reimbursement.[46]
Privacy[edit]
2005[edit]
On April 18, 2005 the Privacy Commissioner of Canada expressed disappointment in the way CIBC dealt with incidents involving the bank misdirecting faxes containing customers' personal information.[47] One involved misdirecting faxes to a scrap yard operator in West Virginia from 2001 to 2004. The misdirected faxes contained the social security numbers, home addresses, phone numbers, and detailed bank account data of several hundred bank customers.[48]
The second incident involved a Dorval businessman and allegedly took place from 2000 to 2004. In both cases, the commissioner noted that the bank did not inform the affected clients, whose personal information was compromised, until the incidents became public and an investigation was underway.[49]
Within days of reports by CTV News and The Globe and Mail, CIBC management announced a directive that banned employees from using fax machines to transmit any documents containing confidential customer information.[50]
2007[edit]
On January 18, 2007, CIBC Asset Management announced that the personal information of about 470,000 current and former clients of Talvest Mutual Funds, a CIBC subsidiary, had gone missing. The information may have included client names, addresses, signatures, dates of birth, bank account numbers, beneficiary information and/or Social Insurance Numbers.[51] The incident stemmed from the disappearance of a hard drive containing information on "the process used to open and administer" customer accounts as it was traveling between the bank's Montreal and Toronto offices.[52] The Privacy Commissioner of Canada stated, "Although I appreciate that the bank notified us of this incident and that it is working cooperatively with my Office, I am nevertheless deeply troubled, especially given the magnitude of this breach, which puts at risk the personal information of hundreds of thousands of Canadians." She immediately launched a privacy investigation.[53]
Employee overtime[edit]
In June 2007, Dara Fresco, a Toronto teller, named CIBC in a $600 million class-action lawsuit regarding the lack of overtime pay to its customer service staff. Fresco v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce is a class action brought on behalf of current and former non-management, non-unionized employees of CIBC in Canada who are or were tellers or other front-line customer service employees working at CIBC retail branch office across Canada. The lawsuit alleges that class members are assigned heavier workloads than could be completed within their standard working hours. They were required or permitted to work overtime to meet the demands of their jobs and CIBC failed to pay for the overtime work in direct contravention of the Canada Labour Code under which they are regulated.[54]
The Ontario Superior Court dismissed the suit June 18, 2012, stating the evidence '"provides no basis in fact that there is a systemic practice of unpaid overtime at CIBC."'[55]
An employee of the Bank of Nova Scotia (Scotiabank) filed a similar suit which the Superior Court certified. Fresco and Scotiabank each appealed their adverse, and contradictory, rulings and the Ontario Court of Appeal ruled that both cases could proceed.[56]
Both banks appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada which on March 21, 2013, denied their requests and allowed the lawsuits to proceed.[57] The cases are awaiting further action as of late 2013.

History[edit]
The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, as it is known today, came into being in 1961. The bank was formed through the merger of the Canadian Bank of Commerce and the Imperial Bank of Canada. At the time, they were two of Canada's largest banks.
Origins[edit]




Commerce Building (c. 1930), now known as Commerce Court North in Toronto


Main articles: Canadian Bank of Commerce and Imperial Bank of Canada
The Honourable William McMaster founded the Canadian Bank of Commerce which opened on May 15, 1867, in Toronto as competition for the Bank of Montreal; by 1874 it had 24 branches.
The Imperial Bank of Canada opened in Toronto on March 18, 1875, founded by former Commerce Vice-president Henry Stark Howland.
By the end of 1895, the Canadian Bank of Commerce had grown to 58 branches and the Imperial Bank of Canada to 18.
The 1896 gold strike in the Yukon prompted the Dominion Government to ask the Canadian Bank of Commerce to open a branch in Dawson City. Acquisitions in the 1920s caused the Commerce Bank to become one of the strongest branch networks in Canada with over 700 local branches; and the bank opened international branches in Cuba, Jamaica, Barbados and Trinidad during the same period.
Wood, Gundy & Company, the precursor of CIBC's investment banking arm, opened its doors on February 1, 1905. During World War I, it took a prominent and active role in the organization of Victory Loans.
The Canadian Bank of Commerce opened its new head office in Toronto in 1931. An observation gallery on the 32nd floor attracted visitors who could get an aerial view of the city.
In 1936, the Commerce was the first Canadian bank to establish a personal loans department.
Following World War II, both banks opened new branches. Although the banks had been barred from the mortgage business since 1871, the Canadian government now called upon them to provide mortgage services. So, in 1954, Canadian banks started offering mortgages for new construction.
Forming Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce[edit]
In 1960, Imperial chairman Stuart Mackersy approached Neil McKinnon the President of the Commerce with a proposal to merge the two banks. This followed a decade of expansion in the Canadian economy and Canada's capitalization of the industrialization of its natural resources. They quickly reached a deal between the two banks.




The newly merged CIBC commissioned a new logo to commemorate its 100th year of operation. The "chevron" logo was in use until 1994[12]


On June 1, 1961, the Canadian Bank of Commerce and the Imperial Bank of Canada merged to form the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce with over 1,200 branches across Canada. The new bank possessed the greatest resources and the most branches of any bank in the country.
Following the merger, the new bank commissioned a new head office. While planning to retain Commerce Court North, the bank hired architect I. M. Pei to design a three-building complex. The result was Commerce Court consisting of a landscaped courtyard complementing the existing building and included the newly built 786 feet (240 m) Commerce Court West. When completed in 1973, the 57-storey building was the tallest in Canada, and the largest stainless-steel-clad building in the world.
In 1967, both Canada and CIBC celebrated their centenaries and CIBC was the only chartered bank to have a branch on-site at Expo 67. Also at this time computerization began to change banking services and the Yonge and Bloor branch in Toronto was the first Canadian bank branch to update customer bank books via computer. This also marked the introduction of inter-branch banking. Before the decade was out, CIBC had introduced the first 24-hour cash dispenser, which would eventually become the ATM.
Changes to federal and provincial regulations ending the separation of banks, investment dealers, trust companies and insurance companies came in 1987. CIBC quickly took advantage of this and became the first Canadian bank to operate an investment dealer, CIBC Securities, offering services to the public.
In 1988, CIBC acquired a majority interest in Wood Gundy which brought a well-respected name and reputation in underwriting. Shortly thereafter, the corporation merged Wood Gundy and CIBC Securities under the name CIBC Wood Gundy which became CIBC Oppenheimer in 1997[13] and later, CIBC World Markets.
In 1992, CIBC introduced automated telephone banking; in 1995 the bank launched its website, and shortly thereafter began offering banking services online. In 1998, CIBC joined with Loblaws to create President's Choice Financial which it launched in 28 Ottawa area stores.
Present[edit]
CIBC agreed to merge with the Toronto-Dominion Bank in 1998. However the Government of Canada, at the recommendation of then Finance Minister Paul Martin, blocked the merger – as well as another proposed by the Bank of Montreal with the Royal Bank of Canada – as not in the best interest of Canadians.[14]
CIBC sold its corporate and purchasing credit card business to U.S. Bank Canada in October 2006 which joined it with business charge cards it previously acquired from Royal Bank of Canada.
In 2006, the stock ticker symbol on the New York Stock Exchange changed from BCM to CM to bring it in line with the ticker symbol on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
In December 2006, CIBC acquired majority control of its publicly held joint venture FirstCaribbean International Bank for just over US$1 billion, (Bds$2 billion), when it purchased the 43.7% stake owned by Barclays Bank.[15] CIBC rebranded the division CIBC FirstCaribbean International Bank in 2011.[16]
On February 12, 2009, the Trinidad and Tobago Express reported that CIBC was pursuing discussions to buy CL Financial's stake in the Republic Bank of Trinidad and Tobago.[17] As part of a "bail out" agreement of CL Financial by the government of Trinidad and Tobago during the Global financial crisis of 2008–2009, the corporation was required to sell Republic and other assets. As of February 2011, CL Financial had yet to agree to a sale.[18]
In February, 2010 CIBC became the first chartered bank in Canada to launch a mobile banking iPhone App. It surpassed 100,000 downloads in just over one month following launch, with over 1 million client logins to CIBC Mobile Banking since its introduction.[19][20]
Four months later, the bank announced it signed a deal to buy a C$2.1-billion credit card portfolio from Citigroup's Citibank Canada MasterCard business.[21]
Finally in October of that year, CIBC announced that it would be the first bank in Canada to introduce the internationally used Visa-branded debit card.[22]
In April 2013, CIBC reached an agreement with Invesco to acquire Atlantic Trust, the company's wealth management unit for US$210 million.[23]
CIBC announced in June 2016 that it would acquire the Chicago-based commercial bank PrivateBancorp for US$3.8 billion.[24]
In April 2017, it was announced that CIBC would be moving its headquarters to CIBC Square.[25]

Caribbean and the West Indies[edit]
Main article: CIBC FirstCaribbean International Bank




CIBC FirstCaribbean branch in Bridgetown, Barbados


In 1920, Canadian Bank of Commerce established its first branches in the West Indies in Bridgetown, Barbados and in Kingston, Jamaica. That same year it also opened branches in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Havana, Cuba. Its first branch in Mexico City opened in 1910. In 1957, the bank opened a branch in Nassau, the Bahamas, and in the subsequent years expanded its operations in Jamaica.
Between 1963 and 1988, the bank expanded its branch network in Barbados opened branches in St. Vincent, Antigua, and St Lucia. In 1988, CIBC sold 45% of its shares in CIBC Jamaica via a public share issue. Between 1993 and 1996, the bank restructured its holdings in the Caribbean, with the incorporation of CIBC West Indies Holdings Limited and CIBC Caribbean Limited. CIBC West Indies Holdings then sold 30% of its shares to the public. In 1997, CIBC issued 5 million shares in CIBC Bahamas Limited to the public.
On October 31, 2001, Barclays and CIBC agreed to combine their Caribbean operations to establish FirstCaribbean International Bank. CIBC bought Barclays' stake in 2006 to give it control of approximately 92% of FirstCaribbean, which was rebranded as CIBC FirstCaribbean International Bank.[16] In 2010, CIBC acquired a 22.5% equity of Butterfield Bank of Bermuda.[27]

Miscellaneous[edit]
Li Ka Shing, Hong Kong billionaire was the largest foreign shareholder in the bank for over two decades, but in early 2005 he sold his portion (est. C$1.2 billion) to establish a Canadian charity, the Li Ka Shing Foundation. CIBC was Mr. Li's choice for financing many of his Canadian ventures, like Husky Energy. Mr. Li had reportedly backed personal and commercial banking head Holger Kluge to succeed Al Flood as CEO of CIBC in 1999.
Corporate governance[edit]
CIBC is well known for its publicized battles of succession to the top position of President and CEO (formerly styled chairman and CEO until 2003 when the positions were separated). When Al Flood became CEO, one of his first acts was to fire his chief rival Paul Cantor. In 1999, the company saw a competition between Wood Gundy (now CIBC World Markets) chief John S. Hunkin and Personal/Commercial banking head Holger Kluge, with Kluge retiring after Hunkin became chairman. In February 2004, Hunkin forced his friend and heir-apparent, David Kassie, to resign as chairman and CEO of World Markets after several scandals in the US. Both men had waived their bonuses in 2002 after that year produced the worst results in the history of the bank. Kassie afterwards founded Genuity Capital and was alleged to have raided 20 key employees from World Markets for his new startup, causing CIBC to file suit.[29] Gerald T. McCaughey became Kassie's replacement heading World Markets and in February 2004, was promoted to President and chief operating officer, assuring his succession as CEO.[30] Shortly after assuming his position, McCaughey reportedly dismissed Jill Denham, Vice Chair of Retail Markets and a potential rival for the CEO post. Denham was reportedly a close ally of Hunkin and Kassie and McCaughey wanted to build his own senior executive team.[31]

CIBC partnered with Air Canada in 1991 to offer credit cards as part of the airline's loyalty program, Aeroplan. In 2009, the program announced that a new agreement with Toronto-Dominion Bank would be effective January 1, 2014.[34]
As part of its purchase of MasterCard from Citibank Canada in 2010, CIBC acquired the co-branded Petro-Canada rewards credit card and continues to jointly market the card.[21]
On October 27, 2011, CIBC announced a partnership with the PANAM Toronto 2015 Organizing Committee to become lead partner of the 2015 Pan American Games and 2015 Parapan American Games[35]
CIBC is an industry partner of the University of Waterloo Stratford Campus.[36]
Credit agency ratings[edit]
On October 26, 2012, rating agency Moody's Investors Service announced it would review the long-term ratings of CIBC along with other Canadian banks, because of concerns about consumer debt levels, housing prices, a sizable exposure to capital markets and more. The review resulted in a downgrade from Aa2 to Aa3 on January 28, 2013.[37]
Settlements and controversies[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (August 2010)


Enron[edit]
On December 22, 2003, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) fined CIBC US$80 million for its role in the manipulation of Enron financial statements. This consists of $37.5 million to repay ill-gotten gains, a $37.5 million penalty and $5 million in interest. The money is intended to be returned to Enron fraud victims pursuant to the Fair Fund provisions of Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.[38]
The SEC also sued three of CIBC's executives. CIBC Executive Vice President Daniel Ferguson and former CIBC Executive Director Mark Wolf agreed to settle for US$563,000 and US$60,000, respectively. Ian Schottlaender, former managing director in CIBC's corporate leveraged finance group in New York initially contested the charges[39] but on July 12, 2004 he agreed to pay US$528,750 as well as be barred from serving as an officer or director of a publicly traded company for a period of five years.[40] Under these agreements the individuals neither admit nor deny wrongdoing.
The SEC complaint charges that "CIBC and the three executives with having helped Enron to mislead its investors through a series of complex structured finance transactions over a period of several years preceding Enron's bankruptcy." The agreement reached between the SEC and CIBC permanently enjoins CIBC from violating the antifraud, books and records, and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws.[38][39]
On August 2, 2005, CIBC paid US$2.4 billion to settle a class action lawsuit brought by a group of pension funds and investment managers, including the University of California, which claims that "systematic fraud by Enron and its officers led to the loss of billions and the collapse of the company."[41]
Market timing[edit]
On July 25, 2005 CIBC confirmed it would pay US$125 million to settle an investigation into its role in the 2003 Mutual-fund scandal. Linda Chatman Thomsen, director of the SEC's division of enforcement, said, "by knowingly financing customers' late trading and market timing, as well as providing financing in amounts far greater than the law allows, CIHI and World Markets boosted their customers' trading profits at the expense of long-term mutual fund shareholders."[42] Under the settlement, CIBC neither admitted nor denied the allegations.[43]
Visa cardholders[edit]
On August 27, 2004, CIBC confirmed that it would settle a class-action lawsuit on behalf of CIBC Visa cardholders. The plaintiffs alleged that the conversion of foreign-currency transactions resulted in an undisclosed or inadequately disclosed mark-up. After approval by an Ontario Superior Court judge, CIBC announced October 15, 2004, that the settlement would result in the bank paying C$13.85 million to its cardholders, $1 million to the United Way, $1.65 million to the Class Action Fund of the Law Society of Upper Canada, and $3 million in legal fees. The bank also announced that it has not admitted any liability and is settling to avoid further litigation with its cardholders.[44]
Voluntary refund of erroneous charges[edit]
On May 20, 2004, CIBC announced that it would refund C$24 million to some of its customers as a result of erroneous overdraft and mortgage charges which were discovered in the course of an internal review. "This is being done as part of CIBC's effort to correct its error and to ensure that it distributes to customers all of the money it received in error," the bank said.[45]
In a similar incident, CIBC announced April 27, 2006 that it's refunding an additional C$27 million to about 200,000 clients who were overcharged for certain overdraft fees and other borrowing transactions, some of which date back to 1993. In cases where clients were undercharged, the bank decided not to seek reimbursement.[46]
Privacy[edit]
2005[edit]
On April 18, 2005 the Privacy Commissioner of Canada expressed disappointment in the way CIBC dealt with incidents involving the bank misdirecting faxes containing customers' personal information.[47] One involved misdirecting faxes to a scrap yard operator in West Virginia from 2001 to 2004. The misdirected faxes contained the social security numbers, home addresses, phone numbers, and detailed bank account data of several hundred bank customers.[48]
The second incident involved a Dorval businessman and allegedly took place from 2000 to 2004. In both cases, the commissioner noted that the bank did not inform the affected clients, whose personal information was compromised, until the incidents became public and an investigation was underway.[49]
Within days of reports by CTV News and The Globe and Mail, CIBC management announced a directive that banned employees from using fax machines to transmit any documents containing confidential customer information.[50]
2007[edit]
On January 18, 2007, CIBC Asset Management announced that the personal information of about 470,000 current and former clients of Talvest Mutual Funds, a CIBC subsidiary, had gone missing. The information may have included client names, addresses, signatures, dates of birth, bank account numbers, beneficiary information and/or Social Insurance Numbers.[51] The incident stemmed from the disappearance of a hard drive containing information on "the process used to open and administer" customer accounts as it was traveling between the bank's Montreal and Toronto offices.[52] The Privacy Commissioner of Canada stated, "Although I appreciate that the bank notified us of this incident and that it is working cooperatively with my Office, I am nevertheless deeply troubled, especially given the magnitude of this breach, which puts at risk the personal information of hundreds of thousands of Canadians." She immediately launched a privacy investigation.[53]
Employee overtime[edit]
In June 2007, Dara Fresco, a Toronto teller, named CIBC in a $600 million class-action lawsuit regarding the lack of overtime pay to its customer service staff. Fresco v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce is a class action brought on behalf of current and former non-management, non-unionized employees of CIBC in Canada who are or were tellers or other front-line customer service employees working at CIBC retail branch office across Canada. The lawsuit alleges that class members are assigned heavier workloads than could be completed within their standard working hours. They were required or permitted to work overtime to meet the demands of their jobs and CIBC failed to pay for the overtime work in direct contravention of the Canada Labour Code under which they are regulated.[54]
The Ontario Superior Court dismissed the suit June 18, 2012, stating the evidence '"provides no basis in fact that there is a systemic practice of unpaid overtime at CIBC."'[55]
An employee of the Bank of Nova Scotia (Scotiabank) filed a similar suit which the Superior Court certified. Fresco and Scotiabank each appealed their adverse, and contradictory, rulings and the Ontario Court of Appeal ruled that both cases could proceed.[56]
Both banks appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada which on March 21, 2013, denied their requests and allowed the lawsuits to proceed.[57] The cases are awaiting further action as of late 2013.

History[edit]
The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, as it is known today, came into being in 1961. The bank was formed through the merger of the Canadian Bank of Commerce and the Imperial Bank of Canada. At the time, they were two of Canada's largest banks.
Origins[edit]




Commerce Building (c. 1930), now known as Commerce Court North in Toronto


Main articles: Canadian Bank of Commerce and Imperial Bank of Canada
The Honourable William McMaster founded the Canadian Bank of Commerce which opened on May 15, 1867, in Toronto as competition for the Bank of Montreal; by 1874 it had 24 branches.
The Imperial Bank of Canada opened in Toronto on March 18, 1875, founded by former Commerce Vice-president Henry Stark Howland.
By the end of 1895, the Canadian Bank of Commerce had grown to 58 branches and the Imperial Bank of Canada to 18.
The 1896 gold strike in the Yukon prompted the Dominion Government to ask the Canadian Bank of Commerce to open a branch in Dawson City. Acquisitions in the 1920s caused the Commerce Bank to become one of the strongest branch networks in Canada with over 700 local branches; and the bank opened international branches in Cuba, Jamaica, Barbados and Trinidad during the same period.
Wood, Gundy & Company, the precursor of CIBC's investment banking arm, opened its doors on February 1, 1905. During World War I, it took a prominent and active role in the organization of Victory Loans.
The Canadian Bank of Commerce opened its new head office in Toronto in 1931. An observation gallery on the 32nd floor attracted visitors who could get an aerial view of the city.
In 1936, the Commerce was the first Canadian bank to establish a personal loans department.
Following World War II, both banks opened new branches. Although the banks had been barred from the mortgage business since 1871, the Canadian government now called upon them to provide mortgage services. So, in 1954, Canadian banks started offering mortgages for new construction.
Forming Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce[edit]
In 1960, Imperial chairman Stuart Mackersy approached Neil McKinnon the President of the Commerce with a proposal to merge the two banks. This followed a decade of expansion in the Canadian economy and Canada's capitalization of the industrialization of its natural resources. They quickly reached a deal between the two banks.




The newly merged CIBC commissioned a new logo to commemorate its 100th year of operation. The "chevron" logo was in use until 1994[12]


On June 1, 1961, the Canadian Bank of Commerce and the Imperial Bank of Canada merged to form the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce with over 1,200 branches across Canada. The new bank possessed the greatest resources and the most branches of any bank in the country.
Following the merger, the new bank commissioned a new head office. While planning to retain Commerce Court North, the bank hired architect I. M. Pei to design a three-building complex. The result was Commerce Court consisting of a landscaped courtyard complementing the existing building and included the newly built 786 feet (240 m) Commerce Court West. When completed in 1973, the 57-storey building was the tallest in Canada, and the largest stainless-steel-clad building in the world.
In 1967, both Canada and CIBC celebrated their centenaries and CIBC was the only chartered bank to have a branch on-site at Expo 67. Also at this time computerization began to change banking services and the Yonge and Bloor branch in Toronto was the first Canadian bank branch to update customer bank books via computer. This also marked the introduction of inter-branch banking. Before the decade was out, CIBC had introduced the first 24-hour cash dispenser, which would eventually become the ATM.
Changes to federal and provincial regulations ending the separation of banks, investment dealers, trust companies and insurance companies came in 1987. CIBC quickly took advantage of this and became the first Canadian bank to operate an investment dealer, CIBC Securities, offering services to the public.
In 1988, CIBC acquired a majority interest in Wood Gundy which brought a well-respected name and reputation in underwriting. Shortly thereafter, the corporation merged Wood Gundy and CIBC Securities under the name CIBC Wood Gundy which became CIBC Oppenheimer in 1997[13] and later, CIBC World Markets.
In 1992, CIBC introduced automated telephone banking; in 1995 the bank launched its website, and shortly thereafter began offering banking services online. In 1998, CIBC joined with Loblaws to create President's Choice Financial which it launched in 28 Ottawa area stores.
Present[edit]
CIBC agreed to merge with the Toronto-Dominion Bank in 1998. However the Government of Canada, at the recommendation of then Finance Minister Paul Martin, blocked the merger – as well as another proposed by the Bank of Montreal with the Royal Bank of Canada – as not in the best interest of Canadians.[14]
CIBC sold its corporate and purchasing credit card business to U.S. Bank Canada in October 2006 which joined it with business charge cards it previously acquired from Royal Bank of Canada.
In 2006, the stock ticker symbol on the New York Stock Exchange changed from BCM to CM to bring it in line with the ticker symbol on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
In December 2006, CIBC acquired majority control of its publicly held joint venture FirstCaribbean International Bank for just over US$1 billion, (Bds$2 billion), when it purchased the 43.7% stake owned by Barclays Bank.[15] CIBC rebranded the division CIBC FirstCaribbean International Bank in 2011.[16]
On February 12, 2009, the Trinidad and Tobago Express reported that CIBC was pursuing discussions to buy CL Financial's stake in the Republic Bank of Trinidad and Tobago.[17] As part of a "bail out" agreement of CL Financial by the government of Trinidad and Tobago during the Global financial crisis of 2008–2009, the corporation was required to sell Republic and other assets. As of February 2011, CL Financial had yet to agree to a sale.[18]
In February, 2010 CIBC became the first chartered bank in Canada to launch a mobile banking iPhone App. It surpassed 100,000 downloads in just over one month following launch, with over 1 million client logins to CIBC Mobile Banking since its introduction.[19][20]
Four months later, the bank announced it signed a deal to buy a C$2.1-billion credit card portfolio from Citigroup's Citibank Canada MasterCard business.[21]
Finally in October of that year, CIBC announced that it would be the first bank in Canada to introduce the internationally used Visa-branded debit card.[22]
In April 2013, CIBC reached an agreement with Invesco to acquire Atlantic Trust, the company's wealth management unit for US$210 million.[23]
CIBC announced in June 2016 that it would acquire the Chicago-based commercial bank PrivateBancorp for US$3.8 billion.[24]
In April 2017, it was announced that CIBC would be moving its headquarters to CIBC Square.[25]

Main article: CIBC FirstCaribbean International Bank




CIBC FirstCaribbean branch in Bridgetown, Barbados


In 1920, Canadian Bank of Commerce established its first branches in the West Indies in Bridgetown, Barbados and in Kingston, Jamaica. That same year it also opened branches in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Havana, Cuba. Its first branch in Mexico City opened in 1910. In 1957, the bank opened a branch in Nassau, the Bahamas, and in the subsequent years expanded its operations in Jamaica.
Between 1963 and 1988, the bank expanded its branch network in Barbados opened branches in St. Vincent, Antigua, and St Lucia. In 1988, CIBC sold 45% of its shares in CIBC Jamaica via a public share issue. Between 1993 and 1996, the bank restructured its holdings in the Caribbean, with the incorporation of CIBC West Indies Holdings Limited and CIBC Caribbean Limited. CIBC West Indies Holdings then sold 30% of its shares to the public. In 1997, CIBC issued 5 million shares in CIBC Bahamas Limited to the public.
On October 31, 2001, Barclays and CIBC agreed to combine their Caribbean operations to establish FirstCaribbean International Bank. CIBC bought Barclays' stake in 2006 to give it control of approximately 92% of FirstCaribbean, which was rebranded as CIBC FirstCaribbean International Bank.[16] In 2010, CIBC acquired a 22.5% equity of Butterfield Bank of Bermuda.[27]

Miscellaneous[edit]
Li Ka Shing, Hong Kong billionaire was the largest foreign shareholder in the bank for over two decades, but in early 2005 he sold his portion (est. C$1.2 billion) to establish a Canadian charity, the Li Ka Shing Foundation. CIBC was Mr. Li's choice for financing many of his Canadian ventures, like Husky Energy. Mr. Li had reportedly backed personal and commercial banking head Holger Kluge to succeed Al Flood as CEO of CIBC in 1999.
Corporate governance[edit]
CIBC is well known for its publicized battles of succession to the top position of President and CEO (formerly styled chairman and CEO until 2003 when the positions were separated). When Al Flood became CEO, one of his first acts was to fire his chief rival Paul Cantor. In 1999, the company saw a competition between Wood Gundy (now CIBC World Markets) chief John S. Hunkin and Personal/Commercial banking head Holger Kluge, with Kluge retiring after Hunkin became chairman. In February 2004, Hunkin forced his friend and heir-apparent, David Kassie, to resign as chairman and CEO of World Markets after several scandals in the US. Both men had waived their bonuses in 2002 after that year produced the worst results in the history of the bank. Kassie afterwards founded Genuity Capital and was alleged to have raided 20 key employees from World Markets for his new startup, causing CIBC to file suit.[29] Gerald T. McCaughey became Kassie's replacement heading World Markets and in February 2004, was promoted to President and chief operating officer, assuring his succession as CEO.[30] Shortly after assuming his position, McCaughey reportedly dismissed Jill Denham, Vice Chair of Retail Markets and a potential rival for the CEO post. Denham was reportedly a close ally of Hunkin and Kassie and McCaughey wanted to build his own senior executive team.[31]

Credit agency ratings[edit]
On October 26, 2012, rating agency Moody's Investors Service announced it would review the long-term ratings of CIBC along with other Canadian banks, because of concerns about consumer debt levels, housing prices, a sizable exposure to capital markets and more. The review resulted in a downgrade from Aa2 to Aa3 on January 28, 2013.[37]
Settlements and controversies[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (August 2010)


Enron[edit]
On December 22, 2003, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) fined CIBC US$80 million for its role in the manipulation of Enron financial statements. This consists of $37.5 million to repay ill-gotten gains, a $37.5 million penalty and $5 million in interest. The money is intended to be returned to Enron fraud victims pursuant to the Fair Fund provisions of Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.[38]
The SEC also sued three of CIBC's executives. CIBC Executive Vice President Daniel Ferguson and former CIBC Executive Director Mark Wolf agreed to settle for US$563,000 and US$60,000, respectively. Ian Schottlaender, former managing director in CIBC's corporate leveraged finance group in New York initially contested the charges[39] but on July 12, 2004 he agreed to pay US$528,750 as well as be barred from serving as an officer or director of a publicly traded company for a period of five years.[40] Under these agreements the individuals neither admit nor deny wrongdoing.
The SEC complaint charges that "CIBC and the three executives with having helped Enron to mislead its investors through a series of complex structured finance transactions over a period of several years preceding Enron's bankruptcy." The agreement reached between the SEC and CIBC permanently enjoins CIBC from violating the antifraud, books and records, and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws.[38][39]
On August 2, 2005, CIBC paid US$2.4 billion to settle a class action lawsuit brought by a group of pension funds and investment managers, including the University of California, which claims that "systematic fraud by Enron and its officers led to the loss of billions and the collapse of the company."[41]
Market timing[edit]
On July 25, 2005 CIBC confirmed it would pay US$125 million to settle an investigation into its role in the 2003 Mutual-fund scandal. Linda Chatman Thomsen, director of the SEC's division of enforcement, said, "by knowingly financing customers' late trading and market timing, as well as providing financing in amounts far greater than the law allows, CIHI and World Markets boosted their customers' trading profits at the expense of long-term mutual fund shareholders."[42] Under the settlement, CIBC neither admitted nor denied the allegations.[43]
Visa cardholders[edit]
On August 27, 2004, CIBC confirmed that it would settle a class-action lawsuit on behalf of CIBC Visa cardholders. The plaintiffs alleged that the conversion of foreign-currency transactions resulted in an undisclosed or inadequately disclosed mark-up. After approval by an Ontario Superior Court judge, CIBC announced October 15, 2004, that the settlement would result in the bank paying C$13.85 million to its cardholders, $1 million to the United Way, $1.65 million to the Class Action Fund of the Law Society of Upper Canada, and $3 million in legal fees. The bank also announced that it has not admitted any liability and is settling to avoid further litigation with its cardholders.[44]
Voluntary refund of erroneous charges[edit]
On May 20, 2004, CIBC announced that it would refund C$24 million to some of its customers as a result of erroneous overdraft and mortgage charges which were discovered in the course of an internal review. "This is being done as part of CIBC's effort to correct its error and to ensure that it distributes to customers all of the money it received in error," the bank said.[45]
In a similar incident, CIBC announced April 27, 2006 that it's refunding an additional C$27 million to about 200,000 clients who were overcharged for certain overdraft fees and other borrowing transactions, some of which date back to 1993. In cases where clients were undercharged, the bank decided not to seek reimbursement.[46]
Privacy[edit]
2005[edit]
On April 18, 2005 the Privacy Commissioner of Canada expressed disappointment in the way CIBC dealt with incidents involving the bank misdirecting faxes containing customers' personal information.[47] One involved misdirecting faxes to a scrap yard operator in West Virginia from 2001 to 2004. The misdirected faxes contained the social security numbers, home addresses, phone numbers, and detailed bank account data of several hundred bank customers.[48]
The second incident involved a Dorval businessman and allegedly took place from 2000 to 2004. In both cases, the commissioner noted that the bank did not inform the affected clients, whose personal information was compromised, until the incidents became public and an investigation was underway.[49]
Within days of reports by CTV News and The Globe and Mail, CIBC management announced a directive that banned employees from using fax machines to transmit any documents containing confidential customer information.[50]
2007[edit]
On January 18, 2007, CIBC Asset Management announced that the personal information of about 470,000 current and former clients of Talvest Mutual Funds, a CIBC subsidiary, had gone missing. The information may have included client names, addresses, signatures, dates of birth, bank account numbers, beneficiary information and/or Social Insurance Numbers.[51] The incident stemmed from the disappearance of a hard drive containing information on "the process used to open and administer" customer accounts as it was traveling between the bank's Montreal and Toronto offices.[52] The Privacy Commissioner of Canada stated, "Although I appreciate that the bank notified us of this incident and that it is working cooperatively with my Office, I am nevertheless deeply troubled, especially given the magnitude of this breach, which puts at risk the personal information of hundreds of thousands of Canadians." She immediately launched a privacy investigation.[53]
Employee overtime[edit]
In June 2007, Dara Fresco, a Toronto teller, named CIBC in a $600 million class-action lawsuit regarding the lack of overtime pay to its customer service staff. Fresco v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce is a class action brought on behalf of current and former non-management, non-unionized employees of CIBC in Canada who are or were tellers or other front-line customer service employees working at CIBC retail branch office across Canada. The lawsuit alleges that class members are assigned heavier workloads than could be completed within their standard working hours. They were required or permitted to work overtime to meet the demands of their jobs and CIBC failed to pay for the overtime work in direct contravention of the Canada Labour Code under which they are regulated.[54]
The Ontario Superior Court dismissed the suit June 18, 2012, stating the evidence '"provides no basis in fact that there is a systemic practice of unpaid overtime at CIBC."'[55]
An employee of the Bank of Nova Scotia (Scotiabank) filed a similar suit which the Superior Court certified. Fresco and Scotiabank each appealed their adverse, and contradictory, rulings and the Ontario Court of Appeal ruled that both cases could proceed.[56]
Both banks appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada which on March 21, 2013, denied their requests and allowed the lawsuits to proceed.[57] The cases are awaiting further action as of late 2013.

Canadian Imperial Bank Of Commerce - Smallest, But Best Valued Of The 'Big 5' - Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (NYSE:CM) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Canadian Imperial Bank Of Commerce - Smallest, But Best Valued Of The 'Big 5'Jun.28.17 | About: Canadian Imperial (CM) Cash-Centered Creep Dividend growth investing, dividend investing, long-term horizonSummaryOn May 25, the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce released their Q2 results.
        Its place in the Canadian banking system assures its longevity, and its growth prospects in the U.S. will ensure value for money going forward.
        It currently is a buy.
        On May 25, the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CM) released their Q2 results, reporting EPS of C$2.64, which beat estimates by C$0.07. The stock is down 13.64% from its 52-week high of $92.22. 

In light of these facts, is Canadian Imperial worth considering for a long-term portfolio? Company Overview Founded in 1867, the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce is a blue-chip Canadian bank which divides its operations into three segments: Capital Markets; Retail and Business Banking; and Wealth Management. Capital Markets provides products relating to global markets and integrated credit, and also provides investment banking-related advice to governments, corporations, and other institutional bodies. For Q2, it took revenues of C$733 million and net income of C$292 million. Retail and Business Banking provides Canadian customers with personal and business products and services. For Q2, it took in revenues of C$2.225 billion and net income of C$647 million. Wealth Management provides investment advice and solutions for high net worth clients and institutions. For Q2, it took in revenues of C$659 million and net income of C$154 million. The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce has a market capitalization of C$44 billion, a workforce of approximately 43,400 employees, and is headquartered in Toronto, Canada. Competitive Advantage The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce benefits from being one of the 'Big Five' Canadian banks. The Canadian banking system is highly regulated and its lending standards are much, much stricter than is the case in the U.S. This regulatory environment has essentially created a banking oligopoly in Canada, comprised of five financial titans - the Royal Bank of Canada (RY), Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD), Scotiabank (BNS), the Bank of Montreal (BMO), and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.
 

Though Canadian Imperial is the smallest of the five, and the one with least international exposure outside Canada, its position within this oligopoly assures it of the sort of profitability that has enabled it to reward shareholders with consistent dividend payments since 1868. Not even the Great Recession was able to impair its ability to pay dividends without cutting them - a claim few U.S. banks can make. Furthermore, as the smallest of the five banks, it is also the one with the greatest growth potential. Canadian Imperial is attempting to rectify its lack of international diversity by expanding its operations into the U.S. through acquisitions: it purchased Atlantic Trust Private Wealth Management for $210 million last year, and this June closed a deal with PrivateBancorp (PVTB) for $5 billion. Valuation Currently, the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce is trading near the $80 mark with a price-to-earnings ratio of 8.79, a forward P/E ratio of 7.22 and offers a dividend yield of 4.76% with a payout ratio of 41.00%. In short, the stock is trading at a discount price, and is able to reward shareholders with a near-5% dividend yield while retaining more than half of the bank's profits. Canadian Imperial is thus not only trading at a discount to the S&P 500 (SPY) average of 25.74, but is also at a discount to its peers within the 'Big Five.'    Bank   P/E Ratio   Dividend Yield (%)    BMO  11.91  3.72    BNS  12.70  3.77    CM  8.79  4.76    RY  12.87  3.49    TD  12.97  3.33   Final Thoughts The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce is the smallest of the five banks and the one with the least international reach - and these reasons likely account for its cheapness relative to the remaining constituents of the 'Big Five' Canadian banks. Yet its growth prospects look radiant and its dividend record looks set to continue going forward. Prospective investors can lock in a near 5% yield with this Canadian blue-chip bank.

The notes are being issued by Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC). There are important differences between the notes and a conventional debt security, including different investment risks and certain additional costs.

Capped Leveraged Index Return Notes® Linked to the Russell 2000® Index, due   June  , 2019 

   


  

    
 
Summary
The Capped Leveraged Index Return Notes® Linked to the Russell 2000® Index, due June  , 2019 (the notes) are our senior unsecured debt securities. The notes are not guaranteed or insured by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency in the United States, Canada or any other jurisdiction or secured by collateral. The notes will rank equally with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt. Any payments due on the notes, including any repayment of principal, will be subject to the credit risk of CIBC. The notes provide you a leveraged return, subject to a cap, if the Ending Value of the Market Measure, which is the Russell 2000® Index (the Index), is greater than its Starting Value. If the Ending Value is equal to or less than the Starting Value but greater than or equal to the Threshold Value, you will receive the principal amount of your notes. If the Ending Value is less than the Threshold Value, you will lose a portion, which could be significant, of the principal amount of your notes. Payments on the notes, including the amount you receive at maturity, will be calculated based on the $10 principal amount per unit and will depend on the performance of the Index, subject to our credit risk. See Terms of the Notes below.
 
The economic terms of the notes (including the Capped Value) are based on our internal funding rate, which is the rate we would pay to borrow funds through the issuance of market-linked notes, and the economic terms of certain related hedging arrangements.  Our internal funding rate is typically lower than the rate we would pay when we issue conventional fixed rate debt securities. This difference in funding rate, as well as the underwriting discount and the hedging-related charge described below, will reduce the economic terms of the notes to you and the initial estimated value of the notes on the pricing date. Due to these factors, the public offering price you pay to purchase the notes will be greater than the initial estimated value of the notes.
 
On the cover page of this term sheet, we have provided the initial estimated value range for the notes. This initial estimated value range was determined based on our pricing models. The initial estimated value as of the pricing date will be based on our internal funding rate on the pricing date, market conditions and other relevant factors existing at that time, and our assumptions about market parameters. For more information about the initial estimated value and the structuring of the notes, see Structuring the Notes on page TS-12.

Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, all references in this document to we, us, our, or similar references are to CIBC.
 
 
Investor Considerations
 



You may wish to consider an investment in the notes if: 

The notes may not be an appropriate investment for you if:  


  

   


§                  You   anticipate that the Index will increase moderately from the Starting Value to   the Ending Value.
§                  You are   willing to risk a substantial loss of principal if the Index decreases from   the Starting Value to an Ending Value that is below the Threshold Value.
§                  You accept   that the return on the notes will be capped.
§                  You are   willing to forgo the interest payments that are paid on conventional interest   bearing debt securities.
§                  You are   willing to forgo dividends or other benefits of owning the stocks included in   the Index.
§                  You are   willing to accept a limited or no market for sales prior to maturity, and   understand that the market prices for the notes, if any, will be affected by   various factors, including our actual and perceived creditworthiness, our   internal funding rate and fees and charges on the notes.
§                You are   willing to assume our credit risk, as issuer of the notes, for all payments   under the notes, including the Redemption Amount. 

§                  You believe   that the Index will decrease from the Starting Value to the Ending Value or   that it will not increase sufficiently over the term of the notes to provide   you with your desired return.
§                  You seek 100%   principal repayment or preservation of capital.
§                  You seek an   uncapped return on your investment.
§                  You seek   interest payments or other current income on your investment.
§                  You want to   receive dividends or other distributions paid on the stocks included in the   Index.
§                  You seek an   investment for which there will be a liquid secondary market.
§                You are   unwilling or are unable to take market risk on the notes or to take our   credit risk as issuer of the notes.   
 
We urge you to consult your investment, legal, tax, accounting, and other advisors before you invest in the notes.

Hypothetical Payout Profile and Examples of Payments at Maturity
 
The below graph is based on hypothetical numbers and values.
 



Capped   Leveraged Index Return Notes®
 

This graph   reflects the returns on the notes, based on the Participation Rate of 200%, a   Threshold Value of 90% of the hypothetical Starting Value and a hypothetical Capped Value   of $11.60 per unit (the midpoint of the Capped Value range of [$11.40 to   $11.80]). The green line reflects the returns on the notes, while the dotted   gray line reflects the returns of a direct investment in the stocks included   in the Index, excluding   dividends.
 
This graph   has been prepared for purposes of illustration only.   
 
The following table and examples are for purposes of illustration only.  They are based on hypothetical values and show hypothetical returns on the notes. They illustrate the calculation of the Redemption Amount and total rate of return based on a hypothetical Starting Value of 100.00, a hypothetical Threshold Value of 90%, the Participation Rate of 200%, a hypothetical Capped Value of $11.60 per unit and a range of hypothetical Ending Values.
 
The actual amount you receive and the resulting total rate of return will depend on the actual Starting Value, Threshold Value, Ending Value, Capped Value, and whether you hold the notes to maturity. The following examples do not take into account any tax consequences from investing in the notes.
 
For recent actual levels of the Market Measure, see The Index section below. The Index is a price return index and as such the Ending Value will not include any income generated by dividends paid on the stocks included in the Index, which you would otherwise be entitled to receive if you invested in those stocks directly. In addition, all payments on the notes are subject to issuer credit risk.

Redemption Amount Calculation Examples
 



Example 1  


The Ending Value is 80.00, or   80.00% of the Starting Value:  


Starting Value:                100.00  


Threshold Value:   90.00  


Ending Value:                   80.00  


 

  Redemption   Amount per unit   
 
 



Example 2  


The Ending Value is 95.00, or   95.00% of the Starting Value:  


Starting Value:                100.00  


Threshold Value:   90.00  


Ending Value:                   95.00  


Redemption Amount (per unit) = $10.00,   the principal amount, since the Ending Value is less than the Starting Value   but equal to or greater than the Threshold Value.   
 
 



Example 3  


The Ending Value is 104.00, or   104.00% of the Starting Value:  


Starting Value:                100.00  


Ending Value:                   104.00  


 

   = $10.80 Redemption Amount per unit   
 
 



Example 4  


The Ending Value is 130.00, or   130.00% of the Starting Value:  


Starting Value:                100.00  


Ending Value:                   130.00  


 

= $16.00, however, because the Redemption Amount for the notes cannot   exceed the Capped Value, the Redemption Amount will be $11.60 per unit

Risk Factors
 
There are important differences between the notes and a conventional debt security.  An investment in the notes involves significant risks, including those listed below. You should carefully review the more detailed explanation of risks relating to the notes in the Risk Factors sections beginning on page PS-6 of product supplement EQUITY INDICES LIRN-1, page S-1 of the prospectus supplement, and page 1 of the prospectus identified above. We also urge you to consult your investment, legal, tax, accounting, and other advisors before you invest in the notes.
 
§                  Depending on the performance of the Index as measured shortly before the maturity date, your investment may result in a loss; there is no guaranteed return of principal.
 
§                  Your return on the notes may be less than the yield you could earn by owning a conventional fixed or floating rate debt security of comparable maturity.
 
§                  Your investment return is limited to the return represented by the Capped Value and may be less than a comparable investment directly in the stocks included in the Index.
 
§                  Payments on the notes are subject to our credit risk, and actual or perceived changes in our creditworthiness are expected to affect the value of the notes. If we become insolvent or are unable to pay our obligations, you may lose your entire investment.
 
§                  Our initial estimated value of the notes will be lower than the public offering price of the notes. The public offering price of the notes will exceed our initial estimated value because costs associated with selling and structuring the notes, as well as hedging the notes, all as further described in Structuring the Notes on page TS-12, are included in the public offering price of the notes.
 
§                  Our initial estimated value does not represent future values of the notes and may differ from others estimates. Our initial estimated value is only an estimate, which will be determined by reference to our internal pricing models when the terms of the notes are set. This estimated value will be based on market conditions and other relevant factors existing at that time, our internal funding rate on the pricing date and our assumptions about market parameters, which can include volatility, dividend rates, interest rates and other factors. Different pricing models and assumptions could provide valuations for the notes that are greater or less than our initial estimated value. In addition, market conditions and other relevant factors in the future may change, and any assumptions may prove to be incorrect. On future dates, the market value of the notes could change significantly based on, among other things, changes in market conditions, including the value of the Market Measure, our creditworthiness, interest rate movements and other relevant factors, which may impact the price at which MLPF&S or any other party would be willing to buy notes from you in any secondary market transactions. Our estimated value does not represent a minimum price at which MLPF&S or any other party would be willing to buy your notes in any secondary market (if any exists) at any time.
 
§                  Our initial estimated value of the notes will not be determined by reference to credit spreads for our conventional fixed-rate debt. The internal funding rate to be used in the determination of our initial estimated value of the notes generally represents a discount from the credit spreads for our conventional fixed-rate debt. The discount is based on, among other things, our view of the funding value of the notes as well as the higher issuance, operational and ongoing liability management costs of the notes in comparison to those costs for our conventional fixed-rate debt. If we were to use the interest rate implied by our conventional fixed-rate debt, we would expect the economic terms of the notes to be more favorable to you. Consequently, our use of an internal funding rate for market-linked notes would have an adverse effect on the economic terms of the notes, the initial estimated value of the notes on the pricing date, and any secondary market prices of the notes.
 
§                  A trading market is not expected to develop for the notes. Neither we nor MLPF&S is obligated to make a market for, or to repurchase, the notes. There is no assurance that any party will be willing to purchase your notes at any price in any secondary market.
 
§                  Our business, hedging, and trading activities, and those of MLPF&S and our respective affiliates (including trades in shares of companies included in the Index), and any hedging and trading activities we, MLPF&S or our respective affiliates engage in for our clients accounts, may affect the market value and return of the notes and may create conflicts of interest with you.
 
§                  The Index sponsor may adjust the Index in a way that affects its level, and has no obligation to consider your interests.
 
§                  You will have no rights of a holder of the securities represented by the Index, and you will not be entitled to receive securities or dividends or other distributions by the issuers of those securities.
 
§                  While we, MLPF&S or our respective affiliates may from time to time own securities of companies included in the Index, we, MLPF&S and our respective affiliates do not control any company included in the Index, and have not verified any disclosure made by any other company.
 
§                  There may be potential conflicts of interest involving the calculation agent, which is MLPF&S.  We have the right to appoint and remove the calculation agent.
 
§                  The U.S. federal income tax consequences of the notes are uncertain, and may be adverse to a holder of the notes.  See Summary of U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences below and U.S. Federal Income Tax Summary beginning on page PS-29 of product supplement EQUITY INDICES LIRN-1.  For a discussion of the Canadian federal income tax consequences of investing in the notes, see Material Income Tax ConsequencesCanadian Taxation in the prospectus dated March 28, 2017, as supplemented by the discussion under Summary of Canadian Federal Income Tax Considerations herein.

Additional Risk Factors
 
The notes are subject to risks associated with small-size capitalization companies.
 
The stocks composing the Index are issued by companies with small-sized market capitalization. The stock prices of small-size companies may be more volatile than stock prices of large capitalization companies. Small-size capitalization companies may be less able to withstand adverse economic, market, trade and competitive conditions relative to larger companies. Small-size capitalization companies may also be more susceptible to adverse developments related to their products or services.

The Index
All disclosures in this term sheet regarding the Index have been derived from publicly available sources, which we have not independently verified.  The information summarizes the current index methodology as published by FTSE Russell (the Index sponsor) and may be changed by FTSE Russell at any time. FTSE Russell, which owns the copyright and all other rights to the Index, has no obligation to continue to publish, and may discontinue publication of, the Index. The consequences of FTSE Russell discontinuing publication of the Index are discussed in the section entitled Description of LIRNsDiscontinuance of an Index beginning on page PS-19 of product supplement EQUITY INDICES LIRN-1. None of us, the calculation agent, or MLPF&S accepts any responsibility for the calculation, maintenance or publication of the Index or any successor index. Additional information on the Index is available at the following website: http://www.ftserussell.com.  No information on that website is deemed to be included or incorporated by reference in this term sheet.
 
Russell 2000® and Russell 3000® are trademarks of FTSE Russell and have been licensed for use by our subsidiary, MLPF&S. The notes are not sponsored, endorsed, sold, or promoted by FTSE Russell, and FTSE Russell makes no representation regarding the advisability of investing in the notes.
 
The Index was developed by Russell Investments (Russell) before FTSE International Limited and Russell combined in 2015 to create FTSE Russell, which is wholly owned by London Stock Exchange Group. Russell began dissemination of the Index (Bloomberg L.P. index symbol RTY) on January 1, 1984. The Index was set to 135 as of the close of business on December 31, 1986. FTSE Russell calculates and publishes the Index. The Index is designed to track the performance of the small capitalization segment of the U.S. equity market. As a subset of the Russell 3000® Index, the Index consists of the smallest 2,000 companies included in the Russell 3000® Index. The Russell 3000® Index measures the performance of the largest 3,000 U.S. companies, representing approximately 98% of the investable U.S. equity market. The Index is determined, comprised, and calculated by FTSE Russell without regard to the notes.
 
Selection of Stocks Comprising the Index
 
All companies eligible for inclusion in the Index must be classified as a U.S. company under FTSE Russells country-assignment methodology. If a company is incorporated, has a stated headquarters location, and trades in the same country (American Depositary Receipts and American Depositary Shares are not eligible), then the company is assigned to its country of incorporation. If any of the three factors are not the same, FTSE Russell defines three Home Country Indicators (HCIs): country of incorporation, country of headquarters, and country of the most liquid exchange (as defined by a two-year average daily dollar trading volume) (ADDTV) from all exchanges within a country. Using the HCIs, FTSE Russell compares the primary location of the companys assets with the three HCIs. If the primary location of its assets matches any of the HCIs, then the company is assigned to the primary location of its assets. If there is insufficient information to determine the country in which the companys assets are primarily located, FTSE Russell will use the primary country from which the companys revenues are primarily derived for the comparison with the three HCIs in a similar manner. FTSE Russell uses the average of two years of assets or revenues data to reduce potential turnover. If conclusive country details cannot be derived from assets or revenues data, FTSE Russell will assign the company to the country of its headquarters, which is defined as the address of the companys principal executive offices, unless that country is a Benefit Driven Incorporation (BDI) country, in which case the company will be assigned to the country of its most liquid stock exchange. BDI countries include: Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Aruba, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Bermuda, Bonaire, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Channel Islands, Cook Islands, Curacao, Faroe Islands, Gibraltar, Guernsey, Isle of Man, Jersey, Liberia, Marshall Islands, Panama, Saba, Sint Eustatius, Sint Maarten, and Turks and Caicos Islands. For any companies incorporated or headquartered in a U.S. territory, including countries such as Puerto Rico, Guam, and U.S. Virgin Islands, a U.S. HCI is assigned.
 
All securities eligible for inclusion in the Index must trade on a major U.S. exchange. Stocks must have a closing price at or above $1.00 on their primary exchange on the last trading day in May to be eligible for inclusion during annual reconstitution. However, in order to reduce unnecessary turnover, if an existing members closing price is less than $1.00 on the last trading day of May, it will be considered eligible if the average of the daily closing prices (from its primary exchange) during the month of May is equal to or greater than $1.00. Initial public offerings are added each quarter and must have a closing price at or above $1.00 on the last day of their eligibility period in order to qualify for index inclusion. If an existing stock does not trade on the rank day (typically the last trading day in May but a confirmed timetable is announced each spring), but does have a closing price at or above $1.00 on another eligible U.S. exchange, that stock will be eligible for inclusion.
 
An important criterion used to determine the list of securities eligible for the Index is total market capitalization, which is defined as the market price as of the last trading day in May for those securities being considered at annual reconstitution times the total number of shares outstanding. Where applicable, common stock, non-restricted exchangeable shares and partnership units/membership interests are used to determine market capitalization. Any other form of shares such as preferred stock, convertible preferred stock, redeemable shares, participating preferred stock, warrants and rights, installment receipts or trust receipts, are excluded from the calculation. If multiple share classes of common stock exist, they are combined. In cases where the common stock share classes act independently of each other (e.g., tracking stocks), each class is considered for inclusion separately. If multiple share classes exist, the pricing vehicle will be designated as the share class with the highest two-year trading volume as of the rank day in May.
 
Companies with a total market capitalization of less than $30 million are not eligible for the Index. Similarly, companies with only 5% or less of their shares available in the marketplace are not eligible for the Index. Royalty trusts, limited liability companies, closed-end investment companies (companies that are required to report Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, as defined by the SEC, including business development companies), blank check companies, special purpose acquisition companies, and limited partnerships are also

ineligible for inclusion. Exchange traded funds and mutual funds are also excluded. Bulletin board, pink sheets, and over-the-counter (OTC) traded securities are not eligible for inclusion.
 
Annual reconstitution is a process by which the Index is completely rebuilt. Based on closing levels of the companys common stock on its primary exchange on the rank day of May of each year, FTSE Russell reconstitutes the composition of the Index using the then existing market capitalizations of eligible companies. Reconstitution of the Index occurs on the last Friday in June or, when the last Friday in June is the 29th or 30th, reconstitution occurs on the prior Friday. In addition, FTSE Russell adds initial public offerings to the Index on a quarterly basis based on total market capitalization ranking within the market-adjusted capitalization breaks established during the most recent reconstitution. After membership is determined, a securitys shares are adjusted to include only those shares available to the public. This is often referred to as free float. The purpose of the adjustment is to exclude from market calculations the capitalization that is not available for purchase and is not part of the investable opportunity set.
 
The following graph shows the daily historical performance of the Index in the period from January 1, 2008 through May 23, 2017.  We obtained this historical data from Bloomberg L.P.  We have not independently verified the accuracy or completeness of the information obtained from Bloomberg L.P. On May 23, 2017, the closing level of the Index was 1,380.982.
 
Historical Performance of the Index
 

 
This historical data on the Index is not necessarily indicative of the future performance of the Index or what the value of the notes may be. Any historical upward or downward trend in the level of the Index during any period set forth above is not an indication that the level of the Index is more or less likely to increase or decrease at any time over the term of the notes.
 
Before investing in the notes, you should consult publicly available sources for the levels of the Index.

Supplement to the Plan of Distribution
 
Under our distribution agreement with MLPF&S, MLPF&S will purchase the notes from us as principal at the public offering price indicated on the cover of this term sheet, less the indicated underwriting discount.
 
We may deliver the notes against payment therefor in New York, New York on a date that is greater than three business days following the pricing date. Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in three business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, if the initial settlement of the notes occurs more than three business days from the pricing date, purchasers who wish to trade the notes more than three business days prior to the original issue date will be required to specify alternative settlement arrangements to prevent a failed settlement.
 
The notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. In the original offering of the notes, the notes will be sold in minimum investment amounts of 100 units. If you place an order to purchase the notes, you are consenting to MLPF&S acting as a principal in effecting the transaction for your account.
 
MLPF&S may repurchase and resell the notes, with repurchases and resales being made at prices related to then-prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices, and these prices will include MLPF&Ss trading commissions and mark-ups. MLPF&S may act as principal or agent in these market-making transactions; however, it is not obligated to engage in any such transactions. At MLPF&Ss discretion, for a short, undetermined initial period after the issuance of the notes, MLPF&S may offer to buy the notes in the secondary market at a price that may exceed the initial estimated value of the notes. Any price offered by MLPF&S for the notes will be based on then-prevailing market conditions and other considerations, including the performance of the Index and the remaining term of the notes. However, none of us, MLPF&S, or any of our respective affiliates is obligated to purchase your notes at any price or at any time, and we cannot assure you that we, MLPF&S or any of our respective affiliates will purchase your notes at a price that equals or exceeds the initial estimated value of the notes.
 
The value of the notes shown on your account statement will be based on MLPF&Ss estimate of the value of the notes if MLPF&S or another of its affiliates were to make a market in the notes, which it is not obligated to do. That estimate will be based upon the price that MLPF&S may pay for the notes in light of then-prevailing market conditions, and other considerations, as mentioned above, and will include transaction costs. At certain times, this price may be higher than or lower than the initial estimated value of the notes.
 
The distribution of the Note Prospectus in connection with these offers or sales will be solely for the purpose of providing investors with the description of the terms of the notes that was made available to investors in connection with their initial offering. Secondary market investors should not, and will not be authorized to, rely on the Note Prospectus for information regarding CIBC or for any purpose other than that described in the immediately preceding sentence.
 
An investors household, as referenced on the cover of this term sheet, will generally include accounts held by any of the following, as determined by MLPF&S in its discretion and acting in good faith based upon information then available to MLPF&S:
 
·                  the investors spouse (including a domestic partner), siblings, parents, grandparents, spouses parents, children and grandchildren, but excluding accounts held by aunts, uncles, cousins, nieces, nephews or any other family relationship not directly above or below the individual investor;
 
·                  a family investment vehicle, including foundations, limited partnerships and personal holding companies, but only if the beneficial owners of the vehicle consist solely of the investor or members of the investors household as described above; and
 
·                  a trust where the grantors and/or beneficiaries of the trust consist solely of the investor or members of the investors household as described above; provided that, purchases of the notes by a trust generally cannot be aggregated together with any purchases made by a trustees personal account.
 
Purchases in retirement accounts will not be considered part of the same household as an individual investors personal or other non-retirement account, except for individual retirement accounts (IRAs), simplified employee pension plans (SEPs), savings incentive match plan for employees (SIMPLEs), and single-participant or owners only accounts (i.e., retirement accounts held by self-employed individuals, business owners or partners with no employees other than their spouses).
 
Please contact your Merrill Lynch financial advisor if you have any questions about the application of these provisions to your specific circumstances or think you are eligible.

Structuring the Notes
 
The notes are our debt securities, the return on which is linked to the performance of the Index.  As is the case for all of our debt securities, including our market-linked notes, the economic terms of the notes reflect our actual or perceived creditworthiness at the time of pricing. The internal funding rate we use in pricing the market-linked notes is typically lower than the rate we would pay when we issue conventional fixed-rate debt securities of comparable maturity. This difference is based on, among other things, our view of the funding value of the notes as well as the higher issuance, operational and ongoing liability management costs of the notes in comparison to those costs for our conventional fixed-rate debt. This generally relatively lower internal funding rate, which is reflected in the economic terms of the notes, along with the fees and charges associated with market-linked notes, typically results in the initial estimated value of the notes on the pricing date being less than their public offering price.
 
At maturity, we are required to pay the Redemption Amount to holders of the notes, which will be calculated based on the performance of the Index and the $10 per unit principal amount. In order to meet these payment obligations, at the time we issue the notes, we may choose to enter into certain hedging arrangements (which may include call options, put options or other derivatives) with MLPF&S or one of its affiliates.  The terms of these hedging arrangements are determined by seeking bids from market participants, including MLPF&S and its affiliates, and take into account a number of factors, including our creditworthiness, interest rate movements, the volatility of the Index, the tenor of the notes and the tenor of the hedging arrangements. The economic terms of the notes and their initial estimated value depend in part on the terms of these hedging arrangements.
 
MLPF&S has advised us that the hedging arrangements will include a hedging-related charge of approximately $0.075 per unit, reflecting an estimated profit to be credited to MLPF&S from these transactions.  Since hedging entails risk and may be influenced by unpredictable market forces, additional profits and losses from these hedging arrangements may be realized by MLPF&S or any third party hedge providers.

Summary of Canadian Federal Income Tax Considerations
 
In the opinion of Blake, Cassels & Graydon LLP, our Canadian tax counsel, the following summary describes the principal Canadian federal income tax considerations under the Income Tax Act (Canada) (the Canadian Tax Act) generally applicable at the date hereof to a purchaser who acquires beneficial ownership of a note pursuant to this term sheet and who for the purposes of the Canadian Tax Act and the regulations thereto and at all relevant times:  (a) is neither resident nor deemed to be resident in Canada; (b) deals at arms length with CIBC and any transferee resident (or deemed to be resident) in Canada to whom the purchaser disposes of the note; (c) does not use or hold and is not deemed to use or hold the note in, or in the course of, carrying on a business in Canada; (d) is entitled to receive all payments (including any interest and principal) made on the note; and (e) is not a, and deals at arms length with any, specified shareholder of CIBC for purposes of the thin capitalization rules in the Canadian Tax Act (a Non-Resident Holder).  A specified shareholder for these purposes generally includes a person who (either alone or together with persons with whom that person is not dealing at arms length for the purposes of the Canadian Tax Act) owns or has the right to acquire or control or is otherwise deemed to own 25% or more of CIBCs shares determined on a votes or fair market value basis.  Special rules which apply to non-resident insurers carrying on business in Canada and elsewhere are not discussed in this summary.
 
This summary is supplemental to and should be read together with the description of material Canadian federal income tax considerations relevant to a Non-Resident Holder owning notes under Material Income Tax ConsequencesCanadian Taxation in the accompanying prospectus and a Non-Resident Holder should carefully read that description as well.
 
Based on Canadian tax counsels understanding of the Canada Revenue Agencys administrative policies and having regard to the terms of the notes, interest payable on the notes should not be considered to be participating debt interest as defined in the Canadian Tax Act and accordingly, a Non-Resident Holder should not be subject to Canadian non-resident withholding tax in respect of amounts paid or credited or deemed to have been paid or credited by CIBC on a note as, on account of or in lieu of payment of, or in satisfaction of, interest.
 
Non-Resident Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the consequences to them of a disposition of the notes to a person with whom they are not dealing at arms length for purposes of the Canadian Tax Act.

Summary of U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences
 
The following discussion is a brief summary of the material U.S. federal income consequences relating to an investment in the notes.  The following summary is not complete and is both qualified and supplemented by, or in some cases supplements, the discussion entitled U.S. Federal Income Tax Summary beginning on page PS-29 of product supplement EQUITY INDICES LIRN-1, which you should carefully review prior to investing in the notes.
 
The U.S. federal income tax consequences of your investment in the notes are uncertain. No statutory, judicial or administrative authority directly discusses how the notes should be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In the opinion of our tax counsel, Mayer Brown LLP, it would generally be reasonable to treat the notes as prepaid cash-settled derivative contracts. Pursuant to the terms of the notes, you agree to treat the notes in this manner for all U.S. federal income tax purposes. If your notes are so treated, you should generally recognize capital gain or loss upon the sale, exchange, redemption or payment on maturity in an amount equal to the difference between the amount you receive at such time and the amount that you paid for your notes. Such gain or loss should generally be long-term capital gain or loss if you have held your notes for more than one year.
 
The characterization described above is not binding on the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) or the courts. Thus, it is possible that the IRS would seek to characterize your notes in a manner that results in tax consequences to you that are different from those described above or in the accompanying product supplement. For a more detailed discussion of certain alternative characterizations with respect to your notes and certain other considerations with respect to your investment in the notes, you should consider the discussion set forth in U.S. Federal Income Tax Summary of the product supplement. We are not responsible for any adverse consequences that you may experience as a result of any alternative characterization of the notes for U.S. federal income tax or other tax purposes.
 
You should consult your tax advisor as to the tax consequences of such characterization and any possible alternative characterizations of the notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. You should also consult your tax advisor concerning the U.S. federal income tax and other tax consequences of your investment in the notes in your particular circumstances, including the application of state, local or other tax laws and the possible effects of changes in federal or other tax laws.

We have filed a registration statement (including a product supplement, a prospectus supplement, and a prospectus) with the SEC for the offering to which this term sheet relates.  Before you invest, you should read the Note Prospectus, including this term sheet, and the other documents that we have filed with the SEC, for more complete information about us and this offering.  You may get these documents without cost by visiting EDGAR on the SEC website at www.sec.gov.  Alternatively, we, any agent, or any dealer participating in this offering will arrange to send you these documents if you so request by calling MLPF&S toll-free at 1-800-294-1322.
 
Market-Linked Investments Classification
 

 
MLPF&S classifies certain market-linked investments (the Market-Linked Investments) into categories, each with different investment characteristics. The following description is meant solely for informational purposes and is not intended to represent any particular Enhanced Return Market-Linked Investment or guarantee any performance.
 
Enhanced Return Market-Linked Investments are short- to medium-term investments that offer you a way to enhance exposure to a particular market view without taking on a similarly enhanced level of market downside risk. They can be especially effective in a flat to moderately positive market (or, in the case of bearish investments, a flat to moderately negative market). In exchange for the potential to receive better-than market returns on the linked asset, you must generally accept market downside risk and capped upside potential.  As these investments are not market downside protected, and do not assure full repayment of principal at maturity, you need to be prepared for the possibility that you may lose all or part of your investment.
 
Leveraged Index Return Notes® and LIRNs® are registered service marks of Bank of America Corporation, the parent company of MLPF&S.

Banking
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce—A History of Innovation

February 19, 2015



 


By Samantha Barnes – samantha.barnes@internationalbanker.com
Known globally as one of the most resilient and stable economies, the Canadian economy has an impressive track record of performance. Like many countries, Canada was hit hard by the global credit crisis more than five years ago; however, the Canadian economy has shown the ability to stabilise and rebuild relatively quickly when compared to its counterparts worldwide. 
Depressed oil prices remain a concern that may upset the development trend and will be watched carefully by investors and economic advisers worldwide when assessing the growth prospects of the Canadian economy. Much as for most nations across the globe, a sudden shock in the energy market has the potential to significantly disrupt nationwide economic growth, investment and market demand as well as employment, all of which will most likely contract in response to sharp market volatility. 
Contributing to the nation’s economic stability and progress is the well-regulated and well-structured banking and financial-services sector. Held in high regard globally, the Canadian banking and financial-services sector weathered the financial crisis with an impressive degree of stability and with speedy, smart responses to surfacing problems. 
CIBC head office is located in Toronto Ontario
While banks in Canada provide a stable footing for the economy, they also operate in a rapidly changing environment. The introduction of mobile technology and ever-evolving client needs are among the factors that have opened up opportunities for players who are willing to move quickly on new technology. One of the banks leading the innovative charge towards new methods of banking in Canada is CIBC—the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. The bank traces its history back to 1867—the year of Canada’s Confederation. Headquartered at Commerce Court in Toronto, Ontario, CIBC operates three primary lines of business: Retail and Business Banking, Wealth Management and Wholesale Banking. The bank furthermore has a number of international operations spanning across the US, the Caribbean, Asia and the UK. Serving more than 11 million clients across the globe with a workforce numbering over 40,000, CIBC currently ranks at number 172 on the Forbes Global 2000 listing and was named by Bloomberg Markets magazine as the strongest bank in Canada and North America, as well as the third strongest bank in the world, in May 2012.        
Despite being steeped in tradition, CIBC’s track record leans towards future thinking and innovation, most recently being a first mover in the next wave of banking innovation for Canadians by offering services on mobile devices for use in a broad range of activities, from banking to paying for the morning coffee. The moves have come as the relatively stable Canadian financial-services industry has faced a significant shakeup—resulting from changing client needs and increasingly efficient emerging technologies. 
CIBC was the first to deliver a mobile-banking app to its clients
Key to providing effective solutions across all areas of the bank is a broader focus on innovation. CIBC is renowned for its cutting-edge approach; constantly striving to deliver the very best possible customer-focussed solutions has made CIBC an industry leader in mobile-financial services. The bank was the first to deliver a mobile-banking app to its clients, and later followed suit with a first-of-its-kind mobile-payment app—allowing clients to pay thousands of merchants in Canada simply by waving their smartphone at the checkout counter. The bank has also gone a step further, delivering eDeposit functionality in 2013—allowing a client to snap a photo of a cheque and have it deposited to his or her account without ever visiting the branch. Business clients have also benefited. The bank’s latest innovation allows business clients to deposit cash to their bank accounts without the cash actually leaving their stores. This virtual cash-deposit service (accomplished with a special in-store safe and a secure link to CIBC) is a far cry from the traditional daily run to the bank with the day’s receipts.
CIBC has established itself as a leader in Canadian retail banking based on its superior ability to provide clients with innovative solutions, which are increasingly becoming integral to client relationships. CIBC applies a strategic focus on making banking easy, personalized and flexible—a key differentiator from its competitors. All the while, in all areas of the business, CIBC is centred on applying the highest calibre of expert advice and problem-solving talent towards meeting client demands. 
CIBC online or mobile banking app
At the heart of the operational framework at CIBC is a focus on the client. Within the bank’s retail division, enhancing the client experience is entrenched in strategy—meaning that all decisions about new services and products must pass through the filter of how it benefits clients, both today and in the future. The bank seeks to ensure clients have a positive experience through whichever channel they choose to carry out their banking, recognizing the shift among consumers to take care of routine transactions through remote channels such as online or mobile banking, while preferring in-person discussions for more significant decisions about financial planning. 
The bank’s recent foray into mobile technology is not the first time it has taken the lead on new innovations. In 1969, CIBC brought the first automated cash dispenser to Canadians, a forerunner of the ATMs we use today. At the time, 24-hour access to cash was a very new concept for clients and employees. Others soon followed, and CIBC now has almost 4,000 bank machines in their across-country network, according to the bank’s latest figures.
When it comes to managing the balance between face-to-face interactions and providing convenient technological solutions, CIBC has ensured that branches remain an integral component in the client experience. CIBC has invested in enhancements to processes that will allow for more productive interactions in branches whilst maintaining offerings of face-to-face personal service, where that is the preferred method of customers. In 1983, CIBC was the first bank in Canada to leverage personal computers for use by tellers. In 2014, CIBC launched the COMPASS system—a new multi-product sales origination platform—enabling more effective conversations between advisors and clients by bringing together a number of legacy systems into a single user-friendly interface that allows an adviser to better understand a client’s needs and automatically suggest solutions that are relevant to the client, including pre-approved credit where appropriate. This helps CIBC deepen client relationships, and results from the system rollout in 2014 have been positive—indicating that interactions are more productive and take less time, enhancing both the client and employee experience. CIBC is focussed on incorporating innovations aimed at leveraging automation in branch services to enhance face-to-face interactions with clients rather than replacing them altogether. 
By providing access, convenience and flexibility in banking, CIBC has established a leadership position in this area of banking. Clients, media and other stakeholders now recognize CIBC as being the leader in retail-banking innovations in the Canadian market, and subsequently the bank is often consulted about new technologies and the potential they have to shape the future of banking in Canada. 
The bank has built on this momentum through acquisitions and strategic partnerships. CIBC announced a deal to buy a CAD $2.1-billion credit-card portfolio from Citigroup’s Citibank Canada MasterCard business in 2010 and reached an agreement to acquire Atlantic Trust in April 2013. 
The “Double Double” card 
The bank also recently unveiled a number of consumer-focused business partnerships aimed at extending the reach of the bank’s services. An innovative new credit card called the “Double Double” card is a partnership with Tim Hortons, the largest quick-service chain in Canada (the namesake of a former Canadian hockey player—it’s larger than McDonald’s in Canada). The card has dual-button technology, lighting up when the customer chooses to pay by credit or use rewards to get a free coffee or baked goods at one of the chain’s 4,000 plus restaurants. The bank also signed up to be the exclusive partner for the Greater Toronto Airport Authority—meaning it’s the only bank able to operate at Canada’s busiest airport hub in Toronto. With 37 million passengers coming through each year, the bank has a captive audience and an opportunity to turn waiting time into client-relationship opportunities. 
Whilst maintaining a laser-sharp focus on business development and innovation, CIBC also works on a number of corporate social-responsibility projects in an effort to support the local community and social development. As an example initiative, CIBC is the lead sponsor of the CIBC Run for the Cure, the largest single-day fundraiser in Canada. 127,000 participants joined in the 2014 run, raising more than $25 million for breast-cancer research. CIBC also contributes to the United Way, which supports local agencies that provide aid to those in need through services such as food banks, shelters, community-counselling centres and many other services. 
The Canadian banking industry is held in high regard globally, due to a significant extent to the stability shown during the recent financial crisis. The banking sector has achieved strong growth over the past few decades—with overall profits for the six biggest Canadian banks exceeding a record-breaking amount of CAD $30 billion. Over the next few years, the challenge will be to navigate the new economic and competitive conditions as the sector becomes increasingly interconnected and globalised. Banks must now consider both local and global economic conditions in their strategic planning and positioning to maintain profitability. They must also address non-traditional competitors. As new forms of payments make their way into the global payments ecosystem, the likes of Apple and Google may well be competitors just as much as another bank. 
In particular there are a number of challenges for the Canadian banking sector that CIBC must target head-on to maintain, and possibly further, its position within the sector. The domination of the Canadian retail-banking industry by five national banks, including CIBC, provides a strong centralised backbone to the Canadian financial system. However, this structure also poses a number of challenges in terms of differentiating banks from one another. CIBC has been able and quick to recognise and address the evolving needs of clients through cutting-edge innovation and development. Only by continuing to focus on product development and service innovation will CIBC maintain its success in these areas and continue to stand out from its competitors. CIBC is positioned to capitalise on a range of market opportunities. To date CIBC has been a leader in adapting to meet client needs effectively and efficiently. Crucial to properly capturing the potential opportunities over the horizon, both long and short term, will be the bank’s ability to continue to innovate, evolve and expand to meet customer needs and to incorporate technological enhancements into day-to-day operations successfully as it has done so well to date.

History[edit]
The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, as it is known today, came into being in 1961. The bank was formed through the merger of the Canadian Bank of Commerce and the Imperial Bank of Canada. At the time, they were two of Canada's largest banks.
Origins[edit]




Commerce Building (c. 1930), now known as Commerce Court North in Toronto


Main articles: Canadian Bank of Commerce and Imperial Bank of Canada
The Honourable William McMaster founded the Canadian Bank of Commerce which opened on May 15, 1867, in Toronto as competition for the Bank of Montreal; by 1874 it had 24 branches.
The Imperial Bank of Canada opened in Toronto on March 18, 1875, founded by former Commerce Vice-president Henry Stark Howland.
By the end of 1895, the Canadian Bank of Commerce had grown to 58 branches and the Imperial Bank of Canada to 18.
The 1896 gold strike in the Yukon prompted the Dominion Government to ask the Canadian Bank of Commerce to open a branch in Dawson City. Acquisitions in the 1920s caused the Commerce Bank to become one of the strongest branch networks in Canada with over 700 local branches; and the bank opened international branches in Cuba, Jamaica, Barbados and Trinidad during the same period.
Wood, Gundy & Company, the precursor of CIBC's investment banking arm, opened its doors on February 1, 1905. During World War I, it took a prominent and active role in the organization of Victory Loans.
The Canadian Bank of Commerce opened its new head office in Toronto in 1931. An observation gallery on the 32nd floor attracted visitors who could get an aerial view of the city.
In 1936, the Commerce was the first Canadian bank to establish a personal loans department.
Following World War II, both banks opened new branches. Although the banks had been barred from the mortgage business since 1871, the Canadian government now called upon them to provide mortgage services. So, in 1954, Canadian banks started offering mortgages for new construction.

In 1960, Imperial chairman Stuart Mackersy approached Neil McKinnon the President of the Commerce with a proposal to merge the two banks. This followed a decade of expansion in the Canadian economy and Canada's capitalization of the industrialization of its natural resources. They quickly reached a deal between the two banks.




The newly merged CIBC commissioned a new logo to commemorate its 100th year of operation. The "chevron" logo was in use until 1994[12]


On June 1, 1961, the Canadian Bank of Commerce and the Imperial Bank of Canada merged to form the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce with over 1,200 branches across Canada. The new bank possessed the greatest resources and the most branches of any bank in the country.
Following the merger, the new bank commissioned a new head office. While planning to retain Commerce Court North, the bank hired architect I. M. Pei to design a three-building complex. The result was Commerce Court consisting of a landscaped courtyard complementing the existing building and included the newly built 786 feet (240 m) Commerce Court West. When completed in 1973, the 57-storey building was the tallest in Canada, and the largest stainless-steel-clad building in the world.
In 1967, both Canada and CIBC celebrated their centenaries and CIBC was the only chartered bank to have a branch on-site at Expo 67. Also at this time computerization began to change banking services and the Yonge and Bloor branch in Toronto was the first Canadian bank branch to update customer bank books via computer. This also marked the introduction of inter-branch banking. Before the decade was out, CIBC had introduced the first 24-hour cash dispenser, which would eventually become the ATM.
Changes to federal and provincial regulations ending the separation of banks, investment dealers, trust companies and insurance companies came in 1987. CIBC quickly took advantage of this and became the first Canadian bank to operate an investment dealer, CIBC Securities, offering services to the public.
In 1988, CIBC acquired a majority interest in Wood Gundy which brought a well-respected name and reputation in underwriting. Shortly thereafter, the corporation merged Wood Gundy and CIBC Securities under the name CIBC Wood Gundy which became CIBC Oppenheimer in 1997[13] and later, CIBC World Markets.
In 1992, CIBC introduced automated telephone banking; in 1995 the bank launched its website, and shortly thereafter began offering banking services online. In 1998, CIBC joined with Loblaws to create President's Choice Financial which it launched in 28 Ottawa area stores.
Present[edit]
CIBC agreed to merge with the Toronto-Dominion Bank in 1998. However the Government of Canada, at the recommendation of then Finance Minister Paul Martin, blocked the merger – as well as another proposed by the Bank of Montreal with the Royal Bank of Canada – as not in the best interest of Canadians.[14]
CIBC sold its corporate and purchasing credit card business to U.S. Bank Canada in October 2006 which joined it with business charge cards it previously acquired from Royal Bank of Canada.
In 2006, the stock ticker symbol on the New York Stock Exchange changed from BCM to CM to bring it in line with the ticker symbol on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
In December 2006, CIBC acquired majority control of its publicly held joint venture FirstCaribbean International Bank for just over US$1 billion, (Bds$2 billion), when it purchased the 43.7% stake owned by Barclays Bank.[15] CIBC rebranded the division CIBC FirstCaribbean International Bank in 2011.[16]
On February 12, 2009, the Trinidad and Tobago Express reported that CIBC was pursuing discussions to buy CL Financial's stake in the Republic Bank of Trinidad and Tobago.[17] As part of a "bail out" agreement of CL Financial by the government of Trinidad and Tobago during the Global financial crisis of 2008–2009, the corporation was required to sell Republic and other assets. As of February 2011, CL Financial had yet to agree to a sale.[18]
In February, 2010 CIBC became the first chartered bank in Canada to launch a mobile banking iPhone App. It surpassed 100,000 downloads in just over one month following launch, with over 1 million client logins to CIBC Mobile Banking since its introduction.[19][20]
Four months later, the bank announced it signed a deal to buy a C$2.1-billion credit card portfolio from Citigroup's Citibank Canada MasterCard business.[21]
Finally in October of that year, CIBC announced that it would be the first bank in Canada to introduce the internationally used Visa-branded debit card.[22]
In April 2013, CIBC reached an agreement with Invesco to acquire Atlantic Trust, the company's wealth management unit for US$210 million.[23]
CIBC announced in June 2016 that it would acquire the Chicago-based commercial bank PrivateBancorp for US$3.8 billion.[24]
In April 2017, it was announced that CIBC would be moving its headquarters to CIBC Square.[25]

Caribbean and the West Indies[edit]
Main article: CIBC FirstCaribbean International Bank




CIBC FirstCaribbean branch in Bridgetown, Barbados


In 1920, Canadian Bank of Commerce established its first branches in the West Indies in Bridgetown, Barbados and in Kingston, Jamaica. That same year it also opened branches in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Havana, Cuba. Its first branch in Mexico City opened in 1910. In 1957, the bank opened a branch in Nassau, the Bahamas, and in the subsequent years expanded its operations in Jamaica.
Between 1963 and 1988, the bank expanded its branch network in Barbados opened branches in St. Vincent, Antigua, and St Lucia. In 1988, CIBC sold 45% of its shares in CIBC Jamaica via a public share issue. Between 1993 and 1996, the bank restructured its holdings in the Caribbean, with the incorporation of CIBC West Indies Holdings Limited and CIBC Caribbean Limited. CIBC West Indies Holdings then sold 30% of its shares to the public. In 1997, CIBC issued 5 million shares in CIBC Bahamas Limited to the public.
On October 31, 2001, Barclays and CIBC agreed to combine their Caribbean operations to establish FirstCaribbean International Bank. CIBC bought Barclays' stake in 2006 to give it control of approximately 92% of FirstCaribbean, which was rebranded as CIBC FirstCaribbean International Bank.[16] In 2010, CIBC acquired a 22.5% equity of Butterfield Bank of Bermuda.[27]

Miscellaneous[edit]
Li Ka Shing, Hong Kong billionaire was the largest foreign shareholder in the bank for over two decades, but in early 2005 he sold his portion (est. C$1.2 billion) to establish a Canadian charity, the Li Ka Shing Foundation. CIBC was Mr. Li's choice for financing many of his Canadian ventures, like Husky Energy. Mr. Li had reportedly backed personal and commercial banking head Holger Kluge to succeed Al Flood as CEO of CIBC in 1999.
Corporate governance[edit]
CIBC is well known for its publicized battles of succession to the top position of President and CEO (formerly styled chairman and CEO until 2003 when the positions were separated). When Al Flood became CEO, one of his first acts was to fire his chief rival Paul Cantor. In 1999, the company saw a competition between Wood Gundy (now CIBC World Markets) chief John S. Hunkin and Personal/Commercial banking head Holger Kluge, with Kluge retiring after Hunkin became chairman. In February 2004, Hunkin forced his friend and heir-apparent, David Kassie, to resign as chairman and CEO of World Markets after several scandals in the US. Both men had waived their bonuses in 2002 after that year produced the worst results in the history of the bank. Kassie afterwards founded Genuity Capital and was alleged to have raided 20 key employees from World Markets for his new startup, causing CIBC to file suit.[29] Gerald T. McCaughey became Kassie's replacement heading World Markets and in February 2004, was promoted to President and chief operating officer, assuring his succession as CEO.[30] Shortly after assuming his position, McCaughey reportedly dismissed Jill Denham, Vice Chair of Retail Markets and a potential rival for the CEO post. Denham was reportedly a close ally of Hunkin and Kassie and McCaughey wanted to build his own senior executive team.[31]

Credit agency ratings[edit]
On October 26, 2012, rating agency Moody's Investors Service announced it would review the long-term ratings of CIBC along with other Canadian banks, because of concerns about consumer debt levels, housing prices, a sizable exposure to capital markets and more. The review resulted in a downgrade from Aa2 to Aa3 on January 28, 2013.[37]
Settlements and controversies[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (August 2010)


Enron[edit]
On December 22, 2003, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) fined CIBC US$80 million for its role in the manipulation of Enron financial statements. This consists of $37.5 million to repay ill-gotten gains, a $37.5 million penalty and $5 million in interest. The money is intended to be returned to Enron fraud victims pursuant to the Fair Fund provisions of Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.[38]
The SEC also sued three of CIBC's executives. CIBC Executive Vice President Daniel Ferguson and former CIBC Executive Director Mark Wolf agreed to settle for US$563,000 and US$60,000, respectively. Ian Schottlaender, former managing director in CIBC's corporate leveraged finance group in New York initially contested the charges[39] but on July 12, 2004 he agreed to pay US$528,750 as well as be barred from serving as an officer or director of a publicly traded company for a period of five years.[40] Under these agreements the individuals neither admit nor deny wrongdoing.
The SEC complaint charges that "CIBC and the three executives with having helped Enron to mislead its investors through a series of complex structured finance transactions over a period of several years preceding Enron's bankruptcy." The agreement reached between the SEC and CIBC permanently enjoins CIBC from violating the antifraud, books and records, and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws.[38][39]
On August 2, 2005, CIBC paid US$2.4 billion to settle a class action lawsuit brought by a group of pension funds and investment managers, including the University of California, which claims that "systematic fraud by Enron and its officers led to the loss of billions and the collapse of the company."[41]
Market timing[edit]
On July 25, 2005 CIBC confirmed it would pay US$125 million to settle an investigation into its role in the 2003 Mutual-fund scandal. Linda Chatman Thomsen, director of the SEC's division of enforcement, said, "by knowingly financing customers' late trading and market timing, as well as providing financing in amounts far greater than the law allows, CIHI and World Markets boosted their customers' trading profits at the expense of long-term mutual fund shareholders."[42] Under the settlement, CIBC neither admitted nor denied the allegations.[43]
Visa cardholders[edit]
On August 27, 2004, CIBC confirmed that it would settle a class-action lawsuit on behalf of CIBC Visa cardholders. The plaintiffs alleged that the conversion of foreign-currency transactions resulted in an undisclosed or inadequately disclosed mark-up. After approval by an Ontario Superior Court judge, CIBC announced October 15, 2004, that the settlement would result in the bank paying C$13.85 million to its cardholders, $1 million to the United Way, $1.65 million to the Class Action Fund of the Law Society of Upper Canada, and $3 million in legal fees. The bank also announced that it has not admitted any liability and is settling to avoid further litigation with its cardholders.[44]
Voluntary refund of erroneous charges[edit]
On May 20, 2004, CIBC announced that it would refund C$24 million to some of its customers as a result of erroneous overdraft and mortgage charges which were discovered in the course of an internal review. "This is being done as part of CIBC's effort to correct its error and to ensure that it distributes to customers all of the money it received in error," the bank said.[45]
In a similar incident, CIBC announced April 27, 2006 that it's refunding an additional C$27 million to about 200,000 clients who were overcharged for certain overdraft fees and other borrowing transactions, some of which date back to 1993. In cases where clients were undercharged, the bank decided not to seek reimbursement.[46]
Privacy[edit]
2005[edit]
On April 18, 2005 the Privacy Commissioner of Canada expressed disappointment in the way CIBC dealt with incidents involving the bank misdirecting faxes containing customers' personal information.[47] One involved misdirecting faxes to a scrap yard operator in West Virginia from 2001 to 2004. The misdirected faxes contained the social security numbers, home addresses, phone numbers, and detailed bank account data of several hundred bank customers.[48]
The second incident involved a Dorval businessman and allegedly took place from 2000 to 2004. In both cases, the commissioner noted that the bank did not inform the affected clients, whose personal information was compromised, until the incidents became public and an investigation was underway.[49]
Within days of reports by CTV News and The Globe and Mail, CIBC management announced a directive that banned employees from using fax machines to transmit any documents containing confidential customer information.[50]
2007[edit]
On January 18, 2007, CIBC Asset Management announced that the personal information of about 470,000 current and former clients of Talvest Mutual Funds, a CIBC subsidiary, had gone missing. The information may have included client names, addresses, signatures, dates of birth, bank account numbers, beneficiary information and/or Social Insurance Numbers.[51] The incident stemmed from the disappearance of a hard drive containing information on "the process used to open and administer" customer accounts as it was traveling between the bank's Montreal and Toronto offices.[52] The Privacy Commissioner of Canada stated, "Although I appreciate that the bank notified us of this incident and that it is working cooperatively with my Office, I am nevertheless deeply troubled, especially given the magnitude of this breach, which puts at risk the personal information of hundreds of thousands of Canadians." She immediately launched a privacy investigation.[53]
Employee overtime[edit]
In June 2007, Dara Fresco, a Toronto teller, named CIBC in a $600 million class-action lawsuit regarding the lack of overtime pay to its customer service staff. Fresco v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce is a class action brought on behalf of current and former non-management, non-unionized employees of CIBC in Canada who are or were tellers or other front-line customer service employees working at CIBC retail branch office across Canada. The lawsuit alleges that class members are assigned heavier workloads than could be completed within their standard working hours. They were required or permitted to work overtime to meet the demands of their jobs and CIBC failed to pay for the overtime work in direct contravention of the Canada Labour Code under which they are regulated.[54]
The Ontario Superior Court dismissed the suit June 18, 2012, stating the evidence '"provides no basis in fact that there is a systemic practice of unpaid overtime at CIBC."'[55]
An employee of the Bank of Nova Scotia (Scotiabank) filed a similar suit which the Superior Court certified. Fresco and Scotiabank each appealed their adverse, and contradictory, rulings and the Ontario Court of Appeal ruled that both cases could proceed.[56]
Both banks appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada which on March 21, 2013, denied their requests and allowed the lawsuits to proceed.[57] The cases are awaiting further action as of late 2013.

History[edit]
The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, as it is known today, came into being in 1961. The bank was formed through the merger of the Canadian Bank of Commerce and the Imperial Bank of Canada. At the time, they were two of Canada's largest banks.
Origins[edit]




Commerce Building (c. 1930), now known as Commerce Court North in Toronto


Main articles: Canadian Bank of Commerce and Imperial Bank of Canada
The Honourable William McMaster founded the Canadian Bank of Commerce which opened on May 15, 1867, in Toronto as competition for the Bank of Montreal; by 1874 it had 24 branches.
The Imperial Bank of Canada opened in Toronto on March 18, 1875, founded by former Commerce Vice-president Henry Stark Howland.
By the end of 1895, the Canadian Bank of Commerce had grown to 58 branches and the Imperial Bank of Canada to 18.
The 1896 gold strike in the Yukon prompted the Dominion Government to ask the Canadian Bank of Commerce to open a branch in Dawson City. Acquisitions in the 1920s caused the Commerce Bank to become one of the strongest branch networks in Canada with over 700 local branches; and the bank opened international branches in Cuba, Jamaica, Barbados and Trinidad during the same period.
Wood, Gundy & Company, the precursor of CIBC's investment banking arm, opened its doors on February 1, 1905. During World War I, it took a prominent and active role in the organization of Victory Loans.
The Canadian Bank of Commerce opened its new head office in Toronto in 1931. An observation gallery on the 32nd floor attracted visitors who could get an aerial view of the city.
In 1936, the Commerce was the first Canadian bank to establish a personal loans department.
Following World War II, both banks opened new branches. Although the banks had been barred from the mortgage business since 1871, the Canadian government now called upon them to provide mortgage services. So, in 1954, Canadian banks started offering mortgages for new construction.
Forming Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce[edit]
In 1960, Imperial chairman Stuart Mackersy approached Neil McKinnon the President of the Commerce with a proposal to merge the two banks. This followed a decade of expansion in the Canadian economy and Canada's capitalization of the industrialization of its natural resources. They quickly reached a deal between the two banks.




The newly merged CIBC commissioned a new logo to commemorate its 100th year of operation. The "chevron" logo was in use until 1994[12]


On June 1, 1961, the Canadian Bank of Commerce and the Imperial Bank of Canada merged to form the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce with over 1,200 branches across Canada. The new bank possessed the greatest resources and the most branches of any bank in the country.
Following the merger, the new bank commissioned a new head office. While planning to retain Commerce Court North, the bank hired architect I. M. Pei to design a three-building complex. The result was Commerce Court consisting of a landscaped courtyard complementing the existing building and included the newly built 786 feet (240 m) Commerce Court West. When completed in 1973, the 57-storey building was the tallest in Canada, and the largest stainless-steel-clad building in the world.
In 1967, both Canada and CIBC celebrated their centenaries and CIBC was the only chartered bank to have a branch on-site at Expo 67. Also at this time computerization began to change banking services and the Yonge and Bloor branch in Toronto was the first Canadian bank branch to update customer bank books via computer. This also marked the introduction of inter-branch banking. Before the decade was out, CIBC had introduced the first 24-hour cash dispenser, which would eventually become the ATM.
Changes to federal and provincial regulations ending the separation of banks, investment dealers, trust companies and insurance companies came in 1987. CIBC quickly took advantage of this and became the first Canadian bank to operate an investment dealer, CIBC Securities, offering services to the public.
In 1988, CIBC acquired a majority interest in Wood Gundy which brought a well-respected name and reputation in underwriting. Shortly thereafter, the corporation merged Wood Gundy and CIBC Securities under the name CIBC Wood Gundy which became CIBC Oppenheimer in 1997[13] and later, CIBC World Markets.
In 1992, CIBC introduced automated telephone banking; in 1995 the bank launched its website, and shortly thereafter began offering banking services online. In 1998, CIBC joined with Loblaws to create President's Choice Financial which it launched in 28 Ottawa area stores.
Present[edit]
CIBC agreed to merge with the Toronto-Dominion Bank in 1998. However the Government of Canada, at the recommendation of then Finance Minister Paul Martin, blocked the merger – as well as another proposed by the Bank of Montreal with the Royal Bank of Canada – as not in the best interest of Canadians.[14]
CIBC sold its corporate and purchasing credit card business to U.S. Bank Canada in October 2006 which joined it with business charge cards it previously acquired from Royal Bank of Canada.
In 2006, the stock ticker symbol on the New York Stock Exchange changed from BCM to CM to bring it in line with the ticker symbol on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
In December 2006, CIBC acquired majority control of its publicly held joint venture FirstCaribbean International Bank for just over US$1 billion, (Bds$2 billion), when it purchased the 43.7% stake owned by Barclays Bank.[15] CIBC rebranded the division CIBC FirstCaribbean International Bank in 2011.[16]
On February 12, 2009, the Trinidad and Tobago Express reported that CIBC was pursuing discussions to buy CL Financial's stake in the Republic Bank of Trinidad and Tobago.[17] As part of a "bail out" agreement of CL Financial by the government of Trinidad and Tobago during the Global financial crisis of 2008–2009, the corporation was required to sell Republic and other assets. As of February 2011, CL Financial had yet to agree to a sale.[18]
In February, 2010 CIBC became the first chartered bank in Canada to launch a mobile banking iPhone App. It surpassed 100,000 downloads in just over one month following launch, with over 1 million client logins to CIBC Mobile Banking since its introduction.[19][20]
Four months later, the bank announced it signed a deal to buy a C$2.1-billion credit card portfolio from Citigroup's Citibank Canada MasterCard business.[21]
Finally in October of that year, CIBC announced that it would be the first bank in Canada to introduce the internationally used Visa-branded debit card.[22]
In April 2013, CIBC reached an agreement with Invesco to acquire Atlantic Trust, the company's wealth management unit for US$210 million.[23]
CIBC announced in June 2016 that it would acquire the Chicago-based commercial bank PrivateBancorp for US$3.8 billion.[24]
In April 2017, it was announced that CIBC would be moving its headquarters to CIBC Square.[25]

In 1920, Canadian Bank of Commerce established its first branches in the West Indies in Bridgetown, Barbados and in Kingston, Jamaica. That same year it also opened branches in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Havana, Cuba. Its first branch in Mexico City opened in 1910. In 1957, the bank opened a branch in Nassau, the Bahamas, and in the subsequent years expanded its operations in Jamaica.
Between 1963 and 1988, the bank expanded its branch network in Barbados opened branches in St. Vincent, Antigua, and St Lucia. In 1988, CIBC sold 45% of its shares in CIBC Jamaica via a public share issue. Between 1993 and 1996, the bank restructured its holdings in the Caribbean, with the incorporation of CIBC West Indies Holdings Limited and CIBC Caribbean Limited. CIBC West Indies Holdings then sold 30% of its shares to the public. In 1997, CIBC issued 5 million shares in CIBC Bahamas Limited to the public.
On October 31, 2001, Barclays and CIBC agreed to combine their Caribbean operations to establish FirstCaribbean International Bank. CIBC bought Barclays' stake in 2006 to give it control of approximately 92% of FirstCaribbean, which was rebranded as CIBC FirstCaribbean International Bank.[16] In 2010, CIBC acquired a 22.5% equity of Butterfield Bank of Bermuda.[27]

Juniper Financial Corporation: The bank acquired the Wilmington, Delaware credit card issuer 2001 and sold to Barclays Bank in 2004[28]

Miscellaneous[edit]
Li Ka Shing, Hong Kong billionaire was the largest foreign shareholder in the bank for over two decades, but in early 2005 he sold his portion (est. C$1.2 billion) to establish a Canadian charity, the Li Ka Shing Foundation. CIBC was Mr. Li's choice for financing many of his Canadian ventures, like Husky Energy. Mr. Li had reportedly backed personal and commercial banking head Holger Kluge to succeed Al Flood as CEO of CIBC in 1999.
Corporate governance[edit]
CIBC is well known for its publicized battles of succession to the top position of President and CEO (formerly styled chairman and CEO until 2003 when the positions were separated). When Al Flood became CEO, one of his first acts was to fire his chief rival Paul Cantor. In 1999, the company saw a competition between Wood Gundy (now CIBC World Markets) chief John S. Hunkin and Personal/Commercial banking head Holger Kluge, with Kluge retiring after Hunkin became chairman. In February 2004, Hunkin forced his friend and heir-apparent, David Kassie, to resign as chairman and CEO of World Markets after several scandals in the US. Both men had waived their bonuses in 2002 after that year produced the worst results in the history of the bank. Kassie afterwards founded Genuity Capital and was alleged to have raided 20 key employees from World Markets for his new startup, causing CIBC to file suit.[29] Gerald T. McCaughey became Kassie's replacement heading World Markets and in February 2004, was promoted to President and chief operating officer, assuring his succession as CEO.[30] Shortly after assuming his position, McCaughey reportedly dismissed Jill Denham, Vice Chair of Retail Markets and a potential rival for the CEO post. Denham was reportedly a close ally of Hunkin and Kassie and McCaughey wanted to build his own senior executive team.[31]

CIBC partnered with Air Canada in 1991 to offer credit cards as part of the airline's loyalty program, Aeroplan. In 2009, the program announced that a new agreement with Toronto-Dominion Bank would be effective January 1, 2014.[34]

Credit agency ratings[edit]
On October 26, 2012, rating agency Moody's Investors Service announced it would review the long-term ratings of CIBC along with other Canadian banks, because of concerns about consumer debt levels, housing prices, a sizable exposure to capital markets and more. The review resulted in a downgrade from Aa2 to Aa3 on January 28, 2013.[37]
Settlements and controversies[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (August 2010)


Enron[edit]
On December 22, 2003, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) fined CIBC US$80 million for its role in the manipulation of Enron financial statements. This consists of $37.5 million to repay ill-gotten gains, a $37.5 million penalty and $5 million in interest. The money is intended to be returned to Enron fraud victims pursuant to the Fair Fund provisions of Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.[38]
The SEC also sued three of CIBC's executives. CIBC Executive Vice President Daniel Ferguson and former CIBC Executive Director Mark Wolf agreed to settle for US$563,000 and US$60,000, respectively. Ian Schottlaender, former managing director in CIBC's corporate leveraged finance group in New York initially contested the charges[39] but on July 12, 2004 he agreed to pay US$528,750 as well as be barred from serving as an officer or director of a publicly traded company for a period of five years.[40] Under these agreements the individuals neither admit nor deny wrongdoing.
The SEC complaint charges that "CIBC and the three executives with having helped Enron to mislead its investors through a series of complex structured finance transactions over a period of several years preceding Enron's bankruptcy." The agreement reached between the SEC and CIBC permanently enjoins CIBC from violating the antifraud, books and records, and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws.[38][39]
On August 2, 2005, CIBC paid US$2.4 billion to settle a class action lawsuit brought by a group of pension funds and investment managers, including the University of California, which claims that "systematic fraud by Enron and its officers led to the loss of billions and the collapse of the company."[41]
Market timing[edit]
On July 25, 2005 CIBC confirmed it would pay US$125 million to settle an investigation into its role in the 2003 Mutual-fund scandal. Linda Chatman Thomsen, director of the SEC's division of enforcement, said, "by knowingly financing customers' late trading and market timing, as well as providing financing in amounts far greater than the law allows, CIHI and World Markets boosted their customers' trading profits at the expense of long-term mutual fund shareholders."[42] Under the settlement, CIBC neither admitted nor denied the allegations.[43]
Visa cardholders[edit]
On August 27, 2004, CIBC confirmed that it would settle a class-action lawsuit on behalf of CIBC Visa cardholders. The plaintiffs alleged that the conversion of foreign-currency transactions resulted in an undisclosed or inadequately disclosed mark-up. After approval by an Ontario Superior Court judge, CIBC announced October 15, 2004, that the settlement would result in the bank paying C$13.85 million to its cardholders, $1 million to the United Way, $1.65 million to the Class Action Fund of the Law Society of Upper Canada, and $3 million in legal fees. The bank also announced that it has not admitted any liability and is settling to avoid further litigation with its cardholders.[44]
Voluntary refund of erroneous charges[edit]
On May 20, 2004, CIBC announced that it would refund C$24 million to some of its customers as a result of erroneous overdraft and mortgage charges which were discovered in the course of an internal review. "This is being done as part of CIBC's effort to correct its error and to ensure that it distributes to customers all of the money it received in error," the bank said.[45]
In a similar incident, CIBC announced April 27, 2006 that it's refunding an additional C$27 million to about 200,000 clients who were overcharged for certain overdraft fees and other borrowing transactions, some of which date back to 1993. In cases where clients were undercharged, the bank decided not to seek reimbursement.[46]
Privacy[edit]
2005[edit]
On April 18, 2005 the Privacy Commissioner of Canada expressed disappointment in the way CIBC dealt with incidents involving the bank misdirecting faxes containing customers' personal information.[47] One involved misdirecting faxes to a scrap yard operator in West Virginia from 2001 to 2004. The misdirected faxes contained the social security numbers, home addresses, phone numbers, and detailed bank account data of several hundred bank customers.[48]
The second incident involved a Dorval businessman and allegedly took place from 2000 to 2004. In both cases, the commissioner noted that the bank did not inform the affected clients, whose personal information was compromised, until the incidents became public and an investigation was underway.[49]
Within days of reports by CTV News and The Globe and Mail, CIBC management announced a directive that banned employees from using fax machines to transmit any documents containing confidential customer information.[50]
2007[edit]
On January 18, 2007, CIBC Asset Management announced that the personal information of about 470,000 current and former clients of Talvest Mutual Funds, a CIBC subsidiary, had gone missing. The information may have included client names, addresses, signatures, dates of birth, bank account numbers, beneficiary information and/or Social Insurance Numbers.[51] The incident stemmed from the disappearance of a hard drive containing information on "the process used to open and administer" customer accounts as it was traveling between the bank's Montreal and Toronto offices.[52] The Privacy Commissioner of Canada stated, "Although I appreciate that the bank notified us of this incident and that it is working cooperatively with my Office, I am nevertheless deeply troubled, especially given the magnitude of this breach, which puts at risk the personal information of hundreds of thousands of Canadians." She immediately launched a privacy investigation.[53]
Employee overtime[edit]
In June 2007, Dara Fresco, a Toronto teller, named CIBC in a $600 million class-action lawsuit regarding the lack of overtime pay to its customer service staff. Fresco v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce is a class action brought on behalf of current and former non-management, non-unionized employees of CIBC in Canada who are or were tellers or other front-line customer service employees working at CIBC retail branch office across Canada. The lawsuit alleges that class members are assigned heavier workloads than could be completed within their standard working hours. They were required or permitted to work overtime to meet the demands of their jobs and CIBC failed to pay for the overtime work in direct contravention of the Canada Labour Code under which they are regulated.[54]
The Ontario Superior Court dismissed the suit June 18, 2012, stating the evidence '"provides no basis in fact that there is a systemic practice of unpaid overtime at CIBC."'[55]
An employee of the Bank of Nova Scotia (Scotiabank) filed a similar suit which the Superior Court certified. Fresco and Scotiabank each appealed their adverse, and contradictory, rulings and the Ontario Court of Appeal ruled that both cases could proceed.[56]
Both banks appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada which on March 21, 2013, denied their requests and allowed the lawsuits to proceed.[57] The cases are awaiting further action as of late 2013.

History[edit]
The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, as it is known today, came into being in 1961. The bank was formed through the merger of the Canadian Bank of Commerce and the Imperial Bank of Canada. At the time, they were two of Canada's largest banks.
Origins[edit]




Commerce Building (c. 1930), now known as Commerce Court North in Toronto


Main articles: Canadian Bank of Commerce and Imperial Bank of Canada
The Honourable William McMaster founded the Canadian Bank of Commerce which opened on May 15, 1867, in Toronto as competition for the Bank of Montreal; by 1874 it had 24 branches.
The Imperial Bank of Canada opened in Toronto on March 18, 1875, founded by former Commerce Vice-president Henry Stark Howland.
By the end of 1895, the Canadian Bank of Commerce had grown to 58 branches and the Imperial Bank of Canada to 18.
The 1896 gold strike in the Yukon prompted the Dominion Government to ask the Canadian Bank of Commerce to open a branch in Dawson City. Acquisitions in the 1920s caused the Commerce Bank to become one of the strongest branch networks in Canada with over 700 local branches; and the bank opened international branches in Cuba, Jamaica, Barbados and Trinidad during the same period.
Wood, Gundy & Company, the precursor of CIBC's investment banking arm, opened its doors on February 1, 1905. During World War I, it took a prominent and active role in the organization of Victory Loans.
The Canadian Bank of Commerce opened its new head office in Toronto in 1931. An observation gallery on the 32nd floor attracted visitors who could get an aerial view of the city.
In 1936, the Commerce was the first Canadian bank to establish a personal loans department.
Following World War II, both banks opened new branches. Although the banks had been barred from the mortgage business since 1871, the Canadian government now called upon them to provide mortgage services. So, in 1954, Canadian banks started offering mortgages for new construction.
Forming Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce[edit]
In 1960, Imperial chairman Stuart Mackersy approached Neil McKinnon the President of the Commerce with a proposal to merge the two banks. This followed a decade of expansion in the Canadian economy and Canada's capitalization of the industrialization of its natural resources. They quickly reached a deal between the two banks.




The newly merged CIBC commissioned a new logo to commemorate its 100th year of operation. The "chevron" logo was in use until 1994[12]


On June 1, 1961, the Canadian Bank of Commerce and the Imperial Bank of Canada merged to form the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce with over 1,200 branches across Canada. The new bank possessed the greatest resources and the most branches of any bank in the country.
Following the merger, the new bank commissioned a new head office. While planning to retain Commerce Court North, the bank hired architect I. M. Pei to design a three-building complex. The result was Commerce Court consisting of a landscaped courtyard complementing the existing building and included the newly built 786 feet (240 m) Commerce Court West. When completed in 1973, the 57-storey building was the tallest in Canada, and the largest stainless-steel-clad building in the world.
In 1967, both Canada and CIBC celebrated their centenaries and CIBC was the only chartered bank to have a branch on-site at Expo 67. Also at this time computerization began to change banking services and the Yonge and Bloor branch in Toronto was the first Canadian bank branch to update customer bank books via computer. This also marked the introduction of inter-branch banking. Before the decade was out, CIBC had introduced the first 24-hour cash dispenser, which would eventually become the ATM.
Changes to federal and provincial regulations ending the separation of banks, investment dealers, trust companies and insurance companies came in 1987. CIBC quickly took advantage of this and became the first Canadian bank to operate an investment dealer, CIBC Securities, offering services to the public.
In 1988, CIBC acquired a majority interest in Wood Gundy which brought a well-respected name and reputation in underwriting. Shortly thereafter, the corporation merged Wood Gundy and CIBC Securities under the name CIBC Wood Gundy which became CIBC Oppenheimer in 1997[13] and later, CIBC World Markets.
In 1992, CIBC introduced automated telephone banking; in 1995 the bank launched its website, and shortly thereafter began offering banking services online. In 1998, CIBC joined with Loblaws to create President's Choice Financial which it launched in 28 Ottawa area stores.
Present[edit]
CIBC agreed to merge with the Toronto-Dominion Bank in 1998. However the Government of Canada, at the recommendation of then Finance Minister Paul Martin, blocked the merger – as well as another proposed by the Bank of Montreal with the Royal Bank of Canada – as not in the best interest of Canadians.[14]
CIBC sold its corporate and purchasing credit card business to U.S. Bank Canada in October 2006 which joined it with business charge cards it previously acquired from Royal Bank of Canada.
In 2006, the stock ticker symbol on the New York Stock Exchange changed from BCM to CM to bring it in line with the ticker symbol on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
In December 2006, CIBC acquired majority control of its publicly held joint venture FirstCaribbean International Bank for just over US$1 billion, (Bds$2 billion), when it purchased the 43.7% stake owned by Barclays Bank.[15] CIBC rebranded the division CIBC FirstCaribbean International Bank in 2011.[16]
On February 12, 2009, the Trinidad and Tobago Express reported that CIBC was pursuing discussions to buy CL Financial's stake in the Republic Bank of Trinidad and Tobago.[17] As part of a "bail out" agreement of CL Financial by the government of Trinidad and Tobago during the Global financial crisis of 2008–2009, the corporation was required to sell Republic and other assets. As of February 2011, CL Financial had yet to agree to a sale.[18]
In February, 2010 CIBC became the first chartered bank in Canada to launch a mobile banking iPhone App. It surpassed 100,000 downloads in just over one month following launch, with over 1 million client logins to CIBC Mobile Banking since its introduction.[19][20]
Four months later, the bank announced it signed a deal to buy a C$2.1-billion credit card portfolio from Citigroup's Citibank Canada MasterCard business.[21]
Finally in October of that year, CIBC announced that it would be the first bank in Canada to introduce the internationally used Visa-branded debit card.[22]
In April 2013, CIBC reached an agreement with Invesco to acquire Atlantic Trust, the company's wealth management unit for US$210 million.[23]
CIBC announced in June 2016 that it would acquire the Chicago-based commercial bank PrivateBancorp for US$3.8 billion.[24]
In April 2017, it was announced that CIBC would be moving its headquarters to CIBC Square.[25]

Caribbean and the West Indies[edit]
Main article: CIBC FirstCaribbean International Bank




CIBC FirstCaribbean branch in Bridgetown, Barbados


In 1920, Canadian Bank of Commerce established its first branches in the West Indies in Bridgetown, Barbados and in Kingston, Jamaica. That same year it also opened branches in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Havana, Cuba. Its first branch in Mexico City opened in 1910. In 1957, the bank opened a branch in Nassau, the Bahamas, and in the subsequent years expanded its operations in Jamaica.
Between 1963 and 1988, the bank expanded its branch network in Barbados opened branches in St. Vincent, Antigua, and St Lucia. In 1988, CIBC sold 45% of its shares in CIBC Jamaica via a public share issue. Between 1993 and 1996, the bank restructured its holdings in the Caribbean, with the incorporation of CIBC West Indies Holdings Limited and CIBC Caribbean Limited. CIBC West Indies Holdings then sold 30% of its shares to the public. In 1997, CIBC issued 5 million shares in CIBC Bahamas Limited to the public.
On October 31, 2001, Barclays and CIBC agreed to combine their Caribbean operations to establish FirstCaribbean International Bank. CIBC bought Barclays' stake in 2006 to give it control of approximately 92% of FirstCaribbean, which was rebranded as CIBC FirstCaribbean International Bank.[16] In 2010, CIBC acquired a 22.5% equity of Butterfield Bank of Bermuda.[27]

Miscellaneous[edit]
Li Ka Shing, Hong Kong billionaire was the largest foreign shareholder in the bank for over two decades, but in early 2005 he sold his portion (est. C$1.2 billion) to establish a Canadian charity, the Li Ka Shing Foundation. CIBC was Mr. Li's choice for financing many of his Canadian ventures, like Husky Energy. Mr. Li had reportedly backed personal and commercial banking head Holger Kluge to succeed Al Flood as CEO of CIBC in 1999.
Corporate governance[edit]
CIBC is well known for its publicized battles of succession to the top position of President and CEO (formerly styled chairman and CEO until 2003 when the positions were separated). When Al Flood became CEO, one of his first acts was to fire his chief rival Paul Cantor. In 1999, the company saw a competition between Wood Gundy (now CIBC World Markets) chief John S. Hunkin and Personal/Commercial banking head Holger Kluge, with Kluge retiring after Hunkin became chairman. In February 2004, Hunkin forced his friend and heir-apparent, David Kassie, to resign as chairman and CEO of World Markets after several scandals in the US. Both men had waived their bonuses in 2002 after that year produced the worst results in the history of the bank. Kassie afterwards founded Genuity Capital and was alleged to have raided 20 key employees from World Markets for his new startup, causing CIBC to file suit.[29] Gerald T. McCaughey became Kassie's replacement heading World Markets and in February 2004, was promoted to President and chief operating officer, assuring his succession as CEO.[30] Shortly after assuming his position, McCaughey reportedly dismissed Jill Denham, Vice Chair of Retail Markets and a potential rival for the CEO post. Denham was reportedly a close ally of Hunkin and Kassie and McCaughey wanted to build his own senior executive team.[31]

Credit agency ratings[edit]
On October 26, 2012, rating agency Moody's Investors Service announced it would review the long-term ratings of CIBC along with other Canadian banks, because of concerns about consumer debt levels, housing prices, a sizable exposure to capital markets and more. The review resulted in a downgrade from Aa2 to Aa3 on January 28, 2013.[37]
Settlements and controversies[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (August 2010)


Enron[edit]
On December 22, 2003, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) fined CIBC US$80 million for its role in the manipulation of Enron financial statements. This consists of $37.5 million to repay ill-gotten gains, a $37.5 million penalty and $5 million in interest. The money is intended to be returned to Enron fraud victims pursuant to the Fair Fund provisions of Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.[38]
The SEC also sued three of CIBC's executives. CIBC Executive Vice President Daniel Ferguson and former CIBC Executive Director Mark Wolf agreed to settle for US$563,000 and US$60,000, respectively. Ian Schottlaender, former managing director in CIBC's corporate leveraged finance group in New York initially contested the charges[39] but on July 12, 2004 he agreed to pay US$528,750 as well as be barred from serving as an officer or director of a publicly traded company for a period of five years.[40] Under these agreements the individuals neither admit nor deny wrongdoing.
The SEC complaint charges that "CIBC and the three executives with having helped Enron to mislead its investors through a series of complex structured finance transactions over a period of several years preceding Enron's bankruptcy." The agreement reached between the SEC and CIBC permanently enjoins CIBC from violating the antifraud, books and records, and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws.[38][39]
On August 2, 2005, CIBC paid US$2.4 billion to settle a class action lawsuit brought by a group of pension funds and investment managers, including the University of California, which claims that "systematic fraud by Enron and its officers led to the loss of billions and the collapse of the company."[41]
Market timing[edit]
On July 25, 2005 CIBC confirmed it would pay US$125 million to settle an investigation into its role in the 2003 Mutual-fund scandal. Linda Chatman Thomsen, director of the SEC's division of enforcement, said, "by knowingly financing customers' late trading and market timing, as well as providing financing in amounts far greater than the law allows, CIHI and World Markets boosted their customers' trading profits at the expense of long-term mutual fund shareholders."[42] Under the settlement, CIBC neither admitted nor denied the allegations.[43]
Visa cardholders[edit]
On August 27, 2004, CIBC confirmed that it would settle a class-action lawsuit on behalf of CIBC Visa cardholders. The plaintiffs alleged that the conversion of foreign-currency transactions resulted in an undisclosed or inadequately disclosed mark-up. After approval by an Ontario Superior Court judge, CIBC announced October 15, 2004, that the settlement would result in the bank paying C$13.85 million to its cardholders, $1 million to the United Way, $1.65 million to the Class Action Fund of the Law Society of Upper Canada, and $3 million in legal fees. The bank also announced that it has not admitted any liability and is settling to avoid further litigation with its cardholders.[44]
Voluntary refund of erroneous charges[edit]
On May 20, 2004, CIBC announced that it would refund C$24 million to some of its customers as a result of erroneous overdraft and mortgage charges which were discovered in the course of an internal review. "This is being done as part of CIBC's effort to correct its error and to ensure that it distributes to customers all of the money it received in error," the bank said.[45]
In a similar incident, CIBC announced April 27, 2006 that it's refunding an additional C$27 million to about 200,000 clients who were overcharged for certain overdraft fees and other borrowing transactions, some of which date back to 1993. In cases where clients were undercharged, the bank decided not to seek reimbursement.[46]
Privacy[edit]
2005[edit]
On April 18, 2005 the Privacy Commissioner of Canada expressed disappointment in the way CIBC dealt with incidents involving the bank misdirecting faxes containing customers' personal information.[47] One involved misdirecting faxes to a scrap yard operator in West Virginia from 2001 to 2004. The misdirected faxes contained the social security numbers, home addresses, phone numbers, and detailed bank account data of several hundred bank customers.[48]
The second incident involved a Dorval businessman and allegedly took place from 2000 to 2004. In both cases, the commissioner noted that the bank did not inform the affected clients, whose personal information was compromised, until the incidents became public and an investigation was underway.[49]
Within days of reports by CTV News and The Globe and Mail, CIBC management announced a directive that banned employees from using fax machines to transmit any documents containing confidential customer information.[50]
2007[edit]
On January 18, 2007, CIBC Asset Management announced that the personal information of about 470,000 current and former clients of Talvest Mutual Funds, a CIBC subsidiary, had gone missing. The information may have included client names, addresses, signatures, dates of birth, bank account numbers, beneficiary information and/or Social Insurance Numbers.[51] The incident stemmed from the disappearance of a hard drive containing information on "the process used to open and administer" customer accounts as it was traveling between the bank's Montreal and Toronto offices.[52] The Privacy Commissioner of Canada stated, "Although I appreciate that the bank notified us of this incident and that it is working cooperatively with my Office, I am nevertheless deeply troubled, especially given the magnitude of this breach, which puts at risk the personal information of hundreds of thousands of Canadians." She immediately launched a privacy investigation.[53]
Employee overtime[edit]
In June 2007, Dara Fresco, a Toronto teller, named CIBC in a $600 million class-action lawsuit regarding the lack of overtime pay to its customer service staff. Fresco v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce is a class action brought on behalf of current and former non-management, non-unionized employees of CIBC in Canada who are or were tellers or other front-line customer service employees working at CIBC retail branch office across Canada. The lawsuit alleges that class members are assigned heavier workloads than could be completed within their standard working hours. They were required or permitted to work overtime to meet the demands of their jobs and CIBC failed to pay for the overtime work in direct contravention of the Canada Labour Code under which they are regulated.[54]
The Ontario Superior Court dismissed the suit June 18, 2012, stating the evidence '"provides no basis in fact that there is a systemic practice of unpaid overtime at CIBC."'[55]
An employee of the Bank of Nova Scotia (Scotiabank) filed a similar suit which the Superior Court certified. Fresco and Scotiabank each appealed their adverse, and contradictory, rulings and the Ontario Court of Appeal ruled that both cases could proceed.[56]
Both banks appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada which on March 21, 2013, denied their requests and allowed the lawsuits to proceed.[57] The cases are awaiting further action as of late 2013.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
