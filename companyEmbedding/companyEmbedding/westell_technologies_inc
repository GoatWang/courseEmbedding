Westell Technologies, Inc. is an Aurora, Illinois company that provides telecommunications equipment for in-building wireless, intelligent site management, cell site optimization, and outside plant solutions. Westell was the last company to manufacture DSL modems in the United States; however, on May 21, 2007, Westell announced plans to outsource manufacturing.[citation needed]




A Westell 6100 DSL modem


History[edit]
Westell was founded in October 1980 in Willowbrook, Illinois, and initially produced electronic equipment used for signaling and transmission on telephone lines leased to private customers. Clinton Penny, who had previously founded Wescom Switching, founded Westell.[2] Beginning in 1992, Westell began developing ADSL products. By the time of its initial public offering (IPO) in 1995, Westell was a prominent DSLAM manufacturer. The company moved out of this business in the wake of the stock market downturn of 2002, and then focused primarily on manufacturing cell site optimization equipment, Ethernet connectivity products, intelligent site management and a series of outdoor enclosure and cabinets.

Westell Technologies, Inc.'s primary IT hub is located with its headquarters in Aurora, IL. An in-house IT team handles internal information technology initiatives separately from the company's communications product development team. Although the company employs various software developers and engineers, the majority work with client-facing products rather than on the internal side of IT.

The internal IT Department is lean, and divided into two primary groups. Systems Architecture oversees systems development and programming, as well as database technologies. Network Infrastructure oversees data storage, network architecture, voice systems and information security. A small IT Support division provides assistance in these areas as well as application support. Staff members use a combination of SAP and Oracle-based solutions to manage the company's finances. Prominent company technologies include SAP, SAP CRM, AutoCAD, Oracle Data Guard, Oracle RAC, Microsoft SQL server, Linux and UNIX.

Westell Technologies, Inc. is an Aurora, Illinois company that provides telecommunications equipment for in-building wireless, intelligent site management, cell site optimization, and outside plant solutions. Westell was the last company to manufacture DSL modems in the United States; however, on May 21, 2007, Westell announced plans to outsource manufacturing.[citation needed]




A Westell 6100 DSL modem


History[edit]
Westell was founded in October 1980 in Willowbrook, Illinois, and initially produced electronic equipment used for signaling and transmission on telephone lines leased to private customers. Clinton Penny, who had previously founded Wescom Switching, founded Westell.[2] Beginning in 1992, Westell began developing ADSL products. By the time of its initial public offering (IPO) in 1995, Westell was a prominent DSLAM manufacturer. The company moved out of this business in the wake of the stock market downturn of 2002, and then focused primarily on manufacturing cell site optimization equipment, Ethernet connectivity products, intelligent site management and a series of outdoor enclosure and cabinets.

Westell Technologies, Inc. is an Aurora, Illinois company that provides telecommunications equipment for in-building wireless, intelligent site management, cell site optimization, and outside plant solutions. Westell was the last company to manufacture DSL modems in the United States; however, on May 21, 2007, Westell announced plans to outsource manufacturing.[citation needed]




A Westell 6100 DSL modem


History[edit]
Westell was founded in October 1980 in Willowbrook, Illinois, and initially produced electronic equipment used for signaling and transmission on telephone lines leased to private customers. Clinton Penny, who had previously founded Wescom Switching, founded Westell.[2] Beginning in 1992, Westell began developing ADSL products. By the time of its initial public offering (IPO) in 1995, Westell was a prominent DSLAM manufacturer. The company moved out of this business in the wake of the stock market downturn of 2002, and then focused primarily on manufacturing cell site optimization equipment, Ethernet connectivity products, intelligent site management and a series of outdoor enclosure and cabinets.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
