Good afternoon. My name is Blair, and I’ll be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to Nevro Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.
Katherine Bock, Senior Director of Corporate Development and Investor Relations, you may go ahead.
Katherine Bock
Thank you, Blair. And thank you all for participating on today's call. Joining me are Rami Elghandour, President and Chief Executive Officer and Andrew Galligan, Chief Financial Officer.
Earlier today Nevro released financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. A copy of the press release is available on the Company's website.
Before we begin I'd like to remind you that management will make statements during this call that include forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws which are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Any statements contained in this call that are not statements of historical fact should be deemed to be forward-looking statements.
All forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, or examination of operating trends and our future financial expectations, which includes full-year 2016 guidance, and our expectations of achieving profitability are based upon current estimates and various assumptions.
These statements involve material risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or events to materially differ from those anticipated or implied by these forward-looking statements. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on these statements.
For a list and description of the risks and uncertainties associated with our business, please see our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Nevro disclaims any intention or obligation except as required by law to update or revise financial projections or forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or otherwise. This conference call contains time-sensitive information and is accurate only as of the live broadcast today, November 07, 2016.
And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Rami.
Rami Elghandour
Thank you, Katie and thanks everyone for dialing in today. For today's call, I’ll start with reviewing our third quarter performance and operating highlights, as well as providing additional color on our U.S. launch. Andrew will follow with a deeper review of the third quarter financials and expectations for worldwide revenue, gross margins and operating expenses for 2016. Then we'll open up the call for your questions.
Nevro's worldwide revenue for the third quarter was $60.9 million, an increase of 296% as reported compared to the same period of the prior year. U.S. revenue was $47.2 million and international revenue was $13.7 million, the latter representing an increase of 26% as reported and 27% in constant currency. These results are driven by continued adoption and excitement for HF10 therapy.
We now estimate our U.S. market share is approximately 15% as of the end of the third quarter of 2016, with opportunities for further growth driven by the ongoing expansion of our outstanding sales organization and access to the broader U.S. market to the launch of our Paddle lead in 2017.

The rapid growth in our U.S. share underscores that HF10 therapy is becoming the therapy of choice for leading physicians and at this community of clinically driven physicians will continue to shape the neuro modulation landscape for years to come.
With over one full-year into our U.S. launch, we have gained meaningful insight from our customers and commercial organization, which now allow us to better predict our U.S. business. As a result, we are increasing and narrowing the full-year 2016 total revenue guidance to $220 million to $225 million as compared to our August 8 guidance of $210 to $220 million for the full year.
We remain ever focused on ensuring chronic pain patients have access to our clinically superior therapy. HF10 therapy remains the only paresthesia-free SCS therapy, has demonstrated nearly twice the efficacy and responder rates as traditional SCS and other new low frequency stimulation wave forms, and is the only therapy to demonstrate clinical superiority to traditional SCS.
Our strategy of delivering clinically superior outcomes continues to serve us well driving both adoption and increased awareness and demand for our therapy. At the core of our growth in a physician community that has demonstrated they are innovators and embracing new technology, clinically driven in their search for improved outcomes and sophisticated in elevating the SCS space by embracing Level One clinical evidence.
We are still early in our controlled launch and over time expect HF10 therapy to be the market-leading SCS therapy. I have the opportunity to meet with clinicians in Europe and the U.S. throughout the third and continuing into the fourth quarter. Through these meetings, it’s clear how far we have come since our launch last year.
The number of physicians that are interested in adopting HF10 therapy continues to grow and reflects the excitement our early adopters have generated due to the outcomes they have been able to deliver to their patients.
Recently, one of these pioneering U.S. clinicians presented outcomes for nearly 300 patients treated with HF10 therapy within this practice since launch. It’s these types of positive results and every day clinical practice that have established HF10 therapy in the U.S. market and around the world.
Finally, with respect to our Paddle lead, we continue to be on-track for a full launch in the first half of 2017 as discussed on our last call.
As we have worked through our operational ramp, we have identified a minor design improvement that will aid in the transition to full-scale manufacturing. We have submitted this change to the FDA and are simultaneously ramping manufacturing operations in preparation for the launch.
On the hiring front, in the U.S. we ended the third quarter with 165 hired and trained reps and that increase of 25 reps from the previous quarter count of 140. We have now exceeded our minimum hiring goal for the year and are continuing to hire into the fourth quarter. Two factors have driven us towards accelerated hiring. First, we have seen more rapid up-tick in the U.S. market due to many leading early adopters utilizing the therapy. Second, due to the demonstrated ability to treat back pain, we are finding that our territories have greater potential than the historical SCS market data suggests.
As a function of this procedure density coupled with the up-tick to date, our reps have been quite busy in their accounts limiting their ability to broaden access to HF10 therapy to new physicians. As a result, we have worked earnestly over the past several months to add to our outstanding sales organization in order to ensure expanded access to HF10 therapy. This concerted effort has reflected in our year-to-date hiring and we expect to continue hiring to keep up with the demand for the therapy.

Internationally, we ended the quarter with 60 sales reps trained and in the field and we continue to add field support as needed. Additionally, we have continued investing in our commercial infrastructure internationally in order to drive further adoption of HF10 therapy worldwide.
Transitioning to reimbursement, we’re pleased to announce that we are now broadly covered by top national insurance providers. In August we announced that Cigna and certain Blue Cross Blue Shield regional plans published updated policies designating high frequency as investigational and experimental. We believe these decisions failed to align with the clinical superiority of HF10 therapy which is backed by two two-year published clinical studies, the latest of which was published in the preeminent journal neurosurgery.
We have made positive progress in our dialog with commercial payers. And in the third quarter, Cigna reversed its prior decision on the strength of our clinical evidence. HF10 therapy is now fully covered for Cigna beneficiaries.
We continue to work with certain Blue Cross Blue Shield regional plans to address their decisions and our continued effort to ensure broader access to this clinically superior therapy.
Finally, last week, the 2017 CMS SCS reimbursement rates were published. The facility rates were increased or largely unchanged representing stability in the current reimbursement landscape. Medicare facility reimbursement for trials increased 9.5% in the hospital outpatient setting and 10.7% in the AFC setting.
In the AFC, Medicare facility reimbursement for permanent implants increased 9.4% for implants with percutaneous leads and 4.9% for implants with surgical leads. In the hospital setting, reimbursement was increased 1.1% for both percutaneous lead and surgical lead IPG implants.
Nevro is recognized as a leader and innovator in neuro modulation, due in large part to our investment in rigorous long-term studies in areas with unmet clinical needs. In order to maintain our position and drive long-term growth of our business, we continue to invest in scientific research and clinical evidence to develop new applications of our proprietary therapy.
In recognition of these efforts, we recently learned that two HF10 therapy, related abstracts were selected for presentation during the groundbreaking study portion of the plenary program at the 20th Annual North American Neuro Modulation Society Meeting in January.
The first abstract featuring results from a prospective study on the application of HF10 therapy for the treatment of upper limb and neck pain will be presented during the groundbreaking clinical trial plenary session. This will be the first time these study results will be presented publicly and I know the investigators of this study are honored by the recognition of NANMS [ph] for their important work.
The second abstract detailing results from basic science research on 10,000 hertz stimulation will be presented during the groundbreaking basic science plenary session. This study represents the latest work regarding the mechanism of action of HF10 therapy. I’m excited by the progress of our pipeline and I look forward to discussing it in more details in 2017.
In closing, I’m proud of our dedicated team and I’m excited about what we will continue to build together. As we grow, more and more people contribute to our mission and I know they embrace the opportunity ahead of us as much as I do. I’m pleased with our progress in both our clinical and commercial operations as we continue to make decisions that we believe will drive long-term value.
It’s especially rewarding to know that our strategy of focusing on patient outcomes has proven successful both in our controlled U.S. launch and continued international adoption. Through this focus, we have built a foundation for the long-term adoption of HF10 therapy. With our outstanding people and company culture, we will find success by continuing to do the right thing and supporting the physicians and patients that depend on us.

It’s clear we have invigorated the SCS market and I’m confident there is more we can do to improve the lives of many more patients in need.
And with that, I’d like to turn the call over to Andrew Galligan, our CFO, for a more detailed review of our financials and guidance. Andrew?
Andrew Galligan
Thank you, Rami. Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $60.9 million, an increase of 296% year-over-year on a reported basis. This increase was primarily due to the continued success of the U.S. launch of HF10 therapy. U.S. revenue was $47.2 million in the third quarter.
As we said on our previous earnings call, industry results in the third quarter tend to be flat or down on a sequential basis due to seasonality. We expected our growth to attenuate in the quarter but given that we’re still in the high-growth stage of our launch, revenues did grow sequentially in Q3 in the U.S. albeit at a slower rate than in previous quarters.
International revenue was up 26% to $13.7 million from $10.9 million during the same period of the prior year. We achieved a constant currency growth rate of 27%. Going forward on this call, all revenue growth rates will be stated on a constant currency basis. Europe had 35% year-over-year growth for the quarter and Australia had growth of 14% compared to the prior year quarter.
After the impact of our recent price increases taken into account, actual unit shipments were down in Australia due to some short-term local factors. We’re increasing our focus on local marketing, reimbursement and clinical activities specific to the international markets to continue to drive broader adoption of HF10 therapy.
We continue to expect that due to constraints such as capitation and increasing market share in international markets, our international growth will moderate. We’ve seen this in the first three quarters of 2016 and continue to expect a moderation of international growth rates in the future.
As we said in our previous earnings call, due to seasonality and the summer months, we expected a sequential decline in international revenue in Q3.
Gross profit for the third quarter of 2016 was $41.7 million or 68% gross margin as compared to $9.4 million or 61% gross margin in the same period of the prior year. Gross margins increased year-over-year primarily due to fundamental cost improvements.
As we continue to grow revenue, we additionally expect to expand gross margin by improving efficiency and further leveraging our manufacturing overhead.
Operating expenses for the third quarter of 2016 were $43.6 million, an increase of 60% compared to the third quarter of 2015. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by increased headcount and related personnel costs. Net loss from operations for the period was $1.9 million compared to $17.7 million for the third quarter of 2015. And at the end of the third quarter of 2016, we had $288 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.
Now on to some considerations regarding profitability. This quarter, our net operating loss was $1.9 million as compared to a loss from operations of $5.9 million in the second quarter. Our revenue growth is far surpassed expectations and we’re still ramping our R&D spend as we get new clinical trials and development projects up and running.
We do not plan to slow down the spending and plan to robustly invest in future opportunities to drive innovation. As a result, when we do achieve profitability, it may or may not persist in subsequent quarters.
In this transition, we want to be clear that we’re focused on growing our markets and expanding the reach of our groundbreaking technology. There are new markets where we can bring the power of HF10 therapy to patients and we intend to do so.

When faced with a choice between the bottom-line and investing in the future of the company, we intend to invest in the future. The time will come when we focus on profitability but that time some distance away.
Turning to our outlook, we are increasing our worldwide revenue guidance for 2016 and narrowing the guidance range. We’re updating our guidance for the fiscal year 2016 to be in the range of $220 million to $225 million, up from our previous worldwide revenue guidance of $210 million to $220 million.
We’re still projecting productivity in the range of an average of $1.3 million to $1.5 million per rep after 12 to 15 months. In the near term, productivity continues to be positively impacted by the uptake of early adopter accounts. Over time we expect productivity to be more in line with our current guidance.
For gross margins in 2016, we expect to end the year at approximately 69% absent any material write-downs of inventory as we continue our rapid production expansion. This is an increase over our prior guidance of 66% due to our achieving fundamental cost improvements.
With regard to our operating expenses for 2016, we now expect to end the year at approximately $170 million in operating expenses plus or minus a few million dollars. This is a decrease from our prior guidance of $180 million to $185 million as our spending on clinical trials and development projects has lagged our expectations.
As Rami outlined, we also plan to continue hiring experienced sales representatives to support the rollout of HF10 therapy.
And back to you Rami
Rami Elghandour
Thanks Andrew. So that will conclude our prepared remarks for today. Blair, please open up the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Mike Weinstein
Good evening, guys. And first off, I apologize. I'm on my cell phone, so sorry if it's not a great connection. But I was hoping you could talk about the sales force growth over the last six months. Obviously, the business continues to grow very nicely, but you increased the size of your sales force by 46% in the last six months.
So, I’m interested in one, for you to comment just on the aggressiveness of the, adds. Obviously, it suggests a fair amount of enthusiasm for the outlook of the business. But two, talk a little bit about how you're managing that. If you add that many reps over a short period of time, it's not always easy to manage through. Thanks.
Rami Elghandour
Thanks Mike, so happy to address both of those questions. I think in terms of the, as we call it the drive to add or the aggressiveness to add, I think we’re obviously very pleased with the progress of the business thus far. But we continue to hear and I know many on the investment community side who have done their own research and surveys have heard that there continues to be strong demand for HF10 therapy that we haven’t quite been able to meet just simply by not having enough boots on the ground to get there.
Even in territories where we had boots on the ground I think it’s clear due to the rate of adoption of the therapy as well as just the efficacy in back pain and the ability for those physicians that are engaged with our therapy to treat many more of the patients, it’s been hard for our existing sales force to really branch out and broaden access to the therapy.
So, it’s really, primarily driven by our desire to meet more and more of the demand in the United States. We’ve obviously been in the market here for over a year and we certainly appreciate the patience of the physician community as we scale our sales force and try to do things the right way. But we know that we have to continue to add in order to get this therapy in the hands of many more physicians.

To your next point dovetails are very nicely in, which is, how do we manage that? Well, we still have a lot of control I mean we still interview every single person that comes through. We have scaled the organization internally from a, marketing, training and otherwise to make sure that we have the appropriate support for the sales force to be successful.
So, we are managing that very closely. We certainly feel very comfortable about the rates that we’re growing. And we, as I said intend to continue to add in order to keep up with the demand in the market.
Mike Weinstein
Rami, did the decisions by Cigna, which first off, congratulations on getting that reversed, but did Cigna and the regional Blues, is that impacting you at all? Did it show up at all in the quarter, or is that a non-issue?
Rami Elghandour
It’s generally a non-issue. Look, I would say on the margins there is some impact in certain territories more than others where you’re going to get some kind of residual impact. But by and large it hasn’t been an issue and we’re certainly pleased that Cigna ultimately recognized the strength of the evidence. And we hope that the Blues will follow soon enough.
Mike Weinstein
Okay. And then maybe if I could sneak in two more, Europe was very strong this quarter, but Australia was lighter than it had been and you commented on some local factors. Maybe you could shed a little bit more light there.
And then the gross margins are ramping very quickly every quarter here. And obviously operating spend, we heard the commentary there and couldn't agree more in terms of investing in the business. But you just want to update us on your thoughts on how gross margins scale from here now that you're approaching 70%, or do you think gross margins ultimately reach, for this company, and how you think about long-term profitability and not the short term? Thanks.
Andrew Galligan
Thanks Mike.
Rami Elghandour
Yes, so with respect to Australia, look, I think we’ve talked about it and we have significant share in that area. With a couple of physicians having either, travel or changing hospitals and kind of idiosyncratic issues like that. And with the concentration of generally the way the markets are internationally and specifically Australia, there was some impact.
We think it’s obviously something we’re very confident in the Australia business. And our team and the ability to continue to grow there but there is definitely kind of a near-term impact that we’re enhanced to work through. I’ll ask Andrew to address the margin question.
Andrew Galligan
Yes, Mike. So, obviously I think we’ve got to a volume player we’ve got some good cost improvements that now has worked its way through the system. So, we were seeing them in the fields. I don’t think we’re prepared to change our long-term view of low to mid-17s for gross margin. And the bottom line we’ve always guided towards mid-20s we can guess operating income. We’re pleased of where we are but not ready to change anything. Thanks Mike.
Operator
The next question comes from the line of David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
David Lewis
Good morning, I’m sorry, good afternoon. A few quick questions. So, just coming back to Mike's question here on revenue per rep, Rami, so interesting dynamics for investors, I think, this afternoon. You have revenue per rep was down a little bit sequentially, but yet you're adding very aggressively into reps. I guess a couple questions.
Is this more about market expansion now, Rami, versus actually supporting the existing physicians you’ve already adopted? And I guess for Andrew, just thinking sequentially here, SG&A has been roughly flattish sequentially, even though you're hiring very aggressively. Is that just timing dynamic?
Rami Elghandour

Sure, yes. To answer your first question, yes, you’re absolutely right David this is more about expanding access to the therapy as I’ve said. And we certainly have plenty of room for growth there our footprint remains quite small in the United States market. And we know that’s something we have to continue to address.
Andrew Galligan
Yes, and as for the revenue per rep coming down a little sequentially, I think we’re pretty clear of it, long-term we expect $1.3 million to $1.5 million. So, that also is fairly a surprise to us. The other question on…
David Lewis
Just spending, Andrew, obviously, a lot of aggressive hiring, but the SG&A was relatively flat sequentially. Was it timing?
Andrew Galligan
Yes, it’s deferred timing, people actually come on board.
David Lewis
Okay. And just a couple more, Rami, heading into next year, it was nice to see the paddle lead timing is on track for ‘17. How are you thinking about paddle lead? Obviously, you have one competitor who has a dramatic outsize exposure to paddle leads. They have a new therapy which recently got a superior label. They're also talking a lot about their primary cell versus your rechargeable device. How are you feeling about the ability to take share with the paddle lead and expand your market opportunity in light of some of these competitive changes with one of your competitors?
Rami Elghandour
Yes, our view on that, despite those developments that you mentioned our view on the paddle launch is unchanged. We feel very good about our ability to take share in that segment of the market. We know that there is demand there. And we look forward to meeting it.
David Lewis
Okay. Rami, just lastly, clinically, I guess you weren't expecting any upper extremity data this early, certainly not at NANMS. How are you thinking about timing for a U.S. ID, perhaps a little too early, but we weren't thinking U.S. ID for upper extremity for at least two more years. Should we take this early data syndication that we could see upper extremities trials moving forward earlier than expected? And I'll jump back in queue. Thanks, guys.
Rami Elghandour
Thanks David. At this point we’re not going to comment on the regulatory strategy. We’re certainly very excited about the data and very excited those investigators will get to present it in that groundbreaking session. But we’ll talk about the regulatory strategy and timelines in the future.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Your line is open.
Bob Hopkins
Thank you. Can you hear me okay?
Rami Elghandour
Yes.
Andrew Galligan
Hi Bob.
Bob Hopkins
Great, great, good afternoon. So, just a couple of follow-up questions here. I was wondering if you wouldn't mind quantifying the issue in Australia and how much it impacted you this quarter or was that a couple million dollars or was it less? And does that get fixed in Q4, just curious if you could clarify Australia.
Andrew Galligan
It’s a very small part of our overall market. So yes, we’re talking about a few million, a couple of million dollars here. And so, one of those things are, Australia is a very concentrated market like most international markets. And so, it only takes one or two doctors to actually be doing something different like taking a very long vacation or changing their practice to actually impact you.
And it usually takes a couple of quarters to work its way through. And the main factor there is, despite all of those perpetuations and the underlying units we actually grew revenue in that market.
Rami Elghandour
And just want to clarify something that Andrew said it was important. The reason it takes a couple of quarters to work through is because of the way our business works. So, when they go back to practice, they have to rebuild their pipeline and they have to build through their implants.

So, in fact when you have a quarter kind of perturbation, it doesn’t necessarily resolve immediately. It starts to resolve but it’s not wholly made up of second quarter, just because of the way the pipeline kind of works on our business.
Bob Hopkins
Okay, and then, just two other quantitative follow-ups to that. Andrew, you mentioned a few times OUS. growth was slow. That's obvious that larger numbers and faster growth rates. But I was wondering, given your emphasis, from where you sit today, is there a decent way you would advise us to think about the OUS growth prospects for the company as we look forward?
And then a little bit more shorter term, I just wanted to ask about the implied Q4 guidance for the fourth quarter, because it suggested the midpoint maybe somewhere in the neighborhood of 5% sequential growth. Was there anything going on in the fourth quarter that's worth noting about? It seems like that's maybe a conservative estimate for Q4, so just wanted to chat a little bit more about longer term OUS growth and the fourth quarter guide.
Andrew Galligan
Sure. I think we’ve been saying for quite some time. But international is slowing down as a function of just the underlying dynamic for those markets. And the fact that we have such large shares, we think it’s harder and harder to actually grow them. So we are seeing the slowdown, there is no question about it.
And then, part of it I think really is, and we’ve said that in today’s script which is to actually build our international markets, now we’re actually going to have to move beyond having a sales focused organization to having a much broader organization on the ground there that’s working on local reimbursement issues, local clinical trials and local marketing that’s really specific to the individual markets. I think to guess the next stage of growth, when you do an increased sophistication of resources on the ground in our international markets.
And with regard to Q4 guide, we really do tend to guide towards what we believe is achievable. And that’s really how we set guidance. And I think we have lot better than we have now and there are fewer uncertainties than there were earlier this year. And we believe we’re really homing in our guidance, much better nowadays.
Bob Hopkins
Okay. Thank you very much.
Rami Elghandour
Thanks Bob.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy from Leerink Partners. Your line is open.
Danielle Antalffy
Thanks so much. Good afternoon, guys, and thanks for taking the questions. You have a competitor that's going to be releasing their own high-frequency clinical trial data. I guess actually not at NANMS, what we're hearing is, they'll be discussing it on their Q4 call. I'm not asking you to speculate on what that means the data is, but if you could walk us through, now that that event is getting closer, how you guys are preparing one way or the other, if it's negative or if it's positive, from a competitive perspective?
Rami Elghandour
Sure. So, I think first of all, there is not a lot of clarity on when or if any data will be release. So I think just like everybody else we’ll kind of see what happens there. Look, we’re very confident obviously in our products, in our portion of our market, we demonstrated the superiority of HF10 therapy not just in terms of data but I think it’s reflected in our adoption to date. So to the extent that there is other data that’s presented by another company that may or may not have had the experience with high frequency stimulation, we’re not really sure that will weigh very much on the market.
And the other thing that I’ve said and I’ll repeat again is that we have invested a lot of time and money and infrastructure and people into building this company to what it is. And we very much plan on defending our intellectual property really vigorously if the path lines up for us.

Danielle Antalffy
Okay, great. Thanks so much. And then again from a competitive perspective, you do now have a competitor that got their first product approved with a superiority label. Just wondering what you're seeing from them specifically from a counter detailing or competitive perspective, if you're seeing them yet at all, and then any changes in competitive counter detailing this quarter versus the last few since you first launched? Thanks so much.
Rami Elghandour
Thanks Danielle. So, I think as everybody knows we don’t really like to talk about our competition. However, I think I’ll go into more detail on this because I think some clarification is required.
I’ll certainly address this question just based on the evidence presented in the Sunburst study and as detailed in their FDA disclosures. The whole premise of this Burst question claiming superiority is to effectively draft on the branding of HF10 therapy.
First our superiority claim is based on superiority and responder rates, vast cores and functional outcomes at multiple time points and across all primary and secondary end-points. Conversely, Burst ran only two superiority tests and failed one of the two. The one failed test was done in a similar manner to how HF10 superior test was performed.
So, the superiority effectively which has been referenced a couple of times on this call today is effectively due to [technical difficulty]. They were not superior in response rates and functionality or across group comparisons.
Looking at the underlying data, I think it gives a little bit more clarity. For example if you look at responder rates, HF10 has responder rates in the 80s, Burst and St. Jude are in the 30s and traditional SCS historically based on published evidence is in the 40s and 50s.
So, I think that kind of gives you an idea of that comparison between therapies because this comparison kind of comes up a lot. However, they do have strong marketing programs and I’m sure they’re going to push Burst as a clinically meaningful option. But I think anyone who digs deeper I think the evidence kind of speaks for itself. And further we ultimately believe the difference between the therapists will be evident to the physicians.
Operator
The next question comes from the line of Dave Troncalli from JMP Securities. Your line is open.
Dave Troncalli
Thanks. I was just wondering if you could maybe provide a little additional color on the clinical spending. I think you said it lagged your expectations. So what other areas were you looking to start on, and is it just a timing issue, I imagine?
Andrew Galligan
Yes, thanks. Clinical trials, is all about how fast you can get on set-up. And also then the pace at which, patients go through the trial. So, it really is a lot of it didn’t say timing issue on the number of patients through the trials but also there were clearly some clinical trials that we expected to have up and running by now that aren’t. It takes longer to get through efficacy approval, doctor’s site signed up, financial agreements, etcetera, etcetera it just takes longer than we are hoping.
Dave Troncalli
I guess the flip side, the good news is the markets that you're going after are large enough to that shouldn't be an issue, at least from our point of view. But the other quick one I would have is the upper limb and neck market. Do you have an estimate of the size of that today?
Rami Elghandour
Well, we’re going to talk more about our pipeline in 2017. So we’re not ready to talk about it yet.
Dave Troncalli
Okay. Thanks.
Rami Elghandour
Thanks Dave.
Operator
The next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Joanne Wuensch
Can I bug you for a little bit more specificity on the pipeline?
Rami Elghandour

Yes, do that.
Joanne Wuensch
You've got some data coming out in January. We all love what you're doing here in back and leg. But I mean, clearly there's, other things that you're coming up upon. How should we think about it or when will you start sharing it?
Rami Elghandour
I think we’ve consistently said that there is, maybe I can provide some more detail Joanne just in terms of the process. So there were, couple of different data points that we’re looking at here. I think certainly there is the evidence that we get from these studies, the enrollment, there is the aspect of regulatory strategy which a number of these indications were continuing to work through. And then there is the kind of the market research aspects which informs what the best approach to the market and market size is.
While obviously we’ve announced and we’re very excited about this data being presented in January, a number of these other process points are in the middle of and working through. Once we have kind of a broader view, we’re certainly going to be happy and excited to share.
Joanne Wuensch
Okay. And as a second question, could you remind us of the size of the paddle lead market and how you approach taking share in that segment of the market opportunity? Thank you.
Rami Elghandour
Sure, thanks Joanne. We believe that the paddle is comprised about 30% plus or minus 5% of the U.S. market. The way we go after that is really, on a high level really no different than the way we’ve approached the rest of the market. There are physicians who primarily prefer to use paddle leads. And they’re part of a lot of the territories we’re in today. Some of them we’re willing and have use percutaneously, its fact just the therapy up until this point. But many others just prefer to stay with the paddle.
So, it will be an opportunity for us to more broadly engage that physician community. And just to be clear, it doesn’t require different or a new sales force, it’s just a function of continuing to expand our existing sales organization or provide access to therapy once this particular product is available.
Joanne Wuensch
Thank you.
Rami Elghandour
Thanks Joanne.
Operator
The next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Larry Biegelsen
Hi, guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions, a couple clarification questions. On the again, upper limb and neck trial, that's off label today, correct? It's the other indication that you're studying, the extremity trial, that's on label. So, upper limb and neck is technically off label. Is that correct, Rami?
Rami Elghandour
Neck pain is off-label, limb as our indication is pain of the trunk and limbs is generally considered on-label.
Larry Biegelsen
So with this data that's positive, you'd be able to promote that data?
Rami Elghandour
If the data is positive you can certainly, based on our existing labeling we believe treat limb pain. However the other notable thing in this particular market is reimbursement, the upper limb and that does not broadly cover. So, that’s another kind of hurdle that has to be worked in.
Larry Biegelsen
And then on the paddle lead, have you re-filed it yet, and is that more of like Q1 or Q2 launch? And I did have one more question.
Rami Elghandour
We have submitted to FDA, given obviously we’re working through something with FDA. We haven’t specified specifically if it’s Q1 or Q2 for exactly that reason. So I think we’ll work through that.
Larry Biegelsen
Okay. Fair enough. And then on the guidance, just kind of a two-part, back to Bob's question about your sequential, the guidance implies about 2% to 10% sequentially. If I look back, the market's been up about 9% to 12% on a worldwide basis in Q4. So, any commentary on if you're expecting the market to slow or anything like that because obviously, we can see your guidance and we can see what the market's done sequentially. And just lastly, Andrew, any opportunity here to comment on 2017, just puts and takes, or color commentary to make sure that people are kind of on the right track. Thanks for taking the questions, guys.

Andrew Galligan
Larry, so, we’re not ready to talk about 2017. I think that’s too early to really get involved in my conversation. Going back to 2014, we’ve always given what we believe is conservative guidance, its solid guidance and they’re numbers that we believe that we can achieve.
Rami Elghandour
As far as, I think it is worth clarifying, I think if you look at, as far as the third quarter, I think if you look at our competitors, they’re generally flat to down this quarter. And we obviously grew sequentially. So I think there is a little bit of a clarification there where there is a look at year-over-year growth for our competitors but sequential growth for us.
I think if you look at every one from a sequential growth view, you’ll see that their numbers were up $1 million or $2 million over much larger denominators. But with the additions of new products, whether those are acquisitions or etcetera, that inherently are growing which implies that there is actually a sequential decline likely in their core SCS businesses.
But I think that’s kind of the commentary I’ll make on Q3. On Q4, I think we have a reputation for giving, for being conservative. And we certainly are confident in the business. We also are trying to as we learn more, to try to be more active. So we’re certainly trying to balance that. And but we certainly want to make sure that it’s clear that we’re very comfortable with our business going into the fourth quarter.
Operator
The next question comes from the line of Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Your line is open.
Margaret Kaczor
Hi, good afternoon, guys. So the first question for me is on U.S. territories. I think you guys referenced towards the beginning of the commentary that you've seen greater potential I guess on the historical SCS market suggested. And I think you referenced that that was due to back pain. So is, there any details that you can give us in terms of how many more patients per account you're seeing? Are you seeing more new accounts? And is it certain geographies or across the board nationally?
Andrew Galligan
That’s a good question, Margaret. I think our comments apply pretty much broadly. I mean there is going to be variability as to the extent of the growth driven in any given geography. But I think it’s fair to say that physicians that already have back pain patients that they’ve now been able to treat. And those who embrace the therapy certainly see utility in that patient population.
Margaret Kaczor
And to follow up on that I guess, is that twice as many patients that these guys are seeing or treating, and then as you look at your reps and sales rep productivity, you've hired a few reps maybe from your competitors. How does their productivity at Nevro compare to what they've seen maybe at their respective shops before you guys?
Rami Elghandour
Sure. Yes, I mean, I think I’ve said before on the first part of the question that we believe that both the back pain patients are multiple existing SCS patient population. So I think I don’t want to put a specific number on it. But there is certainly ample room for growth.
From a productivity perspective, I’ll start and maybe Andrew can comment to it. I think the biggest difference that we see there are two differences that we see in terms of our productivity. One is that the magnitude of productivity is higher certainly but even more importantly the acceleration or the pace at which they get to that part of giving number is probably the biggest difference between us and traditional standalone, off-standard to maybe standalone.
Andrew Galligan
Yes, so when you look at competitive reps, for those reps that really have to go out and build a new territory, there aren’t really that many of them. Those competitor reps in territories which are already sizeable, and it actually takes them many, many years to get up to a $1 million to $1.2 million type run rate, which is a really good territory I think for many of our competitors. So, it takes them much longer time to get up that lateral.

And by and large, that’s kind of our average productivity. So I think we get to our, we have higher productivity and we get there a lot faster 12 to 15 months.
Margaret Kaczor
Great, and then if I could sneak one more in. In terms of 2017, without obviously going into details on your expectations, what do you think is a bigger impact on your growth? Is it going to be hiring more and more new reps or maybe going after the paddle lead, or I guess do the two go hand-in-hand? Thank you.
Andrew Galligan
We follow by reps. I mean, we don’t, I think we need to emphasize more. There are no products dropped at a hospital, I mean, we actually have to be OR, we have to program patients so that revenue is really driven by number of people in the field. Without those people in the field you can’t have the revenue, you cannot drop product off at the hospital. So, the main driver of our business is hiring reps.
Rami Elghandour
Having said that, there are certainly territories that are overwhelmingly paddled, I think is much sense to have reps in theory than it will once we have all available. So that will certainly be a growth driver as well. But underlying as Andrew said is the people, without the people, the product itself isn’t going to solve a lot.
Operator
The next question comes from the line of Brooks West from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.
Brooks West
Hi, thanks. Can you hear me?
Rami Elghandour
Yes. Hi Brooks.
Andrew Galligan
Yes.
Brooks West
Great, just a couple of clarifications, at this point, guys. Andrew, on the gross margin guidance, you said you expect to end the year at approximately 69%. Is that 69% for Q4, or is that a full year number, or is that a Q4 number?
Andrew Galligan
That’s a Q4 number.
Brooks West
Okay. That's what I thought. And then, you gave your share assumption for the U.S. market at about 15%. Can you update us on where you think your share is in Europe and Australia?
Andrew Galligan
It’s really, as you know there is rather some data in Australia, there is no great data in Europe at all. We think roughly we have about a third of the market.
Brooks West
About a third, in each of those territories?
Andrew Galligan
Up and down around that but overall probably if you take them all together probably about a third.
Brooks West
Okay. That's helpful. And then just last for me, is there any other major reimbursement hurdles from a coverage standpoint or an experimental decision standpoint? I know you're working through some of the Blues, but anything else out there that you're working on that's meaningful that we should be aware of?
Rami Elghandour
No, we’re just working through the Blues at this point.
Brooks West
Perfect. Thanks, guys.
Rami Elghandour
Thanks Brooks.
Operator
And your last question is from the line of Suraj Kalia from Northland Securities. Your line is open.
Suraj Kalia
Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. So, Rami, I know on the upper limb, a lot of questions have been asked. Let me ask some more high-level question. Does the funnel for upper limb and neck work the same way as the lower/back and leg pain? By that I mean, just the algorithm of how things are done on these patients and how they land up with SCS. Is the algorithm the same?
Rami Elghandour
It’s somewhat similar Suraj. I think there is probably a lower failed surgical component but overall they are generally viewed as the second kind of largest population seen by this specialty. But they tend to have lower rates of failed surgery relative to the existing market.
Suraj Kalia
Fair enough. And understandably, I guess, you don't want to give specifics. I would get that. But Rami, based on what you'll have seen so far in the U.S. launch, can you directionally characterize for us what your percent of initial implants are “de novo” patients or other failed SCS patients?

Rami Elghandour
They are overwhelming de novo patients.
Suraj Kalia
De novo, okay. And Andrew, one final thing, the comps for reps, do they change after year one, or do they stay the same, or do the metrics change? Just working the rep productivity numbers and curious if there any net drop offs, and is that due to comp, or any color there would be great? Thank you for taking my questions.
Andrew Galligan
Okay. And the $1.3 million to $1.5 million is kind of the peak. At that point they pretty much run out of time because again they actually have to be in the OR, so they have to do the patient educations, the programming for the files, the implants help on insurance etcetera. So they really can get to $1.3 million to $1.5 million a year. And then they’re kind of there. I think that’s it.
Operator
There are no further questions at this time. I’ll turn the call back over to the presenters for closing remarks.
Rami Elghandour
Thanks Blair. And thanks again everyone for joining our call today. We certainly appreciate your continued interest in Nevro. And very much look forward to our next progress update. Have a great day.

Rami Elghandour
Thank you, Katie, and thanks everyone for dialing in today. We've had a strong start of the year in positioning Nevro for near and long-term success. By expanding access to HF10 therapy to the launch of our Surpass surgical lead, scaling our commercial organization and investing in leveraging our proprietary platform to investigate new clinical applications.
That said our U.S. revenue in the first quarter fall short of our expectations. We believe we've identified the contributing factors which I'll talk about shortly and which we are in the process of addressing. We remain confident in our business and are reiterating our worldwide revenue guidance for the full-year 2017.

Earlier this afternoon, we reported worldwide revenue for the first quarter of $68.4 million, an increase of 64% as reported compared to the same period of the prior year. U.S. revenue for the quarter was $53.1 million, an increase of 80%. First quarter international revenue was $15.3 million representing an increase of 30% on a constant currency basis. These results were driven by the continued global adoption of HF10 therapy.
In the U.S. we saw strong growth from our most recent classes of hires to reach their fourth and fifth quarters in the field. However, our Q1 results were affected by greater than expected seasonality coupled with growing pains relating to scaling. Specifically the expansion of our sales management team did not keep pace relative to the rapid growth rates we've experienced We believe this impacted our execution in Q1 particularly with respect to business planning and customer engagement in some of our existing accounts.
We have taken steps to improve execution as we scale our sales organization in order to broaden access the HF10 therapy. Over the past two quarters we've added to our sales management team with our expanded team we are resourced to maintain focused on our existing accounts as we scale. As always, we are focused on continuous improvement and will continue to strengthen and support our team. Our U.S. sales team has done a tremendous job of driving rapid market adoption and we remain confident in our team and our business both this year as well as over the long-term.
On the hiring front in the U.S, we ended the first quarter with 232 hired and trained reps and net increase of 39 reps from the previous quarter count of 193. We have doubled down on our hiring efforts and are pleased to have been able to invest in the expansion of our U.S. sales force as we work towards covering the broader U.S. market. This new class of hires positions us for success in 2018 and beyond.
Internationally, we have continued to build upon our strong share position in our key markets, underpinning our strengths in Q1 with strong performances in Europe and Australia. This performance is a credit to our outstanding sales organization which continues to demonstrate the long-term benefits of our therapy. We ended the quarter with 71 international sales reps trained and in the field and we continue to invest in our team as needed to support our growth.
With respect to the launch of our surpassed surgical leads, we are pleased to announce that after receiving approval for the PMA supplement in January, our controlled launch is underway. To date feedback on our surgical lead has been very positive most notably with respect to reproducing the clinically superior outcomes of HF10 therapy.
On the operations front, we believe the designs changed successfully address the yield issues we experienced and we are continuing to ramp inventory to meet demand in the market. From a market perspective, our sales team continues to be busy engaging in the account opening and onboarding process which was a particular area of focus for us in Q1. We are excited to broaden access to HF10 therapy to the surgeon community and I've been very pleased with our early experience thus far.
On the topic of R&D, our product pipeline is progressing in line with our plans. We are working on a number of product enhancements that we believe will strengthen our portfolio and business. First, we are planning to launch a new smaller profile IPG in the next twelve months. We believe this new product will provide a number of benefits to our patients, customers and business
Additionally, we continue to pursue MRI compatibility for our system, enhanced MRI compatibility for our system. As a reminder, our product currently supports MRI compatibility for the head and extremities for 1.5T and 3T machines which retroactively apply to every patients implanted with Nevro system a significant advantage to our approach.

On the clinical research front building on early evidence suggesting that painful diabetic neuropathies can be effectively treated with HF10 therapy. We are initiating a larger randomized, controlled trial to generate level one evidence in support of this patient population. We view this as a potentially meaningful opportunity and are excited to again lead the field in pursuing the evidence needed to advance patient care.
While the SCS market is increasingly competitively driven by studies that focus on product feature differentiation, we continue to commit resources to expand and enhance patient care through meaningful clinical evidence and new indications. As you recall, promising early preliminary results were presented at the 2017 NANS meeting in January. Stay tune for an update on our progress with this initiative with respect to study design and timelines.
In terms of reimbursement, we have positive news to report. Blue Cross, Blue Shield has updated their evidence review on SCS and concluded that high frequency SCS results in a meaningful improvement in that health outcomes. This is a reflection of the strength of our clinical evidence base as well as the efforts of our market access team.
With this update, Blue Cross is one of the largest policy makers in U.S., now considers HF10 therapy to be a technology that can benefit patients and that is therefore appropriate for regional plans to reimburse for the technology. As you may recall, a small number of Blue Cross regional plans did not cover HF10 therapy. We have already heard from some of those plans that they plan on adopting the updated policy starting June 1 and we are working to ensure the small number of remaining regional plans do so as quickly as possible.
We are pleased that HF10 therapy and the clinical evidence-based supporting it have been validated by another independent agency and that it is covered by all major commercial payers in U.S. providing more patients access to this clinically superior therapy.
In closing I remain excited about the impact of HF10 therapy on the patients we serve and the physicians we support. It is clear we have reinvigorated the SCS market and I remain confident in our ability to establish a global leadership position in the space. Our team has built a strong foundation over the last two years.
In this short time, we have continued to grow internationally establish the substantial U.S. business and scale their organization in a way that means teams are entrepreneurial culture and values. Additionally we have worked towards delivering on the promise of neuromodulation by investing in meaningful new indications, which we believe will continue to set us apart in the field.
We will lead by delivering a superior therapy that truly makes a difference in patients' lives across a range of meaningful indications. I know the talented Nevro team is up to the challenge of building on the great foundation we have established and reaching new highs.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andrew Galligan, our CFO for a more detailed review of our financials. Andrew?
Andrew Galligan
Thank you, Rami. Revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $68.4 million, an increase of 64% year-over-year on a reported basis. This increase was primarily due to the continued global adoption of HF10 therapy. U.S. revenue in the first quarter was $53.1 million, up 80% from 29.5% during the same of period of prior year.
Back in February, we forecasted that on a sequential basis, our U.S. revenue for the first quarter would be more in line with the fourth quarter 2015. However, as Rami noted our U.S. revenue for the quarter came in below our expectation. International revenue was up 26%, $15.3 million or $12.2 million during the same period at the prior year. This represents a constant currency growth rate of 30% both Europe and Australia did well in the quarter. As we've previously stated we believe that the international market is subject to capitation constraints, which will result in moderation of our international growth rates over time.

Gross profit for the first quarter of 2017 was $46.4 million or 68 % gross margin as compared to $26 million or 62% gross margin in the same period of the prior year. Gross margins increased year-over-year primarily due to fundamental cost improvements. Sequentially gross margins were down slightly due to an additional $1 million write-down of inventory, but did not conform to our product requirements. After that margins would have been in line with the fourth quarter.
Operating expenses for the first quarter of 2017 were $59.4 million, an increase of 70% compared to the first quarter of 2016. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by scaling the organization for the increasing size of our business. Legal expense in connection with the Boston Scientific litigation was $2.4 million for the quarter. Net loss from operations for the period was $13.1 million compared to $9 million for the first quarter of 2016. At the end of the first quarter of 2017 we had $264.1 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment.
Turning to our outlook, we are reiterating our worldwide revenue guidance for 2017. We continue to anticipate worldwide revenue for 2017 to be in the range of $310 million to $320 million as we've announced back in February and expect productivity in the range of an average of $1.3 million to $1.5 million per rep after 12 to 15 months. For gross margin from 2016, we still expect to the end the year as approximately 70% with progress towards this number during the year excluding any material write-downs of inventory.
With regard to our operating expenses for 2017, we now expect to end the year as approximately $230 million to $240 million in operating expenses, excluding litigation expense. This is a $5 million increase over our previous guidance in February due in part to our plan to continue to scale our sales force.
And back to you Rami.
Rami Elghandour
Thanks Andrew. So that will conclude our prepared remarks for today. Leandra please open up the call up for your questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein from JP Morgan. Your line is open.
Michael Weinstein
Thank you. And let's start if we can with the commentary just on the quarter. As you are aware you came in generally in line with our expectations in the Street, but Street was a bit more optimistic and you commented that. U.S. business didn't do as well as you are hoping this quarter. So could you just spend a minute on why that was the case?
And then second could you share with us your thoughts going forward, obviously you're still incredibly bullish based on the rep hires that you continue to do. Certainly no one was even close to taking to it higher end of the 39 reps this quarter. So what's driving that thought process? How much of a challenge is it to keep adding reps at the rate you've been adding over the last 12 months and then will go from there? Thanks.
Rami Elghandour
Great. Thanks Mike for the question. So I think let me start by saying the fundamentals in our business haven't changed. We remain very confident in our business both in the near and long-term, but as I discussed there were some operational things that we have to work through.
So let me maybe build on that a little bit to provide a little bit more context. Sales management are core to execution I think we can all agree that management and leadership matters and we were shorthanded with respect to our sales management team, which I think was also further magnified by our increased hiring of late.
New reps that we add for the Company certainly need support in terms of building their territories, but established territories as well need support with respect of adding additional targets, continuing to open accounts, bringing on clinical support and integrating that clinical support.

Additionally, sales management plays a pretty critical role in customer engagement there in the field every week and that layer of engagement with our customers is critical to our near and long-term success. As a result that absence of management really puts a lot of undue burden on the field and I think certainly we saw that impact execution this past quarter.
Our existing sales management team frankly did an admirable job when considering the hiring that they were able to produce as well as managing the overall scale of the business that grew very rapidly. And we've really been working to address this particular challenge in the last two quarter and in fact we've nearly doubled our sales management team over that time period.
So we've got a great sales team, we remain very confident in our business; we don't see or believe that anything is fundamentally changed. But we have to make sure that our team is well supported in their endeavors and I think we feel very good about where we are in terms of addressing this challenge at this point in time.
Michael Weinstein
Yes. So let me ask the - if I listen to just the commentary just on sales management, part of it is that you've gone through this last year the second wave of hiring as I think about it. You added 25 to 28 reps in 2Q, 3Q, 4Q, now you've added 39 reps. Is part of the challenge getting all these new reps that you've hired in more you're recutting territories getting the territory settled and is part of it just getting these new reps who are new to SCS of the productivity curve?
Rami Elghandour
That's a great insightful question Mike. This really doesn't have anything to do per se with cutting territories. I think we've talked about in the past that our territories are pretty down and where we felt like we weren't going to be able to expand coverage in a timely fashion we have been adding to our sales team, but this doesn't have to do with the overall just number of hires if you will. The number of folks that each individual manager have to cover on top of hiring and top of customer engagement just ballooned to levels that were just supposed to manage. We didn't see this coming.
I think effectively you have a couple different choices when you're faced with the situation want us to try to do both in parallel which is meaning fill in your management team as you continue to hire or to take a pause in terms of hiring and then fill in the management team and put in the hiring afterwards.
We certainly chose to do the former and I think that's the reflection of the strength of the managers that we did have in place, but I think eventually that caused us in this particular quarter and the execution wasn't up to the level that we have come to expect and it's principally in view and my belief that just came down to having people that were stretched to thing to be able to deliver on everything that we needed to deliver.
Michael Weinstein
Okay. Last couple questions. So if we think about the Paddle lead launch, let's call it a baseball game. Are you still in the first inning of that launches? Is that the right way to think about it in terms of us seeing a benefit from them?
Rami Elghandour
Yes. I think we're just - just early first inning I would say, I mean we spent a lot of time as you know opening accounts those are a longer term type of accounts to open because these are more than in hospitals, primarily than in hospitals, so we're very early and very encouraged by the feedback that we've received. As I mentioned, I think our sales team is doing a great job of executing on this particular launch, but we still have a long way to go here and a lot of opportunity ahead of us.
Michael Weinstein
Understood. The second last question is one of the questions have read pass is that St. Jude had a very good quarters. If you look at the sequential performance Boston's U.S. SCS business I think was down about 16% sequentially, but still a bit better than what industry was modeling. The St. Jude business grew by our numbers, about 7.5% sequentially, that obviously they're reflecting some benefit from the DRG stimulation, but on the pain stem business in/and last had a good quarter. Is there any sense in your view that momentum has shipped? Is just anything in your and to be competitive issue recognizing that Senza was trying to get out in front of your Paddle lead launch as well?

Rami Elghandour
I think it's hard for us to comment on how their particular business is going. I think as you mentioned there's a lot that was added to that portfolio which makes it a little bit harder for us to comment. I think we saw the pure portfolio Boston demonstrates the typical seasonality that you would expect to see in Q1, so it's hard to comment. I think generally speaking my comment on competition is that it's intensifying.
I think there's a reaction to our increasing success and the execution of our sales team and we see all sorts of things that whether it's bulking or pricing or dissipative marketing or all sorts of different tactics employed in different areas of the country. I don't know that I would hang my hat on that. I think for us it's we've got a lot that going for us in a very positive direction and I think we will continue to execute at a high level going forward
Michael Weinstein
Understood. Thank you.
Rami Elghandour
Thanks Mike.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
David Lewis
Good afternoon. Rami I just want to pick up on some of those last points, so I guess the first thing you're talking a lot about middle management on this call, but as I just think about the business Rami, it feels like and perhaps you're talking about the sales leadership, but how much this is just you don't have enough reps? It feels like in the earliest part of 2016 you may have been under rep for an investment perspective. I noticed you've added in the last two quarters more reps than you added in the prior three quarters. So a lot of focus on management just sort of wondering is this just about not having enough reps to grow at the rate you can grow at?
Rami Elghandour
I think David that sort of the underlying reason why we got - successfully we're expecting flat revenue in Q1, right is because we haven't hired enough folks earlier on that we should have - where we would have expect it that kind of continue to grow sequentially.
So that sort of the underlying basis, but that's not really the reason why we had this challenge in Q1, right. It is particularly related to this management challenge that I discussed. So in a sense you can address your question specifically it would be both, right that we were under staff in the reps department and we had this issue as well and that would be - that would argue why we came in both lower than and we guide at this one close place, is that makes sense?
David Lewis
Okay. That's very helpful. Couple quick ones here, revenues throughout this quarter was down year-on-year and I guess it just some that may seem surprising a lot of the fact that I want to hit and you have more reps. So that would suppress revenue per rep, but then you have Paddle lead, a little bit of contribution from ULN post-NAND. So could you just walk us through that the driving force there between things that are helping revenue per rep and things are working against it?
Rami Elghandour
Sure. Yes I think you hit me on the head, David. I think there are some things that are working towards in terms of new data. I think the Paddle will could potentially help, but again we're very, very early innings there.
But I think the reality is we continue to talk about that that we expect our productivity to be in the range that we described and I think there was a whole host of different reasons why that was overshooting at the beginning so the mix of reps that's changed over time to more non-SCS reps, which I think puts some weight on that and I think if you can imagine that our mix from a quarter-to-quarter basis, my shift as well in terms of number of reps versus clinicals and that's sort of can weigh on it as well.
So there's all source of different puts and takes on that, but overall the core message is still the same though. We have expected productivity in this range. We don't have data to suggest that it will be out of this range and the fact that we're beating it was had a lot to do probably would be early launch days than anything else.

David Lewis
Okay, one last question for me is just two parts. One we talked a lot about the sales related dynamics, but you also mentioned seasonality. I sort of come back to that is that selling days classic SCS first quarter to first quarter dynamics or is that the timing of NANS this year and then related to that maybe for Andrew, just second quarter expectations just so we can levels that expectations. Is a way to think about the second quarter similar rates of revenue on a percentage basis in the second quarter of 2017 like we saw in the second quarter 2016 24-ish percent which should be sort of in that mid 70s range for the second quarter and I'll jump back in queue? Thanks so much.
Andrew Galligan
Well let me hit the guidance up front. We don't want to actually give quarterly guidance, and so not really prepared to go there at the moment. So what I will say background is if you remember back to we had a perturbation in Australia in Q3 and it takes a quarter or two in this industry before you can turn anything around, because you have this whole reestablishing files and the delay between trial and the actual implant which was the focus of the revenue. So I mean I would say this is going to turn around overnight. So it will have an impact on the second quarter.
David Lewis
In there's a seasonality, Rami anything specific about seasonality you wanted to call out.
Rami Elghandour
I think nothing specific David, primarily it's the Q4 to Q1 right, so we talked about this in the past and Q4 positions both for move up - spend more doing permanent implants, which also kind of robs from doing additional trials in the fourth quarter, which generally carries over into the first quarter. I think that's primarily. I'm sure have some fact as well as being on the margin so, but that's kind of what you would expand and I think has Mike mentioned earlier that's likely with the self-announcement.
David Lewis
Thank you very much.
Rami Elghandour
Thanks David.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins from Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Robert Hopkins
Hi, thanks. Can you hear me okay?
Rami Elghandour
Yes.
Andrew Galligan
Hi, Bob
Robert Hopkins
Hey great, good afternoon. So when I look at then numbers for the U.S., it seems like sort of the simplest way of saying this is that the market was very healthy in the first quarter, but your market share in the first quarter was pretty flat relative to the fourth quarter and that's sort of the first time that's happened since the launch and I guess we're trying to understand why share was flat sequentially, because again the market seemed very healthy.
So I guess my question is just to be super specific on the issues that you're calling out in terms of the scaling issues? Was turnover in the rep or support base or was this really just a matter of scale? Just trying to understand kind of a little bit more what happened because on again in the face of it so it seems like some competitors launching products and that that hurt your ability to take share?
Rami Elghandour
Yes, thanks for the question Bob, I think in terms of turnover that that's sort of - that was on different in this particular quarter. So I think we've talked about that in the past, but there was nothing there in particular that drove, yes I think your assessment is right I think they just really came down to us to our execution.
We've been pretty deep on this and looked that it a bunch of different ways and also really came down to being stretched a bit thin and not you know pushing and getting the type of close that we typically expect that the end of any given quarter. Just didn't happen based on our prior experience and I think a lot of that is just being under-resourced to make it happen.

Robert Hopkins
It didn't seem like the competitors are doing anything different in the quarter. They did have a couple new products obviously to launch, but I'm just curious on the competitive front we really don't think there's anything different happening in this quarter.
Rami Elghandour
No, I think every quarter we see a new different attempts from the competition to be honest so there clearly were we've really disrupted this market and yes having some new products in the market I'm sure on the margin gets a little bit more share a voice maybe you got a little bit file here and there, but you know we don't really view that again we want very deep and we certainly consider that as a possibility, but now truthfully we don't really see that as a driving factor in this particular quarter.
Again on the margin there have some - I think similar to for example the Paddle launch right, I'm sure on the margin we spent a lot of time opening accounts on Paddle and those things on the margin might have some impact but overriding it was really execution or and then something we feel pretty confident.
Robert Hopkins
Okay. And then lastly on a positive note, I mean in this first quarter it looked like the U.S. market actually accelerated a little bit and is now growing close to 20%. Obviously a year and a half ago this mark was fairly growing and now it's growing it's one of the best growth markets in all of MedTech. So as you guys look forward to this U.S. market in the in the trends that are driving the acceleration in growth. How sustainable do you think this high-teens market growth is if we kind of hit at inflection point in terms of you know awareness and data, new products I mean is this high teens market growth sustainable you think.
Rami Elghandour
Yes, I mean we are confident and a double-digit growth rate for some time given I think our confidence in our ability to continue to take share and grow the market. I think that you know sort of the extra boost to that top end perhaps it's being driven as you said by some new products that our competitors can talk about.
In our experience internationally is that those kind of get a bounce and then kind of fade because a lot of the follow-up through on those products is just not as good as our product right. So I don't know that I am comfortable saying that I think this is going to be a 20% growth rate going forward but I am confident in a double-digit growth rate, because I can attest to what I believe will be able to contribute to it on a go forward basis.
Robert Hopkins
Great. Thanks very much for taking the questions.
Rami Elghandour
Thanks Bob.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy from Leerink Partners, your line is open.
Danielle Antalffy
Good afternoon, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Rami I was hoping you could give a little bit more color into I am sorry to harp on that, but into the issues permanent execution perspective in the quarter? Just wondering did it had more to do with impact from getting new centers onboard or existing users using the last and I guess the follow-up there would be what gives you guys confidence that if it is the existing users using west so that's not suggestive of a longer-term trend here maybe they did from trialing and now they're going back with these before or what have you.
Rami Elghandour
Sure. Thanks for the question Danielle. So I think as I mentioned in the script, our newer classes of hiring are actually ramping up quite well, so this was more of an established business challenge. Again, there is some expected level of seasonality that we would have thought we would see and I think we certainly saw that. I think what we're saying is that that changes there was greater than just simply the seasonality. I think the reason we're confident in addressing it is that this isn't simply trials that were early on and went away.

I think this was a little bit of share shifting within accounts to a greater degree than we would have expected. You have to remember that a lot of our accounts were not necessarily be only person in there and I think to the extent that we haven't been as present in those accounts and I think has organized that we've been in the past and we're going to see some impact to our business. So that's the reason why we're confident in addressing this, we think that obviously with the updates both to our management team as well as our overall sales team where we'll be in better position to continue to grow in those accounts we have in the past.
Danielle Antalffy
Okay. That's helpful. I know you guys don't want to necessarily give the metric fair amount of trials from an implant ratio perspective, but just curious if there's been any change on the types of metrics from your…
Rami Elghandour
We are comparable saying that that national average has fell where it's been - there has been no change there.
Danielle Antalffy
Okay. Great. Thanks so much guys.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Dave Troncalli from JMP Securities. Your line is open.
Dave Troncalli
Thanks. And then just as it relates to the management - the sales management, did you guys commented all that I may have missed it, but like how many folks you have and then sort of as you look at the under-staffed issue I mean where you talking about five to 10 individuals and they already hired now, so we feel good going forward just any other color you could give there?
Rami Elghandour
Sure. Thanks, Troncalli. Obviously we didn't give out a model where we give out how many regions we have, but I will say it was a significant number. I've said we've doubled it and yes we are at this point fully staffed, so we're just playing catch up over the last two quarters and I asked that we made a strategic decision to parallel have that with sales hiring. And I think the net results, obviously again were disappointed, but will take where we are because I think it positions us for the future.
Dave Troncalli
And then if any change that you noticed in the pricing or anything else from the quarter just to I guess take that off to table as well has a potential concern for folks?
Rami Elghandour
Sorry the question was related to pricing?
Dave Troncalli
Yes.
Rami Elghandour
Yes. I think we - again, we've seen that on the margin, pricing, bulking. There are certainly - our competitors on any market are kind of taking a variety of steps to combat us, so we definitely do see that, but I'm not sure we can say that this is kind of like a national strategy or national kind of wave that we're up against it. Certainly there's pockets of when we're dealing with it.
Dave Troncalli
Thanks a lot.
Rami Elghandour
Thanks.

Thank you for taking the question. Just shift to the conversation a little bit, we saw a slowdown in the international sales in the fourth quarter and we've been sort of thinking about market or markets would slow for some time. And then here we go and rebound in the first quarter to 32% growth organic or X effects. Can you comment on what the rebound is or if there was anything in particular that helped the first quarter out outside the United States?
Rami Elghandour
Yes. Sure. So I think interestingly in the fourth quarter we talked about first time that we actually saw a bit of a slowdown because the counts just running out of budget. And I think that probably lowered the Q4 international revenue which we talked about. I think what's really has happened when you look at the numbers is that there was a rebound in those accounts in the first quarter as we try to catch up with the patients that they had been treated in the fourth quarter, so that's one element of what happened.

And the other is as I mentioned earlier, we have that perturbation in Australia in the third quarter and we said it would take a couple of quarters for it to turn around in Australia frankly is back on track. So you have those combined in the first quarter because I think they gave us a pretty strong first quarter.
And then the caution there is I think in the first quarter in Europe that's a one quarter bump and now they're going to go back to kind of a more subdued growth rate and again Australia is kind of back on track. So I think there were two elements of why this quarter in particular was a little higher internationally that really don't continue for the rest of the year.
Joanne Wuensch
Okay. And then one of the things that you've been spending more time in meetings talking about our other applications of the SCS technology and clearly there's still a lot more to go and back in leg, but can you sort of discuss some of the timelines for neck, shoulder, peripheral neuropathy? Thank you.
Rami Elghandour
Thanks Joanne. Yes, like - I think you highlighted that well, we're very excited about the potential to expand to a number of new applications and unfortunately I think as I mentioned before, we're still sorting through a lot of different things like regulatory strategy and clinical timelines. So I think we'll reserve updating specific timelines with respect to those indications as we have more clarity around some of the road ahead of us in those fronts. We are excited about this in next particular study that will be launching soon with respect to diabetic neuropathy and I will certainly update you and we have more information there.
Joanne Wuensch
Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Larry Biegelsen
Hey guys thanks for taking the question. One of the pipeline, one of the competition, MRI safe timing, I mean I'm sorry if you mentioned it, but the full body, I did hear it timings. And I was just curious on upper linen neck, you showed good data NANS. But that was not one of the pivotal trials, you mentioned earlier, why no plan to do a pivotal trial there, I thought you said you really need that to drive reimbursement and I had one follow-up. Thanks.
Rami Elghandour
Sure, Larry. Yes, so we didn't mention a specific timeline with respect to MRI. I mention one with respect to the smaller profile IPG. With MRI I talked about that previously that we're evaluating from a regulatory perspective and from a testing perspective, what our approach looks like. We're gaining - increasing information and confidence in that program. But we want to make sure that we have further clarity before we comment on the timeline.
With respect to ULN, we have won three different studies on that particular indication and I think we're evaluating our regulatory and health economic perspective on that - based on that clinical set while assessing if and what type of further studies are needed. I think also we want to prioritize - while we have a lot of resources to do important clinical work, ultimately everything is limited and so we want to prioritize running larger. We want to prioritize the studies that we want to potentially more meaningful indication and that's why you see the diabetic neuropathy study taking center stage here.
Larry Biegelsen
Thank you. Does that on the competition - the multipart question, so given your success obviously the competition is it's counter detailing you and so of couple of issues it would be helpful I think to hear you address. One is the explant issue, which is real or not, he's in the market anecdotally. And I just wanted to hear your perspective and the other is related to the question that I asked in the last call about the options that the competition is offering in.

For example first, the data may not be as strong as your data, but some positions like the optionality of tonic and burst that you mentioned on the last call me Rami that you have something you can address that you just need to communicate that better. So I'm wondering if you could help on this call maybe talk a little bit about more how you're trying to avoid being seen is kind of one size fits all? So apologize for the multipart question, but if you need to be repeatedly of that I'm happy to. Thanks Rami.
Rami Elghandour
Thanks very much Larry. Both relevant questions, so let's address the explant point first. I think this is where if you heard my reference earlier to deceptive marketing I believe this for very frankly could squarely there. So we have one of our competitors and I which is Abbott seems you're pushing the narrative that primary cell devices are somehow better for patients than rechargeable.
I think there's - let me first state that I believe this is a disservice to patients and physicians and frankly in our view raises the issue of patient safety. There's a reason why the U.S. market in the Australian market have long shifted to rechargeable devices into patient benefits and improved safety around with fewer surgical interventions. The only markets that really operate, but primary cells are that way due to cost constraints particularly in Europe.
So this is push for primary cells is really largely a deceptive marketing effort by shown selective data that purports to support the position that primary cell batteries have lower explant rates them rechargeable systems. In a recent study that was shown in fact HF10 therapy have the lower to explant rate even though it was a study that was supported by Abbott.
And I think the reality is given the increasing we reported a high proportion of primary cells that this particular company notes of having they will likely be on a path to have larger explant because the reality is that those devices have a relatively high explant rate to rechargeables in a pretty short period of time. I think the kind of rep is up, this sort of marketing I believe isn't good for the industry, it's not good for the space, I think it's continues to draw attention to something that actually frankly plagues the rest of the industry a heck of the lot more than it hits us.
I think clearly when you have a therapy that works 80% of the time and two-years competing against therapies that work in the case of the St. Jude burst 39% of the time in three months. And in case a traditional stem in the 50% range after two years. One of those is going to have a lot worse explant rate than the others you guys can do the math.
So I think this was a misguided attempt by you know a competitor and ultimately I think we have a lot of great things to talk about. So we generally tend to focus on talking about our products and companies that don't have a lot of great. Thank thought - with respect to the options again I think the same data is relevant. Our product works in a clinically superior way traditional SCS therapy. We do have a ways for optimize that therapy and as I talk about on the prior call.
There are we know we have to do a better job of communicating that and I think better than that we have to do a better job of explaining to the market and to our customers that the level of investment and that we make in patient care and follow-up which is unparalleled in the space.
I think a lot of our competitors have taken to borrowing or replicating our messaging but no other company actually commit the resources or as the product to follow-up through on delivering the best possible patient outcomes that population. So I think we have certainly some work we can continue to do from a marketing perspective, but I feel pretty strongly that we're offering the very best product for patients in the market and will continue to do that and be successful as a result because.

Larry Biegelsen

Your next question comes from the line of Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Your line is open.
Margaret Kaczor
Hi, good afternoon, guys. First question for me is on the sales force I think you can probably have the largest sales force in the industry at this point. You mentioned being fully staffed on the sales management, side but you guys continue to expect a higher throughout the year. And then in terms of the reps those are bringing on today. How do they differ maybe from the original reps that were maybe more SCS focused where maybe if learned something about the culture of the reps or hiring practices that could actually work out in your favor long-term.
Rami Elghandour
Thanks Margaret. So first of all we do not have the largest sales force in the space at least not yet, I think obviously, we expect to continue to grow and hope to grow into that position, but we're not there yet. I think what we talked about in the past is that we want to hire the best fit for a particular market and either due to available talent or non-compete, so other factors that may or may not always be somebody with prior SCS experience.
I think what we've also found is that our sales team that don't have the sales experience of ramp have done fairly well, they are just on a delayed cadence that's where the 12 to 15 months comes in relative to our SCS trained reps. So we feel pretty good about that. We've obviously shifted the mix and some of that was early, but some of that was playing out and so for…
Margaret Kaczor
And then in terms of the neurosurgeon accounts, the surgical lead accounts, how many of those - if you guys can share have you guys gotten into, maybe how many hospitals have you guys gone into and gotten positive back opinions verses maybe the number that you're still waiting on or targeting, and how does this compare the original HF10 launch?
Rami Elghandour
So we don't get into the whole level of detail with respect to accounts. I can just say that it was - it certainly a core focus and I think I mentioned in the past that this was fairly regional in the certain areas of the country where this is more prominent than others, so we are going to keep plugging away. I think the important thing to take into consideration here is, this is not like a relaunch in a sense that we are starting from ground zero.
Obviously, got a fair amount of coverage around the country and so this becomes optionality in terms of when you're adding additional accounts, now you can service a part of the market that we penetrate easily service, but we are effectively constrained by people right, so just having this doesn't necessarily just wind up creating instant Greenfield that just gives us long range ability to continue to grow on certain territories.
Margaret Kaczor
Got it. And then maybe one more on the smaller profile IPG, have you guys file that with the FDA and is it going to impact the life of the device at all? Thank you.
Rami Elghandour
No comments on the first. And you can actually technically comment on the second with the FDA the term, but the intent is no that it should not impact the life of the product, but that certainly is where labeling comes in, so we are hopeful.
Margaret Kaczor
Got it. Thanks.
Rami Elghandour
Thanks Margaret.

Your next question comes from the line of Jason Mills from Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.
Jason Mills
Rami thanks for adding me to the call. Can you hear me okay?
Rami Elghandour
Yes.
Andrew Galligan
Hey, Jason.
Jason Mills
Andrew, again thanks for adding me to the call. So couple questions on the sales force. Maybe one other follow-up. So as David mentioned earlier in the call, your addition to the sales force for the last two quarters, you said the only addition you have over the previous three, almost four. I'm just wondering, given the complexion of your sales rep hires changed marginally, and you've also talked a lot about of sales management on this call, I'm wondering if the ramp algorithm, if you will, from sort of the initial hire to 100% productivity, I'm wondering that algorithm has changed. You've seen any major fluctuations in the past quarter rep and average rep from zero to - is way to 100% productivity?

Andrew Galligan
I'm proud to take that Jason. So we are still predicting the 12 to 15 months and we've said that the non-SCS people are on the higher end of that range and then as our mix has moved towards more SCS people on average that productivity ramp will be a little bit later than it has been in the initial launch where it was mostly a SCS people. So I think there is some motivations there, but frankly at this stage we have no data to suggest that it's any different than our guidance at the moment which is 12 to 15 months, $1.3 million to $1.5 million, which is moving around in that range.
Jason Mills
Okay, that's helpful. And ultimately, based on what you've seen thus far with the non-SCS reps, I know you commented earlier this year, I don't know if it was an Investor Meeting or somewhere else, that you saw some SCS reps sort of lose focus, maybe in the fourth quarter, and you had to do some rep turnover, wondering the non-SCS rep, whether you're seeing those reps or hiring folks that are perhaps a bit hungrier, that are used to a bit more competitive landscape, whether be in orthopedics or spine, a little more competitive areas? And whether or not that sort of - you have some optimism as it relates to how they'll climb the curve and integrate within the sales force?
Andrew Galligan
So I think SCS has historically been a very competitive industry. I mean then Abbott, and St. Jude, Medtronic and Boston were always fiercely competitive. I don't think there's any difference in rest of ability to deal with competition between the non-SCS and the SCS. It's just the non-SCS people come in and they need about a quarter to familiarize themselves with the industry. But from there the real ability I think is about the same as the SCS people is just we go we go for athletes of our kind of knowledge.
Jason Mills
All right. Okay, that's helpful. I appreciate that. And to earlier question on pricing, you haven't seen any - you've seen pockets of pricing and bundling competition. I'm wondering if you could comment on your pricing, whether or not these activities on the part of your competitors has caused anything notable in terms of your pricing on average across the country to find notable? I know it's difficult thing to do, let's say anything north 5% or so an average over the course of the last 12 months as it relates to your product?
Rami Elghandour
Jason, we find actually our pricing has been pretty stable and the 23,000 to 25,000 average over the nation, I mean they are obviously different since regionally in that pricing, but it all averages us 23 to 25.
Jason Mills
Perfect. Last question for me. We've talked to a few folks in different parts of the country. Maybe characterize them as sort of medium volume versus the high-volume? And in certain geographies, high-value account to do a lot of HF10 therapy, and then five miles away, medium volume accounts haven't had whenever rep calling them.
Wondering is that sort of, obviously, that's an example being under rep, but how do you think about the complexion companies of your account base at this point in time, where you move only in the surprisingly, but downstream to a lower volume accounts is the number of reps in your ability to cover the industry to expand or how should we think about the complexion of your counsel the next 12 to 24 months? Thanks for taking the question.
Rami Elghandour
Sure. Yes, so let me clarify we don't actually target purely on volume and in fact some of our best accounts and best customers are lower or medium volume accounts that because if we have an account that is patient focused and buys into the therapy and the technology they can meaningfully grow that business by and really help a lot more patients by leveraging our platform.

So the size of a particular account isn't really the primary driver for adoption, it's just maybe happenstance in a particular areas where you look that. We were still under service and I think that is just a function of the fact that there's still lot more opportunity to go after. There's still a lot of places for us to go and it is really purely a function of having our feet on the street and as you can see, we are working hard to address that but certainly trying to do that and in a way that we're structured have the same sort of control that we had at the beginning of our launch.

Your next question comes from the line of Suraj Kalia from Northland Securities. Your line is open.
Suraj Kalia
Good afternoon everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Rami most of my questions have been answered, while I'll just take two one. Can you give us the status of explants and the reason I ask is just trying to understand how you'll manage the patients implanted with Senza, obviously there is a desire for solid growth, but then you have to balance the outcomes in these patients also somewhat and not all comers are going to get Senza. What I'm trying to understand is how do you all train your reps you know to go out in the field and basically provide this balance so that we don't get poor outcomes once and as implanted? Thank you for taking my questions.
Rami Elghandour
So I think this is not something that is unique to us. All SCS companies have a long-term follow-up component to their business. I think the difference between us and everyone else is that one our therapy is more effective and more durable has been proven and clinical studies. So that naturally provides a huge benefit in this particular component.
But I think two we have built and the support team that - and teams of folks that don't exist in other companies whose responsibility is to help with longer-term follow-up and I think the combination of those two things being more effective in severe therapy coupled with dedicated resources to address this particular challenge in SCS as what's a lot us to be successful I think when you look at our international success where we continue to grow and now you're seven of our commercialization.
Are there perturbations based on competitive stuff like the sort of messaging and any given quarter. Yes, absolutely but over the long-term I think we've demonstrated that our model and our therapy can list and I think that test of time and that's what we look forward to proving here over the long-term to us as well.
Suraj Kalia
Thanks.

REDWOOD CITY, Calif., June 28, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Nevro Corp., a global medical device company that is providing innovative evidence-based solutions for the treatment of chronic pain, today announced that EY recognized Rami Elghandour, President and CEO of Nevro, with the Entrepreneur Of The Year® 2017 Award in Northern California. The award recognizes entrepreneurs who are excelling in areas such as innovation, financial performance and personal commitment to their businesses and communities. Mr. Elghandour was selected by an independent panel of judges, and the award was presented at a special gala event at the Fairmont San Jose on June 23, 2017.








"I am honored to accept the EY Entrepreneur Of The Year Award for Northern California on behalf of the Nevro team," said Mr. Elghandour. "This award is truly a reflection of our amazing people, our culture, and the impact our team has on helping patients regain their independence from the crippling effects of chronic pain. Chronic pain has increasingly become a part of our national dialogue and we are proud to offer a non-surgical, non-opioid solution to help address this health challenge. We are committed to continuing to invest in innovative, evidence-based therapies to help many more patients in need."
Mr. Elghandour joined Nevro in 2012 and currently serves as President and CEO of the company. During Mr. Elghandour's tenure, Nevro grew from a small startup to a leader in neuromodulation, going public in 2014 and growing from 65 to over 650 people in under five years. In 2016, Nevro achieved worldwide revenue of $228.5 million, an increase of 228% as reported over the prior year, and has been recognized as one of the leading companies in Silicon Valley by The Mercury News' SV150 list.
Nevro has developed and commercialized the Senza® spinal cord stimulation (SCS) system to treat patients suffering from chronic pain. Over 25 million adults in the United States suffer from chronic pain according to the National Center for Health Statistics and the annual economic cost of this population has been estimated at nearly $635 billion. The Senza system is a non-surgical, non-opioid treatment option for patients suffering from chronic back and leg pain and is commercially available in Europe, Australia, and the United States. The Senza system delivers Nevro's innovative HF10 therapy which is nearly twice as efficacious as existing SCS therapies and was demonstrated as clinically superior in the groundbreaking SENZA-RCT clinical trial, the largest prospective randomized SCS study to assess the treatment of chronic back and leg pain.
