	Investment has undrawn commitments. A negative cost basis may result from unamortized fees. Unamortized fees are classified as unearned income which reduces cost basis.
















	(11)






	Investment is not a "qualifying asset" as defined under Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act. Under the 1940 Act, the Company may not acquire any non-qualifying asset unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the Company's total assets. As of December 31, 2016, qualifying assets represent 86.0% of the Company's total assets and non-qualifying assets represent 14.0% of the Company's total assets.
















	(12)






	The sale of a portion of this loan does not qualify for true sale accounting under Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 860 -


	Transfers and Servicing


	("ASC 860"), and therefore, the entire debt investment remains in the Consolidated Schedule of Investments. Accordingly, the fair value of the Company's debt investments includes


	$14.0 million


	 related to the Company's secured borrowings. (See Note 15 in the accompanying notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.)
















	(13)






	The interest rate on the principal balance outstanding for all floating rate loans is indexed to LIBOR and an alternate base rate (e.g., prime rate), which typically resets semi-annually, quarterly, or monthly at the borrower's option. The borrower may also elect to have multiple interest reset periods for each loan. For each of these loans, the Company has provided the applicable margin over LIBOR based on each respective credit agreement.

	With the exception of investments held by the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries that have each received a license from the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”) to operate as a small business investment company (“SBIC”), each of the Company's investments is pledged as collateral under one or more of its credit facilities. A single investment may be divided into parts that are individually pledged as collateral to separate credit facilities.
















	(15)






	As defined in the 1940 Act, the Company is deemed to be both an "Affiliated Person" of and to "Control" this portfolio company as the Company owns more than 25% of the portfolio company's outstanding voting securities or has the power to exercise control over management or policies of such portfolio company (including through a management agreement). See Schedule 12-14 in the accompanying notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for transactions during


	the three months ended


	December 31, 2016


	 in which the issuer was both an Affiliated Person and a portfolio company that the Company is deemed to control.
















	(16)






	First Star Bermuda Aviation Limited and First Star Speir Aviation 1 Limited are wholly-owned holding companies formed by the Company in order to facilitate its investment strategy. In accordance with Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2013-08, the Company has deemed the holding companies to be investment companies under GAAP and therefore deemed it appropriate to consolidate the financial results and financial position of the holding companies and to recognize dividend income versus a combination of interest income and dividend income. Accordingly, the debt and equity investments in the wholly-owned holding companies are disregarded for accounting purposes since the economic substance of these instruments are equity investments in the operating entities.

	See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for portfolio composition.

	In December 2016, the Company restructured its investment in Senior Loan Fund JV I, LLC. As part of the restructuring, the Company exchanged its subordinated notes for Class A Mezzanine Secured Deferrable Floating Rate Notes and Class B Mezzanine Secured Deferrable Fixed Rate Notes issued by a newly formed, wholly owned subsidiary, SLF Repack Issuer 2016 LLC. The Class A Mezzanine Secured Deferrable Floating Rate Notes bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus the applicable margin as defined in the indenture. The Class A Mezzanine Secured Deferrable Floating Rate Notes and Class B Mezzanine Secured Deferrable Fixed Rate Notes are collectively referred to as the "mezzanine notes".

	Investment has undrawn commitments. A negative cost basis may result from unamortized fees. Unamortized fees are classified as unearned income which reduces cost basis.
















	(11)






	Investment is not a "qualifying asset" as defined under Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act. Under the 1940 Act, the Company may not acquire any non-qualifying asset unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the Company's total assets. As of September 30, 2016, qualifying assets represent 85.8% of the Company's total assets and non-qualifying assets represent 14.2% of the Company's total assets.
















	(12)






	The sale of a portion of this loan does not qualify for true sale accounting under FASB ASC Topic 860 -


	Transfers and Servicing


	("ASC" 860"), and therefore, the entire debt investment remains in the Consolidated Schedule of Investments. Accordingly, the fair value of the Company's debt investments includes


	$14.0 million


	 related to the Company's secured borrowings. (See Note 15 in the accompanying notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.)
















	(13)






	The interest rate on the principal balance outstanding for all floating rate loans is indexed to LIBOR and an alternate base rate (e.g., prime rate), which typically resets semi-annually, quarterly, or monthly at the borrower's option. The borrower may also elect to have multiple interest reset

	periods for each loan. For each of these loans, the Company has provided the applicable margin over LIBOR based on each respective credit agreement.













	(14)






	With the exception of investments held by the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries that have each received a license from the SBA to operate as an SBIC, each of the Company's investments is pledged as collateral under one or more of its credit facilities. A single investment may be divided into parts that are individually pledged as collateral to separate credit facilities.
















	(15)






	As defined in the 1940 Act, the Company is deemed to be both an "Affiliated Person" of and to "Control" this portfolio company as the Company owns more than 25% of the portfolio company's outstanding voting securities or has the power to exercise control over management or policies of such portfolio company (including through a management agreement). See Schedule 12-14 in the accompanying notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for transactions during


	the three months ended


	December 31, 2016


	 in which the issuer was both an Affiliated Person and a portfolio company that the Company is deemed to control.
















	(16)






	First Star Aviation, LLC, First Star Bermuda Aviation Limited and First Star Speir Aviation 1 Limited are wholly-owned holding companies formed by the Company in order to facilitate its investment strategy. In accordance with Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2013-08, the Company has deemed the holding companies to be investment companies under GAAP and therefore deemed it appropriate to consolidate the financial results and financial position of the holding companies and to recognize dividend income versus a combination of interest income and dividend income. Accordingly, the debt and equity investments in the wholly-owned holding companies are disregarded for accounting purposes since the economic substance of these instruments are equity investments in the operating entities.

	See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for portfolio composition.

	In March 2016, the Company restructured its investment in CCCG, LLC. As part of the restructuring, the Company exchanged cash and its debt securities for debt and equity securities in a newly restructured entity, Express Group Holdings LLC.

	In April 2016, the Company

	The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") and pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X. In the opinion of management, all adjustments of a normal recurring nature considered necessary for the fair presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements have been made. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. The Company is an investment company following the accounting and reporting guidance in FASB ASC 946,


	Financial Services - Investment Companies


	 ("ASC 946").




	Use of Estimates:




	The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions affecting amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates are based on the information that is currently available to the Company and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in the economic and political environments, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining these estimates could cause actual results to differ and such differences could be material. Significant estimates include the valuation of investments and revenue recognition.




	Consolidation:




	The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Fifth Street Finance Corp. and its consolidated subsidiaries. Each consolidated subsidiary is wholly-owned and, as such, consolidated into the Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain subsidiaries that hold investments are treated as pass through entities for tax purposes. The assets of certain of the Company's consolidated subsidiaries are not directly available to satisfy the claims of the creditors of the Company or any of its other subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2016, the Company's consolidated subsidiaries were Fifth Street Fund of Funds LLC ("Fund of Funds"), Fifth Street Funding II, LLC ("Funding II"), Fifth Street Mezzanine Partners IV, L.P. ("FSMP IV"), Fifth Street Mezzanine Partners V, L.P. ("FSMP V" and together with FSMP IV, the "SBIC Subsidiaries"), and FSFC Holdings, Inc ("Holdings"). In addition, the Company consolidates various holding companies held in connection with its equity investments in certain portfolio investments.




	Since the Company is an investment company, portfolio investments held by the Company are not consolidated into the Consolidated Financial Statements. The portfolio investments held by the Company are included on the Statements of Assets and Liabilities as investments at fair value.









	Fair Value Measurements:




	The Company values its investments in accordance with FASB ASC 820,


	Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures


	 ("ASC 820"), which defines fair value as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A liability's fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor. ASC 820 prioritizes the use of observable market prices derived from such prices over entity-specific inputs. Where observable prices or inputs are not

	FIFTH STREET FINANCE CORP.




	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	(in thousands, except share and per share amounts, percentages and as otherwise indicated)




























	available or reliable, valuation techniques are applied. These valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the investments or market and the investments' complexity.




	Hierarchical levels, defined by ASC 820 and directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuation of these assets and liabilities, are as follows:




	 













	•






	Level 1 — Unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.
















	•






	Level 2 — Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data at the measurement date for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
















	•






	Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that reflect management's best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model.







	In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an investment's level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the investment. Generally, it is expected that all of the Company's investment securities will be valued using Level 3 inputs. This includes investment securities that are valued using "bid" and "ask" prices obtained from independent third party pricing services or directly from brokers. These investments are generally classified as Level 3 because the quoted prices may be indicative in nature for securities that are in an inactive market, may be for similar securities or may require adjustments for investment-specific factors or restrictions.




	Financial instruments with readily available quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment inherent in measuring fair value. As such, the Investment Adviser's capital markets group obtains and analyzes readily available market quotations provided by independent pricing services for all of the Company's senior secured debt investments for which quotations are available. In determining the fair value of a particular investment, pricing services use observable market information, including both binding and non-binding indicative quotations.




	The Investment Adviser evaluates the prices obtained from independent pricing services based on available market information and company specific data that could affect the credit quality and/or fair value of the investment. Investments for which market quotations are readily available may be valued at such market quotations. In order to validate market quotations, the Investment Adviser looks at a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and nature of the quotations. The Investment Adviser does not adjust the prices unless it has a reason to believe any such market quotations are not reflective of the fair value of an investment. Examples of events that would cause market quotations to not reflect fair value could include cases when a security trades infrequently causing a quoted purchase or sale price to become stale or in the event of a "fire sale" by a distressed seller. In these instances, the Company values such investments by using the valuation procedure that it uses with respect to assets for which market quotations are not readily available (as discussed below).




	If the quotation provided by the pricing service is based on only one or two market sources, the Company performs additional procedures to corroborate such information, which may include the bond yield approach discussed below and a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the credit quality and market trends affecting the portfolio company.




	The Company performs detailed valuations of its debt and equity investments for which market quotations are not readily available or are deemed not to represent fair value of the investments. The Company typically uses two different valuation techniques. The first valuation technique is an analysis of the enterprise value ("EV") of the portfolio company. EV means the entire value of the portfolio company to a market participant, including the sum of the values of debt and equity securities used to capitalize the enterprise at a point in time. The primary method for determining EV uses a multiple analysis whereby appropriate multiples are applied to the portfolio company's EBITDA (generally defined as earnings before net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization). EBITDA multiples are typically determined based upon review of market comparable transactions and publicly traded comparable companies, if any. The Company may also employ other valuation multiples to determine EV, such as revenues. The second method for determining EV uses a discounted cash flow analysis whereby future expected cash flows of the portfolio company are discounted to determine a present value using estimated discount rates (typically a weighted average cost of capital based on costs of debt and equity consistent with current market conditions). The EV analysis is typically performed to determine the value of equity investments, to determine if there is credit impairment for debt investments and to determine the value for debt investments that the Company is deemed to control under the 1940 Act. If debt investments are credit impaired, an EV analysis may be used to value such debt investments; however, in addition to the methods outlined above, other alternative methods such as an asset liquidation model, expected recovery model or a recent observable or pending transaction may be utilized to estimate EV. The second valuation technique is a bond yield approach, which is typically performed for non-credit impaired debt investments. To determine fair value using a bond

	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	(in thousands, except share and per share amounts, percentages and as otherwise indicated)




























	yield approach, a current price is imputed for the investment based upon an assessment of the expected market yield for a similarly structured investment with a similar level of risk. In the bond yield approach, the Company considers the current contractual interest rate, the capital structure and other terms of the investment relative to risk of the company and the specific investment. A key determinant of risk, among other things, is the leverage through the investment relative to the EV of the portfolio company. As debt investments held by the Company are substantially illiquid with no active transaction market, the Company depends on primary market data, including newly funded transactions and industry specific market movements, as well as secondary market data with respect to high yield debt instruments and syndicated loans, as inputs in determining the appropriate market yield, as applicable.




	In accordance with ASC 820-10, certain investments that qualify as investment companies in accordance with ASC 946 may be valued using net asset value as a practical expedient for fair value.




	The Company estimates the fair value of privately held warrants using a Black Scholes pricing model, which includes an analysis of various factors and subjective assumptions including the current stock price (by analyzing the portfolio company's operating performance and financial condition and general market conditions), the expected period until exercise, expected volatility of the underlying stock price, expected dividends and the risk free rate. Changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates.




	The Company's Board of Directors undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter in connection with determining the fair value of the Company's investments:













	•






	The quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the Investment Adviser's valuation team in conjunction with the Investment Adviser's portfolio management and capital markets teams;







	•


	Preliminary valuations are then reviewed and discussed with principals of the Investment Adviser;













	•






	Separately, independent valuation firms engaged by the Board of Directors prepare valuations of the Company's investments, on a selected basis, for which market quotations are not readily available or are readily available but deemed not reflective of the fair value of the investment, and submit the reports to the Company and provide such reports to the Investment Adviser and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors;
















	•






	The Investment Adviser compares and contrasts its preliminary valuations to the valuations of the independent valuation firms and prepares a valuation report for the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors;
















	•






	The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors reviews the preliminary valuations with the portfolio managers of the Investment Adviser, and the Investment Adviser responds and supplements the preliminary valuations to reflect any discussions between the Investment Adviser and the Audit Committee;
















	•






	The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors makes a recommendation to the Board of Directors regarding the fair value of the level 3 investments in the Company's portfolio; and
















	•






	The Board of Directors discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each level 3 investment in the Company's portfolio.







	The fair value of each of the Company's investments at


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	September 30, 2016


	 was determined in good faith by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors has authorized the engagement of independent valuation firms to provide valuation assistance. The Company will continue to engage independent valuation firms to provide assistance regarding the determination of the fair value of a portion of the Company's portfolio securities for which market quotations are not readily available or are readily available but deemed not reflective of the fair value of the investment each quarter. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, 81.8% of the Company's portfolio at fair value was valued either using market quotations or by independent valuation firms. The percentage of our portfolio valued by independent valuation firms may vary from period to period based on the availability of market quotations for our portfolio investments during the respective periods. However, the Board of Directors is ultimately and solely responsible for the valuation of the portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to the Company's valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process.




	Investment Income:




	Interest and Dividend Income




	Interest income, adjusted for accretion of original issue discount ("OID"), is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected. The Company stops accruing interest on investments when it is determined that interest is no longer collectible. Investments that are expected to pay regularly scheduled interest in cash are generally placed on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest cash payments will be collected. Cash interest payments received on investments may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management’s judgment. Such non-accrual








	39








	FIFTH STREET FINANCE CORP.




	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	(in thousands, except share and per share amounts, percentages and as otherwise indicated)




























	investments are restored to accrual status if past due principal and interest are paid in cash, and in management’s judgment, the portfolio company is likely to continue timely payment of its remaining interest.




	In connection with its investment, the Company sometimes receives nominal cost equity that is valued as part of the negotiation process with the particular portfolio company. When the Company receives nominal cost equity, the Company allocates its cost basis in its investment between its debt securities and its nominal cost equity at the time of origination. Any resulting discount from recording the loan, or otherwise purchasing a security at a discount, is accreted into interest income over the life of the loan.




	For the Company's secured borrowings, the interest earned on the entire loan balance is recorded within interest income and the interest earned by the buyer from the partial loan sales is recorded within interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.




	The Company generally recognizes dividend income on the ex-dividend date. Distributions received from equity investments are evaluated to determine if the distribution should be recorded as dividend income or a return of capital. Generally, the Company will not record distributions from equity investments as dividend income unless there are sufficient earnings at the portfolio company prior to the distribution. Distributions that are classified as a return of capital are recorded as a reduction in the cost basis of the investment.




	The Company reversed $0.7 million of dividend income during the three months ended December 31, 2015 upon the receipt of updated information from a portfolio company regarding the characterization of a cash distribution received in a prior period. The related Part I incentive fee reimbursement related to this adjustment was recorded during the three months ended December 31, 2015.




	PIK Interest Income




	The Company has investments in debt securities which contain PIK interest provisions. PIK interest is computed at the contractual rate specified in each investment agreement and added to the principal balance of the investment and recorded as income. PIK interest on certain of the Company's debt investments, which represents contractually deferred interest added to the loan balance that is generally due at the end of the loan term, is generally recorded on the accrual basis to the extent such amounts are expected to be collected. The Company generally ceases accruing PIK interest if there is insufficient value to support the accrual or if the Company does not expect the portfolio company to be able to pay all principal and interest due. The Company's decision to cease accruing PIK interest involves subjective judgments and determinations based on available information about a particular portfolio company, including whether the portfolio company is current with respect to its payment of principal and interest on its loans and debt securities; monthly and quarterly financial statements and financial projections for the portfolio company; the Company's assessment of the portfolio company's business development success, including product development, profitability and the portfolio company's overall adherence to its business plan; information obtained by the Company in connection with periodic formal update interviews with the portfolio company's management and, if appropriate, the private equity sponsor; and information about the general economic and market conditions in which the portfolio company operates. Based on this and other information, the Company determines whether to cease accruing PIK interest on a loan or debt security. The Company's determination to cease accruing PIK interest on a loan or debt security is generally made well before the Company's full write-down of such loan or debt security.




	Fee Income




	Fee income consists of the monthly servicing fees, advisory fees, amendment fees, structuring fees and prepayment fees that the Company receives in connection with its debt investments. These fees are recognized as earned.




	The Company has also structured exit fees across certain of its portfolio investments to be received upon the future exit of those investments. These fees are to be paid to the Company upon the sooner to occur of (i) a sale of the borrower or substantially all of the assets of the borrower, (ii) the maturity date of the loan or (iii) the date when full prepayment of the loan occurs. The receipt of such fees is contingent upon the occurrence of one of the events listed above for each of the investments. A percentage of these fees is included in net investment income over the life of the loan.




	Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash:




	Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash consist of demand deposits and highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less, when acquired. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions and, at times, cash held in bank accounts may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") insured limit. Cash and cash equivalents are classified as Level 1 assets and are included on the Company's Consolidated Schedule of Investments.




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	, included in cash and cash equivalents was $149.2 million held in bank accounts of the SBIC Subsidiaries. These cash and cash equivalents are permitted only for certain uses, including funding portfolio company investments to be held at the SBIC Subsidiaries, repaying SBA-guaranteed debentures and funding operating expenses of the SBIC Subsidiaries. This

	FIFTH STREET FINANCE CORP.




	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	(in thousands, except share and per share amounts, percentages and as otherwise indicated)




























	cash is not permitted to be used to fund the Company's investments that are held outside the SBIC Subsidiaries or for other corporate purposes of the Company.




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	, included in restricted cash was $1.1 million that was held at U.S. Bank, National Association in connection with the Company's Sumitomo Facility (as defined in Note 6). As of September 30, 2016, included in restricted cash was $12.4 million that was held at U.S. Bank, National Association in connection with the Company's Sumitomo Facility. Pursuant to the terms of the Sumitomo Facility, the cash is restricted until the Company submits its required monthly reporting schedules.




	Due from Portfolio Companies:




	Due from portfolio companies consists of amounts payable to the Company from its portfolio companies, excluding those amounts attributable to interest, dividends or fees receivable. These amounts are recognized as they become payable to the Company (


	e.g.


	, principal payments on the scheduled amortization payment date).




	Receivables/Payables From Unsettled Transactions:




	Receivables/payables from unsettled transactions consists of amounts receivable to or payable by the Company for transactions that have not settled at the reporting date.




	Insurance Recoveries Receivable:




	Insurance recoveries receivable consists of amounts receivable to the Company from insurance recoveries in connection with settlement costs and professional fees. Claims for loss recoveries are generally recognized when a loss event has occurred and recovery is considered probable.




	Deferred Financing Costs:




	In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,


	Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs


	 which requires debt financing costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability, similar to the presentation of debt discounts. Additionally, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15, which provides further clarification on the same topic and states that the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") would not object to the deferral and presentation of debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequent amortization of the deferred costs over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. The Company adopted the guidance for debt arrangements that are not line-of-credit arrangements for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and applied a retrospective approach. As a result of the adoption, the Company reclassified $9.2 million of deferred financing costs assets to a direct deduction from the related debt liability on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities as of September 30, 2016. The adoption of this guidance had no impact on net assets or the Consolidated Statement of Operations.




	Deferred financing costs consist of fees and expenses paid in connection with the closing or amending of credit facilities and debt offerings. Deferred financing costs in connection with credit facilities are capitalized as an asset at the time of payment. Deferred financing costs in connection with all other debt arrangements are a direct deduction from the related debt liability at the time of payment. Deferred financing costs are amortized using the straight line method over the terms of the respective credit facilities and the effective interest method for debt securities. This amortization expense is included in interest expense in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. Upon early termination of a credit facility, the remaining balance of unamortized fees related to such facility is accelerated into interest expense.









	Offering Costs:




	Offering costs consist of fees and expenses incurred in connection with the offer and sale of the Company's securities, including legal, accounting and printing fees. The Company charges offering costs to capital at the time of an offering. There were no offering costs charged to capital during the three months ended


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	December 31, 2015


	.




	Income Taxes:




	The Company has elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code and operates in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. In order to be subject to tax as a RIC, among other things, the Company is required to meet certain source of income and asset diversification requirements and timely distribute dividends to its stockholders of an amount generally at least equal to 90% of investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code and determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid, for each taxable year. As a RIC, the Company is not subject to federal income tax on the portion of its taxable income and gains distributed currently to stockholders as a dividend. Depending on the level of taxable income earned during a taxable year, the Company may choose to retain taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions and would distribute such taxable income in the next taxable year. The Company would then incur a 4% excise tax on such income, as required. To the extent that the








	41








	FIFTH STREET FINANCE CORP.




	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	(in thousands, except share and per share amounts, percentages and as otherwise indicated)




























	Company determines that its estimated current year annual taxable income, determined on a calendar year basis, could exceed estimated current calendar year dividend distributions, the Company accrues excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as taxable income is earned. The Company anticipates timely distribution of its taxable income within the tax rules under Subchapter M of the Code. The Company did not incur a U.S. federal excise tax for calendar years 2014 and 2015 and does not expect to incur a U.S. federal excise tax for calendar year 2016. The Company may incur a U.S. federal excise tax in future years.




	The Company holds certain portfolio investments through taxable subsidiaries, including Funds of Funds and Holdings. The purpose of the Company's taxable subsidiaries is to permit the Company to hold equity investments in portfolio companies which are "pass through" entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes in order to comply with the RIC tax requirements. The taxable subsidiaries are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, and portfolio investments held by them are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements as portfolio investments and recorded at fair value. The taxable subsidiaries are not consolidated with the Company for U.S. federal income tax purposes and may generate income tax expense, or benefit, and the related tax assets and liabilities, as a result of their ownership of certain portfolio investments. This income tax expense, if any, would be reflected in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company uses the asset and liability method to account for its taxable subsidiaries' income taxes. Using this method, the Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. In addition, the Company recognizes deferred tax benefits associated with net operating carry forwards that it may use to offset future tax obligations. The Company measures deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which it expects to recover or settle those temporary differences.




	FASB ASC Topic 740


	 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes


	 ("ASC 740") provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized, measured, presented, and disclosed in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. ASC 740 requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the Company's tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are "more-likely-than-not" of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. Management's determinations regarding ASC 740 may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based upon factors including, but not limited to, an ongoing analysis of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. The Company recognizes the tax benefits of uncertain tax positions only where the position is "more-likely-than-not" to be sustained assuming examination by tax authorities. Management has analyzed the Company's tax positions, and has concluded that no liability for unrecognized tax benefits should be recorded related to uncertain tax positions taken on returns filed for open tax years 2013, 2014 or 2015. The Company identifies its major tax jurisdictions as U.S. Federal and Connecticut, and the Company is not aware of any tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will change materially in the next 12 months.    




	Secured Borrowings:




	The Company follows the guidance in ASC 860 when accounting for loan participations and other partial loan sales. Such guidance provides accounting and reporting standards for transfers and servicing of financial assets and requires a participation or other partial loan sale to meet the definition of a "participating interest," as defined in the guidance, in order for sale treatment to be allowed. Participations or other partial loan sales which do not meet the definition of a participating interest or which are not eligible for sale accounting remain on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities and the proceeds are recorded as a secured borrowing until the definition is met. Secured borrowings are carried at fair value to correspond with the related investments, which are carried at fair value. See Note 15 for additional information.




	Amounts Payable to Syndication Partners:




	The Company acts as administrative agent for certain loans it originates and then syndicates. As administrative agent, the Company receives interest, principal and/or other payments from borrowers that gets redistributed to syndication partners. If not redistributed by the reporting date, such amounts are classified in restricted cash and a payable is recorded to syndication partners on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities.




	Fair Value Option:




	The Company adopted certain principles under FASB ASC Topic 825


	Financial Instruments


	–


	 Fair Value Option


	("ASC 825") and elected the fair value option for its secured borrowings, which had a cost basis of


	$14.4 million


	 and $18.9 million in the aggregate as of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	September 30, 2016


	, respectively. The Company believes that by electing the fair value option for these financial instruments, it provides consistent measurement of the assets and liabilities which relate to the partial loan sales mentioned above.




	However, the Company has not elected the fair value option to report other selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value. With the exception of the line items entitled "deferred financing costs", "credit facilities payable", "SBA debentures payable", and








	42








	FIFTH STREET FINANCE CORP.




	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	(in thousands, except share and per share amounts, percentages and as otherwise indicated)




























	"unsecured notes payable," which are reported at amortized cost, all assets and liabilities approximate fair value on the Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities. The carrying value of the line items titled "interest, dividends, and fees receivable," "due from portfolio companies," "receivables from unsettled transactions," "insurance recoveries receivable," "accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities," "base management fee and part I incentive fee payable," "due to FSC CT," "interest payable," "amounts payable to syndication partners," "director fees payable," "payables from unsettled transactions" and "legal settlements payable" approximate fair value due to their short maturities.




	    Recent Accounting Pronouncements:




	In May 2014, the FASB issued


	ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers


	("ASU 2014-09"), which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. ASU 2014-09 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP when it becomes effective. In March 2016, the FASB issued


	ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) - Principal versus Agent Considerations


	. This ASU is intended to clarify revenue recognition accounting when a third party is involved in providing goods or services to a customer. In April 2016, the FASB issued


	ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) - Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing


	. This ASU is intended to clarify two aspects of Topic 606: identifying performance obligations and licensing implementation guidance. In May 2016, the FASB issued


	ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) - Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients


	. This ASU amends certain aspects of ASU 2014-09, addresses certain implementation issues identified and clarifies the new revenue standards’ core revenue recognition principles. The new standards will be effective for the Company on October 1, 2018 and early adoption is permitted on the original effective date of January 1, 2017. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The Company is evaluating the effect that new standards will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The Company has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the effect of this standard on its consolidated financial statements and its ongoing financial reporting.




	In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,


	Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern,


	 which requires management to evaluate, at each annual and interim reporting period, a company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued and provide related disclosures. This accounting guidance is effective for the Company on a prospective basis beginning for the annual fiscal 2017 period and is not expected to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.




	In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-07,


	Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent)


	. The update eliminates the requirement to categorize investments in the fair value hierarchy if their fair value is measured at net asset value (NAV) per share (or its equivalent) using the practical expedient in the FASB’s fair value measurement guidance. Public companies are required to apply ASU 2015-07 retrospectively for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Accordingly, the Company adopted ASU 2015-07 during the three months ended December 31, 2016 and determined that the adoption did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.




	In January 2016, the FASB issued


	ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall


	("ASU 2016-01"), which makes limited amendments to the guidance in GAAP on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. The new standard significantly revises an entity's accounting related to (1) the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and (2) the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value. It also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods therein.  Early adoption is permitted specifically for the amendments pertaining to the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value.  Early adoption of all other amendments is not permitted. Upon adoption, the Company will be required to make a cumulative-effect adjustment to the Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective.  The Company did not early adopt the new guidance during the three months ended


	December 31, 2016


	. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-01 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.




	In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18,


	Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)


	 which requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. Therefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included within cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The new guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and early adoption is permitted. The amendment should be adopted retrospectively. The Company did not early adopt the new guidance during the three months ended December 31, 2016. The new guidance is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

	Note 3. Portfolio Investments




	At


	December 31, 2016


	,


	189.4%




	of net assets, or


	$2.0 billion


	, was invested in


	123


	 portfolio investments, including the Company's investment in Class A Mezzanine Secured Deferrable Floating Rate Notes and Class B Mezzanine Secured Deferrable Fixed Rate Notes and limited liability company ("LLC") equity interests in Senior Loan Fund JV I, LLC (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, "SLF JV I"), which had a fair value of $101.0 million, $24.8 million and


	$13.9 million


	, respectively. At


	December 31, 2016


	,


	17.6%


	 of net assets, or


	$181.0 million


	, was invested in cash and cash equivalents (including restricted cash). In comparison, at


	September 30, 2016


	,


	189.6%


	 of net assets, or $


	2.2 billion


	, was invested in 129 portfolio investments, including the Company's investment in subordinated notes and LLC equity interests in SLF JV I, which had a fair value of


	$129.0 million


	 and


	$13.7 million


	, respectively, and


	11.4%


	 of net assets, or

	77.6%


	 of the Company's portfolio at fair value consisted of senior secured debt investments that were secured by priority liens on the assets of the portfolio companies and 13.1% consisted of subordinated notes, including debt investments in SLF JV I. As of September 30, 2016, 78.0% of the Company's portfolio at fair value consisted of senior secured debt investments that were secured by priority liens on the assets of the portfolio companies and 13.2% consisted of subordinated notes, including debt investments in SLF JV I.




	Moreover, the Company held equity investments in certain of its portfolio companies consisting of common stock, preferred stock, limited partnership interests or LLC equity interests. These instruments generally do not produce a current return but are held for potential investment appreciation and capital gain.




	During the three months ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015


	, the Company recorded net realized gain (loss) on investments and secured borrowings of


	$(23.1) million


	 and


	$1.4 million


	, respectively.


	During the three months ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015

These investments are generally not redeemable. The fair value amounts presented in this table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented in the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities.







	When a determination is made to classify a financial instrument within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy, the determination is based upon the fact that the unobservable factors are significant to the overall fair value measurement. However, Level 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or Level 3 components, observable components (i.e. components that are actively quoted and can be validated by external sources). Accordingly, the appreciation (depreciation) in the tables below includes changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology.

	(e)






	The Company generally uses prices provided by an independent pricing service which are non-binding indicative prices on or near the valuation date as the primary basis for the fair value determinations for quoted senior secured debt investments. Since these prices are non-binding, they may not be indicative of fair value. Each quoted price is evaluated by the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors in conjunction with additional information compiled by the Company, including financial performance, recent business developments and various other factors.

	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	(in thousands, except share and per share amounts, percentages and as otherwise indicated)




























	Under the bond yield approach, the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company's investments in debt securities and secured borrowings are capital structure premium, tranche specific risk premium (discount), size premium and industry premium (discount). Increases or decreases in any of those inputs in isolation may result in a lower or higher fair value measurement, respectively.




	Under the market and income approaches, the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company's investments in debt or equity securities are the weighted average cost of capital, company specific risk premium, revenue growth rate and EBITDA/Revenue multiple. Increases or decreases in a portfolio company's weighted average cost of capital or company specific risk premium in isolation may result in a lower or higher fair value measurement, respectively. Increases or decreases in the revenue growth rate or valuation multiples in isolation may result in a higher or lower fair value measurement, respectively.

	The Company utilizes the bond yield approach to estimate the fair values of its SBA debentures payable, which are included in Level 3 of the hierarchy. Under the bond yield approach, the Company uses bond yield models to determine the present value of the future cash flows streams for the debentures. The Company reviews various sources of data involving investments with similar characteristics and assesses the information in the valuation process.




	The Company uses the non-binding indicative quoted price as of the valuation date to estimate the fair value of its 4.875% unsecured notes due 2019, which are included in Level 3 of the hierarchy.




	The Company uses the unadjusted quoted price as of the valuation date to calculate the fair value of its 5.875% unsecured notes due 2024 and its 6.125% unsecured notes due 2028, which trade under the symbol "FSCE" on the New York Stock Exchange and the symbol "FSCFL" on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, respectively.

	The Company's investments are generally in small and mid-sized companies in a variety of industries. As of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	September 30, 2016


	, the Company had no single investment that represented greater than 10%




	of the total investment portfolio at fair value. Income, consisting of interest, dividends, fees, other investment income and realization of gains or losses, can fluctuate upon repayment or sale of an investment and in any given year can be highly concentrated among several investments.


	For the three months ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015


	, no individual investment produced investment income that exceeded 10% of total investment income.




	Senior Loan Fund JV I LLC




	In May 2014, the Company entered into an LLC agreement with Trinity Universal Insurance Company, a subsidiary of Kemper Corporation ("Kemper"), to form SLF JV I. On July 1, 2014, SLF JV I began investing in senior secured loans of middle market

	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	(in thousands, except share and per share amounts, percentages and as otherwise indicated)




























	companies and other corporate debt securities. The Company co-invests in these securities with Kemper through its investment in SLF JV I. SLF JV I is managed by a four person Board of Directors, two of whom are selected by the Company and two of whom are selected by Kemper. As of December 31, 2016, SLF JV I is capitalized pro rata with LLC equity interests as transactions are completed and may be capitalized with additional mezzanine notes which mature on October 12, 2036. All portfolio decisions and investment decisions in respect of SLF JV I must be approved by the SLF JV I investment committee, which consists of one representative of the Company and one representative of Kemper (with approval from a representative of each required). As of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	September 30, 2016


	, the Company and Kemper owned, in the aggregate,


	87.5%


	 and


	12.5%


	, respectively, of the LLC equity interests. As of December 31, 2016 and September 30, 2016, the Company owned 87.5% of the outstanding mezzanine notes and subordinated notes, respectively, and Kemper owned 12.5% of the outstanding mezzanine notes and subordinated notes, respectively.




	The Company has determined that SLF JV I is an investment company under ASC 946, however, in accordance with such guidance, the Company will generally not consolidate its investment in a company other than a wholly-owned investment company subsidiary or a controlled operating company whose business consists of providing services to the Company. Accordingly, the Company does not consolidate its noncontrolling interest in SLF JV I.




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	September 30, 2016


	, SLF JV I had total assets of


	$318.8 million


	 and


	$338.5 million


	, respectively. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, the Company's investment in SLF JV I consisted of LLC equity interests of


	$13.9 million


	, at fair value, and Class A mezzanine secured deferrable floating rate notes and Class B mezzanine secured deferrable fixed rate notes of


	$101.0 million


	 and


	$24.8 million


	, at fair value, respectively. As of


	September 30, 2016


	, the Company's investment in SLF JV I consisted of LLC equity interests of


	$13.7 million


	 and subordinated notes of


	$129.0 million


	, at fair value. In connection with the restructuring in December 2016 of the Company’s and Kemper’s investment in SLF JV I, the Company and Kemper exchanged their holdings of subordinated notes of SLF JV I for the mezzanine notes issued by SLF Repack Issuer 2016 LLC, a newly formed, wholly owned special purpose issuer subsidiary of SLF JV I, which are secured by SLF JV I’s LLC equity interests in the special purpose entities serving as borrowers under the Deutsche Bank facility and Credit Suisse facility described below. The mezzanine notes are senior in right of payment to the SLF JV I LLC equity interests and any contributions made by the Company to fund investments of SLF JV I through SLF Repack Issuer 2016 LLC. SLF JV I's portfolio consisted of middle market and other corporate debt securities of


	34


	 and


	37


	 "eligible portfolio companies" (as defined in the Section 2(a)(46) of the 1940 Act) as of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	September 30, 2016


	, respectively. The portfolio companies in SLF JV I are in industries similar to those in which the Company may invest directly.




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	September 30, 2016


	, the Company and Kemper had funded approximately


	$184.8 million


	 and $183.9 million, respectively, to SLF JV I, of which


	$161.7 million


	 and $160.9 million, respectively, was from the Company. As of


	September 30, 2016


	, the Company had commitments to fund subordinated notes to SLF JV I of $157.5 million, of which


	$12.0 million


	 was unfunded. As of December 31, 2016, the Company and Kemper had the option to fund additional mezzanine notes, subject to additional equity funding to SLF JV I. As of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	September 30, 2016


	, the Company had commitments to fund LLC equity interests in SLF JV I of


	$17.5 million


	, of which


	$1.3 million


	 and

	(1) There are no management fees or incentive fees charged at SLF JV I.




	SLF JV I has elected to fair value the debt securities issued to the Company and Kemper under ASC 825. The debt securities are valued based on a recent transaction price.




	During the three months ended




	December 31, 2016


	, the Company did not sell any senior secured debt investments to SLF JV I.


	During the three months ended


	 


	December 31, 2015


	, the Company sold


	$9.4 million


	 of senior secured debt investments to SLF JV I at fair value in exchange for


	$9.4 million


	 cash consideration. The Company recognized a


	$0.1 million


	 realized loss on these transactions.













	Note 4. Fee Income




	The Company receives a variety of fees in the ordinary course of business, including servicing, advisory, amendment, structuring and prepayment fees, which are classified as fee income and recognized as they are earned. The ending unearned fee income balance as of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	September 30, 2016


	 was $1.3 million.




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	, the Company had a receivable for


	$1.5 million


	 in aggregate exit fees of


	one


	 portfolio investment upon the future exit of this investment. These fees are to be paid to the Company upon the sooner to occur of (i) a sale of the borrower or substantially all of the assets of the borrower, (ii) the maturity date of the loan or (iii) the date when full prepayment of the loan occurs.

	FIFTH STREET FINANCE CORP.




	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	(in thousands, except share and per share amounts, percentages and as otherwise indicated)




























	The receipt of such fees is contingent upon the occurrence of one of the events listed above for each of the investments. A percentage of these fees is included in net investment income over the life of the loan.




	For the three months ended


	December 31, 2016


	, the Company recorded total fee income of


	$3.6 million


	, $0.8 million of which was recurring in nature. For the three months ended


	December 31, 2015


	, the Company recorded total fee income of


	$8.8 million


	, $2.0 million of which was recurring in nature. Recurring fee income primarily consists of servicing fees and exit fees.

	Distributions




	Distributions to common stockholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. The Company is required to distribute dividends each taxable year to its stockholders of an amount generally at least equal to 90% of its investment company taxable income, determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid, in order to be eligible for tax benefits allowed to a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. The Company anticipates paying out as a distribution all or substantially all of those amounts. The amount to be paid out as a dividend is determined by the Board of Directors and is based on management’s estimate of the Company’s annual taxable income.




	The Company has adopted a dividend reinvestment plan (“DRIP”) that provides for reinvestment of any distributions the Company declares in cash on behalf of its stockholders, unless a stockholder elects to receive cash. As a result, if the Company’s Board of Directors authorizes, and the Company declares, a cash distribution, then the Company’s stockholders who have not “opted out” of the Company’s DRIP will have their cash distribution automatically reinvested in additional shares of the Company’s common stock, rather than receiving the cash distribution. If the Company’s shares are trading at a premium to net asset value, the Company typically issues new shares to implement the DRIP. If the Company’s shares are trading at a discount to net asset value, the Company typically purchases shares in the open market in connection with the Company’s obligations under the DRIP.




	For income tax purposes, the Company estimates that its distributions for the calendar year will be composed primarily of ordinary income, and will be appropriately reported to the Internal Revenue Service and stockholders for the calendar year. To the extent that the Company’s taxable earnings fall below the amount of distributions paid, a portion of the total amount of the Company’s dividends for the fiscal year may be deemed a return of capital for tax purposes to the Company’s stockholders.

	Note 6. Borrowings




	ING Facility




	On May 27, 2010, the Company entered into a secured syndicated revolving credit facility (as subsequently amended, the "ING facility") pursuant to a Senior Secured Revolving Credit Agreement ("ING Credit Agreement") with certain lenders party thereto from time to time and ING Capital LLC, as administrative agent. The ING facility provides that the Company may use the proceeds and letters of credit under the facility for general corporate purposes, including acquiring and funding leveraged loans, mezzanine loans, high-yield securities, convertible securities, preferred stock, common stock and other investments. The ING facility allows the Company to request letters of credit from ING Capital LLC, as the issuing bank.




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	, the ING facility permitted up to $710 million of borrowings with an accordion feature allowing for future expansion of the facility up to a total of $800 million, and borrowings under the facility bore interest at a rate equal to LIBOR (1-, 2-, 3- or 6-month, at the Company's option) plus 2.25% per annum, with no LIBOR floor. Unless extended, the period during which the Company may make and reinvest borrowings under the facility will expire on August 6, 2017 and the maturity date of the facility is August 6, 2018.




	The ING facility is secured by substantially all of the Company's assets, as well as the assets of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Holdings, and its indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Fund of Funds, subject to certain exclusions for, among other things, equity interests in the Company's SBIC subsidiaries, and equity interests in Funding II (as defined below) as set forth in a Guarantee, Pledge and Security Agreement ("ING Security Agreement") entered into in connection with the ING Credit Agreement, among








	60








	FIFTH STREET FINANCE CORP.




	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	(in thousands, except share and per share amounts, percentages and as otherwise indicated)




























	Holdings, ING Capital LLC, as collateral agent, and the Company. Fund of Funds and Holdings were formed to hold certain of the Company's portfolio companies for tax purposes and have no other operations.




	 




	Pursuant to the ING Security Agreement, Holdings and Fund of Funds guaranteed the obligations under the ING Security Agreement, including the Company's obligations to the lenders and the administrative agent under the ING Credit Agreement. Additionally, the Company pledged its entire equity interest in Holdings and Holdings pledged its entire equity interest in Fund of Funds to the collateral agent pursuant to the terms of the ING Security Agreement. None of the Company's SBIC subsidiaries, or Funding II, as defined below, is party to the ING facility and their respective assets have not been pledged in connection therewith.




	The ING Credit Agreement and related agreements governing the ING facility required Holdings, Fund of Funds and the Company to, among other things, (i) make representations and warranties regarding the collateral as well as each of the Company's portfolio companies' businesses, (ii) agree to certain indemnification obligations, and (iii) agree to comply with various affirmative and negative covenants and other customary requirements for similar credit facilities. The ING facility documents also include usual and customary default provisions such as the failure to make timely payments under the facility, the occurrence of a change in control, and the failure by the Company to materially perform under the ING Credit Agreement and related agreements governing the facility, which, if not complied with, could accelerate repayment under the facility. Any such non-compliance could materially and adversely affecting the Company's liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants under the ING facility.




	Each loan or letter of credit originated under the ING facility is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The Company cannot be assured that it will be able to borrow funds under the ING facility at any particular time or at all.




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	, the Company had


	$402.5 million


	 of borrowings outstanding under the ING facility, which had a fair value of


	$402.5 million


	. The Company's borrowings under the ING facility bore interest at a weighted average interest rate of


	2.945%


	 for the three months ended


	December 31, 2016


	. For the three months ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company recorded interest expense of


	$4.2 million


	 and $3.3 million, respectively, related to the ING facility.









	Sumitomo Facility




	On September 16, 2011, Funding II, a consolidated wholly-owned bankruptcy remote, special purpose subsidiary, entered into a Loan and Servicing Agreement (as subsequently amended, the "Sumitomo Agreement"), as amended from time to time, with respect to a credit facility ("Sumitomo facility") with Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation ("SMBC"), an affiliate of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Inc., as administrative agent, and each of the lenders from time to time party thereto.




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	, the Sumitomo facility permitted up to $125




	million of borrowings (subject to collateral requirements), and borrowings under the facility bore interest at a rate of either (i) LIBOR (1-month) plus 2.00% per annum, with no LIBOR floor, if the borrowings under the Sumitomo facility are greater than 35% of the aggregate available borrowings under the Sumitomo facility or (ii) LIBOR (1-month) plus 2.25% per annum, if the borrowings under the Sumitomo Facility are less than or equal to 35% of the aggregate available borrowings under the Sumitomo facility. Unless extended, the period during which the Company may make and reinvest borrowings under the facility will expire on September 16, 2017, and the maturity date of the facility is September 16, 2021.




	In connection with the Sumitomo facility, the Company entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with Funding II, pursuant to which it has sold and will continue to sell to Funding II certain loan assets the Company has originated or acquired, or will originate or acquire.




	  




	The Sumitomo Agreement and related agreements governing the Sumitomo facility required both Funding II and the Company to, among other things (i) make representations and warranties regarding the collateral as well as each of the Company's portfolio companies' businesses, (ii) agree to certain indemnification obligations, and (iii) comply with various covenants, servicing procedures, limitations on acquiring and disposing of assets, reporting requirements and other customary requirements for similar credit facilities, including a prepayment penalty in certain cases. The Sumitomo facility agreements also include usual and customary default provisions such as the failure to make timely payments under the facility, a change in control of Funding II, and the failure by Funding II or the Company to materially perform under the Sumitomo Agreement and related agreements governing the Sumitomo facility, which, if not complied with, could accelerate repayment under the facility. Any such non-compliance could materially and adversely affect the Company's liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. Funding II was formed for the sole purpose of entering into the Sumitomo facility and has no other operations. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants under the Sumitomo facility.

	The Sumitomo facility is secured by all of the assets of Funding II. Each loan origination under the facility is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. There is no assurance that Funding II will be able to borrow funds under the Sumitomo facility at any particular time or at all.




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	, the Company had


	$38.9 million




	of borrowings outstanding under the Sumitomo facility, which had a fair value of


	$38.9 million


	. The Company's borrowings under the Sumitomo facility bore interest at a weighted average interest rate of


	2.784%


	 for the three months ended


	December 31, 2016


	. For the three months ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company recorded interest expense of


	$0.6 million


	 and $0.4 million, respectively, related to the Sumitomo facility.









	SBIC Subsidiaries




	On February 3, 2010, the Company's consolidated, wholly-owned subsidiary, FSMP IV, received a license, effective February 1, 2010, from the SBA to operate as an SBIC under Section 301(c) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended. On May 15, 2012, the Company's consolidated, wholly-owned subsidiary, FSMP V, received a license, effective May 10, 2012, from the SBA to operate as an SBIC. SBICs are designed to stimulate the flow of private equity capital to eligible small businesses. Under SBA regulations, SBICs may make loans to eligible small businesses and invest in the equity securities of small businesses.




	 




	The SBIC licenses allow the SBIC Subsidiaries to obtain leverage by issuing SBA-guaranteed debentures, subject to the satisfaction of certain customary procedures. SBA-guaranteed debentures are non-recourse, interest only debentures with interest payable semi-annually and have a 10-year maturity. The principal amount of SBA-guaranteed debentures is not required to be paid prior to maturity but may be prepaid at any time without penalty. The interest rate of SBA-guaranteed debentures is fixed at the time of issuance at a market-driven spread over U.S. Treasury Notes with 10-year maturities.




	SBA regulations currently limit the amount of SBA-guaranteed debentures that an SBIC may issue to $150 million when it has at least $75 million in regulatory capital. Affiliated SBICs are permitted to issue up to a combined maximum amount of $350 million of debentures when they have at least $175 million in regulatory capital.




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	 and September 30, 2016, FSMP IV had $75.0 million in regulatory capital and $138.3 million in SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding, which had a carrying value of $136.7 million and $136.6 million, respectively. As of


	December 31, 2016


	 and September 30, 2016, the fair value of these debentures was


	$130.9 million


	 and $131.0 million, respectively. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, these debentures bore interest at a weighted average interest rate of 3.625% (excluding the SBA annual charge), as follows:

	December 31, 2016


	 and September 30, 2016, the fair value of these debentures was


	$66.8 million


	 and $67.5 million, respectively. As of

	As of


	December 31, 2016


	, the $213.3 million of SBA-guaranteed debentures held by the SBIC Subsidiaries carry a weighted average interest rate of 3.348% (excluding the SBA annual charge).




	For the three months ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company recorded aggregate interest expense of


	$2.2 million


	 and $2.3 million, respectively, related to the SBA-guaranteed debentures of both SBIC subsidiaries.




	The SBA restricts the ability of SBICs to repurchase their capital stock. SBA regulations also include restrictions on a "change of control" or transfer of an SBIC and require that SBICs invest idle funds in accordance with SBA regulations. In addition, the SBIC Subsidiaries may also be limited in their ability to make distributions to the Company if they do not have sufficient capital, in accordance with SBA regulations.

	(in thousands, except share and per share amounts, percentages and as otherwise indicated)




























	The SBIC Subsidiaries are subject to regulation and oversight by the SBA, including requirements with respect to maintaining certain minimum financial ratios and other covenants. Receipt of an SBIC license does not assure that the SBIC Subsidiaries will receive SBA-guaranteed debenture funding and is further dependent upon the SBIC Subsidiaries continuing to be in compliance with SBA regulations and policies.




	The SBA, as a creditor, will have a superior claim to the SBIC Subsidiaries' assets over the Company's stockholders in the event the Company liquidates the SBIC Subsidiaries or the SBA exercises its remedies under the SBA-guaranteed debentures issued by the SBIC Subsidiaries upon an event of default.




	The Company has received exemptive relief from the SEC to permit it to exclude the debt of the SBIC Subsidiaries guaranteed by the SBA from the definition of senior securities in the Company's 200% asset coverage test under the 1940 Act. This allows the Company increased flexibility under the 200% asset coverage test by permitting it, as of December 31, 2016, to borrow up to $213.3 million more than it would otherwise be able to under the 1940 Act absent the receipt of this exemptive relief.




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	, except for assets that were funded through the Company's SBIC subsidiaries, substantially all of the Company's assets were pledged as collateral under the ING facility or the Sumitomo facility. With respect to the assets funded through the Company's SBIC subsidiaries, the SBA, as a creditor, will have a superior claim to the SBIC subsidiaries' assets over the Company's stockholders.

	Note 8. Taxable/Distributable Income and Dividend Distributions




	Taxable income differs from net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations primarily due to: (1) unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments and secured borrowings, as gains and losses which are not included in taxable income until they are realized; (2) origination and exit fees received in connection with investments in portfolio companies; (3) organizational and deferred offering costs; (4) recognition of interest income on certain loans; (5) income or loss recognition on exited investments; and (6) related to investments in controlled foreign corporations.




	At September 30, 2016, the Company had net capital loss carryforwards of $268.0 million to offset net capital gains, to the extent available and permitted by U.S. federal income tax law. Of the capital loss carryforwards, $1.5 million will expire on September 30, 2017, $10.3 million will expire on September 30, 2019, and $256.2 million will not expire, of which $55.3 million are available to offset future short-term capital gains and $200.9 million are available to offset future long-term capital gains.

	(1) The Company's taxable income for the three months ended


	December 31, 2016


	 is an estimate and will not be finally determined until the Company files its tax return for the Company's anticipated fiscal and taxable year ending September 30, 2017. Therefore, the final taxable income may be different than the estimate.




	As of September 30, 2016, the components of accumulated undistributed income on a tax basis were as follows:

























	Undistributed ordinary income, net






	$






	—















	Net realized capital losses






	(268,025






	)








	Unrealized losses, net






	(48,000






	)










	The Company uses the asset and liability method to account for its taxable subsidiaries' income taxes. Using this method, the Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. In addition, the Company recognizes deferred tax benefits associated with net loss carry forwards that it may use to offset future tax obligations. The Company measures deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which it expects to recover or settle those temporary differences. The Company has recorded a deferred tax asset for the difference in the book and tax basis of certain equity investments and tax net operating losses held by its taxable subsidiaries of $0.3 million. However, this amount has been fully offset by a valuation allowance, since it is more-likely-than-not that this deferred tax asset will not be realized.




	The Company is permitted to carry forward any net capital losses, if any, incurred in taxable years beginning with the Company's tax year ended September 30, 2011 for an unlimited period. However, any losses incurred during such taxable years will be required to be utilized prior to the losses incurred in taxable years ended prior to the Company’s tax year ended September 30, 2011, which are subject to an expiration date. As a result of the ordering rule, capital loss carryforwards from the Company’s tax year ended prior to its tax year ended September 30, 2011 may be more likely to expire unused than under previous tax law.




	As a RIC, the Company is also subject to a U.S. federal excise tax based on distributive requirements of its taxable income on a calendar year basis. The Company did not incur a U.S. federal excise tax for calendar years 2014 and 2015 and does not expect to incur a U.S. federal excise tax for calendar year 2016.




	    








	Note 9. Realized Gains or Losses and Net Unrealized Appreciation or Depreciation on Investments and Secured Borrowings




	Realized gains or losses are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the sale or redemption and the cost basis of the investment without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, and includes investments written-off during the period, net of recoveries. Realized losses may also be recorded in connection with the Company's determination that certain investments are considered worthless securities and/or meet the conditions for loss recognition per the applicable tax rules.




	Net unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the net change in the valuation of the portfolio pursuant to the Company's valuation guidelines and the reclassification of any prior period unrealized appreciation or depreciation.

	Note 10. Concentration of Credit Risks




	The Company deposits its cash with financial institutions and at times such balances may be in excess of the FDIC insurance limit. The Company limits its exposure to credit loss by depositing its cash with high credit quality financial institutions and monitoring their financial stability.













	Note 11. Related Party Transactions




	The Company has entered into an investment advisory agreement, subject to annual renewal, with the Investment Adviser. Under the investment advisory agreement, the Company pays the Investment Adviser a fee for its services consisting of two components — a base management fee and an incentive fee.




	Base Management Fee




	Prior to December 31, 2015, the base management fee was calculated at an annual rate of 2.0% of the Company's gross assets, including any borrowings for investment purposes but excluding cash and cash equivalents. The base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears and the fee for any partial month or quarter was appropriately prorated.




	On January 20, 2016, the Company announced that the Investment Adviser agreed to an amendment to the investment advisory agreement to permanently reduce the base management fee. Beginning January 1, 2016, the base management fee on total gross assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents) was reduced from 2.0% to 1.75%. The other commercial terms of the Company’s existing investment advisory arrangement with the Investment Adviser remained unchanged.




	On July 14, 2015, the Company announced that its investment adviser voluntarily agreed to a revised base management fee arrangement (the "Revised Management Fee") for the period commencing on July 1, 2015 and remaining in effect until January 1, 2017 (the "Waiver Period").




	The Revised Management Fee was intended to provide for a reduction in the base management fee payable by the Company to the Investment Adviser during the Waiver Period in connection with the issuance or sale of shares of the Company's common stock, including new shares issued as dividends or pursuant to the Company's dividend reinvestment plan, but excluding certain non-ordinary course transactions.  Neither the prior waiver of base management fees nor the Revised Management Fee in any way implies that the Investment Adviser will agree to additional waivers of management or incentive fees in any future period. The Revised Management Fee did not result in any recalculations of the base management fee prior to the expiration of the Waiver Period.




	For the three months ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, base management fees (net of waivers) were


	$8.6 million


	 and $11.7 million, respectively.




	For the three months ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Investment Adviser voluntarily waived a portion of the base management fee which resulted in waivers of


	$0.1 million


	.

	FIFTH STREET FINANCE CORP.




	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	(in thousands, except share and per share amounts, percentages and as otherwise indicated)




























	Incentive Fee




	The incentive fee has two parts. The first part ("Part I incentive fee" or "income incentive fee") is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on the Company's "Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income" for the immediately preceding fiscal quarter. For this purpose, "Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income" means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that the Company receives from portfolio companies) accrued during the fiscal quarter, minus the Company's operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, expenses payable under the Company's administration agreement, and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as OID, debt instruments with PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that the Company has not yet received in cash. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of the Company's net assets at the end of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter, will be compared to a "hurdle rate" of 2% per quarter, subject to a "catch-up" provision measured as of the end of each fiscal quarter. The Company's net investment income used to calculate this part of the incentive fee is also included in the amount of its gross assets used to calculate the base management fee. The operation of the incentive fee with respect to the Company's Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for each quarter is as follows:













	•






	No incentive fee is payable to the Investment Adviser in any fiscal quarter in which the Company's Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not exceed the hurdle rate of 2% (the "preferred return" or "hurdle");
















	•






	100% of the Company's Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income with respect to that portion of such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than or equal to 2.5% in any fiscal quarter is payable to the Investment Adviser. The Company refers to this portion of its Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (which exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than or equal to 2.5%) as the "catch-up." The "catch-up" provision is intended to provide the Investment Adviser with an incentive fee of 20% on all of the Company's Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income as if a hurdle rate did not apply when the Company's Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income exceeds 2.5% in any fiscal quarter; and
















	•






	20% of the amount of the Company's Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds 2.5% in any fiscal quarter is payable to the Investment Adviser once the hurdle is reached and the catch-up is achieved.












	There is no accumulation of amounts on the hurdle rate from quarter to quarter and accordingly there is no clawback of amounts previously paid if subsequent quarters are below the quarterly hurdle and there is no delay of payment if prior quarters are below the quarterly hurdle.




	The second part of the incentive fee ("Part II Incentive Fee" or "capital gain incentive fee") is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each fiscal year (or upon termination of the investment advisory agreement, as of the termination date) and equals 20% of the Company's realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of each fiscal year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees.




	GAAP requires the Company to accrue for the theoretical capital gain incentive fee that would be payable after giving effect to the net unrealized capital appreciation. A fee so calculated and accrued would not be payable under the investment advisory agreement, and may never be paid based upon the computation of capital gain incentive fees in subsequent periods. Amounts ultimately paid under the investment advisory agreement will be consistent with the formula reflected in the investment advisory agreement. The Company does not currently accrue for capital gain incentive fees due to the accumulated realized and unrealized losses in the portfolio.




	For the three months ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, incentive fees were


	$4.1 million


	 and $3.7 million, respectively.




	At


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	September 30, 2016


	, the Company had a liability on its Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities in the amount of


	$12.4 million


	 and


	$16.0 million


	, respectively, reflecting the unpaid portion of the base management fee and Part I incentive fee payable to the Investment Adviser.




	Indemnification




	The investment advisory agreement provides that, absent willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of their respective duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of their respective duties and obligations, the Investment Adviser and its officers, managers, partners, members (and their members, including the owners of their members), agents, employees, controlling persons and any other person or entity affiliated with it, are entitled to indemnification from the Company for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of the

	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	(in thousands, except share and per share amounts, percentages and as otherwise indicated)




























	Investment Adviser's services under the investment advisory agreement or otherwise as the Investment Adviser. In this regard, FSAM may seek indemnification under the investment advisory agreement with respect to any losses and expenses it may incur in connection with active lawsuits. There is no estimated range of potential claims at this time, and, to date, no amounts have been recorded in the consolidated financial statements.




	Administration Agreement




	On January 1, 2015, the Company entered into an administration agreement with its administrator, FSC CT, under substantially similar terms as its prior administration agreement with FSC CT, Inc. Under the administration agreement with FSC CT, administrative services are provided to the Company, including providing the Company with its principal executive offices and equipment, and clerical, bookkeeping and recordkeeping services at such facilities. Under the administration agreement, FSC CT also performs or oversees the performance of the Company's required administrative services, which includes being responsible for the financial records which the Company is required to maintain and preparing reports to the Company's stockholders and reports filed with the SEC. In addition, FSC CT assists the Company in determining and publishing the Company's net asset value, overseeing the preparation and filing of the Company's tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports to the Company's stockholders, and generally overseeing the payment of the Company's expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to the Company by others. For providing these services, facilities and personnel, the Company reimburses FSC CT the allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by FSC CT in performing its obligations under the administration agreement, including rent and the Company's allocable portion of the costs of compensation and related expenses of the Company's chief financial officer and chief compliance officer and their staffs. Such reimbursement is at cost with no profit to, or markup by, FSC CT. The Company utilizes office space in Greenwich, CT that is leased by FSC CT from an affiliate controlled by the chief executive officer of the Investment Adviser and FSC CT, Mr. Leonard M. Tannenbaum. The Company also utilizes additional office space that is leased by affiliates of the Investment Adviser and FSC CT in Chicago, IL. Any reimbursement for a portion of the rent at these locations is at cost with no profit to, or markup by, FSC CT. FSC CT may also provide, on the Company's behalf, managerial assistance to the Company's portfolio companies. The administration agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon 60 days' written notice to the other party.




	For the three months ended


	December 31, 2016


	, the Company accrued administrative expenses of $1.4 million, including $0.9 million of general and administrative expenses, which are due to FSC CT. At


	December 31, 2016


	 and September 30, 2016,


	$2.1 million


	 and $2.2 million was included in "Due to FSC CT" in the Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities, respectively. For the three months ended


	December 31, 2015


	, the Company accrued administrative expenses of $1.5 million, including $0.9 million of general and administrative expenses, which were due to FSC CT.




	As of December 31, 2016, a subsidiary of FSAM held 8,399,520 shares of the Company's common stock, which represents approximately 6.0% of the Company's common stock outstanding.

Tannenbaum, the Company's former Chief Executive Officer. The Convertible Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated April 12, 2011 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and the Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (the “Trustee”).




	The Convertible Notes matured on April 1, 2016 and the Company repaid in full the $115.0 million of outstanding Convertible Notes on their maturity date. The Convertible Notes bore interest at a rate of 5.375% per annum and were repaid using cash on hand and borrowings under the ING facility.




	The Convertible Notes bore interest that was payable semiannually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The Convertible Notes were the Company's unsecured obligations and ranked senior in right of payment to the Company's indebtedness that was expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Convertible Notes; equal in right of payment to the Company's unsecured indebtedness that was not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of the Company's secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness (including trade payables) incurred by the Company's subsidiaries or financing vehicles.

	On or after January 1, 2016 until the close of business on March 31, 2016, holders could have converted their Convertible Notes at any time. Upon conversion, the Company would have been obligated to deliver shares of its common stock based on a conversion rate that was subject to periodic adjustment.




	The Company could not redeem the Convertible Notes prior to maturity. No sinking fund was provided for the Convertible Notes. In addition, if certain corporate events occurred in respect of the Company, holders of the Convertible Notes could have required the Company to repurchase for cash all or part of their Convertible Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest through, but excluding, the required repurchase date.




	The Indenture contained certain covenants, including covenants requiring the Company to provide financial information to the holders of the Convertible Notes and the Trustee if the Company ceases to be subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). These covenants were subject to limitations and exceptions that are described in the Indenture.




	For the three months ended


	December 31, 2015


	, the Company recorded interest expense of $1.7 million related to the Convertible Notes.

	2019 Notes




	On February 26, 2014, the Company issued $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 4.875% unsecured notes due 2019 (the "2019 Notes") for net proceeds of $244.4 million after deducting OID of $1.4 million, underwriting commissions and discounts of $3.7 million and offering costs of $0.5 million.  The OID on the 2019 Notes is amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the notes.




	The 2019 Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated April 30, 2012, as supplemented by the supplemental indenture, dated February 26, 2014 (collectively, the "2019 Notes Indenture"), between the Company and the Trustee. The 2019 Notes are the Company's general unsecured obligations that rank senior in right of payment to all of the Company's existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2019 Notes. The 2019 Notes rank equally in right of payment with all of the Company's existing and future liabilities that are not so subordinated. The 2019 Notes effectively rank junior to any of the Company's secured indebtedness (including unsecured indebtedness that the Company later secures) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The 2019 Notes rank structurally junior to all existing and future indebtedness (including trade payables) incurred by the Company's subsidiaries, financing vehicles or similar facilities. 




	Interest on the 2019 Notes is paid semi-annually on March 1 and September 1 at a rate of 4.875% per annum. The 2019 Notes mature on March 1, 2019 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at the Company's option prior to maturity.




	The 2019 Notes Indenture contains certain covenants, including covenants requiring the Company's compliance with (regardless of whether the Company is subject to) the restrictions on dividends, distributions and purchase of capital stock set forth in Section 18(a)(1)(B) as modified by Section 61(a)(1) of the 1940 Act, as well as covenants requiring the Company to provide financial information to the holders of the 2019 Notes and the Trustee if the Company ceases to be subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. These covenants are subject to limitations and exceptions that are described in the 2019 Notes Indenture. The Company may repurchase the 2019 Notes in accordance with the 1940 Act and the rules promulgated thereunder. In addition, holders of the 2019 Notes can require the Company to repurchase the 2019 Notes at 100% of their principal amount upon the occurrence of certain change of control events as described in the 2019 Notes Indenture. The 2019 Notes were issued in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. During the three months ended


	December 31, 2016


	 and December 31, 2015, the Company did not repurchase any of the 2019 Notes in the open market.




	For each of the three months ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company recorded interest expense of


	$3.3 million


	 related to the 2019 Notes.




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	, there were


	$250.0 million


	 of 2019 Notes outstanding, which had a carrying value and fair value of $247.6 million and


	$255.9 million

	Note 15. Secured Borrowings




	See Note 2 "Secured Borrowings" for a description of the Company's accounting treatment of secured borrowings.




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	, secured borrowings at fair value totaled


	$14.0 million


	 and the fair value of the investment that is associated with these secured borrowings was


	$46.8 million


	. These secured borrowings were the result of the Company's completion of partial loan sales totaling $22.8 million of a senior secured debt investment during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 that did not meet the definition of a participating interest. As a result, sale treatment was not allowed and these partial loan sales were treated as secured borrowings. The Company receives loan servicing fees as it continues to serve as administrative agent for this investment. As a result, the Company earns servicing fees in connection with the loans that were partially sold. During the three months ended


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	December 31, 2015


	, there were

	Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies




	FSC Class-Action Lawsuits




	In October and November of 2015, the Company, its executive officers and FSAM were named as defendants in three putative securities class-action lawsuits filed in New York and Connecticut federal courts (and later consolidated in New York). The lawsuits alleged violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of a putative class of investors who purchased our common stock between July 7, 2014, and February 6, 2015. The lawsuits alleged in general terms that defendants engaged in a purportedly fraudulent scheme designed to artificially inflate the true value of our investment portfolio and investment income in order to increase FSAM’s revenue. The plaintiffs sought compensatory damages and attorneys’ fees and costs, among other relief, but did not specify the amount of damages being sought. A lead plaintiff was selected in February 2016, a consolidated complaint similar to the original complaint was filed in April 2016, and a motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint was filed in May 2016. The parties agreed in July to settle the case for $14.1 million, with approximately 99% of the settlement amount to be paid from insurance coverage. Confirmatory discovery was completed in August 2016, and the lead plaintiff filed the proposed settlement with the court in September. On November 9, 2016, the court authorized the parties to send notice to the class and scheduled a fairness hearing for February 16, 2017. No objections or opt-outs to the settlement were received by the deadline.




	FSC Shareholder Derivative Actions




	I


	n December 2015 through April 2016, several putative shareholder derivative actions were filed on behalf of the Company in Connecticut federal court and in Connecticut and Delaware state court, naming its executive officers and directors and FSAM as defendants and the Company as the nominal defendant. The underlying allegations in all of the complaints were related, and generally similar, to the allegations in the securities class actions against us described above. The Connecticut federal cases were consolidated, and the defendants moved to transfer the cases to New York federal court, which motion was subsequently withdrawn without prejudice in connection with the proposed settlement described below. The Connecticut and Delaware state cases were stayed by consent of the parties while the Connecticut federal court considered the proposed settlement.

	(in thousands, except share and per share amounts, percentages and as otherwise indicated)

































	The parties signed an agreement in July 2016 to settle the cases. The proposed settlement provided for Fifth Street Management’s waiver of fees charged to the Company in the amount of $1.0 million for each of ten consecutive quarters starting in January 2018 and maintenance of the previously announced decrease in the base management fee from 2% to a maximum of 1.75% of gross assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents) for at least four years, subject to certain specified conditions. The proposed settlement also called for the Company to adopt certain governance and oversight enhancements. The Company and the defendants further agreed that the Company would not oppose plaintiffs’ request for an award of $5.1 million in attorneys’ fees and expenses, which was paid from insurance coverage. The plaintiffs conducted confirmatory discovery in August 2016, and, on September 23, 2016, the Connecticut federal court issued an order preliminarily approving the proposed settlement, authorizing the parties to disseminate notice to the Company's stockholders. A fairness hearing was held on December 13, 2016 and the proposed settlement was approved. The Connecticut and Delaware state cases were dismissed in light of such approval.




	FSC Delaware Class-Action Lawsuit




	On January 29, 2016, James Craig filed a putative stockholder class-action lawsuit in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware against the Company's officers and directors, Fifth Street Management, FSAM, the Company and Fifth Street Holdings L.P. The complaint alleged that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties to our stockholders by, among other things, issuing an incomplete or inaccurate preliminary proxy statement that purportedly attempted to mislead our stockholders into voting against proposals to be presented by another shareholder in a proxy contest in connection with the Company's 2016 annual meeting. The complaint sought, among other things, an injunction preventing the Company and its Board of Directors from soliciting proxies for the 2016 annual meeting until additional disclosures were issued. The plaintiff moved for expedited proceedings and for a preliminary injunction.




	Defendants opposed plaintiff’s motion for expedited proceedings and moved to dismiss the case. The Company also filed another amendment to the preliminary proxy statement, making additional disclosures relating to issues raised by plaintiff. On February 16, 2016, plaintiff withdrew his motions for a preliminary injunction and expedited proceedings. Plaintiff later informed the court that his case had become moot upon the withdrawal of the competing proxy proposal, and he moved for a “mootness fee.” On September 23, 2016, the court awarded plaintiff fees and expenses of $0.4 million, which were paid from insurance coverage during the three months ended December 31, 2016.




	SEC Examination and Investigation




	On March 23, 2016, the Division of Enforcement of the SEC sent document subpoenas and document preservation notices to the Company, FSAM, FSCO GP LLC - General Partner of Fifth Street Opportunities Fund, L.P., or FSOF, and FSFR. The subpoenas sought production of documents relating to a variety of issues, including those raised in an ordinary-course examination of Fifth Street Management by the SEC’s Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations that began in October 2015, and in the securities class actions and derivative actions discussed above. The subpoenas were issued pursuant to a formal order of private investigation captioned In the Matter of the Fifth Street Group of Companies, No. HO-12925, dated March 23, 2016, which addresses (among other things) (i) the valuation of the Company's portfolio companies and investments, (ii) the expenses allocated or charged to the Company and FSFR, (iii) FSOF’s trading in the securities of publicly traded business development companies, (iv) statements to the Board, other representatives of pooled investment vehicles, investors, or prospective investors concerning the fair value of the Company's portfolio companies or investments as well as expenses allocated or charged to the Company and FSFR, (v) various issues relating to adoption and implementation of policies and procedures under the Advisers Act, (vi) statements and/or potential omissions in the entities’ SEC filings, (vii) the entities’ books, records, and accounts and whether they fairly and accurately reflected the entities’ transactions and dispositions of assets, and (viii) several other issues relating to corporate books and records. The formal order cites various provisions of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Advisers Act, as well as rules promulgated under those Acts, as the bases of the investigation. The subpoenaed Fifth Street entities are cooperating with the Division of Enforcement investigation, have produced requested documents, and have been communicating with Division of Enforcement personnel.




	Legal Costs




	A provision for losses of $19.5 million related to the lawsuits was recorded, offset by the accrual of expected insurance recoveries of $19.4 million in the accompanying consolidated financial statements during the year ended September 30, 2016. No significant additional provision for losses related to the lawsuits was recorded during the three months ended December 31, 2016. An adverse judgment could have a material adverse effect on the operations and liquidity of the Company. FSAM may seek indemnification under the investment advisory agreement with respect to any losses and expenses it may incur in connection with these lawsuits.









	In connection with the matters described above, the Company incurred professional fees of $0.1 million and received insurance reimbursements related to previously incurred professional fees of $0.6 million during the three months ended December 31, 2016. The Company incurred professional fees of $5.8 million and did not receive any insurance reimbursements during the three months ended December 31, 2015. In the future, certain of the expenses associated with defense of the lawsuits may also be covered by insurance, and

	(in thousands, except share and per share amounts, percentages and as otherwise indicated)




























	the Company may seek reimbursement from the appropriate carriers. The Company cannot assure you, however, that these expenses will ultimately be reimbursed in whole, or at all.




	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements




	The Company may be a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financial needs of its companies. At


	December 31, 2016


	, the Company's only off-balance sheet arrangements consisted of


	$157.0 million


	 of unfunded commitments, which was comprised of


	$143.1 million


	 to provide debt financing to certain of its portfolio companies,


	$1.3 million


	 to provide equity financing to SLF JV I and $12.6 million related to unfunded limited partnership interests. As of


	September 30, 2016


	, the Company's only off-balance sheet arrangements consisted of $


	215.7 million


	 of unfunded commitments, which was comprised of $191.7 million to provide debt financing to certain of its portfolio companies, $14.1 million to provide debt and equity financing to SLF JV I and $9.9 million related to unfunded limited partnership interests. Such commitments are subject to its portfolio companies' satisfaction of certain financial and nonfinancial covenants and involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities and are not reflected on our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. The fair value of the Company's unfunded commitments is considered to be immaterial as the yield determined at the time of underwriting is expected to be materially consistent with the yield upon funding.




	A summary of the composition of unfunded commitments (consisting of revolvers, term loans with delayed draw components, SLF JV I subordinated notes and LLC interests, and limited partnership interests) as of


	December 31, 2016

	Item 2.     


	Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations




	The following discussion should be read in connection with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.




	Some of the statements in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q constitute forward-looking statements because they relate to future events or our future performance or financial condition. The forward-looking statements contained in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q may include statements as to:













	•






	our future operating results and dividend projections;
















	•






	our business prospects and the prospects of our portfolio companies;
















	•






	the impact of the investments that we expect to make;
















	•






	the ability of our portfolio companies to achieve their objectives;
















	•






	our expected financings and investments;
















	•






	the adequacy of our cash resources and working capital;
















	•






	the timing of cash flows, if any, from the operations of our portfolio companies; and
















	•






	the cost or potential outcome of any litigation to which we may be a party.







	In addition, words such as "anticipate," "believe," "expect," "seek," "plan," "should," "estimate," "project" and "intend" indicate forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements include these words. The forward-looking statements contained in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those implied or expressed in the forward-looking statements for any reason, including the factors set forth in "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2016 and elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include:




	 













	•






	changes in the economy, financial markets and political environment;
















	•






	risks associated with possible disruption in our operations or the economy generally due to terrorism or natural disasters;
















	•






	future changes in laws or regulations (including the interpretation of these laws and regulations by regulatory authorities) and conditions in our operating areas, particularly with respect to business development companies, small business investment companies, or SBICs, or regulated investment companies, or RICs; and
















	•






	other considerations that may be disclosed from time to time in our publicly disseminated documents and filings.







	We have based the forward-looking statements included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q on information available to us on the date of this quarterly report, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Although we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, you are advised to consult any additional disclosures that we may make directly to you or through reports that we in the future may file with the SEC, including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.




	Except as otherwise specified, references to the "Company," "we," "us," and "our," refer to Fifth Street Finance Corp and its consolidated subsidiaries.




	All dollar amounts in tables are in thousands, except share and per share amounts, percentages and as otherwise indicated.




	Overview




	We are a specialty finance company that is a closed-end, non-diversified management investment company. We have elected to be regulated as a business development company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the 1940 Act. We have qualified and elected to be treated as a RIC under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, for tax purposes.









	We generally lend to and invest in small and mid-sized companies, primarily in connection with investments by private equity sponsors. We define small and mid-sized companies as those with annual EBITDA (generally defined as earnings before net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization) between $10 million and $120 million. Our investment objective is to maximize our portfolio’s total return by generating current income from our debt investments, and to a lesser extent, capital appreciation from our equity investments.




	We are externally managed by Fifth Street Management LLC, or the Investment Adviser, a subsidiary of Fifth Street Asset Management Inc., or FSAM, a publicly traded alternative asset manager, pursuant to an investment advisory agreement. FSC CT LLC, or FSC CT, a subsidiary of the Investment Adviser, also provides certain administrative and other services necessary for us to operate.

	Critical Accounting Policies









	Basis of Presentation




	Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, and pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X. In the opinion of management, all adjustments of a normal recurring nature considered necessary for the fair presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements have been made. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. We are an investment company following the accounting and reporting guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 946,


	Financial Services-Investment Companies,


	 or ASC 946.




	Investment Valuation




	We are required to report our investments that are not publicly traded or for which current market values are not readily available at fair value. The fair value is deemed to be the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.




	We value our investments in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 820,


	Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures


	, or ASC 820, which defines fair value as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A liability's fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor. ASC 820 prioritizes the use of observable market prices derived from such prices over entity-specific inputs. Where observable prices or inputs are not available or reliable, valuation techniques are applied. These valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the investments or market and the investments' complexity.




	Hierarchical levels, defined by ASC 820 and directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuation of these assets and liabilities, are as follows:




	 













	•






	Level 1 — Unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.
















	•






	Level 2 — Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data at the measurement date for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
















	•






	Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that reflect management's best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model.







	In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy established by ASC 820. In such cases, an investment's level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the investment. Generally, it is expected that all of our investment securities will be valued using Level 3 inputs. This includes investment securities that are valued using "bid" and "ask" prices obtained from independent third party pricing services or directly from brokers. These investments are generally classified as Level 3 because the quoted prices may be indicative in nature for securities that are in an inactive market, may be for similar securities or may require adjustments for investment-specific factors or restrictions.




	Financial instruments with readily available quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment inherent in measuring fair value. As such, our Investment Adviser's capital markets group obtains and analyzes readily available market quotations provided by independent pricing services for all of our senior secured debt investments for which quotations are available. In determining the fair value of a particular investment, pricing services use observable market information, including both binding and non-binding indicative quotations.




	Our Investment Adviser evaluates the prices obtained from independent pricing services based on available market information and company specific data that could affect the credit quality and/or fair value of the investment. Investments for which market quotations are readily available may be valued at such market quotations. In order to validate market quotations, our Investment Adviser looks at a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and nature of the quotations. Our Investment Adviser does not adjust the prices unless it has a reason to believe any such market quotations are not reflective of the fair value of an investment. Examples of events that would cause market quotations to not reflect fair value could include cases when a security trades infrequently causing a quoted purchase or sale price to become stale or in the event of a "fire sale"








	82

















	by a distressed seller. In these instances, we value such investments by using the valuation procedure that it uses with respect to assets for which market quotations are not readily available (as discussed below).




	If the quotation provided by the pricing service is based on only one or two market sources, we perform additional procedures to corroborate such information, which may include the bond yield approach discussed below and a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the credit quality and market trends affecting the portfolio company.




	We perform detailed valuations of our debt and equity investments for which market quotations are not readily available or are deemed not to represent fair value of the investments. We typically use two different valuation techniques. The first valuation technique is an analysis of the enterprise value, or EV, of the portfolio company. EV means the entire value of the portfolio company to a market participant, including the sum of the values of debt and equity securities used to capitalize the enterprise at a point in time. The primary method for determining EV uses a multiple analysis whereby appropriate multiples are applied to the portfolio company's EBITDA. EBITDA multiples are typically determined based upon review of market comparable transactions and publicly traded comparable companies, if any. We may also employ other valuation multiples to determine EV, such as revenues. The second method for determining EV uses a discounted cash flow analysis whereby future expected cash flows of the portfolio company are discounted to determine a present value using estimated discount rates (typically a weighted average cost of capital based on costs of debt and equity consistent with current market conditions). The EV analysis is typically performed to determine the value of equity investments, to determine if there is credit impairment for debt investments and to determine the value for debt investments that we are deemed to control under the 1940 Act. If debt investments are credit impaired, an EV analysis may be used to value such debt investments; however, in addition to the methods outlined above, other alternative methods such as an asset liquidation model, expected recovery model or a recent observable or pending transaction may be utilized to estimate EV. The second valuation technique is a bond yield approach, which is typically performed for non-credit impaired debt investments. To determine fair value using a bond yield approach, a current price is imputed for the investment based upon an assessment of the expected market yield for a similarly structured investment with a similar level of risk. In the bond yield approach, we consider the current contractual interest rate, the capital structure and other terms of the investment relative to risk of the company and the specific investment. A key determinant of risk, among other things, is the leverage through the investment relative to the EV of the portfolio company. As debt investments held by us are substantially illiquid with no active transaction market, we depend on primary market data, including newly funded transactions and industry specific market movements, as well as secondary market data with respect to high yield debt instruments and syndicated loans, as inputs in determining the appropriate market yield, as applicable.




	In accordance with ASC 820-10, certain investments that qualify as investment companies in accordance with ASC 946 may be valued using net asset value as a practical expedient for fair value.




	We estimate the fair value of privately held warrants using a Black Scholes pricing model, which includes an analysis of various factors and subjective assumptions including, but not limited to, the current stock price (by analyzing the portfolio company's operating performance and financial condition and general market conditions), the expected period until exercise, expected volatility of the underlying stock price, expected dividends and the risk free rate. Changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates.




	Our Board of Directors undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter in connection with determining the fair value of our investments:













	•






	The quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by our Investment Adviser's valuation team in conjunction with the Investment Adviser's portfolio management and capital markets teams;







	•


	Preliminary valuations are then reviewed and discussed with principals of our Investment Adviser;













	•






	Separately, independent valuation firms engaged by our Board of Directors prepare valuations of our investments, on a selected basis, for which market quotations are not readily available or are readily available but deemed not reflective of the fair value of the investment, and submit the reports to us and provide such reports to our Investment Adviser and the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors;
















	•






	The Investment Adviser compares and contrasts its preliminary valuations to the valuations of the independent valuation firms and prepares a valuation report for the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors;
















	•






	The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors reviews the preliminary valuations with the portfolio managers of the Investment Adviser and our Investment Adviser responds and supplements the preliminary valuations to reflect any discussions between our Investment Adviser and the Audit Committee;
















	•






	The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors makes a recommendation to our Board of Directors regarding the fair value of the level 3 investments in the Company's portfolio; and
















	•






	Our Board of Directors discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each level 3 investment in the Company's portfolio.

	The fair value of our investments at


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	September 30, 2016


	 was determined in good faith by our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors has authorized the engagement of independent valuation firms to provide valuation assistance. We will continue to engage independent valuation firms to provide assistance regarding the determination of the fair value of a portion of our portfolio securities for which market quotations are not readily available or are readily available but deemed not reflective of the fair value of the investment each quarter. As of


	December 31, 2016


	,


	69.4%


	 of our portfolio at fair value was valued by independent valuation firms. The percentage of our portfolio valued by independent valuation firms may vary from period to period based on the availability of market quotations for our portfolio investments during the respective periods. Typically, a higher percentage of our portfolio is valued by independent valuation firms in our fiscal fourth quarter due to additional year-end procedures. However, our Board of Directors is ultimately and solely responsible for the valuation of the portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to our valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process.




	The percentages of our portfolio, at fair value, valued by independent valuation firms as of the end of each period during the current and two preceding fiscal years were as follows:

























	As of December 31, 2014

	Revenue Recognition




	Interest and Dividend Income




	Interest income, adjusted for accretion of original issue discount, or OID, is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected. We stop accruing interest on investments when it is determined that interest is no longer collectible. Investments that are expected to pay regularly scheduled interest in cash are generally placed on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest cash payments will be collected. Cash interest payments received on investments may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management’s judgment. Such non-accrual investments are restored to accrual status if past due principal and interest are paid in cash, and in management’s judgment, are likely to continue timely payment of their remaining interest. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, there were


	11


	 investments on which we had stopped accruing cash and/or payment in kind, or PIK interest or OID income.




	In connection with our investment, we sometimes receive nominal cost equity that is valued as part of the negotiation process with the particular portfolio company. When we receive nominal cost equity, we allocate our cost basis in the investment between debt securities and the nominal cost equity at the time of origination. Any resulting discount from recording the loan, or otherwise purchasing a security at a discount, is accreted into interest income over the life of the loan.




	We generally recognize dividend income on the ex-dividend date. Distributions received from equity investments are evaluated to determine if the distribution should be recorded as dividend income or a return of capital. Generally, we will not record distributions from equity investments as dividend income unless there are sufficient earnings at the portfolio company prior to the distribution. Distributions that are classified as a return of capital are recorded as a reduction in the cost basis of the investment.




	Fee Income




	We receive a variety of fees in the ordinary course of business, including servicing, advisory, amendment, structuring and prepayment fees, which are classified as fee income and recognized as they are earned.




	We have also structured exit fees across certain of our portfolio investments to be received upon the future exit of those investments. Exit fees are payable upon the exit of a debt security. These fees are to be paid to us upon the sooner to occur of (i) a sale of the borrower or substantially all of the assets of the borrower, (ii) the maturity date of the loan or (iii) the date when full prepayment of the loan occurs. The receipt of such fees is contingent upon the occurrence of one of the events listed above for each of the investments. A percentage of these fees is included in net investment income over the life of the loan. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, we had a receivable for


	$1.5 million


	 in aggregate exit fees of


	one


	 portfolio investment upon the future exit of this investment.








	84






















	PIK Interest




	Our loans may contain contractual PIK interest provisions. The PIK interest, which represents contractually deferred interest added to the loan balance that is generally due at the end of the loan term, is generally recorded on the accrual basis to the extent such amounts are expected to be collected. We generally cease accruing PIK interest if there is insufficient value to support the accrual or if we do not expect the portfolio company to be able to pay all principal and interest due. Our decision to cease accruing PIK interest involves subjective judgments and determinations based on available information about a particular portfolio company, including whether the portfolio company is current with respect to its payment of principal and interest on its loans and debt securities; monthly and quarterly financial statements and financial projections for the portfolio company; our assessment of the portfolio company's business development success, including product development, profitability and the portfolio company's overall adherence to its business plan; information obtained by us in connection with periodic formal update interviews with the portfolio company's management and, if appropriate, the private equity sponsor; and information about the general economic and market conditions in which the portfolio company operates. Based on this and other information, we determine whether to cease accruing PIK interest on a loan or debt security when it is determined that PIK interest is no longer collectible. Our determination to cease accruing PIK interest on a loan or debt security is generally made well before our full write-down of such loan or debt security. In addition, if it is subsequently determined that we will not be able to collect any previously accrued PIK interest, the fair value of our loans or debt securities would decline by the amount of such previously accrued, but uncollectible, PIK interest. The accrual of PIK interest on our debt investments increases the recorded cost basis of these investments in our Consolidated Financial Statements and, as a result, increases the cost basis of these investments for purposes of computing the capital gains incentive fee payable by us to our Investment Adviser.




	For a discussion of risks we are subject to as a result of our use of PIK interest in connection with our investments, see "Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure — We may have difficulty paying our required distributions if we are required to recognize income for U.S. federal income tax purposes before or without receiving cash representing such income," "— We may in the future choose to pay distributions partly in our own stock, in which case you may be subject to tax in excess of the cash you receive" and "— Our incentive fee may induce our Investment Adviser to make speculative investments" in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2016. In addition, if it is subsequently determined that we will not be able to collect any previously accrued PIK interest, the fair value of our loans or debt securities would decline by the amount of such previously accrued, but uncollectible, PIK interest. The accrual of PIK interest on our debt investments increases the recorded cost basis of these investments both in our Consolidated Financial Statements and for purposes of computing the capital gains incentive fee payable by us to our Investment Adviser.









	To maintain our status as a RIC, PIK income must be paid out to our stockholders as distributions, even though we have not yet collected the cash and may never collect the cash relating to the PIK interest. Accumulated PIK interest was


	$62.0 million


	, or 3.2%, of the fair value of our portfolio of investments as of


	December 31, 2016


	 and $62.6 million, or 2.9%, as of


	September 30, 2016


	. The net increases in loan balances as a result of contractual PIK arrangements are separately identified in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.








	85

















	Portfolio Composition




	Our investments principally consist of loans, purchased equity investments and equity grants in privately-held companies and Senior Loan Fund JV I, LLC, or, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, SLF JV I. Our loans are typically secured by a first, second or subordinated lien on the assets of the portfolio company and generally have terms of up to seven years (but an expected average life of between three and four years). We are currently focusing our origination efforts on a prudent mix of senior secured and subordinated loans which we believe will provide attractive risk-adjusted returns while maintaining adequate credit protection. The mix may change over time based on market conditions and management's view of where the best risk-adjusted returns are available.

	Portfolio Asset Quality




	We employ a ranking system to assess and monitor the credit risk of our investment portfolio. We rank all debt investments on a scale from 1 to 4. The system is intended to reflect the performance of the borrower's business, the collateral coverage of the loan, and other factors considered relevant to making a credit judgment. We have determined that there should be an individual ranking assigned to each tranche of securities in the same portfolio company where appropriate. This may arise when the perceived risk of loss on the investment varies significantly between tranches due to their respective seniority in the capital structure.













	•






	Investment Ranking 1 is used for debt investments that are performing above expectations and/or capital gains are expected.
















	•






	Investment Ranking 2 is used for debt investments that are performing substantially within our expectations, and whose risks remain materially consistent with the potential risks at the time of the original or restructured investment. All new debt











	88

















	investments are initially ranked 2.













	•






	Investment Ranking 3 is used for debt investments that are performing below our expectations and for which risk has materially increased since the original or restructured investment. The portfolio company may be out of compliance with debt covenants and may require closer monitoring. To the extent that the underlying agreement has a PIK interest provision, debt investments with a ranking of 3 are generally those on which we are not accruing PIK interest.
















	•






	Investment Ranking 4 is used for debt investments that are performing substantially below our expectations and for which risk has increased substantially since the original or restructured investment. Debt investments with a ranking of 4 are those for which some loss of principal is expected and are generally those on which we are not accruing cash interest.







	The following table shows the distribution of our debt investments on the 1 to 4 investment ranking scale at fair value as of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	September 30, 2016

	Due to operating performance this ratio is not measurable and, as a result, is excluded from the total portfolio calculation.
















	(2)






	Beginning as of December 31, 2016, we have revised our investment ranking scale to include only debt investments. Accordingly, in order to make the table comparative, we revised the investment ranking table as of September 30, 2016 to exclude equity investments.







	We may from time to time modify the payment terms of our debt investments, either in response to current economic conditions and their impact on certain of our portfolio companies or in accordance with tier pricing provisions in certain loan agreements. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, we had modified the payment terms of our debt investments in 14 portfolio companies. Such modified terms may include increased PIK interest provisions and reduced cash interest rates. These modifications, and any future modifications to our loan agreements, may limit the amount of interest income that we recognize from the modified investments, which may, in turn, limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.




	Loans and Debt Securities on Non-Accrual Status




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	, there were


	11


	 investments on which we had stopped accruing cash and/or PIK interest or OID income. As of


	September 30, 2016


	, there were five investments on which we had stopped accruing cash and/or PIK interest or OID income. As of


	December 31, 2015


	, there were five investments on which we had stopped accruing cash and/or PIK interest or OID income.

	Senior Loan Fund JV I, LLC




	In May 2014, we entered into a limited liability company, or LLC, agreement with Kemper to form SLF JV I. On July 1, 2014, SLF JV I began investing in senior secured loans of middle market companies and other corporate debt securities. We co-invest in these securities with Kemper through our investment in SLF JV I. SLF JV I is managed by a four person board of directors, two of whom are selected by us and two of whom are selected by Kemper. SLF JV I is capitalized pro rata with LLC equity interests as transactions are completed and may be capitalized with additional Class A mezzanine senior secured deferrable floating rate notes and Class B mezzanine senior secured deferrable fixed rate notes, or, collectively, the mezzanine notes, issued to the Company and Kemper by SLF Repack Issuer 2016 LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of SLF JV I. The mezzanine notes mature on October 12, 2036. All portfolio decisions and investment decisions in respect of SLF JV I must be approved by the SLF JV I investment committee, which consists of one representative from us and one representative of Kemper (with approval from a representative of each required). As of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	September 30, 2016


	, we and Kemper owned, in the aggregate,


	87.5%


	 and


	12.5%


	, respectively, of the LLC equity interests. As of December 31, 2016 and September 30, 2016, we owned 87.5% of the outstanding mezzanine notes and subordinated notes, respectively, and Kemper owned 12.5% of the outstanding mezzanine notes and subordinated notes, respectively.








	90

















	SLF JV I has a $200.0 million senior revolving credit facility with Deutsche Bank AG, New York Branch, or the Deutsche Bank facility, with a maturity date of July 1, 2019. Borrowings under the Deutsche Bank facility bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.50% per annum.




	$100.0 million


	 was outstanding under this facility as of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	September 30, 2016


	.




	SLF JV I also has a $200.0 million credit facility with Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch, or the Credit Suisse facility, bringing SLF JV I’s total debt capacity to $400.0 million.  The Credit Suisse facility has a maturity date of July 7, 2023 and borrowings under the facility bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.50% per annum.


	$51.7 million


	 and $67.0 million was outstanding under this facility as of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	September 30, 2016


	, respectively.




	Borrowings under the Deutsche Bank facility and Credit Suisse facility are secured by all of the assets of the respective special purpose financing vehicles of SLF JV I.




	We have determined that SLF JV I is an investment company under ASC 946, however, in accordance with such guidance, we will generally not consolidate our investment in a company other than a wholly-owned investment company subsidiary or a controlled operating company whose business consists of providing services to us. Accordingly, we do not consolidate our noncontrolling interest in SLF JV I.




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	September 30, 2016


	, SLF JV I had total assets of


	$318.8 million


	 and


	$338.5 million


	, respectively. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, our investment in SLF JV I consisted of LLC equity interests of


	$13.9 million


	, at fair value, and Class A mezzanine secured deferrable floating rate notes and Class B mezzanine secured deferrable fixed rate notes of approximately


	$101.0 million


	 and


	$24.8 million


	, at fair value, respectively. As of


	September 30, 2016


	, our investment in SLF JV I consisted of LLC equity interests of


	$13.7 million


	 and subordinated notes of


	$129.0 million


	, at fair value. In connection with the restructuring of our and Kemper’s investment in SLF JV I, we and Kemper exchanged our holdings of subordinated notes of SLF JV I for the mezzanine notes issued by SLF Repack Issuer 2016 LLC, a newly formed, wholly owned special purpose issuer subsidiary of SLF JV I, which are secured by SLF JV I’s LLC equity interests in the special purpose entities serving as borrowers under the Deutsche Bank facility and Credit Suisse facility described below. The mezzanine notes are senior in right of payment to the SLF JV I LLC equity interests and any contributions we make to fund investments of SLF JV I through SLF Repack Issuer 2016 LLC. SLF JV I's portfolio consisted of middle market and other corporate debt securities of


	34


	 and


	37


	 "eligible portfolio companies" (as defined in the Section 2(a)(46) of the 1940 Act) as of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	September 30, 2016


	, respectively. The portfolio companies in SLF JV I are in industries similar to those in which we may invest directly.




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	September 30, 2016


	, we and Kemper had funded approximately


	$184.8 million


	 and $183.9 million, respectively, to SLF JV I, of which


	$161.7 million


	 and $160.9 million, respectively, was from us. As of


	September 30, 2016


	, we had commitments to fund subordinated notes to SLF JV I of $157.5 million, of which


	$12.0 million


	 was unfunded. As of December 31, 2016, we and Kemper had the option to fund additional mezzanine notes, subject to additional equity funding to SLF JV I. As of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	September 30, 2016


	, we had commitments to fund LLC equity interests in SLF JV I of


	$17.5 million


	, of which


	$1.3 million


	 and


	$1.4 million


	 was unfunded, respectively.

	SLF JV I has elected to fair value the debt securities issued to us and Kemper under ASC Topic 825 —


	Financial Instruments


	, or ASC 825. The debt securities are valued based on a recent transaction price.




	During the three months ended




	December 31, 2016


	, we did not sell any senior secured debt investments to SLF JV I.


	During the three months ended


	 


	December 31, 2015


	, we sold


	$9.4 million


	 of senior secured debt investments to SLF JV I at fair value in exchange for


	$9.4 million


	 cash consideration. We recognized a


	$0.1 million


	 realized loss on these transactions.




	Discussion and Analysis of Results and Operations




	Results of Operations




	The principal measure of our financial performance is the net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations, which includes net investment income (loss), net realized gain (loss) and net unrealized appreciation (depreciation). Net investment income is the difference between our income from interest, dividends, fees, and other investment income and total expenses. Net realized gain (loss) on investments and secured borrowings is the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio investments and secured borrowings and their stated costs. Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) is the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio and secured borrowings during the reporting period, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation (depreciation) when gains or losses are realized.




	Comparison of three months ended


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	December 31, 2015






	Total Investment Income




	Total investment income includes interest on our investments, fee income and other investment income. Fee income consists of the monthly servicing fees, advisory fees, structuring fees, exit fees and prepayment fees that we receive in connection with our debt investments. These fees are recognized as earned. Other investment income consists primarily of dividend income received from certain of our equity investments.




	Total investment income


	for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015


	 was


	$51.8 million


	 and


	$65.1 million


	, respectively. For


	the three months ended


	December 31, 2016


	, this amount primarily consisted of


	$46.7 million


	 of interest income from portfolio investments (which included


	$2.8 million


	 of PIK interest) and


	$3.6 million


	 of fee income. For


	the three months ended


	December 31, 2015


	, this amount primarily consisted of


	$54.5 million


	 of interest income from portfolio investments (which included


	$3.3 million


	 of PIK interest) and


	$8.8 million


	 of fee income.




	Total investment income for


	the three months ended


	December 31, 2016


	, as compared to


	the three months ended


	December 31, 2015


	, decreased primarily due to lower interest income from a decrease in the size of our investment portfolio and additional investments on which we stopped accruing cash and/or PIK interest or OID income.








	96

















	Expenses




	Net expenses (expenses net of base management fee waivers and insurance recoveries) for


	the three months ended


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	December 31, 2015


	 were


	$28.5 million


	 and


	$38.5 million


	, respectively. Net expenses decreased for


	the three months ended




	December 31, 2016


	, as compared to


	the three months ended


	December 31, 2015


	, by


	$10.1 million


	, or


	26.1%


	, due primarily to a $6.5 million decrease in professional fees (net of insurance recoveries) and a


	$3.1 million


	 decrease in base management fees (net of waivers), which was attributable to a reduction in the size of our portfolio as well as the permanent fee reduction that we agreed to with our Investment Adviser effective January 1, 2016.




	Net Investment Income




	As a result of the


	$13.4 million




	decrease in total investment income and the


	$10.1 million


	 decrease in net expenses, net investment income for


	the three months ended


	December 31, 2016


	 decreased by




	$3.3 million


	, or


	12.4%


	, compared to


	the three months ended


	December 31, 2015


	.




	Realized Gain (Loss) on Investments and Secured Borrowings




	Realized gain (loss) is the difference between the net proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio investments and secured borrowings and their stated costs. Realized losses may also be recorded in connection with our determination that certain investments are considered worthless securities and/or meet the conditions for loss recognition per the applicable tax rules.




	See Note 9 in the consolidated financial statements for more details regarding investment realization events for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.




	Net Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Investments and Secured Borrowings









	Net unrealized appreciation or depreciation is the net change in the fair value of our investments and secured borrowings during the reporting period, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation when gains or losses are realized.




	See Note 9 in the consolidated financial statements for more details regarding unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments and secured borrowings for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.









	Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources




	Cash Flows




	We have a number of alternatives available to fund our investment portfolio and our operations, including raising equity, increasing debt and funding from operational cash flow. Additionally, to generate liquidity we may reduce investment size by syndicating a portion of any given transaction. We intend to fund our future distribution obligations through operating cash flow or with funds obtained through future equity and debt offerings or credit facilities, as we deem appropriate.




	For the three months ended


	December 31, 2016


	, we experienced a net


	increase


	 in cash and cash equivalents of


	$61.9 million


	. During that period, we received


	$179.1 million


	 of net cash from operating activities, primarily from


	$225.5 million


	 of principal payments, PIK payments and sale proceeds received and the cash activities related to


	$23.3 million


	 of net investment income, partially offset by funding


	$104.2 million


	 of investments and net revolvers. During the same period, net cash


	used


	 by financing activities was


	$117.2 million


	, primarily consisting of


	$74.9 million


	 of net


	repayments


	 under our credit facilities,


	$24.0 million


	 of cash distributions paid to our stockholders,


	$12.5 million


	 of repurchases of common stock under stock repurchase program,


	$4.5 million


	 of repayments of secured borrowings and


	$1.3 million


	 of repurchases of common stock under our DRIP.




	For the three months ended


	December 31, 2015


	, we experienced a net


	decrease


	 in cash and cash equivalents of


	$55.8 million


	. During that period, we received


	$15.1 million


	 of net cash from operating activities, primarily from $343.4 million of principal




	payments, PIK payments and sale proceeds received and the cash activities related to $26.6 million of net investment income, partially




	offset by funding $351.9 million of investments and net revolvers. During the same period, net cash


	used


	 by financing activities was


	$70.9 million


	, primarily consisting of $42.0 million of net borrowings under our credit facilities, $25.2 million of cash distributions




	paid to our stockholders, $1.8 million of repayments of secured borrowings and $1.8 million of repurchases of common stock under our




	DRIP.




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	, we had


	$181.0 million


	 in cash and cash equivalents (including


	$1.1 million


	 of restricted cash), portfolio investments (at fair value) of


	$2.0 billion


	,


	$12.3 million


	 of interest, dividends and fees receivable, $19.5 million of payables from unsettled transactions,


	$210.2 million


	 of SBA debentures payable (net of unamortized financing costs),


	$441.4 million


	 of








	97

















	borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities,


	$405.0 million


	 of unsecured notes payable (net of unamortized financing costs),


	$14.0 million


	 of secured borrowings and unfunded commitments of


	$157.0 million


	. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, included in restricted cash was $1.1 million that was held at U.S. Bank, National Association in connection with our Sumitomo Facility.




	As of


	September 30, 2016


	, we had $130.4 million in cash and cash equivalents (including


	$12.4 million


	 of restricted cash), portfolio investments (at fair value) of


	$2.2 billion


	,


	$15.6 million


	 of interest, dividends and fees receivable,


	$210.0 million


	 of SBA debentures payable (net of unamortized financing costs),


	$516.3 million


	 of borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities,


	$404.6 million


	 of unsecured notes payable (net of unamortized financing costs),


	$18.4 million


	 of secured borrowings and unfunded commitments of $215.7 million. As of September 30, 2016, included in restricted cash was $12.4 million that was held at U.S. Bank, National Association in connection with our Sumitomo Facility.




	Other Sources of Liquidity




	We intend to continue to generate cash primarily from cash flows from operations, including interest earned, future borrowings and future offerings of securities. We may from time to time issue securities pursuant to a shelf registration statement or otherwise pursuant to private offerings. The issuance of debt or equity securities will depend on future market conditions, funding needs and other factors and there can be no assurance that any such issuance will occur or be successful. In the future, we may also securitize a portion of our investments. To securitize investments, we would likely create a wholly-owned subsidiary and contribute a pool of loans to the subsidiary. We would then sell interests in the subsidiary on a non-recourse basis to purchasers and we would retain all or a portion of the equity in the subsidiary. Our primary uses of funds are investments in our targeted asset classes and cash distributions to holders of our common stock.




	Although we expect to fund the growth of our investment portfolio through the net proceeds from future equity offerings and issuances of senior securities or future borrowings to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act, our plans to raise capital may not be successful. In this regard, because our common stock has at times traded at a price below our then-current net asset value per share (which has primarily been the case for several years) and we are limited in our ability to sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share, we may be limited in our ability to raise equity capital.




	In addition, we intend to distribute at least 90% of our taxable income as dividends to our stockholders each taxable year in connection with satisfying the requirements applicable to entities subject to tax as RICs under Subchapter M of the Code. See "Regulated Investment Company Status and Distributions" below. Consequently, we may not have the funds or the ability to fund new investments, to make additional investments in our portfolio companies, to fund our unfunded commitments to portfolio companies or to repay borrowings. In addition, the illiquidity of our portfolio investments may make it difficult for us to sell these investments when desired and, if we are required to sell these investments, we may realize significantly less than their recorded value.




	As a business development company, under the 1940 Act, we generally are not permitted to incur indebtedness unless immediately after such borrowing we have an asset coverage for total borrowings of at least 200% (i.e., the amount of debt may not exceed 50% of the value of our assets). This requirement limits the amount that we may borrow. We received exemptive relief from the SEC to permit us to exclude the debt of our SBIC subsidiaries guaranteed by the U.S. Small Business Administration, or SBA, from the definition of senior securities in the 200% asset coverage ratio we are required to maintain under the 1940 Act. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, we were in compliance with this asset coverage requirement, as modified by our exemptive relief. The amount of leverage that we employ will depend on our assessment of market conditions and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing, such as the maturity, covenant package and rate structure of the proposed borrowings, our ability to raise funds through the issuance of shares of our common stock and the risks of such borrowings within the context of our investment outlook. Ultimately, we only intend to use leverage if the expected returns from borrowing to make investments will exceed the cost of such borrowing. To fund growth in our investment portfolio in the future, we anticipate needing to raise additional capital from various sources, including the equity markets and the securitization or other debt-related markets, which may or may not be available on favorable terms, if at all.




	We may from time to time be required to refinance previously issued debt securities upon their maturities. For example, we repaid in full our unsecured convertible notes on their maturity date of April 1, 2016. In order to fund this repayment, we utilized cash on hand and borrowings under our ING revolving credit facility.

	Shares were purchased on the open market and distributed.












	On November 30, 2015, our Board of Directors approved a common stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to $100 million in the aggregate of the outstanding shares of our common stock through November 30, 2016. During the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock under this common stock repurchase program.




	On November 28, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a new common stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to $12.5 million in the aggregate of our outstanding common stock through November 28, 2017. Common stock repurchases under the program were made in the open market. During the three months ended


	December 31, 2016


	, we repurchased 2,298,247 shares of our common stock for $12.5 million, including commissions, under the new common stock repurchase program. As of December 31, 2016, there is no availability under the new common stock repurchase program to repurchase additional common stock.

	SBIC Subsidiaries




	On February 3, 2010, our consolidated, wholly-owned subsidiary, Fifth Street Mezzanine Partners IV, L.P., or FSMP IV, received a license, effective February 1, 2010, from the SBA to operate as a SBIC under Section 301(c) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended. On May 15, 2012, our consolidated, wholly-owned subsidiary, Fifth Street Mezzanine Partners V, L.P., or FSMP V, received a license, effective May 10, 2012, from the SBA to operate as an SBIC. SBICs are designed to stimulate the flow of private equity capital to eligible small businesses. Under SBA regulations, SBICs may make loans to eligible small businesses and invest in the equity securities of small businesses.




	 




	The SBIC licenses allow the SBIC subsidiaries to obtain leverage by issuing SBA-guaranteed debentures, subject to the satisfaction of certain customary procedures. SBA-guaranteed debentures are non-recourse, interest only debentures with interest payable semi-annually and have a 10-year maturity. The principal amount of SBA-guaranteed debentures is not required to be paid prior to maturity but may be prepaid at any time without penalty. The interest rate of SBA-guaranteed debentures is fixed at the time of issuance at a market-driven spread over U.S. Treasury Notes with 10-year maturities.








	99

















	SBA regulations currently limit the amount of SBA-guaranteed debentures that an SBIC may issue to $150 million when it has at least $75 million in regulatory capital. Affiliated SBICs are permitted to issue up to a combined maximum amount of $350 million of debentures when they have at least $175 million in regulatory capital.




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	 and September 30, 2016, FSMP IV had $75.0 million in regulatory capital and $138.3 million in SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding, which had a carrying value of $136.7 million and $136.6 million, respectively. As of


	December 31, 2016


	 and September 30, 2016, the fair value of these debentures was


	$130.9 million


	 and $131.0 million, respectively. These debentures bore interest at a weighted average interest rate of 3.625% (excluding the SBA annual charge), as follows:

	December 31, 2016


	 and September 30, 2016, the fair value of these debentures was


	$66.8 million

	As of


	December 31, 2016


	, the $213.3 million of SBA-guaranteed debentures held by the SBIC Subsidiaries carry a weighted average interest rate of 3.348% (excluding the SBA annual charge).




	For the three months ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we recorded aggregate interest expense of


	$2.2 million


	 and


	$2.3 million


	, respectively, related to the SBA-guaranteed debentures of the SBIC subsidiaries.




	The SBA restricts the ability of SBICs to repurchase their capital stock. SBA regulations also include restrictions on a "change of control" or transfer of an SBIC and require that SBICs invest idle funds in accordance with SBA regulations. In addition, the SBIC Subsidiaries may also be limited in their ability to make distributions to us if they do not have sufficient capital, in accordance with SBA regulations.




	The SBIC subsidiaries are subject to regulation and oversight by the SBA, including requirements with respect to maintaining certain minimum financial ratios and other covenants. Receipt of an SBIC license does not assure that our SBIC subsidiaries will receive SBA-guaranteed debenture funding and is further dependent upon our SBIC subsidiaries continuing to be in compliance with SBA regulations and policies.




	The SBA, as a creditor, will have a superior claim to our SBIC subsidiaries' assets over our stockholders in the event we liquidate our SBIC subsidiaries or the SBA exercises its remedies under the SBA-guaranteed debentures issued by the SBIC subsidiaries upon an event of default.




	We have received exemptive relief from the SEC to permit us to exclude the debt of our SBIC subsidiaries guaranteed by the SBA from the definition of senior securities in the 200% asset coverage test under the 1940 Act. This allows us increased flexibility under the 200% asset coverage test by permitting us, as of September 30, 2016, to borrow up to $213.3 million more than we would otherwise be able to under the 1940 Act absent the receipt of this exemptive relief.




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	, except for assets that were funded through our SBIC subsidiaries and our investment in SLF JV I, substantially all of our assets were pledged as collateral under the ING facility or the Sumitomo facility (each as defined below).




	We and our SBIC subsidiaries are also subject to certain regulatory requirements relating to our borrowings. For a discussion of such requirements, see "Item 1. Business — Regulation — Business Development Company Regulations" and "— Small Business Investment Company Regulations" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016.

	ING Facility




	On May 27, 2010, we entered into a secured syndicated revolving credit facility, or as subsequently amended, the ING facility, pursuant to a Senior Secured Revolving Credit Agreement, or ING Credit Agreement, with certain lenders party thereto from time to time and ING Capital LLC, as administrative agent. The ING facility provides that we may use the proceeds and letters of credit under the facility for general corporate purposes, including acquiring and funding leveraged loans, mezzanine loans, high-yield securities, convertible securities, preferred stock, common stock and other investments. The ING facility allows us to request letters of credit from ING Capital LLC, as the issuing bank.




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	, the ING facility permitted up to $710 million of borrowings with an accordion feature allowing for future expansion of the facility up to a total of $800 million, and borrowings under the facility bore interest at a rate equal to LIBOR (1-, 2-, 3- or 6-month, at our option) plus 2.25% per annum, with no LIBOR floor, assuming we maintain our current credit rating. Unless extended, the period during which we may make and reinvest borrowings under the facility will expire on August 6, 2017, and the maturity date of the facility is August 6, 2018.




	The ING facility is secured by substantially all of our assets, as well as the assets of our wholly-owned subsidiary, FSFC Holdings, Inc., or Holdings, and our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Fifth Street Fund of Funds LLC, or Fund of Funds, subject to certain exclusions for, among other things, equity interests in our SBIC subsidiaries and equity interests in Funding II (as defined below) as set forth in a Guarantee, Pledge and Security Agreement, or the ING Security Agreement, entered into in connection with the ING Credit Agreement, among Holdings, ING Capital LLC, as collateral agent, and us. Fund of Funds and Holdings were formed to hold certain of our portfolio companies for tax purposes and have no other operations.




	Pursuant to the ING Security Agreement, Holdings and Fund of Funds guaranteed the obligations under the ING Security Agreement, including our obligations to the lenders and the administrative agent under the ING Credit Agreement. Additionally, we pledged our entire equity interest in Holdings and Holdings pledged its entire equity interest in Fund of Funds to the collateral agent pursuant to the terms of the ING Security Agreement. None of our SBIC subsidiaries, Fifth Street Funding, LLC or Funding II, is party to the ING facility and their respective assets have not been pledged in connection therewith.




	The ING Credit Agreement and related agreements governing the ING facility required Holdings, Fund of Funds and us to, among other things, (i) make representations and warranties regarding the collateral as well as each of our portfolio companies' businesses, (ii) agree to certain indemnification obligations, and (iii) agree to comply with various affirmative and negative covenants and other customary requirements for similar credit facilities. The ING facility documents also include usual and customary default provisions such as the failure to make timely payments under the facility, the occurrence of a change in control, and the failure by us to materially perform under the ING Credit Agreement and related agreements governing the facility, which, if not complied with, could accelerate repayment under the facility. Any such non-compliance could materially and adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under the ING facility.




	Each loan or letter of credit originated under the ING facility is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. We cannot be assured that we will be able to borrow funds under the ING facility at any particular time or at all.




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	, we had


	$402.5 million


	 of borrowings outstanding under the ING facility, which had a fair value of


	$402.5 million


	. Our borrowings under the ING facility bore interest at a weighted average interest rate of


	2.945%


	 for


	the three months ended


	December 31, 2016


	.


	For the three months ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015


	, we recorded interest expense of


	$4.2 million


	 and


	$3.3 million


	, respectively, related to the ING facility.




	Sumitomo Facility




	On September 16, 2011, Fifth Street Funding II, LLC, a consolidated wholly-owned bankruptcy remote, special purpose subsidiary, or Funding II, entered into a Loan and Servicing Agreement, or, as subsequently amended, the Sumitomo Agreement, with respect to a credit facility, or the Sumitomo facility, with Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, or SMBC, an affiliate of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Inc., as administrative agent, and each of the lenders from time to time party thereto.




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	, the Sumitomo facility permitted up to $125 million of borrowings (subject to collateral requirements), and borrowings under the facility bore interest at a rate of either (i) LIBOR (1-month) plus 2.00% per annum, with no LIBOR floor, if the borrowings under the Sumitomo facility are greater than 35% of the aggregate available borrowings under the Sumitomo facility or (ii) LIBOR (1-month) plus 2.25% per annum, if the borrowings under the Sumitomo Facility are less than or equal to 35% of the aggregate available borrowings under the Sumitomo facility. Unless extended, the period during which we may make and reinvest borrowings under the facility will expire on September 16, 2017, and the maturity date of the facility is September 16, 2021. As of








	101

















	December 31, 2016, the total availability under the Sumitomo facility was approximately $39.0 million, of which we had $0.1 million of remaining availability.




	In connection with the Sumitomo facility, we entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with Funding II, pursuant to which we will sell to Funding II certain loan assets we have originated or acquired, or will originate or acquire.




	The Sumitomo Agreement and related agreements governing the Sumitomo facility required both Funding II and us to, among other things, (i) make representations and warranties regarding the collateral as well as each of our businesses, (ii) agree to certain indemnification obligations, and (iii) comply with various covenants, servicing procedures, limitations on acquiring and disposing of assets, reporting requirements and other customary requirements for similar credit facilities, including a prepayment penalty in certain cases. The Sumitomo facility agreements also include usual and customary default provisions such as the failure to make timely payments under the facility, a change in control of Funding II, and the failure by Funding II or us to materially perform under the Sumitomo Agreement and related agreements governing the Sumitomo facility, which, if not complied with, could accelerate repayment under the facility. Any such non-compliance could materially and adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. Funding II was formed for the sole purpose of entering into the Sumitomo facility and has no other operations. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under the Sumitomo facility.




	The Sumitomo facility is secured by all of the assets of Funding II. Each loan origination under the Sumitomo facility is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. We cannot be assured that Funding II will be able to borrow funds under the Sumitomo facility at any particular time or at all.




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	, we had


	$38.9 million


	 of borrowings outstanding under the Sumitomo facility, which had a fair value of


	$38.9 million


	. Our borrowings under the Sumitomo facility bore interest at a weighted average interest rate of


	2.784%


	 for


	the three months ended


	December 31, 2016


	.


	For the three months ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015


	, we recorded interest expense of


	$0.6 million


	 and


	$0.4 million


	, respectively, related to the Sumitomo facility.




	The Sumitomo facility does not require us to comply with significant financial covenants. The following table describes significant financial covenants with which we must comply under the ING facility on a quarterly basis:

	(1) As contractually required, we report financial covenants based on the last filed quarterly or annual report, in this case our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. We were also in compliance with all financial covenants under these credit facilities based on the financial information contained in this Quarterly Report Form 10-Q for the three months ended


	December 31, 2016


	.




	Convertible Notes




	On April 12, 2011, we issued $152 million of convertible notes, or the Convertible Notes, including $2 million issued to Leonard M. Tannenbaum, our former Chief Executive Officer. The Convertible Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated April 12, 2011 or, the Indenture, between us and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee, or the Trustee.




	The Convertible Notes matured on April 1, 2016, or the Maturity Date and we repaid in full the $115.0 million of outstanding Convertible Notes on the Maturity Date using cash on hand and borrowings under the ING facility.




	The Convertible Notes bore interest at a rate of 5.375% per annum payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The Convertible Notes were our unsecured obligations and ranked senior in right of payment to our indebtedness that was expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Convertible Notes; equal in right of payment to our unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness (including trade payables) incurred by our subsidiaries or financing vehicles.




	On or after January 1, 2016 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the Maturity Date, holders could have converted their Convertible Notes at any time. Upon conversion, we would have been obligated to deliver shares of our common stock based on a conversion rate that was subject to periodic adjustment.




	We could not redeem the Convertible Notes prior to maturity. No sinking fund was provided for the Convertible Notes. In addition, if certain corporate events occurred in respect to us, holders of the Convertible Notes could have required us to repurchase for








	102

















	cash all or part of their Convertible Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest through, but excluding, the required repurchase date.




	For the three months ended December 31, 2015, we recorded interest expense of


	$1.7 million


	 related to the Convertible Notes.




	2019 Notes




	On February 26, 2014, we issued $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 4.875% 2019 Notes for net proceeds of $244.4 million after deducting original issue discount of $1.4 million, underwriting commissions and discounts of $3.7 million and offering costs of $0.5 million. The original issue discount on these notes is amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the notes.




	The 2019 Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated April 30, 2012, as supplemented by the supplemental indenture, dated February 26, 2014, or collectively, the 2019 Notes Indenture, between us and the Trustee. The 2019 Notes are our general unsecured obligations that rank senior in right of payment to all of our existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2019 Notes. The 2019 Notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future liabilities that are not so subordinated. The 2019 Notes effectively rank junior to any of our secured indebtedness (including unsecured indebtedness that we later secure) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The 2019 Notes rank structurally junior to all existing and future indebtedness (including trade payables) incurred by our subsidiaries, financing vehicles or similar facilities. 




	Interest on the 2019 Notes is paid semi-annually on March 1 and September 1, at a rate of 4.875% per annum. The 2019 Notes mature on March 1, 2019 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at our option prior to maturity.




	The 2019 Notes Indenture contains certain covenants, including covenants requiring our compliance with (regardless of whether we are subject to) the restrictions on dividends, distributions and purchase of capital stock set forth in Section 18(a)(1)(B) as modified by Section 61(a)(1) of the 1940 Act, as well as covenants requiring us to provide financial information to the holders of the 2019 Notes and the Trustee if we cease to be subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. These covenants are subject to limitations and exceptions that are described in the 2019 Notes Indenture. We may repurchase the 2019 Notes in accordance with the 1940 Act and the rules promulgated thereunder. In addition, holders of the 2019 Notes can require us to repurchase the 2019 Notes at 100% of their principal amount upon the occurrence of certain change of control events as described in the 2019 Notes Indenture. The 2019 Notes were issued in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.


	During the three months ended




	December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015


	, we did not repurchase any of the 2019 Notes in the open market.




	For each of the three months ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we recorded interest expense of


	$3.3 million


	 related to the 2019 Notes.




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	, there were


	$250.0 million


	 of 2019 Notes outstanding, which had a fair value of $


	255.9 million


	.




	2024 Notes




	On October 18, 2012, we issued $75.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 5.875% 2024 Notes for net proceeds of $72.5 million after deducting underwriting commissions of $2.2 million and offering costs of $0.3 million.




	The 2024 Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated April 30, 2012, as supplemented by the first supplemental indenture, dated October 18, 2012, or collectively, the 2024 Notes Indenture, between us and the Trustee. The 2024 Notes are our unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to our existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2024 Notes; equal in right of payment to our existing and future unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness (including existing unsecured indebtedness that we later secure) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all existing and future indebtedness (including trade payables) incurred by our subsidiaries or financing vehicles.




	Interest on the 2024 Notes is paid quarterly in arrears on January 30, April 30, July 30 and October 30 at a rate of 5.875% per annum. The 2024 Notes mature on October 30, 2024 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at our option on or after October 30, 2017. The 2024 Notes are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol "FSCE" with a par value of $25.00 per note.




	The 2024 Notes Indenture contains certain covenants, including covenants requiring our compliance with (regardless of whether we are subject to) the asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 18(a)(1)(A) as modified by Section 61(a)(1) of the 1940 Act and with the restrictions on dividends, distributions and purchase of capital stock set forth in Section 18(a)(1)(B) as modified by Section 61(a)(1) of the 1940 Act, as well as covenants requiring us to provide financial information to the holders of the 2024 Notes and the Trustee if we cease to be subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. These covenants are subject to limitations and exceptions that are described in the 2024 Notes Indenture. We may repurchase the 2024 Notes in accordance with the 1940 Act and the








	103

















	rules promulgated thereunder. Any 2024 Notes repurchased by us may, at our option, be surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation, but may not be reissued or resold by us. Any 2024 Notes surrendered for cancellation will be promptly canceled and no longer outstanding under the 2024 Notes Indenture.


	During the three months ended




	December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015


	, we did not repurchase any of the 2024 Notes in the open market.




	For each of the three months ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we recorded interest expense of


	$1.2 million


	 related to the 2024 Notes.




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	, there were


	$75.0 million


	 of 2024 Notes outstanding, which had a fair value of


	$74.6 million


	.




	2028 Notes




	In April and May 2013, we issued $86.3 million in aggregate principal amount of our 6.125% 2028 Notes for net proceeds of $83.4 million after deducting underwriting commissions of $2.6 million and offering costs of $0.3 million.




	The 2028 Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated April 30, 2012, as supplemented by the second supplemental indenture, dated April 4, 2013, or collectively, the 2028 Notes Indenture, between us and the Trustee. The 2028 Notes are our unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to our existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2028 Notes; equal in right of payment to our existing and future unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness (including existing unsecured indebtedness that we later secure) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all existing and future indebtedness (including trade payables) incurred by our subsidiaries or financing vehicles.




	Interest on the 2028 Notes is paid quarterly in arrears on January 30, April 30, July 30 and October 30 at a rate of 6.125% per annum. The 2028 Notes mature on April 30, 2028 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at our option on or after April 30, 2018. The 2028 Notes are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the trading symbol "FSCFL" with a par value of $25.00 per note.




	The 2028 Notes Indenture contains certain covenants, including covenants requiring our compliance with (regardless of whether we are subject to) the asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 18(a)(1)(A) as modified by Section 61(a)(1) of the 1940 Act, as well as covenants requiring us to provide financial information to the holders of the 2028 Notes and the Trustee if we cease to be subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. These covenants are subject to limitations and exceptions that are described in the 2028 Notes Indenture. We may repurchase the 2028 Notes in accordance with the 1940 Act and the rules promulgated thereunder. Any 2028 Notes repurchased by us may, at our option, be surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation, but may not be reissued or resold by us. Any 2028 Notes surrendered for cancellation will be promptly canceled and no longer outstanding under the 2028 Notes Indenture.


	During the three months ended




	December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015


	, we did not repurchase any of the 2028 Notes in the open market.




	For each of the three months ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we recorded interest expense of


	$1.4 million


	 related to the 2028 Notes.




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	, there were


	$86.3 million


	 2028 Notes outstanding, which had a fair value of


	$85.0 million


	.




	Secured Borrowings




	We follow the guidance in ASC Topic 860,


	Transfers and Servicing


	when accounting for loan participations and other partial loan sales. Such guidance requires a participation or other partial loan sale to meet the definition of a "participating interest," as defined in the guidance, in order for sale treatment to be allowed. Participations or other partial loan sales which do not meet the definition of a participating interest remain on our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities and the proceeds are recorded as a secured borrowing until the definition is met. Secured borrowings are carried at fair value to correspond with the related investments, which are carried at fair value.




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	, secured borrowings at fair value totaled


	$14.0 million


	 and the fair value of the loan that is associated with these secured borrowings was


	$46.8 million


	. These secured borrowings were the result of the completion of partial loan sales totaling $22.8 million of a senior secured debt investment during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 that did not meet the definition of a participating interest. As a result, sale treatment was not allowed and these partial loan sales were treated as secured borrowings.


	During the three months ended




	December 31, 2016


	 and


	December 31, 2015


	, there were


	$4.5 million


	 and


	$1.8 million


	 of repayments on secured borrowings, respectively.




	For each of the three months ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we recorded interest expense of


	$0.4 million


	, related to the secured borrowings.








	104

















	As of


	December 31, 2016


	, there were


	$14.4 million


	 of secured borrowings outstanding, which had a fair value of


	$14.0 million


	.




	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements




	We may be a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, our only off-balance sheet arrangements consisted of


	$157.0 million


	 of unfunded commitments, which was comprised of


	$143.1 million


	 to provide debt financing to certain of our portfolio companies,


	$1.3 million


	 to provide equity financing to SLF JV I and


	$12.5 million


	 related to unfunded limited partnership interests. As of


	September 30, 2016


	, our only off-balance sheet arrangements consisted of $


	215.7 million


	 of unfunded commitments, which was comprised of $191.7 million to provide debt financing to certain of our portfolio companies, $14.1 million to provide debt and equity financing to SLF JV I and $9.9 million related to unfunded limited partnership interests. Such commitments are subject to our portfolio companies' satisfaction of certain financial and nonfinancial covenants and involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities and are not reflected on our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. We believe that our assets will provide adequate cover to satisfy all of our unfunded commitments as of


	December 31, 2016


	.




	A summary of the composition of unfunded commitments (consisting of revolvers, term loans with delayed draw components, SLF JV I subordinated notes and LLC interests, and limited partnership interests) as of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	September 30, 2016

	Regulated Investment Company Status and Distributions




	We elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As long as we continue to qualify as a RIC, we will not be subject to tax on our investment company taxable income or realized net capital gains, to the extent that such taxable income or gains is distributed, or deemed to be distributed as dividends, to stockholders on a timely basis.




	Taxable income generally differs from net income for financial reporting purposes due to temporary and permanent differences in the recognition of income and expenses, and generally excludes net unrealized appreciation or depreciation until realized. Distributions declared and paid by us in a taxable year may differ from taxable income for that taxable year as such distributions may include the distribution of taxable income derived from the current taxable year or the distribution of taxable income derived from the prior taxable year carried forward into and distributed in the current taxable year. Distributions also may include returns of capital.




	To maintain RIC tax treatment, we must, among other things, distribute dividends, with respect to each taxable year, of an amount at least equal to 90% of our investment company taxable income (i.e., our net ordinary income and our realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any), determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid. As a RIC, we are also subject to a federal excise tax, based on distribution requirements of our taxable income on a calendar year basis. We anticipate timely distribution of our taxable income in accordance with tax rules. We did not incur a U.S. federal excise tax for calendar years 2014 and 2015 and do not expect to incur a U.S. federal excise tax for the calendar year 2016. We may incur a federal excise tax in future years.




	We intend to distribute to our stockholders between 90% and 100% of our annual taxable income (which includes our taxable interest and fee income). However, we are partially dependent on our SBIC subsidiaries for cash distributions to enable us to meet the RIC distribution requirements. Our SBIC subsidiaries may be limited by the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended, and SBA regulations governing SBICs, from making certain distributions to us that may be necessary to enable us to maintain our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC. We may have to request a waiver of the SBA's restrictions for our SBIC subsidiaries to make certain distributions to maintain our RIC status. We cannot assure you that the SBA will grant such waiver. Also, the covenants under the Sumitomo facility could, under certain circumstances, restrict Funding and Funding II from making distributions to us and, as a result, hinder our ability to satisfy the distribution requirement associated with our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC. Similarly, the covenants contained in the ING facility may prohibit us from making distributions to our stockholders, and, as a result, could hinder our ability to satisfy the distribution requirement associated with our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC. In addition, we may retain for investment some or all of our net capital gains (i.e., realized net long-term capital gains in excess of realized net short-term capital losses) and treat such amounts as deemed distributions to our stockholders. If we do this, our stockholders will be treated as if they received actual distributions of the capital gains we retained and then reinvested the net after-tax proceeds in our common stock. Our stockholders also may be eligible to claim tax credits (or, in certain circumstances, tax refunds) equal to their allocable share of the tax








	107

















	we paid on the capital gains deemed distributed to them. To the extent our taxable earnings for a fiscal and taxable year fall below the total amount of our dividend distributions for that fiscal and taxable year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to our stockholders.




	We may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time. In addition, we may be limited in our ability to make distributions due to the asset coverage test for borrowings applicable to us as a business development company under the 1940 Act and due to provisions in our credit facilities and debt instruments. If we do not distribute a certain percentage of our taxable income annually, we will suffer adverse tax consequences, including possible loss of our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC. We cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions or distributions at a particular level.




	A RIC may treat a distribution of its own stock as fulfilling its RIC distribution requirements if each stockholder may elect to receive his or her entire distribution in either cash or stock of the RIC, subject to certain limitations regarding the aggregate amount of cash to be distributed to all stockholders. If these and certain other requirements are met, for U.S federal income tax purposes, the amount of the dividend paid in stock will be equal to the amount of cash that could have been received instead of stock. We have no current intention of paying dividends in shares of our stock in accordance with these guidelines.




	We may generate qualified interest income that may be exempt from United States withholding tax on foreign accounts. A regulated RIC is permitted to designate distributions of qualified interest income and short-term capital gains as exempt from U.S. withholding tax when paid to non-U.S. shareholders with proper documentation. The following table, which may be subject to change as we finalize our annual tax filings, lists the percentage of qualified interest income and qualified short-term capital gains for the three months ended December 31, 2016.

	Related Party Transactions




	We have entered into an investment advisory agreement with our Investment Adviser. Messrs. Berman, Dalton and Sandeep K. Khorana, each an interested member of our Board of Directors, have a direct or indirect pecuniary interest in our Investment Adviser. The Investment Adviser is a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, that is partially and indirectly owned by FSAM. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, fees payable to our Investment Adviser pursuant to the investment advisory agreement equaled (a) a base management fee of 1.75% of the value of our gross assets, which includes any borrowings for investment purposes and excludes cash and cash equivalents, and (b) an incentive fee based on our performance. The base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears and the fee for any partial month or quarter is appropriately prorated. The incentive fee consists of two parts. The first part is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears and equals 20% of our "Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income" for the immediately preceding quarter, subject to a preferred return, or "hurdle," and a "catch up" feature. The “catch-up” provision is intended to provide our investment adviser with an incentive fee of 20% on all of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income as if a hurdle rate did not apply when our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income exceeds 2.5% in any fiscal quarter. There is no accumulation of amounts on the hurdle rate from quarter to quarter and accordingly there is no clawback of amounts previously paid if subsequent quarters are below the quarterly hurdle. The second part is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each fiscal year (or upon termination of the investment advisory agreement) and equals 20% of our realized capital gains on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of the year, if any, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fee. The investment advisory agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon no fewer than 60 days' written notice to the other.


	During the three months ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015


	, we incurred fees of $13.1 million and $15.3 million, respectively, under the investment advisory agreement. While under no obligation to do so,


	for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015


	, the Investment Adviser voluntarily and irrevocably waived a portion of the base management fee relating to partial loan sales that did not qualify for true sale accounting, which resulted in a waiver of $0.1 million for each period.




	Prior to December 31, 2015, the base management fee was calculated at an annual rate of 2% of our gross assets, which includes any borrowings for investment purposes but excludes any cash and cash equivalents held at the end of each quarter.




	On January 20, 2016, we announced that our Investment Adviser had agreed to an amendment to the investment advisory agreement to permanently reduce the base management fee. Beginning January 1, 2016, the base management fee on gross assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents) was reduced from 2% to 1.75%. The other commercial terms of our investment advisory arrangement with our Investment Adviser remained unchanged.








	108

















	On July 14, 2015, we announced that our Investment Adviser voluntarily agreed to a revised base management fee arrangement, or the Revised Management Fee, for the period commencing on July 1, 2015 and remaining in effect until January 1, 2017, or the Waiver Period. The Revised Management Fee was intended to provide for a reduction in the base management fee payable by us to our Investment Adviser during the Waiver Period in connection with the issuance or sale of shares of our common stock, including new shares issued as dividends or pursuant to our dividend reinvestment plan, but excluding certain non-ordinary course transactions.  Neither the prior waiver of base management fees nor the Revised Management Fee in any way implies that our Investment Adviser will agree to waive management or incentive fees in any future period. The Revised Management Fee did not result in any recalculations of the base management fee prior to the expiration of the Waiver Period.




	Pursuant to the administration agreement with FSC CT, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of our investment adviser, FSC CT furnishes us with the facilities, including our principal executive offices, and administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations, including equipment, clerical, bookkeeping and recordkeeping services at such facilities. In addition, FSC CT will assist us in connection with the determination and publishing of our net asset value, the preparation and filing of tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports to our stockholders. We pay FSC CT its allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by FSC CT in performing its obligations under the administration agreement, including a portion of the rent at market rates and the compensation of our chief financial officer and chief compliance officer and their respective staffs. The administration agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon no fewer than 60 days' written notice to the other. During the three months ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we incurred expenses of $1.4 million and $1.5 million, respectively, under the administration agreement.




	We have also entered into a license agreement with Fifth Street Capital LLC pursuant to which Fifth Street Capital LLC has agreed to grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name "Fifth Street." Under this agreement, we will have a right to use the "Fifth Street" name, for so long as Fifth Street Management LLC or one of its affiliates remains our investment adviser. Other than with respect to this limited license, we will have no legal right to the "Fifth Street" name. Fifth Street Capital LLC is controlled by Mr. Tannenbaum, our Investment Adviser's chief executive officer.




	As of December 31, 2016, a subsidiary of FSAM held 8,399,520 shares of our common stock, which represents approximately 6.0% of our common stock outstanding.




	Recent Developments




	On December 8, 2016, our Board of Directors appointed Patrick J. Dalton as Chief Executive Officer and elected him as a member of the Board of Directors, effective January 2, 2017, succeeding Todd G. Owens. In addition, Ivelin M. Dimitrov also stepped down from his roles as President, Chief Investment Officer and a member of the Board of Directors, effective January 2, 2017.




	On February 6, 2017, our Board of Directors declared the following distributions:















	•






	monthly dividend of $0.02 per share, payable on March 31, 2017 to stockholders of record on March 15, 2017;
















	•






	quarterly dividend of $0.02 per share, payable on June 30, 2017 to stockholders of record on June 15, 2017; and
















	•






	quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share, payable on September 29, 2017 to stockholders of record on September 15, 2017.

	Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk









	We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates may affect both our cost of funding and our interest income from portfolio investments, cash and cash equivalents and idle funds investments. Our risk management systems and procedures are designed to identify and analyze our risk, to set appropriate policies and limits and to continually monitor these risks and limits by means of reliable administrative and information systems and other policies and programs. Our investment income will be affected by changes in various interest rates, including LIBOR and prime rates, to the extent our debt investments include floating interest rates. In addition, our investments are carried at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board of Directors in accordance with the 1940 Act. Our valuation methodology utilizes discount rates in part in valuing our investments, and changes in those discount rates may have an impact on the valuation of our investments.

	We regularly measure exposure to interest rate risk. We assess interest rate risk and manage our interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis by comparing our interest rate sensitive assets to our interest rate sensitive liabilities. Based on this review, we determine whether or not any hedging transactions are necessary to mitigate exposure to changes in interest rates. The following table shows a comparison of the interest rate base for our interest-bearing cash and outstanding investments, at principal, and our outstanding borrowings as of

	Controls and Procedures









	(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures









	Management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of


	December 31, 2016


	. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of


	December 31, 2016


	, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as a result of the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting that is described below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.









	(b) Material Weakness in Internal Control over Financial Reporting









	As of September 30, 2016, management has determined that the Company did not design or maintain effective controls to internally communicate current accounting policies and procedures including the nature of supporting documentation required to validate certain portfolio company data. This material weakness remained as of


	December 31, 2016


	 primarily because the remediation actions described below remain in process.









	(c) Remediation of Material Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting









	During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, we took a number of steps to remediate the aggregated material weakness including formalizing policies and procedures relating to fee income recognition and the communication of these policies and procedures throughout the organization. Further, we added senior experienced accounting and financial reporting personnel with higher levels of experience, outsourced a number of accounting and operation activities, engaged a public accounting firm to assist on technical accounting matters and reallocated existing internal resources.  During the fiscal year ending September 30, 2017, we have and will continue to take a number of additional steps to remediate this material weakness, including the formalization of policies and procedures in other significant areas and the implementation of controls over the validation of portfolio company data. Management is committed to improving our internal control processes and believes that the measures described above should be sufficient to remediate the identified material weakness and strengthen our internal control over financial reporting.  Based on the steps we have taken to date and the anticipated timing of additional remediation measures and appropriate test work, we expect that the remediation of this material weakness will be completed prior to the end of calendar year 2017.  We cannot assure you, however, that the steps taken will remediate such weakness, nor can we be certain of whether additional actions will be required or the costs of any such actions.









	(d) Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting









	Other than the remediation efforts described above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the first fiscal quarter of 2017 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

	PART II — OTHER INFORMATION















	Item 1.     


	Legal Proceedings




	Although we may, from time to time, be involved in litigation arising out of our operations in the normal course of business or otherwise, we are currently not a party to any pending material legal proceedings except as described below.




	FSC Class-Action Lawsuits




	In October and November of 2015, we, our executive officers and FSAM were named as defendants in three putative securities class-action lawsuits filed in New York and Connecticut federal courts (and later consolidated in New York). The lawsuits alleged violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of a putative class of investors who purchased our common stock between July 7, 2014, and February 6, 2015. The lawsuits alleged in general terms that defendants engaged in a purportedly fraudulent scheme designed to artificially inflate the true value of our investment portfolio and investment income in order to increase FSAM’s revenue. The plaintiffs sought compensatory damages and attorneys’ fees and costs, among other relief, but did not specify the amount of damages being sought. A lead plaintiff was selected in February 2016, a consolidated complaint similar to the original complaint was filed in April 2016, and a motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint was filed in May 2016. The parties agreed in July to settle the case for $14,050,000, with approximately 99% of the settlement amount to be paid from insurance coverage. Confirmatory discovery was completed in August, and the lead plaintiff filed the proposed settlement with the court in September. On November 9, 2016, the court authorized the parties to send notice to the class and scheduled a fairness hearing for February 16, 2017. No objections or opt-outs to the settlement were received by the deadline.




	FSC Shareholder Derivative Actions




	I


	n December 2015 through April 2016, several putative shareholder derivative actions were filed on behalf of us in Connecticut federal court and in Connecticut and Delaware state court, naming our executive officers and directors and FSAM as defendants and the Company as the nominal defendant. The underlying allegations in all of the complaints were related, and generally similar, to the allegations in the securities class actions against us described above. The Connecticut federal cases were consolidated, and the defendants moved to transfer the cases to New York federal court, which motion was subsequently withdrawn without prejudice in connection with the proposed settlement described below. The Connecticut and Delaware state cases were stayed by consent of the parties while the Connecticut federal court considered the proposed settlement.









	The parties signed an agreement in July 2016 to settle the cases. The proposed settlement provided for Fifth Street Management’s waiver of fees charged to us in the amount of $1.0 million for each of ten consecutive quarters starting in January 2018 and maintenance of the previously announced decrease in the base management fee from 2% to a maximum of 1.75% of gross assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents) for at least four years, subject to certain specified conditions. The proposed settlement also called for us to adopt certain governance and oversight enhancements. We and the defendants further agreed that we would not oppose plaintiffs’ request for an award of $5.1 million in attorneys’ fees and expenses, which was paid from insurance coverage. The plaintiffs conducted confirmatory discovery in August 2016, and, on September 23, 2016, the Connecticut federal court issued an order preliminarily approving the proposed settlement, authorizing the parties to disseminate notice to our stockholders. A fairness hearing was held on December 13, 2016 and the proposed settlement was approved. The Connecticut and Delaware state cases were dismissed in light of such approval.




	FSC Delaware Class-Action Lawsuit




	On January 29, 2016, James Craig filed a putative stockholder class-action lawsuit in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware against our executive officers and directors, Fifth Street Management, FSAM, us and Fifth Street Holdings L.P. The complaint alleged that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties to our stockholders by, among other things, issuing an incomplete or inaccurate preliminary proxy statement that purportedly attempted to mislead our stockholders into voting against proposals to be presented by another shareholder in a proxy contest in connection with our 2016 annual meeting. The complaint sought, among other things, an injunction preventing us and our Board of Directors from soliciting proxies for the 2016 annual meeting until additional disclosures were issued. The plaintiff moved for expedited proceedings and for a preliminary injunction.




	Defendants opposed plaintiff’s motion for expedited proceedings and moved to dismiss the case. We also filed another amendment to the preliminary proxy statement, making additional disclosures relating to issues raised by plaintiff. On February 16, 2016, plaintiff withdrew his motions for a preliminary injunction and expedited proceedings. Plaintiff later informed the court that his case had become moot upon the withdrawal of the competing proxy proposal, and he moved for a “mootness fee.” On September 23, 2016, the court awarded plaintiff fees and expenses of $350,000, which were paid from insurance coverage.

	On March 23, 2016, the Division of Enforcement of the SEC sent document subpoenas and document preservation notices to us, FSAM, FSCO GP LLC - General Partner of Fifth Street Opportunities Fund, L.P., or FSOF, and FSFR. The subpoenas sought production of documents relating to a variety of issues, including those raised in an ordinary-course examination of Fifth Street Management by the SEC’s Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations that began in October 2015, and in the securities class actions and derivative actions discussed above. The subpoenas were issued pursuant to a formal order of private investigation captioned In the Matter of the Fifth Street Group of Companies, No. HO-12925, dated March 23, 2016, which addresses (among other things) (i) the valuation of our portfolio companies and investments, (ii) the expenses allocated or charged to us and FSFR, (iii) FSOF’s trading in the securities of publicly traded business development companies, (iv) statements to the Board, other representatives of pooled investment vehicles, investors, or prospective investors concerning the fair value of our portfolio companies or investments as well as expenses allocated or charged to us and FSFR, (v) various issues relating to adoption and implementation of policies and procedures under the Advisers Act, (vi) statements and/or potential omissions in the entities’ SEC filings, (vii) the entities’ books, records, and accounts and whether they fairly and accurately reflected the entities’ transactions and dispositions of assets, and (viii) several other issues relating to corporate books and records. The formal order cites various provisions of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Advisers Act, as well as rules promulgated under those Acts, as the bases of the investigation. The subpoenaed Fifth Street entities are cooperating with the Division of Enforcement investigation, have produced requested documents, and have been communicating with Division of Enforcement personnel.

	On November 30, 2015, our Board of Directors approved a $100 million common stock repurchase program through November 30, 2016, and on November 28, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a new common stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to $12.5 million in the aggregate of our outstanding common stock through November 28, 2017. Common stock repurchases under this program were made in the open market, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise at times, and in such amounts, as management deemed appropriate subject to various factors, including company performance, capital availability, general economic and market conditions, regulatory requirements and other corporate considerations, as determined by management. As of December 31, 2016, there is no availability under this common stock repurchase program to repurchase additional common stock.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
