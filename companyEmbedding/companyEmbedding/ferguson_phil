On 4th and one, with 1:37 left on the clock and an undefeated season on the line, Michael Jenkins pulls down a 37 yard touchdown pass against Purdue to keep the Buckeyes national championship hopes alive.Craig Krenzel - #16 - QuarterbackWhether throwing or running the ball, the brainy Craig Krenzel made good decisions all year long.  Surprising most everybody during the National Championship game, Craig led all rushers with 81yards.Mike Doss - #2 - Strong SafetyMike Doss returned to Ohio State his senior year to win a national championship.  Things worked out just fine.  Known for his hard hits, Mike intercepted a pass during the Miami game and was named the Defensive MVP of the championship game.  Here he celebrates the Buckeyes 14th victory.Maurice Clarett - #13 - TailbackAn unbelievable freshman year.  In the 11 games he played, Maurice averaged 5.6 yards a carry while rushing for 1,266 yards.  He came up big when it counted.  A touchdown and 119 yards against the team up north and two touchdowns against Miami.Chris Gamble - #7 - Wide Receiver/Defensive Back/Punt ReturnerFirst two way starter for the buckeyes in 39 years.  On defense he returned an interception for a touchdown in the Penn State game.  In the original painting, Gamble makes a huge 57 yard catch during the 4th quarter of the Miami game.Matt Wilhelm - #35 - LinebackerFrom a touchdown saving tipped pass early in the season, during the 4th quarter of the Cincinnati game, to a punishing hit that sent Miami quarterback Ken Dorsey to the sidelines, Matt was the man in the middle.  Matt led a ferocious defense that caused five turnovers during the Miami game.newitem233965114Price: $3,500.00
