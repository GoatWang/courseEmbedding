Prostate cancer is the second most common form of cancer affecting men in the United States: An estimated one in six will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in his lifetime. The American Cancer Society estimates that approximately 240,000 new cases of prostate cancer will be diagnosed and about 30,000 men will die of the disease this year. Approximately 2 million men in the U.S. currently count themselves among prostate cancer survivors.

Clinical Trials
Targeting & Treating Cancer
Progenics is committed to improving patient care through the detection, treatment, and management of cancer. Prospective patients or their physicians who may be interested in participating in these clinical trials may wish to refer to information on these pages or contact the clinical department at 844-643-5710.
Clinical trials often involve patients with specific health conditions who benefit from receiving medication and treatment that would not otherwise be available to them. These trials provide information on the benefits, side effects and possible uses for new drugs or expanded uses for existing medications. Results from clinical trials are submitted for review to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other regulatory authorities elsewhere, which determine safety and efficacy standards for medical products. If a medicine meets these standards, it can be approved and becomes available by prescription.
The National Institutes of Health offers up-to-date information on clinical trials, including ours, at www.clinicaltrials.gov.
Information on all clinical trials involving products being developed by Progenics is posted here.

AZEDRA (Ultra-Orphan Radiotherapeutic)

PyL – PSMA Targeted PET Imaging Agent
1095 – Small Molecule Therapeutic
Azedra – Ultra-Orphan Radiotherapeutic
 

Our Pipeline
Progenics has a pipeline that includes products in pre-clinical through late-stage development. We are focused on critical unmet diagnostic and therapeutic needs of prostate cancer patients.



PSMA Targeted Oncology


1404  Tc-99m Diagnostic Imaging Agent



1404 is a technetium-99m labeled small molecule which binds PSMA and is used as an imaging agent to diagnose and detect localized prostate cancer as well as soft tissue and bone metastases. We have completed a global multi-centered Phase 2 trial assessing the diagnostic accuracy of 1404 imaging in men with high-risk prostate cancer and a multi-center, open-label Phase 3 trial is ongoing to determine the sensitivity and specificity of 1404 to correctly identify whether or not patients have clinically significant prostate cancer (generally, Gleason score >3+4). MORE>



PyL™ F-18 Diagnostic Imaging Agent



PyL (also known as [18F]DCFPyL) is a clinical-stage, fluorinated PSMA-targeted Positron Emission Topography (PET) imaging agent for prostate cancer that was discovered and developed at the Center for Translational Molecular Imaging at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. A proof-of-concept study published in the April 2015 issue of the Journal of Molecular Imaging and Biology showed that the uptake of PyL is high in sites of putative metastatic lesions and primary tumors, suggesting the potential for high sensitivity in detecting prostate cancer. A phase 2/3 trial commenced in December 2016 to assess the diagnostic performance of PyL PET/CT imaging to detect prostate cancer in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic disease. MORE>



1095 I-131 Small Molecule Theranostic



1095 is a PSMA-targeted Iodine-131 labeled small molecule that is designed to deliver a dose of beta radiation directly to prostate cancer cells with minimal impact on the surrounding healthy tissues. In collaboration with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application has been filed in the U.S. and a Phase 1 trial has been initiated. MORE>



PSMA TTC



PSMA TTC is a thorium-227 labeled PSMA-targeted antibody therapeutic. The PSMA TTC is designed to deliver a dose of alpha radiation directly to prostate cancer cells with minimal impact on the surrounding healthy tissues. In April 2016, we granted Bayer exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize products using our PSMA antibody technology in combination with Bayer’s alpha-emitting radionuclides.





Oncology


Azedra®I-131 Theranostic (MIBG)

SPA


AZEDRA is a radiotherapeutic product candidate in development as a treatment for malignant and/or recurrent pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma, rare tumors found in the adrenal glands and outside of the adrenal glands, respectively. AZEDRA has been granted Breakthrough Therapy and Orphan Drug designations, as well as Fast Track status in the U.S. Under a SPA agreement with the FDA, a Phase 2 registrational trial has been completed in patients with malignant and/or recurrent pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma; there is currently no FDA-approved therapy for the treatment of these ultra-orphan diseases. MORE>





Oncology Supportive Care


RELISTOR® SC



RELISTOR® subcutaneous injection, a small-molecule mu-opioid receptor antagonist, is approved in the United States for the treatment of opioid induced constipation in adult patients with chronic non-cancer pain. Progenics has licensed Relistor® to Salix Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. in markets worldwide.




RELISTOR® Oral



RELISTOR® Tablets (methylnaltrexone bromide) is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation (OIC) in adults with chronic non-cancer pain. Progenics has licensed Relistor® to Salix Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. in markets worldwide.



RELISTOR® SC (AI-Japan)








Partnered Programs


PRO 140



PRO 140 is a humanized anti-CCR5 monoclonal antibody created at Progenics and now developed by CytoDyn, Inc. PRO 140 is in Phase 3 testing as a treatment for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.  MORE>

Progenics Pharmaceuticals, Inc. develops innovative medicines and other technologies to identify, target and treat cancer. Our pipeline includes: (1) therapeutic agents designed to precisely target cancer (AZEDRA® and 1095); (2) PSMA-targeted imaging agents for prostate cancer (1404 and PyLTM); and (3) imaging analysis tools. Our first commercial product, RELISTOR® (methylnaltrexone bromide) for opioid-induced constipation, is partnered with Valeant.

					Full Description



Progenics Pharmaceuticals, Inc., incorporated on December 1, 1986, is engaged in developing medicines and other products for targeting and treating cancer. The Company's pipeline includes therapeutic agents designed to target cancer (AZEDRA and 1095); prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted imaging agents for prostate cancer (1404 and PyL), and imaging analysis tools. It also includes commercial product, RELISTOR (methylnaltrexone bromide) for opioid-induced constipation.AZEDRA is a radiotherapeutic product candidate in development as a treatment for malignant and/or recurrent pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma, rare tumors found in the adrenal glands and outside of the adrenal glands, respectively. AZEDRA has been granted breakthrough therapy and orphan drug designations, as well as Fast Track status in the United States and a Phase II registrational trial has been completed in patients with malignant and/or recurrent pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma. 1404 is a technetium-99m labeled small molecule, which binds PSMA and is used as an imaging agent to diagnose and detect localized prostate cancer, as well as soft tissue and bone metastases. It has completed a global multi-centered Phase II trial assessing the diagnostic accuracy of 1404 imaging in men with high-risk prostate cancer and a multi-center, open-label Phase III trial is ongoing to determine the sensitivity and specificity of 1404 to identify whether or not patients have clinically significant prostate cancer.PyL is a clinical-stage, fluorinated PSMA-targeted Positron Emission Topography (PET) imaging agent for prostate cancer. A Phase II/III trial is commenced to assess the diagnostic performance of PyL PET/computed tomography (CT) imaging to detect prostate cancer in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic disease. 1095 is a PSMA-targeted Iodine-131 labeled small molecule that is designed to deliver a dose of beta radiation directly to prostate cancer cells with minimal impact on the surrounding healthy tissues. PSMA TTC is a thorium-227 labeled PSMA-targeted antibody therapeutic. The PSMA TTC is designed to deliver a dose of alpha radiation directly to prostate cancer cells with minimal impact on the surrounding healthy tissues.RELISTOR is a treatment for opioid induced constipation (OIC) that addresses its underlying mechanism of OIC and decreases the constipating side effects induced by opioid pain medications, such as morphine and codeine without diminishing their ability to relieve pain. RELISTOR subcutaneous injection is approved and is being sold in the United States, European Union (E.U.) and Canada. Prostate cancer bone scan indexing products include Exini bone Bone scan index (BSI), which quantifies the hotspots on bone scans of prostate cancer patients and automatically calculates the BSI value, representing the disease burden of prostate cancer shown on the bone scan.The Company competes with Nektar Therapeutics, AstraZeneca PLC, Merck & Co., Inc., Sucampo Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Aytu Bioscience Inc., Blue Earth Diagnostic, Inc., Johnson & Johnson, Medivation, Inc., Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc., Theravance, Inc. and Mundipharma International Limited.

Welcome to the future of medicine. Where disease is no match for tenacity. No match for ingenuity. Where together, we go boldly.

This is the most exciting time in the history of medicine. Millions of people around the world are benefiting from breakthrough treatments that save, extend and improve life.
Research, technology and genomics are coming together to create a platform that allows researchers to decipher the cause of disease as never before. Each advance opens new doors, new cures, new treatments.
And yet, it’s not enough.
"Today's breakthroughs become tomorrow's medicines."
 Tweet
Cures don’t appear on a schedule. In search of the unknowable, in search of curing the incurable, there is no one map, no singular template, no predictable milestones.
Finding lifesaving medicines is a life’s work – the work of thousands of researchers who never say never. It's also the work of millions of patients who fight side by side with researchers in the battle for life, against whatever odds they face together.
Now is the time to put the accelerator to the floor. The best is yet to come – like groundbreaking advances in immunotherapy and personalized medicine – where the once impossible is now reality.
Welcome to the future of medicine. Where disease is no match for tenacity. No match for ingenuity. Where together, we go boldly.
Dylan Thomas penned "Do not go gentle into that good night" in 1947, but the sentiment is as timely today as it ever was. Millions of Americans are battling serious illnesses, but they’re not alone in the fight. They have the support of thousands of biopharmaceutical researchers whose lives are dedicated to helping patients go boldly into longer, healthier, and more productive lives.

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

America’s biopharmaceutical companies are driving the future of medicine through bold advances in genomics, personalized medicine and immunotherapy. The new era of genomics provides better understanding of the genes that can cause certain diseases and equips researchers with the tools they need to tailor treatments like never before. Personalized medicines are at the center of this revolution, offering patients individualized therapies unique to each patient. Immunotherapy is transforming cancer care in new ways by harnessing the patient’s immune system to eliminate the disease or slow its growth. Together, these advancements are helping patients live longer, healthier, and more productive lives.

Personalized Medicine
Personalized medicine — sometimes referred to as precision or individualized medicine —is an emerging field of medicine that uses diagnostic tools to identify specific biological markers, often genetic, to help assess which medical treatments and procedures will be best for each patient.
