Job Details
               VSB is currently delivering a driving service for clients throughout the North Down and Ards area. This service is funded by the South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust. Transport is primarily provided for children and young people who have been referred by Family and Childcare departments of the Trust. VSB use volunteer drivers to help clients get to school, childcare, contact visits and health appointments. The service also provides transport for older people who need to get to health and chiropody appointments as well as some local voluntary organisations. Last quarter this busy service drove nearly 22,000 miles for the South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust! Referrals are welcome from social workers operating in the North Down and Ards area for Family and Childcare services. There are currently 30 volunteer drivers who give their time to help others in their local community- they use their own cars and are reimbursed mileage expenses. This service would not operate with the dedication of our volunteers and VSB are always looking for more! Our drivers have a coffee morning every month to get to know one another and are provided with free training and thank you events.
