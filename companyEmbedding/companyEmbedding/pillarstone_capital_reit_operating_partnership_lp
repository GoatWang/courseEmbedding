Pillarstone Capital REIT Completes Acquisition Of 14 Real Estate Assets






GlobeNewswire



Dec 8, 2016 5:17 PM EST













 




























































 HOUSTON, Dec. 08, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pillarstone Capital REIT (OTC:PRLE) ("Pillarstone" or the "Company") today announced that it has acquired 14 real estate assets from Whitestone REIT (NYSE:WSR) ("Whitestone"). Pillarstone has acquired the 14 real estate assets for a total transaction value of approximately $84.0 million from Whitestone, a company affiliated with certain members of Pillarstone's management team and Board of Trustees. Pillarstone Capital REIT Operating Partnership, LP ("OP") will assume approximately $65.9 million of debt associated with the properties, and Whitestone will receive operating partnership units ("OP Units") ¿of the OP valued at approximately $18.1 million 1, comprising approximately 84% of the ownership of the OP. Following the acquisition, it is expected that Whitestone will consolidate the OP on its financial statements due to its significant equity ownership of the OP.  Key Benefits of the Transaction  Positions Pillarstone to pursue new value-enhancing real estate investment opportunities and develop and redevelop the acquired properties. Retains Whitestone's property management and leasing agreements and expertise for two years following the close of the transaction. Whitestone and Pillarstone will own 84% and 16%, respectively, of the OP Units.   Special Committee ProcessThe transaction is the result of an active and extensive process led by Special Committees formed by the Boards of both companies, along with each Special Committee's advisors. Both Special Committees were composed entirely of disinterested, independent trustees. The Pillarstone Special Committee and the Board of Trustees unanimously approved the transaction. "This is a transformative transaction that will allow Pillarstone to focus on specific high-growth markets and capitalize on private and public real estate opportunities," said Dennis Chookaszian, a trustee of Pillarstone and member of Pillarstone's Special Committee. "Through this acquisition, we will have the ability to pursue a number of attractive ROI opportunities, including the potential redevelopment of the acquired assets for multi-family, industrial or office uses."

Pillarstone Capital REIT Completes Acquisition of 14 Real Estate Assets

 December 8, 2016 Author: admin Category: Recent Transactions 


Will Pursue New Value-Enhancing Real Estate Investment Opportunities
Houston, December 8, 2016 – (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) – Pillarstone Capital REIT (OTC: PRLE) (“Pillarstone” or the “Company”) today announced that it has acquired 14 real estate assets from Whitestone REIT (NYSE: WSR) (“Whitestone”).
Pillarstone has acquired the 14 real estate assets for a total transaction value of approximately $84.0 million from Whitestone, a company affiliated with certain members of Pillarstone’s management team and Board of Trustees. Pillarstone Capital REIT Operating Partnership, LP (“OP”) will assume approximately $65.9 million of debt associated with the properties, and Whitestone will receive operating partnership units (“OP Units”) ‎of the OP valued at approximately $18.1 million[1], comprising approximately 84% of the ownership of the OP. Following the acquisition, it is expected that Whitestone will consolidate the OP on its financial statements due to its significant equity ownership of the OP.
Key Benefits of the Transaction

subdivides its outstanding Shares, or (iii) combines its
outstanding Shares into a smaller number of Shares, the Conversion
Factor shall be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Factor by a
fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of Shares
issued and outstanding on the record date for such dividend,
distribution, subdivision or combination (assuming for such
purposes that such dividend, distribution, subdivision or
combination has occurred as of such time) and the denominator of
which shall be the actual number of Shares (determined without the

Partner with or into another entity (the “ Successor
Entity ”), the Conversion Factor shall be adjusted by
multiplying the Conversion Factor by the number of shares of the
Successor Entity into which one Share is converted pursuant to such

Conversion Factor shall become effective immediately after the
effective date of the event retroactive to the record date, if any,
for the event giving rise thereto, it being intended that (x)
adjustments to the Conversion Factor are to be made to avoid
unintended dilution or anti-dilution as a result of transactions in
which Shares are issued, redeemed or exchanged without a
corresponding issuance, redemption or exchange of Partnership Units
and (y) if a Specified Redemption Date shall fall between the
record date and the effective date of any event of the type
described above, that the Conversion Factor applicable to such

Interests, (ii) the right of each such class or series of
Partnership Interests to share in Partnership distributions, (iii)
the rights of each such class or series of Partnership Interests
upon dissolution and liquidation of the Partnership, (iv) the
rights, if any, of each such class to vote on matters that require
the vote or Consent of the Limited Partners, and (v) the
consideration, if any, to be received by the Partnership; provided,
however, that no such Partnership Units or other Partnership
Interests shall be issued to the General Partner unless (a) the
Partnership Interests are issued in connection with the grant,
award or issuance of Shares or other equity interests in the
General Partner (including a transaction described in Section
7.4.F ) having designations, preferences and other rights such
that the economic interests attributable to such Shares or other
equity interests are substantially similar to the designations,
preferences and other rights (except voting rights) of the
Partnership Interests issued to the General Partner in accordance
with this Section 4.2.A , and the General Partner
contributes to the Partnership the proceeds (if any) from the
issuance of Shares or equity received by the General Partner as
required pursuant to Section 7.5.D ,

 


17
 




 


 


(b) the General Partner
makes an additional Capital Contribution to the Partnership, or (c)
the additional Partnership Interests are issued to all Partners
holding Partnership Interests in the same class in proportion to
their respective Percentage Interests in such class. If the
Partnership issues Partnership Interests pursuant to this
Section 4.2.A , the General Partner shall make such
revisions to this Agreement (including, without limitation, the
revisions described in Section 5.4 , Section 6.2 and
Section 8.6 ) as it deems necessary to reflect the issuance
of such Partnership Interests. The designation of any newly issued
class or series of Partnership Interests may provide a formula for
treating such Partnership Interests solely for purposes of voting
on or consenting to any matter that requires the vote or Consent of
the Limited Partners as set forth in one or more of Sections
7.1 , 7.5.A , 7.11 , 13.1(i) ,
13.1(vi) , 14.1.A , 14.1.C , 14.2.A ,
and 14.2.B of this Agreement as the equivalent of a
specified number (including any fraction thereof) of Class A Units.
Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the General Partner from
issuing Partnership Units for less than fair market value if the
General Partner concludes in good faith that such issuance is in
the best interests of the Partnership.
B.     
Classes of
Partnership Units . On the date of this Agreement,
the Partnership shall have two authorized classes of Partnership
Units, entitled “Class A Units” and “LTIP
Units,” and, thereafter, such additional classes of
Partnership Units as may be created by the General Partner pursuant
to Section 4.2.A and this Section 4.2.B . Class A
Units or a class of Partnership Interests created pursuant to
Section 4.2.A or this Section 4.2.B , at the election
of the General Partner, in its sole and absolute discretion, may be
issued to newly admitted Partners in exchange for the contribution
by such Partners of cash, real estate partnership interests, stock,
notes or other assets or consideration; provided, however, that any
Partnership Unit that is not specifically designated by the General
Partner as being of a particular class shall be deemed to be a
Class A Unit. The issuance and terms of any LTIP Units shall be in
accordance with Section 4.6 .
Section 4.3     
No Preemptive
Rights
Except to the extent expressly
granted by the Partnership pursuant to another agreement, no Person
shall have any preemptive, preferential or other similar right with
respect to (i) additional Capital Contributions or loans to the
Partnership or (ii) issuance or sale of any Partnership Units or
other Partnership Interests.
Section 4.4     
Other Contribution
Provisions
A.     
General
. If any Partner is
admitted to the Partnership and is given a Capital Account in
exchange for services rendered to the Partnership, such transaction
shall be treated by the Partnership and the affected Partner (and
set forth in the Partner Registry) as if the Partnership had
compensated such Partner in cash, and the Partner had made a
Capital Contribution of such cash to the capital of the
Partnership.
B.     
Mergers
. To the extent the
Partnership acquires any property (or an indirect interest therein)
by the merger of any other Person into the Partnership or with or
into a Subsidiary of the Partnership, Persons who receive
Partnership Interests in exchange for their interest in the Person
merging into the Partnership or with or into a Subsidiary of the
Partnership shall be deemed to have been admitted as Additional
Limited Partners pursuant to Section 12.2 and shall be
deemed to have

 


18
 




 


 


made Capital
Contributions as provided in the applicable merger agreement (or if
not so provided, as determined by the General Partner in its sole
and absolute discretion) and as set forth in the Partner
Registry.
Section 4.5     
No Interest on
Capital
No Partner shall be entitled to
interest on its Capital Contributions or its Capital
Account.
Section 4.6     
LTIP
Units
A.     
Issuance of LTIP
Units . The
General Partner may from time to time, for such consideration as
the General Partner may determine to be appropriate, issue LTIP
Units to Persons who provide services to the Partnership or the
Parent and admit such Persons as Limited Partners. Subject to the
following provisions of this Section 4.6 and the special
provisions of Sections 4.7 and 6.1.E , LTIP Units
shall be treated as Class A Units, with all of the rights,
privileges and obligations attendant thereto. For purposes of
computing the Partners’ Percentage Interests, holders of LTIP
Units shall be treated as Class A Unit holders and LTIP Units shall
be treated as Class A Units. In particular, the Partnership shall
maintain at all times a one-to-one correspondence between LTIP
Units and Class A Units for conversion, distribution and other
purposes, including, without limitation, complying with the
following procedures:
(i)     
If an Adjustment Event
(as defined below) occurs, then the General Partner shall make a
corresponding adjustment to the LTIP Units to maintain a
one-for-one conversion and economic equivalence ratio between Class
A Units and LTIP Units. The following shall be “Adjustment
Events”: (A) the Partnership makes a distribution on all
outstanding Class A Units in Partnership Units, (B) the Partnership
subdivides the outstanding Class A Units into a greater number of
units or combines the outstanding Class A Units into a smaller
number of units, or (C) the Partnership issues any Partnership
Units in exchange for its outstanding Class A Units by way of a
reclassification or recapitalization of its Class A Units. If more
than one Adjustment Event occurs, the adjustment to the LTIP Units
need be made only once using a single formula that takes into
account each and every Adjustment Event as if all Adjustment Events
occurred simultaneously. For the avoidance of doubt, the following
shall not be Adjustment Events: (x) the issuance of Partnership
Units in a financing, reorganization, acquisition or other similar
business Class A Unit Transaction, (y) the issuance of Partnership
Units pursuant to any employee benefit or compensation plan or
distribution reinvestment plan or (z) the issuance of any
Partnership Units to the General Partner or the Parent in respect
of a capital contribution to the Partnership. If the Partnership
takes an action affecting the Class A Units other than actions
specifically described above as “Adjustment Events” and
in the opinion of the General Partner such action would require an
adjustment to the LTIP Units to maintain the one-to-one
correspondence described above, the General Partner shall have the
right to make such adjustment to the LTIP Units, to the extent
permitted by law and by any Equity Incentive Plan, in such manner
and at such time as the General Partner, in its sole discretion,
may determine to be appropriate under the circumstances. If an
adjustment is made to the LTIP Units, as herein provided, the
Partnership shall promptly file in the books and records of the
Partnership an officer’s certificate setting forth such
adjustment and a brief statement of the facts requiring such
adjustment, which

 


19
 




 


 


certificate shall be
conclusive evidence of the correctness of such adjustment absent
manifest error. Promptly after filing of such certificate, the
Partnership shall mail a notice to each LTIP Unitholder setting
forth the adjustment to his or her LTIP Units and the effective
date of such adjustment; and
(ii)     
The LTIP Unitholders
shall, when, as and if authorized and declared by the General
Partner out of assets legally available for that purpose, be
entitled to receive distributions in an amount per LTIP Unit equal
to the distributions per Class A Unit (the “ Class A
Unit Distribution ”), paid to holders of Class A
Units on such Partnership Record Date established by the General
Partner with respect to such distribution. So long as any LTIP
Units are outstanding, no distributions (whether in cash or in
kind) shall be authorized, declared or paid on Class A Units,
unless equal distributions have been or contemporaneously are
authorized, declared and paid on the LTIP Units.
B.     
Priority
. Subject to the
provisions of this Section 4.6 and the special provisions of
Sections 4.7 and 5.1.E , the LTIP Units shall rank
pari passu with the Class A Units as to the payment of regular and
special periodic or other distributions and distribution of assets
upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up. As to the payment of
distributions and as to distribution of assets upon liquidation,
dissolution or winding up, any class or series of Partnership Units
which by its terms specifies that it shall rank junior to, on a
parity with, or senior to the Class A Units shall also rank junior
to, or pari passu with, or senior to, as the case may be, the LTIP
Units. Subject to the terms of any Vesting Agreement, an LTIP
Unitholder shall be entitled to transfer his or her LTIP Units to
the same extent, and subject to the same restrictions as holders of
Class A Units are entitled to transfer their Class A Units pursuant
to Article XI .
C.     
Special
Provisions .
LTIP Units shall be subject to the following special
provisions:
(i)     
Vesting
Agreements .
LTIP Units may, in the sole discretion of the General Partner, be
issued subject to vesting, forfeiture and additional restrictions
on transfer pursuant to the terms of a Vesting Agreement. The terms
of any Vesting Agreement may be modified by the General Partner
from time to time in its sole discretion, subject to any
restrictions on amendment imposed by the relevant Vesting Agreement
or by the Equity Incentive Plan, if applicable. LTIP Units that
have vested under the terms of a Vesting Agreement are referred to
as “ Vested LTIP Units ;” all other LTIP
Units shall be treated as “ Unvested LTIP Units
.”
(ii)     
Forfeiture . Unless otherwise specified in the
Vesting Agreement, upon the occurrence of any event specified in a
Vesting Agreement as resulting in either the right of the
Partnership or the General Partner to repurchase LTIP Units at a
specified purchase price or some other forfeiture of any LTIP
Units, then if the Partnership or the General Partner exercises
such right to repurchase or forfeiture in accordance with the
applicable Vesting Agreement, the relevant LTIP Units shall
immediately, and without any further action, be treated as
cancelled and no longer outstanding for any purpose. Unless
otherwise specified in the Vesting Agreement, no consideration or
other payment shall be due with respect to any LTIP Units that have
been forfeited, other than any distributions declared with respect
to a Partnership Record Date prior to the effective date of the
forfeiture. In connection with any repurchase or forfeiture of LTIP
Units, the balance of the portion of the Capital Account

 


20
 




 


 


of the LTIP Unitholder
that is attributable to all of his or her LTIP Units shall be
reduced by the amount, if any, by which it exceeds the target
balance contemplated by Section 6.1.E , calculated with
respect to the LTIP Unitholder’s remaining LTIP Units, if
any.
(iii)     
Allocations . LTIP Unitholders shall be
entitled to certain special allocations of gain under Section
6.1.E .
(iv)     
Redemption . The Redemption Right provided to
the holders of Class A Units under Section 8.6 shall not
apply with respect to LTIP Units unless and until they are
converted to Class A Units as provided in clause (v) below and
Section 4.7 .
(v)     
Conversion to Class
A Units .
Vested LTIP Units are eligible to be converted into Class A Units
in accordance with Section 4.7 .
D.     
Voting
. LTIP Unitholders
shall (a) have the same voting rights as the Limited Partners, with
the LTIP Units voting as a single class with the Class A Units and
having one vote per LTIP Unit; and (b) have the additional voting
rights that are expressly set forth below. So long as any LTIP
Units remain outstanding, the Partnership shall not, without the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the LTIP Units
outstanding at the time, given in person or by proxy, either in
writing or at a meeting (voting separately as a class), amend,
alter or repeal, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, the
provisions of this Agreement applicable to LTIP Units so as to
materially and adversely affect any right, privilege or voting
power of the LTIP Units or the LTIP Unitholders as such, unless
such amendment, alteration, or repeal affects equally, ratably and
proportionately the rights, privileges and voting powers of all of
Class A Units (including the Class A Units held by the General
Partner or the Parent); but subject, in any event, to the following
provisions:
(i)     
With respect to any
Class A Unit Transaction (as defined in Section 4.7.F ), so
long as the LTIP Units are treated in accordance with Section
4.7.F , the consummation of such Class A Unit Transaction shall
not be deemed to materially and adversely affect such rights,
preferences, privileges or voting powers of the LTIP Units or the
LTIP Unitholders as such; and
(ii)     
Any creation or
issuance of any Partnership Units or of any class or series of
Partnership Interest in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, including, without limitation, additional Class A Units
or LTIP Units, whether ranking senior to, junior to, or on a parity
with the LTIP Units with respect to distributions and the
distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up,
shall not be deemed to materially and adversely affect such rights,
preferences, privileges or voting powers of the LTIP Units or the
LTIP Unitholders as such.
The foregoing voting provisions
will not apply if, at or prior to the time when the act with
respect to which such vote would otherwise be required will be
effected, all outstanding LTIP Units shall have been converted into
Class A Units.
Section 4.7     
Conversion of LTIP
Units.

 


21
 




 


 

A.     
Conversion
Right . An
LTIP Unitholder shall have the right (the “ Conversion
Right ”), at his or her option, at any time to
convert all or a portion of his or her Vested LTIP Units into Class
A Units; provided, however, that a holder may not exercise the
Conversion Right for less than one thousand (1,000) Vested LTIP
Units or, if such holder holds less than one thousand Vested LTIP
Units, all of the Vested LTIP Units held by such holder. LTIP
Unitholders shall not have the right to convert Unvested LTIP Units
into Class A Units until they become Vested LTIP Units; provided,
however, that when an LTIP Unitholder is notified of the expected
occurrence of an event that will cause his or her Unvested LTIP
Units to become Vested LTIP Units, such LTIP Unitholder may give
the Partnership a Conversion Notice conditioned upon and effective
as of the time of vesting and such Conversion Notice, unless
subsequently revoked by the LTIP Unitholder, shall be accepted by
the Partnership subject to such condition. The General Partner
shall have the right at any time to cause a conversion of Vested
LTIP Units into Class A Units. In all cases, the conversion of any
LTIP Units into Class A Units shall be subject to the conditions
and procedures set forth in this Section 4.7 .
B.     
Exercise by an LTIP
Unitholder .
A holder of Vested LTIP Units may convert such LTIP Units into an
equal number of fully paid and non-assessable Class A Units, giving
effect to all adjustments (if any) made pursuant to Section
4.6 . Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event may a holder
of Vested LTIP Units convert a number of Vested LTIP Units that
exceeds (x) the Economic Capital Account Balance of such Limited
Partner, to the extent attributable to its ownership of LTIP Units,
divided by (y) the Class A Unit Economic Balance, in each case as
determined as of the effective date of conversion (the “
Capital Account Limitation ”). In order to
exercise his or her Conversion Right, an LTIP Unitholder shall
deliver a notice (a “ Conversion Notice
”) in the form attached as Exhibit F to this
Agreement to the Partnership (with a copy to the General Partner)
not less than ten nor more than 60 days prior to a date (the
“ Conversion Date ”) specified in such
Conversion Notice; provided, however, that if the General Partner
has not given to the LTIP Unitholders notice of a proposed or
upcoming Class A Unit Transaction (as defined in Section
4.7.F ) at least 30 days prior to the effective date of such
Class A Unit Transaction, then LTIP Unitholders shall have the
right to deliver a Conversion Notice until the earlier of (x) the
tenth day after such notice from the General Partner of a Class A
Unit Transaction or (y) the third business day immediately
preceding the effective date of such Class A Unit Transaction. A
Conversion Notice shall be provided in the manner provided in
Section 15.1 . Each LTIP Unitholder covenants and agrees
with the Partnership that all Vested LTIP Units to be converted
pursuant to this Section 4.7.B shall be free and clear of
all liens and encumbrances. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, a holder of LTIP Units may deliver a Notice of Redemption
pursuant to Section 8.6 relating to those Class A Units that
will be issued to such holder upon conversion of such LTIP Units
into Class A Units in advance of the Conversion Date; provided,
however, that the redemption of such Class A Units by the
Partnership shall in no event take place until after the Conversion
Date. For clarity, it is noted that the objective of this paragraph
is to put an LTIP Unitholder in a position where, if he or she so
wishes, the Class A Units into which his or her Vested LTIP Units
will be converted can be redeemed by the Partnership simultaneously
with such conversion, with the further consequence that, if the
General Partner elects to cause the Parent to assume and perform
the Partnership’s redemption obligation with respect to such
Class A Units under Section 8.6 by delivering to such holder
Shares rather than cash, then such holder can have such Shares
issued to him or her simultaneously with the conversion of his or
her Vested LTIP Units into Class A Units.

 


22
 




 


 


The General Partner and
LTIP Unitholder shall reasonably cooperate with each other to
coordinate the timing of the events described in the foregoing
sentence.
C.     
Forced
Conversion .
The Partnership, at any time at the election of the General
Partner, may cause any number of Vested LTIP Units held by an LTIP
Unitholder to be converted (a “ Forced
Conversion ”) into an equal number of Class A Units,
giving effect to all adjustments (if any) made pursuant to
Section 4.6 ; provided, however, that the Partnership may
not cause Forced Conversion of any LTIP Units that would not at the
time be eligible for conversion at the option of such LTIP
Unitholder pursuant to Section 4.7.B . In order to exercise
its right of Forced Conversion, the Partnership shall deliver a
notice (a “ Forced Conversion Notice ”)
in the form attached as Exhibit G to this Agreement
to the applicable LTIP Unitholder not less than ten nor more than
60 days prior to the Conversion Date specified in such Forced
Conversion Notice. A Forced Conversion Notice shall be provided in
the manner provided in Section 15.1 .
D.     
Completion of
Conversion .
A conversion of Vested LTIP Units for which the holder thereof has
given a Conversion Notice or the Partnership has given a Forced
Conversion Notice shall occur automatically after the close of
business on the applicable Conversion Date without any action on
the part of such LTIP Unitholder, as of which time such LTIP
Unitholder shall be credited on the books and records of the
Partnership with the issuance as of the opening of business on the
next day of the number of Class A Units issuable upon such
conversion. After the conversion of LTIP Units as aforesaid, the
Partnership shall deliver to such LTIP Unitholder, upon his or her
written request, a certificate of the General Partner certifying
the number of Class A Units and remaining LTIP Units, if any, held
by such person immediately after such conversion. The Assignee of
any Limited Partner pursuant to Article XI may exercise the
rights of such Limited Partner pursuant to this Section 4.7
and such Limited Partner shall be bound by the exercise of such
rights by the Assignee.
E.     
Impact of
Conversions for Purposes of Section 6.1.E . For purposes of making future
allocations under Section 6.1.E and applying the Capital
Account Limitation, the portion of the Economic Capital Account
Balance of the applicable LTIP Unitholder that is treated as
attributable to his or her LTIP Units shall be reduced, as of the
date of conversion, by the product of the number of LTIP Units
converted and the Class A Unit Economic Balance.
F.     
Class A Unit
Transactions . If the Partnership, the General
Partner or the Parent shall be a party to any Class A Unit
Transaction, as defined below (including, without limitation, a
merger, consolidation, unit exchange, self tender offer for all or
substantially all Class A Units or other business combination or
reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of the
Partnership’s assets, but excluding any Class A Unit
Transaction which constitutes an Adjustment Event) in each case as
a result of which Class A Units shall be exchanged for or converted
into the right, or the holders of such Class A Units shall
otherwise be entitled, to receive cash, securities or other
property or any combination thereof (each of the foregoing being
referred to herein as a “ Class A Unit
Transaction ”), then the General Partner shall,
immediately prior to the Class A Unit Transaction, exercise its
right to cause a Forced Conversion with respect to the maximum
number of LTIP Units then eligible for conversion, taking into
account any allocations that occur in connection with the Class A
Unit Transaction or that would occur in connection with the Class A
Unit Transaction if the

 


23
 




 


 


assets of the
Partnership were sold at the Class A Unit Transaction price or, if
applicable, at a value determined by the General Partner in good
faith using the value attributed to the Partnership Units in the
context of the Class A Unit Transaction (in which case the
Conversion Date shall be the effective date of the Class A Unit
Transaction). In anticipation of such Forced Conversion and the
consummation of the Class A Unit Transaction, the Partnership shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each LTIP Unitholder
to be afforded the right to receive in connection with such Class A
Unit Transaction in consideration for the Class A Units into which
his or her LTIP Units will be converted the same kind and amount of
cash, securities and other property (or any combination thereof)
receivable upon the consummation of such Class A Unit Transaction
by a holder of the same number of Class A Units, assuming such
holder of Class A Units is not a Person with which the Partnership
consolidated or into which the Partnership merged or which merged
into the Partnership or to which such sale or transfer was made, as
the case may be (a “ Constituent Person
”), or an affiliate of a Constituent Person. In the event
that holders of Class A Units have the opportunity to elect the
form or type of consideration to be received upon consummation of
the Class A Unit Transaction, prior to such Class A Unit
Transaction the General Partner shall give prompt written notice to
each LTIP Unitholder of such election, and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to afford the LTIP Unitholders the right to
elect, by written notice to the General Partner, the form or type
of consideration to be received upon conversion of each LTIP Unit
held by such holder into Class A Units in connection with such
Class A Unit Transaction. If an LTIP Unitholder fails to make such
an election, such holder (and any of its transferees) shall receive
upon conversion of each LTIP Unit held him or her (or by any of his
or her transferees) the same kind and amount of consideration that
a holder of a Class A Unit would receive if such Class A Unit
holder failed to make such an election. Subject to the rights of
the Partnership and the General Partner under any Vesting Agreement
and any Equity Incentive Plan, the Partnership shall use
commercially reasonable effort to cause the terms of any Class A
Unit Transaction to be consistent with the provisions of this
Section 4.7.F and to enter into an agreement with the
successor or purchasing entity, as the case may be, for the benefit
of any LTIP Unitholders whose LTIP Units will not be converted into
Class A Units in connection with the Class A Unit Transaction that
will (i) contain provisions enabling the holders of LTIP Units that
remain outstanding after such Class A Unit Transaction to convert
their LTIP Units into securities as comparable as reasonably
possible under the circumstances to the Class A Units and (ii)
preserve as far as reasonably possible under the circumstances the
distribution, special allocation, conversion, and other rights set
forth in this Agreement for the benefit of the LTIP
Unitholders.
 
ARTICLE V 
 
DISTRIBUTIONS
Section 5.1     
Requirement and
Characterization of Distributions
A.     
General
. The General Partner
may cause the Partnership to distribute at least quarterly all, or
such portion as the General Partner may in its sole and absolute
discretion determine, of the Available Cash of the Partnership with
respect to such quarter or shorter period to the Partners
in

 


24
 




 


 


accordance with the
terms established for the class or classes of Partnership Interests
held by such Partners who are Partners on the respective
Partnership Record Date with respect to such quarter or shorter
period as provided in Sections 5.1.B and 5.1.C and in
accordance with the respective terms established for each class of
Partnership Interest. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, in no event may a Partner receive a distribution
of Available Cash with respect to a Partnership Unit for a quarter
or shorter period if such Partner is entitled to receive a
distribution with respect to a Share for which such Partnership
Unit has been redeemed or exchanged. Unless otherwise expressly
provided for herein, or in the terms established for a new class or
series of Partnership Interests created in accordance with
Article IV hereof, no Partnership Interest shall be entitled
to a distribution in preference to any other Partnership Interest.
The General Partner shall make such reasonable efforts, as
determined by it in its sole and absolute discretion and consistent
with the qualification of the General Partner as a REIT, to
distribute Available Cash (a) to Limited Partners so as to preclude
any such distribution or portion thereof from being treated as part
of a sale of property to the Partnership by a Limited Partner under
Section 707 of the Code or the Regulations thereunder; provided,
however, that neither the General Partner nor the Partnership shall
have liability to a Limited Partner under any circumstances as a
result of any distribution to a Limited Partner being so treated,
and (b) to the General Partner in an amount sufficient to enable
the General Partner to make distributions to its shareholders that
will enable the General Partner to (1) satisfy the requirements for
qualification as a REIT under the Code and the Regulations (the
“ REIT Requirements ”), and (2) avoid any
U.S. federal income or excise tax liability.
B.     
Method
. C. Each holder of
Partnership Interests that is entitled to any preference in
distribution shall be entitled to a distribution in accordance with
the rights of any such class of Partnership Interests (and, within
such class, pro rata in proportion to the respective Percentage
Interests on such Partnership Record Date); and

(i)     
To the extent there is
Available Cash remaining after the payment of any preference in
distribution in accordance with the foregoing clause (i), with
respect to Partnership Interests that are not entitled to any
preference in distribution or with respect to which distributions
are not limited to any preference in distribution, such Available
Cash shall be distributed pro rata to each such class in accordance
with the terms of such class (and, within each such class, pro rata
in proportion to the respective Percentage Interests on such
Partnership Record Date).
D.     
Distributions with
Respect to Class A Units . For any quarter or shorter period
with respect to which a distribution is to be made (a “
Distribution Period ”), the General Partner
shall distribute the Available Cash with respect to such
Distribution Period available for distribution with respect to the
Class A Units pro rata among Partners holding Class A Units on the
Partnership Record Date for the Distribution Period in accordance
with the number of Class A Units held by each Partner on such
Partnership Record Date; provided, however, that in no event may a
Partner receive a distribution of Available Cash with respect to a
Class A Unit if a Partner is entitled to receive a distribution
with respect to a Share for which such Class A Unit has been
redeemed or exchanged.
E.     
Distributions With
Respect to LTIP Units . In accordance with Section
4.6.A , LTIP Unitholders shall be entitled to receive
distributions in an amount per LTIP Unit equal to the Class A Unit
Distribution.

 


25
 




 


 

Section 5.2     
Amounts
Withheld
All amounts withheld pursuant to
the Code or any provisions of any state or local tax law and
Section 10.5 with respect to any allocation, payment or
distribution to the General Partner, the Limited Partners or
Assignees shall be treated as amounts distributed to the General
Partner, Limited Partners or Assignees, as the case may be,
pursuant to Section 5.1 for all purposes under this
Agreement.
Section 5.3     
Distributions Upon
Liquidation
Proceeds from a Liquidating Event
shall be distributed to the Partners in accordance with Section
13.2 .

Partner.
ARTICLE VI 
 
ALLOCATIONS
Section 6.1     
Allocations for
Capital Account Purposes
For purposes of maintaining the
Capital Accounts and in determining the rights of the Partners
among themselves, the Partnership’s items of income, gain,
loss and deduction (computed in accordance with Exhibit
B ) shall be allocated among the Partners in each taxable
year (or portion thereof) as provided herein below.
A.     
Net
Income .
After giving effect to the special allocations set forth in
Section 1 of Exhibit C , Net Income shall be
allocated:

(1)     
first, to the General
Partner until the cumulative Net Income allocated under this clause
(1) equals the cumulative Net Losses allocated to the General
Partner under Section 6.1.B(6) ;

(2)     
second, to each DRO
Partner until the cumulative Net Income allocated to such DRO
Partner under this clause (2) equals the cumulative Net Losses
allocated to such DRO Partner under Section 6.1.B(5) (and
among the DRO Partners, pro rata in proportion to their respective
percentages of the cumulative Net Losses allocated to all DRO
Partners pursuant to Section 6.1.B(5) );

(3)     
third, to the General
Partner until the cumulative Net Income allocated under this clause
(3) equals the cumulative Net Losses allocated the General Partner
under Section 6.1.B(4) ;

 


26
 




 


 


(4)     
fourth, to the holders
of any Partnership Interests that are entitled to any preference
upon liquidation until the cumulative Net Income allocated under
this clause (4) equals the cumulative Net Losses allocated to such
Partners under Section 6.1.B(3) ;

(5)     
fifth, to the holders
of any Partnership Interests that are entitled to any preference in
distribution in accordance with the rights of any such class of
Partnership Interests until each such Partnership Interest has been
allocated, on a cumulative basis pursuant to this clause (5), Net
Income equal to the amount of distributions payable that are
attributable to the preference of such class of Partnership
Interests whether or not paid (and, within such class, pro rata in
proportion to the respective Percentage Interests as of the last
day of the period for which such allocation is being
made);

(6)     
sixth, to the holders
of any Partnership Interests that are not entitled to any
preference upon liquidation until the cumulative Net Income
allocated under this clause (6) equals the cumulative Net Loss
allocated to such Partners under Section 6.1.B(2); and

(7)     
finally, with respect
to Partnership Interests that are not entitled to any preference in
distribution or with respect to which distributions are not limited
to any preference in distribution, pro rata to each such class in
accordance with the terms of such class (and, within such class,
pro rata in proportion to the respective Percentage Interests as of
the last day of the period for which such allocation is being
made).
B.     
Net
Losses .
After giving effect to the special allocations set forth in
Section 1 of Exhibit C , Net Losses shall be
allocated:

(1)     
first, to the holders
of Partnership Interests, in proportion to, and to the extent that,
their share of the Net Income previously allocated pursuant to
Section 6.1.A(7) exceeds, on a cumulative basis, the sum of
(a) distributions with respect to such Partnership Interests
pursuant to clause (ii) of Section 5.1.B and (b) Net Losses
allocated under this clause (1);

(2)     
second, with respect to
classes of Partnership Interests that are not entitled to any
preference in distribution upon liquidation, pro rata to each such
class in accordance with the terms of such class (and, within such
class, pro rata in proportion to the respective Percentage
Interests as of the last day of the period for which such
allocation is being made); provided, however, that Net Losses shall
not be allocated to any Partner pursuant to this Section
6.1.B(2) to the extent that such allocation would cause such
Partner to have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit (or increase
any existing Adjusted Capital Account Deficit) (determined in each
case (i) by not including in the Partners’ Adjusted Capital
Accounts any amount that a Partner is obligated to contribute to
the Partnership with respect to any deficit in its Capital Account
pursuant to Section 13.3 and (ii) in the case of a Partner
who also holds classes of Partnership Interests that are entitled
to any preferences in distribution upon liquidation, by subtracting
from such Partners’ Adjusted Capital Account the amount of
such preferred distribution to be made upon liquidation) at the end
of such taxable year (or portion thereof);

(3)     
third, with respect to
classes of Partnership Interests that are entitled to any
preference in distribution upon liquidation, in reverse order of
the priorities of each such class

 


27
 




 


 


(and within each such
class, pro rata in proportion to their respective Percentage
Interests as of the last day of the period for which such
allocation is being made); provided, however, that Net Losses shall
not be allocated to any Partner pursuant to this Section
6.1.B(3) to the extent that such allocation would cause such
Partner to have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit (or increase
any existing Adjusted Capital Account Deficit) (determined in each
case by not including in the Partners’ Adjusted Capital
Accounts any amount that a Partner is obligated to contribute to
the Partnership with respect to any deficit in its Capital Account
pursuant to Section 13.3 ) at the end of such taxable year
(or portion thereof);

(4)     
fourth, to the General
Partner in an amount equal to the excess of (a) the amount of the
Partnership’s Recourse Liabilities over (b) the Aggregate DRO
Amount;

(5)     
fifth, to and among the
DRO Partners, in proportion to their respective DRO Amounts, until
such time as the DRO Partners as a group have been allocated
cumulative Net Losses pursuant to this clause (5) equal to the
Aggregate DRO Amount; and

(6)     
thereafter, to the
General Partner.
C.     
Allocation of
Nonrecourse Debt . For purposes of Regulation
Section 1.752-3(a), the Partners agree that Nonrecourse Liabilities
of the Partnership in excess of the sum of (i) the amount of
Partnership Minimum Gain and (ii) the total amount of Nonrecourse
Built-in Gain shall be allocated by the General Partner by taking
into account facts and circumstances relating to each
Partner’s respective interest in the profits of the
Partnership unless and to the extent provided otherwise in an
agreement between any Partner and the Partnership. For this
purpose, the General Partner shall have the sole and absolute
discretion in any Fiscal Year to allocate such excess Nonrecourse
Liabilities among the Partners in any manner permitted under Code
Section 752 and the Regulations thereunder.
D.     
Recapture
Income . Any
gain allocated to the Partners upon the sale or other taxable
disposition of any Partnership asset shall, to the extent possible
after taking into account other required allocations of gain
pursuant to Exhibit C , be characterized as Recapture
Income in the same proportions and to the same extent as such
Partners have been allocated any deductions directly or indirectly
giving rise to the treatment of such gains as Recapture
Income.
E.     
Special Allocations
Regarding LTIP Units . Notwithstanding the provisions of
Section 6.1.A , Liquidating Gains shall first be allocated
to the LTIP Unitholders until their Economic Capital Account
Balances, to the extent attributable to their ownership of LTIP
Units, are equal to (i) the Class A Unit Economic Balance,
multiplied by (ii) the number of their LTIP Units. For this
purpose, “ Liquidating Gains ” means net
gains that are or would be realized in connection with the actual
or hypothetical sale of all or substantially all of the assets of
the Partnership, including, without limitation, net capital gain
realized in connection with an adjustment to the value of
Partnership assets under Section 704(b) of the Code made pursuant
to Section 1.D of Exhibit B of the Partnership
Agreement. The “ Economic Capital Account
Balances ” of the LTIP Unitholders will be equal to
their Capital Account balances to the extent attributable to their
ownership of LTIP Units. Similarly, the “ Class A Unit
Economic Balance ” shall mean (i) the Capital Account
balance of the Parent, plus the amount of the Parent’s share
of any Partner Minimum Gain or Partnership Minimum Gain,

 


28
 




 


 


in either case to the
extent attributable to the Parent’s ownership of Class A
Units and computed on a hypothetical basis after taking into
account all allocations through the date on which any allocation is
made under this Section 6.1.E , but prior to the realization
of any Liquidating Gains, divided by (ii) the number of the
Parent’s Class A Units. Any such allocations shall be made
among the LTIP Unitholders in proportion to the amounts required to
be allocated to each under this Section 6.1.E . The parties
agree that the intent of this Section 6.1.E is to make the
Capital Account balance associated with each LTIP Unit to be
economically equivalent to the Capital Account balance associated
with the Parent’s Class A Units (on a per-Unit basis),
provided that Liquidating Gains are of a sufficient magnitude to do
so upon a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Partnership, or upon an adjustment to the Partners’ Capital
Accounts pursuant to Section 1.D of Exhibit B
. To the extent the LTIP Unitholders receive a distribution in
excess of their Capital Accounts, such distribution will be a
guaranteed payment under Section 707(c) of the Code.
F.     
Special Allocations
in Connection with a Liquidity Event . The Partners intend that the
allocation of Net Profits, Net Losses and other items of income,
gain, loss, deduction and credit required to be allocated to the
Capital Accounts of the Partners pursuant to this Agreement will
result in final Capital Account balances that will permit the
amount each Partner is entitled to receive upon
“liquidation” of the Partnership (within the meaning of
Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(g) of the Treasury Regulations) to equal
the amount such Partner would have received if such amount was
distributable solely pursuant to the priorities set forth in
Article V , as applicable, and Section 13.2.A(1) -
(4) (and, for the avoidance of doubt, taking into account any
applicable DRO Amounts). Accordingly, notwithstanding the
provisions of Section 6.1.A and Section 6.1.B , in
the taxable year of the event precipitating a Liquidity Event and
thereafter, appropriate adjustments to allocations of Net Profits
and Net Losses to the Partners shall be made to achieve such
result.
Section 6.2     
Revisions to
Allocations to Reflect Issuance of Partnership Interests or Certain
DRO Obligations
A.     
Issuances of
Partnership Interests . If the Partnership issues
Partnership Interests pursuant to Article IV , the General
Partner shall make such revisions to this Article VI and the
Partner Registry in the books and records of the Partnership as it
deems necessary to reflect the terms of the issuance of such
Partnership Interests, including making preferential allocations to
classes of Partnership Interests that are entitled thereto. Such
revisions shall not require the consent or approval of any other
Partner.
B.     
Certain DRO
Obligations . If a DRO Partner has agreed and
is obligated to restore the deficit balance in such Partner’s
Capital Account upon the occurrence of certain events, and such
obligation is inconsistent with the allocation of Net Losses that
otherwise would apply to such Partner as a DRO Partner pursuant to
this Article VI (for example, because the DRO Partner has agreed to
bear Net Losses in a manner pari passu with the General
Partner), the General Partner shall make such revisions to this
Article VI as it deems necessary to reflect the terms of such
obligation, including with respect to the order of allocation of
Net Losses with respect to such Partner. Such revisions shall not
require the consent or approval of any other Partner.

general partner of the Partnership.
B.     
Responsibility for
Partnership and General Partner Expenses . The Partnership shall be

General Partner and to the management and administration of any
Subsidiaries of the General Partner or the Partnership or
Affiliates of the Partnership, such as auditing expenses and filing

reimbursement shall be reduced by (x) any interest earned by the
General Partner with respect to bank accounts or other instruments
or accounts held by it on behalf of the Partnership as permitted in
Section 7.5.A (which interest is considered to belong to the
Partnership and shall be paid over to the Partnership to the extent
not applied to reimburse the General Partner for expenses
hereunder); and (y) any amount derived by the General Partner from
any investments permitted in Section 7.5.A ; (ii) the
Partnership shall not be responsible for any taxes that the General
Partner would not have been required to pay if the General Partner
qualified as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes or any
taxes imposed on the General Partner by reason of the General
Partner’s failure to distribute to its shareholders an amount
equal to its taxable income; (iii) the Partnership shall not be
responsible for expenses or liabilities incurred by the General
