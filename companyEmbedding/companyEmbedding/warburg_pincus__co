Post the transaction, Tata Motors and affiliates of the Tata Group will continue to retain a significant minority interest of approximately 43% in Tata Technologies, with the remaining ownership held by the management team and other shareholders.

Ramakrishnan, Group CFO, Tata Motors. Mr. Ramakrishnan added, “We look forward to partnering with Warburg Pincus and achieving greater heights for the Company and all its stakeholders.”
“Tata Technologies is widely acknowledged for its superior service offerings and its industry leading engineering capabilities. The Company has demonstrated the ability to scale accounts in a competitive industry by becoming embedded in the manufacturing and product development process of its customers. We are delighted to be partnering with the Tata Group to support the continued growth and development of the Company.

“This investment is a testament to our achievements to date and, more importantly, of our great potential moving forward,” said Tata Technologies CEO and MD Warren Harris. “As the engineering services outsourcing (ESO) market has matured from cost arbitrage and staff augmentation to increasingly high-end, strategic work, Tata Technologies has been there leading the charge. With the perspective and insights that Warburg Pincus offers as a premier global private equity firm, we are confident we will not only continue moving up the value chain, but materially accelerate our growth journey.”
“Tata Technologies has demonstrated over the past six years of our investment, a high quality engineering services solution appreciated by its marquee client base.

Geek+ Receives $60 Million Series B Investment Led by Warburg Pincus

BEIJING, July 13, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Geek+ (www.geekplus.com.cn), a leading robot company in China, today announced it has received US$60 million in Series B financing. This new round of financing is led by an affiliate of Warburg Pincus, a leading global private equity firm focused on growth investing, and participated by existing shareholders including Volcanics Venture. This is the largest single round of fundraising in the logistics robot industry globally to date.
Founded in early 2015, Geek+ provides one-stop intelligent logistics robot solutions to customers. Enabled by artificial intelligence ("AI") and robot technologies, Geek+'s solutions cover storage, order picking, material handling and parcel sorting. The company's solutions can perform a wide range of functions such as order division and consolidation, intelligent inventory replenishment and products return, SKU correlation analysis, robots routes optimization, automated collision and congestion control, and dynamic shelf optimization. 
Geek+ has delivered the largest numbers of logistics robots among its peers in China.  The company's customers include e-commerce platforms, third-party logistics providers, express delivery companies, offline retailers and manufacturers of apparels, pharmaceuticals, automobiles and electronics products. Geek+ has also established strategic partnerships with a number of key customers to co-develop customized AI and robotic solutions across different industries and applications.
Mr. Yong Zheng, Founder and CEO of Geek+, said: "This round of financing will help us upgrade our business in three aspects. Firstly, we will accelerate the upgrading of our logistics robotics products and expand product offerings to cover more applications. Secondly, we will accelerate our geographical expansion and industry coverage to provide our one-stop intelligent logistics system and operation solutions to more customers. Thirdly, we will start exploring overseas markets through multiple channels."
As a leading player of logistics robotics technologies, Geek+ has significant advantages in technology capability, product performance and market share compared to industry peers. To date, Geek+ has delivered nearly 1,000 units of robots in warehouses for over 20 customers including Tmall, VIPShop and Suning.                      
Geek+ is the largest logistics robot company in China. It also operates the single largest robot warehouse in China with the most number of robots in operation and the highest processing volume. The company has successfully supported its e-commerce customers seamlessly complete their warehouse operations during major e-commerce promotion campaigns such as "November 11th Singles' Day" and "June 18th Shopping Day" in China. Geek+ expects to finish deliveries of 2,000 robot units by end of 2017.
"Our intelligent logistics robotic solutions have great flexibility and scalability. They help customers achieve agility in logistics and mitigate investment risks by quickly responding to fluctuating order volume, often caused by constantly changing market environment. With the explosive growth of customer demand for logistics robots, Geek+ will continue to work closely with our business partners to drive the application of AI technologies across the whole logistics value chain," added Mr. Zheng.
The institutional investors of Geek+ will remain as financial investors after this round of financing. The strong capital support will further enable Geek+ to provide professional, stable and high-quality services as an independent service provider.     
Mr. Jericho Zhang, Principal of Warburg Pincus, commented: "As the AI technologies are maturing, we are seeing increasing market demand and new applications. In particular, the traditional, capital-intensive and labor-intensive logistics industry provides huge market potential for AI technologies. With the rapid development of China's e-commerce industry, China's warehouse management industry is undergoing transformational changes. More complex warehouse operations and increasing costs are spurring demand for AI-enabled solutions, particularly logistics robots."
"The use of AI solutions and logistics robots has clear advantages in cost, efficiency and flexibility over manual warehouse management and other automation technologies. Geek+'s team has industry-leading technological capability and a deep understanding of logistics operation. We will leverage our experience and resources in the logistics and technology sectors to support Geek+'s business expansion, and help build Geek+ into a global leader in artificial intelligence," added Mr. Zhang. 
Warburg Pincus is a global private equity firm focused on growth investing. Since 1994, the firm has invested more than $7 billion in nearly 100 companies in China. The investment in Geek+ is Warburg Pincus' first investment in the AI sector in China. Warburg Pincus is one of the most experienced investors in China's logistics industry, and its current portfolio companies include ZTO Express, ANE Logistics, Yunniao Technology and ESR Group in China. Machine learning and AI have been a key recent focus of the Warburg Pincus' technology practice.  The firm has invested in mobile endpoint security service provider Zimperium, leading speech recognition and transcription provider Nuance, compensation data vendor Payscale, student analytics provider Civitas and computer vision company Trax.

Founding and early history[edit]
In 1939 Eric Warburg of the Warburg banking family founded a company under the name E.M. Warburg & Co. Its first address was 52 William Street, New York, the Kuhn Loeb building. Throughout the early post-war period, the firm was a small office of 20 employees. In 1966, E.M. Warburg merged with Lionel I. Pincus & Co, forming a new company that eventually became known as E.M. Warburg, Pincus & Co.[11] In 1965, when Eric Warburg retired to Germany, control was handed to Lionel Pincus, a partner in the Ladenburg Thalmann investment bank, and the working language of the office switched from German to English. Lionel ran the company from 1966 to 2002, and died in 2009. [12]
Warburg Pincus began investing in Europe in 1983 and opened its first office in Asia in 1994. It has invested more than $5 billion in Europe; more than $3 billion in India[13] and more than $3.3 billion in China. The firm is headquartered in New York and has offices in Beijing, Hong Kong, London, Mumbai, San Francisco, São Paulo, Shanghai and Singapore, with administrative offices in Amsterdam, Luxembourg and Mauritius.[14]
The firm is structured as a global partnership led by co-presidents Charles Kaye and Joseph Landy.[15] Kaye has been with Warburg Pincus since 1986 and worked to launch the Asian operations. Landy has been with the firm since 1985, focusing on investments in information technology, communications applications and structured investments. Approximately 35% of the firm’s investments are outside of the U.S.[16]
Initial public offerings[edit]
Warburg Pincus has completed more initial public offerings with its companies than any other global private equity firm.[17] More than 140 Warburg Pincus companies have listed on exchanges, raising approximately $30 billion in public markets.[18] In each of these IPOs, the firm was the principal financial investor in the portfolio company. The companies have listed on 13 exchanges, including at least 30 IPOs outside the U.S. In August 2010, a six-year partnership between management and Warburg Pincus led to MEG Energy’s successful IPO.[19]
Venture capital[edit]
Warburg Pincus has a history of venture capital investing. The firm is a founding member of the venture capital associations in the U.S. and China, and offers a global entrepreneur in residence program to help start up new businesses.[citation needed]
In October 2014, Reuters reported that Warburg Pincus had raised $4 billion for its first energy-focused private equity fund.[20]
Growth capital[edit]
Warburg Pincus has invested in companies such as Harbin Pharmaceutical in China,[21] Bharti Telecommunications in India, AmRest in Poland[22] and Nuance Communications in the U.S.[23] In Bharti Airtel, Warburg Pincus had invested $292 million across multiple tranches and exited with $1.9 billion in 2005, which is considered to be the largest Private Equity exit in India.[24]
Fight over the Warburg name[edit]
During the post-war period, Eric Warburg vied with his cousin Siegmund Warburg, founder of S.G. Warburg, over the use of the Warburg name in New York. Siegmund wished to expand the S.G. Warburg franchise into New York but was blocked by the existence of E.M. Warburg & Co. Following the effective sale of the business to Pincus, Siegmund Warburg accused Eric of prostituting the Warburg name. "Complicating matters was that Siegmund thought Pincus the wrong kind of Jew - of Eastern European ancestry, with a garment-district background. Professionally, he thought Pincus well below haute banque stature in the venture capital world."[25]
In January 1970, Siegmund finally got the name changed to E.M. Warburg, Pincus & Company to differentiate it from S.G. Warburg & Company. "In the end, however, Lionel Pincus had the last laugh on Siegmund. He expanded Eric's tiny firm into a giant, thriving business, with three and a half billion dollars of venture capital partnerships."[25]
In 1999, they attempted to purchase English Premier League football (soccer) team Everton.[26]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Founding and early history[edit]
In 1939 Eric Warburg of the Warburg banking family founded a company under the name E.M. Warburg & Co. Its first address was 52 William Street, New York, the Kuhn Loeb building. Throughout the early post-war period, the firm was a small office of 20 employees. In 1966, E.M. Warburg merged with Lionel I. Pincus & Co, forming a new company that eventually became known as E.M. Warburg, Pincus & Co.[11] In 1965, when Eric Warburg retired to Germany, control was handed to Lionel Pincus, a partner in the Ladenburg Thalmann investment bank, and the working language of the office switched from German to English. Lionel ran the company from 1966 to 2002, and died in 2009. [12]
Warburg Pincus began investing in Europe in 1983 and opened its first office in Asia in 1994. It has invested more than $5 billion in Europe; more than $3 billion in India[13] and more than $3.3 billion in China. The firm is headquartered in New York and has offices in Beijing, Hong Kong, London, Mumbai, San Francisco, São Paulo, Shanghai and Singapore, with administrative offices in Amsterdam, Luxembourg and Mauritius.[14]
The firm is structured as a global partnership led by co-presidents Charles Kaye and Joseph Landy.[15] Kaye has been with Warburg Pincus since 1986 and worked to launch the Asian operations. Landy has been with the firm since 1985, focusing on investments in information technology, communications applications and structured investments. Approximately 35% of the firm’s investments are outside of the U.S.[16]
Initial public offerings[edit]
Warburg Pincus has completed more initial public offerings with its companies than any other global private equity firm.[17] More than 140 Warburg Pincus companies have listed on exchanges, raising approximately $30 billion in public markets.[18] In each of these IPOs, the firm was the principal financial investor in the portfolio company. The companies have listed on 13 exchanges, including at least 30 IPOs outside the U.S. In August 2010, a six-year partnership between management and Warburg Pincus led to MEG Energy’s successful IPO.[19]
Venture capital[edit]
Warburg Pincus has a history of venture capital investing. The firm is a founding member of the venture capital associations in the U.S. and China, and offers a global entrepreneur in residence program to help start up new businesses.[citation needed]
In October 2014, Reuters reported that Warburg Pincus had raised $4 billion for its first energy-focused private equity fund.[20]
Growth capital[edit]
Warburg Pincus has invested in companies such as Harbin Pharmaceutical in China,[21] Bharti Telecommunications in India, AmRest in Poland[22] and Nuance Communications in the U.S.[23] In Bharti Airtel, Warburg Pincus had invested $292 million across multiple tranches and exited with $1.9 billion in 2005, which is considered to be the largest Private Equity exit in India.[24]
Fight over the Warburg name[edit]
During the post-war period, Eric Warburg vied with his cousin Siegmund Warburg, founder of S.G. Warburg, over the use of the Warburg name in New York. Siegmund wished to expand the S.G. Warburg franchise into New York but was blocked by the existence of E.M. Warburg & Co. Following the effective sale of the business to Pincus, Siegmund Warburg accused Eric of prostituting the Warburg name. "Complicating matters was that Siegmund thought Pincus the wrong kind of Jew - of Eastern European ancestry, with a garment-district background. Professionally, he thought Pincus well below haute banque stature in the venture capital world."[25]
In January 1970, Siegmund finally got the name changed to E.M. Warburg, Pincus & Company to differentiate it from S.G. Warburg & Company. "In the end, however, Lionel Pincus had the last laugh on Siegmund. He expanded Eric's tiny firm into a giant, thriving business, with three and a half billion dollars of venture capital partnerships."[25]
In 1999, they attempted to purchase English Premier League football (soccer) team Everton.[26]

Founding and early history[edit]
In 1939 Eric Warburg of the Warburg banking family founded a company under the name E.M. Warburg & Co. Its first address was 52 William Street, New York, the Kuhn Loeb building. Throughout the early post-war period, the firm was a small office of 20 employees. In 1966, E.M. Warburg merged with Lionel I. Pincus & Co, forming a new company that eventually became known as E.M. Warburg, Pincus & Co.[11] In 1965, when Eric Warburg retired to Germany, control was handed to Lionel Pincus, a partner in the Ladenburg Thalmann investment bank, and the working language of the office switched from German to English. Lionel ran the company from 1966 to 2002, and died in 2009. [12]
Warburg Pincus began investing in Europe in 1983 and opened its first office in Asia in 1994. It has invested more than $5 billion in Europe; more than $3 billion in India[13] and more than $3.3 billion in China. The firm is headquartered in New York and has offices in Beijing, Hong Kong, London, Mumbai, San Francisco, São Paulo, Shanghai and Singapore, with administrative offices in Amsterdam, Luxembourg and Mauritius.[14]
The firm is structured as a global partnership led by co-presidents Charles Kaye and Joseph Landy.[15] Kaye has been with Warburg Pincus since 1986 and worked to launch the Asian operations. Landy has been with the firm since 1985, focusing on investments in information technology, communications applications and structured investments. Approximately 35% of the firm’s investments are outside of the U.S.[16]
Initial public offerings[edit]
Warburg Pincus has completed more initial public offerings with its companies than any other global private equity firm.[17] More than 140 Warburg Pincus companies have listed on exchanges, raising approximately $30 billion in public markets.[18] In each of these IPOs, the firm was the principal financial investor in the portfolio company. The companies have listed on 13 exchanges, including at least 30 IPOs outside the U.S. In August 2010, a six-year partnership between management and Warburg Pincus led to MEG Energy’s successful IPO.[19]
Venture capital[edit]
Warburg Pincus has a history of venture capital investing. The firm is a founding member of the venture capital associations in the U.S. and China, and offers a global entrepreneur in residence program to help start up new businesses.[citation needed]
In October 2014, Reuters reported that Warburg Pincus had raised $4 billion for its first energy-focused private equity fund.[20]
Growth capital[edit]
Warburg Pincus has invested in companies such as Harbin Pharmaceutical in China,[21] Bharti Telecommunications in India, AmRest in Poland[22] and Nuance Communications in the U.S.[23] In Bharti Airtel, Warburg Pincus had invested $292 million across multiple tranches and exited with $1.9 billion in 2005, which is considered to be the largest Private Equity exit in India.[24]
Fight over the Warburg name[edit]
During the post-war period, Eric Warburg vied with his cousin Siegmund Warburg, founder of S.G. Warburg, over the use of the Warburg name in New York. Siegmund wished to expand the S.G. Warburg franchise into New York but was blocked by the existence of E.M. Warburg & Co. Following the effective sale of the business to Pincus, Siegmund Warburg accused Eric of prostituting the Warburg name. "Complicating matters was that Siegmund thought Pincus the wrong kind of Jew - of Eastern European ancestry, with a garment-district background. Professionally, he thought Pincus well below haute banque stature in the venture capital world."[25]
In January 1970, Siegmund finally got the name changed to E.M. Warburg, Pincus & Company to differentiate it from S.G. Warburg & Company. "In the end, however, Lionel Pincus had the last laugh on Siegmund. He expanded Eric's tiny firm into a giant, thriving business, with three and a half billion dollars of venture capital partnerships."[25]
In 1999, they attempted to purchase English Premier League football (soccer) team Everton.[26]

The company’s award-winning flagship product EMA™, is a mobile, cloud-based, specialty-specific electronic health record (EHR) system that is used by thousands of specialty practices nationwide.Modernizing Medicine’s success can be attributed to its development of technology to support the unique needs of physicians in surgical and medical specialties.

This is the seventh consecutive year that the gGastro™ gastroenterology EHR system ranked first, and the fourth consecutive year that the EMA™ dermatology EHR system earned the top spot.
