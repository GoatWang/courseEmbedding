About Us

Western Pacific Trust Company is a unique independent trust company which has been a trusted financial services provider to corporations and individuals since 1999.
Consolidation in this industry has led to the existence of fewer and larger financial institutions in today’s market place. That concentration has created a niche market for Western Pacific Trust Company, which caters specifically to the private capital markets, and offers clients competitive, responsive and knowledgeable service on a consistent basis.
The shares of WPTC are listed on the TSX Venture Exchange under the trading symbol “WP”.

Some of our clients receive SEO services from us and others simply have us act as their "virtual webmaster," with complete responsibility for the performance and "health" of their websites. In all cases, we are relying upon WPEngine to provide a highly-performant, very stable, full featured managed WordPress hosting platform as well as stellar 24x7 tech support.ProsWPEngine's servers provide extremely fast page load times using a combination of high-speed server hardware and software along with an excellent CDN and top notch caching software.WPEngine provides a long list of other tools besides hosting, tools that help me spend minimum time to get maximum results, including staging servers, automatic and ad hoc backups of both production and staging servers, easy-to-implement SSL and more.WPEngine's tech support personnel and systems are the best I have ever seen for hosting providers.ConsSimply stated, I cannot think of any areas for meaningful improvement. They just simply work, and work extremely well for us.Likelihood to Recommend10.0On a multiple-site, multiple-install basis, WPEngine is very fairly priced, for the value that it provides. If you're only hosting one site, the cost is a little higher and therefore harder to sustain on a long term basis.from Tim Colling's Full Review (2 More Sections)Robert AllenWordPress Developer | Design | 1-10 employeesUser Review: "Start your WP Engines!"9 of 10  |  6/11/2016Invited By: TrustRadius | Incentive: YesUse Cases and Deployment ScopeWe use WP Engine as a host for client sites when their needs justify the feature set. For our high-end clients, having a managed host is the obvious choice, and WP Engine is priced as the premium provider of those services. For clients looking to make a living from their website, the security and stability of WP Engine makes it an essential tool.ProsWP Engine makes development incredibly easy with their built-in live/staging server features.WP Engine handles backups and some software updates automatically, which reduces the amount of manual management dramatically.ConsThe user interface is not very intuitive, which means new staff members require more training than I'd like.The way they manage production/development servers and FTP access is somewhere between nebulous and tragically unique.Their premium pricing is surely worthwhile, but it is significantly higher than virtually all of their competitors, without much obvious distinction in feature sets.Some very basic features like spinning up a second instance require a PHONE CALL to their BILLING department to enable. What is this, 1990?Likelihood to Recommend9.0We recommend WP Engine for clients who intend to use their site to make a living, who want reliability and uptime they can count on, and who don't want to worry about hiring server security or upkeep experts. The cost savings of using WP Engine over hiring a server security expert is justification alone. However, for clients who want a simple site hosted as a 'brochure' for their services or cost is a constraint, we recommend using DigitalOcean.from Robert Allen's Full Review (3 More Sections)Fareed AbolhassaniInformation Technology Manager | Information Technology and Services | 51-200 employeesWP Engine Review: "WordPress Engine"8 of 10  |  6/10/2016Invited By: TrustRadius | Incentive: YesUse Cases and Deployment ScopeWP Engine is currently being used for my personal portfolio website.ProsFree data backup & restoreHacked site fixed at no chargeGreat security & speedGreat developer friendly toolsConsIf you exceed the set number of visitors it will result in additional feesNot applicable for non-WP platformsLimited versatilityPriceLikelihood to Recommend8.0If you're someone who doesn't care about price but cares about performance and quality, then WP Engine is perfect for you.from Fareed Abolhassani's Full Review (2 More Sections)Joe PrestonE-Commerce manager | Retail | 11-50 employeesUser Review: "WP Engine - They Stay Up And Running"7 of 10  |  11/19/2014Invited By: TrustRadiusUse Cases and Deployment ScopeWP Engine was the blog host for a busy corporate blog. We migrated there from shared hosting. There was not a lot of PHP expertise in the organization, or experience with self-managed web hosting, so WP-Engine was an appealing alternative at the price point and level of service. After several outages and configuration problems with shared hosting and the collective "Welp" from the development staff, I decided an upgrade was necessary.ProsGreat reliabilityGreat CommunicationA point of view and demonstrated expertise with the unique challenges of WordPress.Dedicated to WordPress, servers optimally tuned to take advantage of WordPress use cases.ConsThey changed our pricing and charged the card without informing me in advance. They made good on that, but that was kind of a "Huh?" moment for me (and the accounting department).Their attitude about plugin management, including the global restriction of some plugins to optimize for the WPEngine experience across all clients, is quite different from most blog hosts and takes some getting used to. Reducing the flexibility of WordPress is crippling one of WordPress's key business advantages.Overage charges! Overage charges combined with restricting plugins in part due to bandwidth concerns. That's two levels of reduced service to me, for the good of the community-at-large (or is it for the good of WP Engine?). Overall, these three points coordinate into a story about WP Engine that suggests they don't really have the Customer Experience on the same priority as micromanaging the return per customer.Likelihood to Recommend7.0If you are sitting on a huge bucket of money; your boss decrees "It shall be WordPress", and you don't have experienced Apache server admins - man, save yourself 17 headaches and run to WP Engine.from Joe Preston's Full Review (9 More Sections)WP Engine Rating SummaryOverall Rating (7)9.2Likelihood to Recommend (4)9.1Likelihood to Renew (1)3.0Support (1)9.0WP Engine DescriptionWP Engine is a fully-managed WordPress hosted solution. One of its main features is the capability to create a staging site. It also offers curated recommendations for plugins and themes. Hosting through WP Engine delivers Wordpress along with extra security features and curation of plugins and themes for help with site optimization; also EverCache Technology, the WP Engine custom-built caching technology to speed the delivery of content.Pricing for hosting starts at $29 for a personal site (10GB of local storage, unlimited data transfer with up to 25k visits per month, $99 for Professional hosting services (10 WP installs, 10k visits per month, and 20GB of local storage), $249 for Business hosting (25WP installs, 400k visits per month and 30GB of storage), and the custom-tailored Enterprise level. A 60-day trial is available, during which a refund may be requested if the user is not happy with the hosting service.Categories:  Website Hosting PricingFree Trial Available? YesFree or Freemium Version Available? NoPremium Consulting/Integration Services Available?  NoEntry-level set up fee? NoWP Engine Technical DetailsOperating Systems: UnspecifiedMobile Application:NoAlternatives to WP EnginePantheon+CompareWordPress+CompareEktron+CompareTemplateToaster+CompareHostGator+CompareCompare WP Engine to ...More InformationWP Engine  Product DetailsAlternatives to WP EngineAll Website Hosting ServicesAbout UsFor VendorsTerms of UseSecurityPrivacyTwitterBlogLinkedIn™© Copyright 2013-2017 TrustRadius                         “Trust,” the first app from The Coral Project, debuts - The Washington Post                                                                    2         Desktop notifications are on   | Turn off      Get breaking news alerts from  The Washington Post   Turn on desktop notifications?

Sign up   *Invalid email address   Got it   Got it                 By WashPostPR  By WashPostPR  March 14, 2016       In a guest blog post, The Post’s Director of Digital News Projects Greg Barber discusses a new demo release of Trust, the first app from The Coral Project, a collaboration between The Post, The New York Times, and the Mozilla Foundation that is focused on creating an open-source community platform for publishers and is funded by a grant from the Knight Foundation. Read on for Barber’s post: Digital communities are havens of rich, illuminating data: comments, replies, shares, deletes, positive and negative reactions — all of which cascades to create live streams of conversation that at their best can elucidate and inspire. It’s that data that The Coral Project team is unlocking in our new Trust product, shown publicly for the first time today at the SXSW Interactive festival in Austin, Texas. Our project’s overall goal is to help publishers build and enliven communities around their journalism through open-source software and renewed best practices. The Trust app is our first step toward that goal. The Trust app aims to scale the moderation of user-generated contributions by focusing on the user’s history of contributions in addition to moderating individual contributions themselves. Through Trust, publishers can categorize users in two ways: persistent tags (examples: this user is a medical doctor; this user’s comments have been featured in an article) and dynamic lists — groups that allow publishers to tee up groups of users based on their contribution history. For example, if a publisher wanted to find new users in the politics section who prompted conversation without violating the site’s discussion policy, they could use this recipe: Total comments = less than 10; total replies received = more than 5; comments deleted = 0. The Trust app would serve up users who fit that description — and it could continue to do so dynamically without further action from the publisher. Trust is the first in a set of software applications that The Coral Project will release in beta form this year. We’ll be working with teams at The Post, The Times, and other newsrooms to test the app and refine it before releasing it more widely. Anyone who is interested in contributing to The Coral Project, or learning more about it, is welcome to participate in our community, read our blog, or explore our Github. We’ve recently released a set of personas — archetypes that put a face on the people we’ve met and use cases we’ve gathered in more than 300 interviews with people from nearly 150 news organizations in 30 countries. The Coral Project’s software development is a true team effort, involving developers, designers, and strategists from The Post, The Times, and Mozilla, and suggestions from people the world over.

8 Tips for Building Trust in Your Product


Building trust in your product is a long process, but it's an investment that always pays off.






 By Ken Lin


Ken Lin is the Chief Executive Officer and founder of Credit Karma. Ken started Credit Karma with a mission to change how people interact with their finances, making it easier to manage and more transparent.

WRITE A COMMENT

In business, trust is earned and not given. When consumers trust your product, they're happier and more engaged. User acquisition becomes easier. You put yourself in a position to make a real difference. However, trust can be elusive. It is tricky to build and easily lost.
When Credit Karma was founded we were trying to offer free credit information in an industry where such promises usually resulted in fees and conditions, to the endless frustration of consumers.
Rather than serving as a business constraint, this ended up doing us a favor, setting out a path for us for what not to do. The mistakes of companies before us meant our margin for error was small, but served as a guide in how to gain and keep our members' trust.
Communicate how you are different
Know your story and tell it well. Stress what is different about your company. We started Credit Karma in 2007 to deliver transparency and offer free credit scores, in a market where there was no such thing. Sites would market themselves as free while requiring their membership to enter costly subscription programs. Immediately, we focused on communicating what elevated us. We emphasized that no credit card would be needed, because other "free" sites needed one to use their service. We did everything to emphasize that we truly were free, to let people know this wasn't a trick.
Make trust a long-term investment
Trust doesn't happen overnight. It is a long process, filled with peaks and valleys. Your work is never over. I see companies trip up constantly in thinking that because they've done everything right this far, customers might not notice if they take shortcuts. Trust can be quickly undone, no matter how much hard work you put in. Prioritize it and invest in it for the long haul.
Your product has to back up the trust you're asking for
Communication and patience are easily touted, but your product needs to back it up. Every privacy policy and product feature needs to be developed with your credibility in mind. When people saw that Credit Karma was free, their next suspicion was that we were paying for it by selling our marketing lists to spammers. We don't sell or rent personal information to third parties for any purpose and make that clear all over our site. To relax on this would be to let all of our members down.
Get the word out
You need to be a storyteller for your point of difference. After we were founded, and as a team of just three with no marketing or PR associates, I made a commitment to write 20 bloggers a personal email each night to get them to try out our product. If they hated the product because it was bad, that was fine. (Luckily, no one did.) But it was important that we got the word out that we really were free and did what we said we do.
Prepare yourself that everyone is a cynic
If you're entering into a vertical that generates negative sentiments and has had bad press, you need to have a thick skin. The space Credit Karma was operating in had a terrible reputation when we launched. I had to reconcile myself that if I were an outsider here I would likely be thinking the same things. Everyone on the internet is a bit of a cynic. You need to take it with a grain of salt.
Don't sling mud
You may be bringing honesty and ethics into a space that desperately needed it, but you need to distance yourself from what came before. No one wins from mudslinging games. Rather than yell at somebody else, focus instead on talking about the positive attributes of your product and your ongoing vision. If other companies try and bring your product down, take it as a compliment that you're on their radars.
Always be proving yourself trustworthy
You need to live by the promises you make to your users. Everyday, I want to prove all over again to our members and my team that I'm worthy of their trust. If you betray that, it can follow you around for a long time.
In the long run, morals are the better business choice
Principles are easy when you're a new business with no customers. But to maintain trust you need to lay out your mission and use it as a moral compass for everything you do. You will reach points where you could make more money in the short-term at the cost of the consumer and the company's overall wellbeing. Ultimately though, sacrificing trust and goodwill for revenue in the short term will only serve to undercut the foundation of your company.

TWEAKS, SUPPORT REQUESTS & REASONABLE USE
Support must be requested through the proper channels to be received and responded to in a reasonable amount of time. To request support please email support@trustwp.com.
Each request for a WordPress Tweak is subject to a maximum of 45 minutes of development. The effort required for development is exclusively determined by the Trust WP management. For work outside of the scope of the Trust WP 45 minute development agreement (Single Tweak), Trust WP management will break it down to a series of single tweaks and send it back to you for confirmation before we proceed.  Trust WP also may provide alternative solutions to the client including referral to the Trust WP partner network for solutions.
Trust WP provides 24/7 support, but provides no guarantee either express or implied on the timeframe of when a support request can or will be resolved.
Your requests are subject to approval by Trust WP management or by its assigned agent.
NATURE OF TWEAKS
Tweaks should fall within the following categories.
•    UI troubleshooting (HTML, CSS, Javascript)
•    Styling elements with CSS
•    Content population & image manipulation
•    Creation of basic graphics (e.g. buttons, banners, etc.)
•    WordPress consulting (advice and support)
•    Optimization of CSS, Javascript and Images
•    Theme/plugin audits
•    Plugin installation and implementation
If you are unsure about whether or not a Tweak meets these criteria, submit it as a ticket to our support system and we will either accept the ticket or deny the ticket based on managerial approval.
Examples of Tweaks which shall not meet Trust WP management approval for support:
•    Website redesign
•    Landing page design
•    Custom plugin development
•    Custom theme development
•    Search marketing/SEO services
Any tweak deemed by Trust WP management to exceed 45 minutes effort, we will break it down to a series of single tweaks and send it back to you for confirmation before we proceed.
THIRD-PARTY MATERIALS
Certain services available may include materials from third parties. Trust WP may provide links to third-party websites as a convenience to you. You agree that Trust WP is not responsible for examining or evaluating the content or accuracy and does not warrant and will not have any liability or responsibility for any third-party materials or websites, or for any other materials, products, or services of third parties. You agree that you will not use any third-party materials in a manner that would infringe or violate the rights of any other party and that Trust WP is not in any way responsible for any such use by you.
Termination & Cancellation
Cancellation can occur at anytime. You’re never required to stay with us – in fact, we’d prefer you have the option to leave if you’re unhappy with our service and give us feedback on how we can serve you better.
Trust WP may terminate or suspend any and all Services and/or your Trust WP account immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms. Upon termination of your account, your right to use the Services will immediately cease. If you wish to terminate your Trust WP account, you must Contact us with your termination request at support@trustwp.com. All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.
You can contact us through the contact page or at support@trustwp.com.
PAYMENT
You agree that you will pay for the Services, and that Trust WP may charge your payment method for any services purchased and for any additional amounts (including any taxes and late fees, as applicable) that may be accrued by or in connection with your Account. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TIMELY PAYMENT OF ALL FEES AND FOR PROVIDING TRUST WP WITH A VALID PAYMENT METHOD FOR PAYMENT OF ALL FEES.
Your total price will include the price of the product but expressly excludes any applicable taxes; such service tax is based on the bill-to address and the applicable tax rate in effect at the time you use the Services. We will charge tax only in such jurisdictions where the Services are taxable.
Prices for the Services may change at any time at Trust WP’s sole and exclusive discretion. The Services do not provide price protection or refunds in the event of a price reduction or promotional offering.
Change
Trust WP reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace the terms at any time. If the alterations constitute a material change to the terms, Trust WP will notify you by posting an announcement on the site. What constitutes a material change will be determined at Trust WP’s sole discretion. You shall be responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any such modifications. Using any service or viewing any content following notification of a material change to the terms shall constitute your acceptance of the Terms as modified.
Miscellaneous
No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a result of the Terms and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind Trust WP in any respect whatsoever. The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. Trust WP shall not be liable for any failure to perform its obligations hereunder where such failure results from any cause beyond Trust WP’s reasonable control, including, without limitation, mechanical, electronic or communications failure or degradation (including “line-noise” interference). If any provision of the Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. Trust WP may transfer, assign or delegate the Terms and its rights and obligations without consent. The Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of The United States of America, as if made within California between two residents thereof, and the parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of California courts. Both parties agree that the Terms is the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of the Terms, and that all modifications must be in a writing signed by both parties, except as otherwise provided herein.
