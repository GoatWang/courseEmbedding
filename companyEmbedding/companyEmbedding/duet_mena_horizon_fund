Duet Marina Horizon Fund UCITS launches on Palaedino platform

Launches & Fundraising











Palaedino Fund (UCITS IV) and Duet MENA Limited (Duet) have launched the Duet Mena Horizon Fund UCITS, a long only equity fund targeting listed equities in the MENA region. 
The fund's strategy is underpinned by a strong focus on fundamental analysis adapted to exploit systematic inefficiencies that exist in the fund’s target markets. The strategy will deploy a combination of thematic idea generation and bottom up stock picking to generate a high conviction top ideas portfolio in the MENA region. The new UCITS fund will mirror the SIF fund that Duet has been managing since May 2011, which delivered c.20% annualised returns and a cumulative out-performance* of c.66% from inception to end of 2014. The new UCITS fund will be managed by the existing investment team at Duet, led by Hedi Ben Mlouka - CIO, and Ali Al Nasser - Fund Manager.
Alessandro Mauceri, Chairman of the Palaedino Fund Board, says: “We are excited to on-board Duet MENA Horizon as a new fund on our UCITS umbrella. The Investment Manager is well-recognized for its regional investment expertise, resulting in top quartile returns for its SIF fund. We are delighted to enter into this collaboration which marks a new milestone as this is the first emerging and new frontier markets strategy to be plugged into our UCITS umbrella”.
Hedi Ben Mlouka, Founding Partner and CIO at Duet, says: "We are glad to have launched a UCITS version of our existing Duet Mena Horizon Fund. The Fund will leverage Duet's regional infrastructure and on-the-ground resources which have catapulted Duet to a position of key player in the investment management space in the Middle East and North Africa region. The Fund team's track record is testament to its ability to generate returns in different market environments and reflects its deep understanding of the impact of local and global factors on the opportunity set and expected returns.”
Ali Al Nasser, Fund Manager at Duet, says: "MENA markets now represent less than 2% of most emerging market indices. We expect that to grow substantially in the coming few years, with improved accessibility, an increase in primary market activity and continued improvement in the corporate governance framework being key drivers. We believe our regional specialist model and benchmark agnostic security selection approach will continue to generate very unique and profitable investment opportunities for the Fund and provide a continuation of the return profile we have achieved for investors since inception.”
This is the seventh sub-fund of the Palaedino UCITS Platform, a Luxembourg SICAV established in November 2009.  The Management Company of the Platform is FundPartner Solutions (Europe) SA, a 100% affiliate of the Pictet Group based in Luxembourg.

Duet launches UCITS version of its MENA Horizon Fund

Duet Group, an alternative asset manager, has announced the launch of a UCITS version of its Duet MENA Horizon Fund, a long only equity fund focusing on investment opportunities in listed equities in the Middle East and North Africa region. 

Hedi Ben Mlouka, Founding Partner and CIO at Duet said: "We are glad to have launched a UCITS version of our existing Duet Mena Horizon Fund. The Fund will leverage Duet's regional infrastructure and on-the-ground resources which have catapulted Duet to a position of key player in the investment management space in the Middle East and North Africa region.” 

“The Fund team's track record is testament to its ability to generate returns in different market environments and reflects its deep understanding of the impact of local and global factors on the opportunity set and expected returns,” he said.

The UCITS fund will mirror the SIF fund that Duet has been managing since May 2011, which delivered around 20% annualized returns and a cumulative out-performance of approximately 66% from inception to end of 2014. 

The Fund will be managed by the existing investment team at Duet, led by CIO Hedi Ben Mlouka and fund manager Ali Al Nasser.

The fund's strategy will deploy a combination of thematic idea generation and bottom up stock picking to generate a high conviction top ideas portfolio in the MENA region.

Testimonials



I find AGF’s content to be well-written, interesting and highly informative. AGF is able to attract leading figures in the African fund market for exclusive insights and opinion articles that are difficult to find elsewhere.

Joe GreenwellBusiness Development Director - Augentius




Finding the news behind the news has always been the challenge, but Anna and her team always seem to pull it off. The AGF website, e-newsletter and monthly magazine are read by the whole Phatisa team; well-written, African private equity news not found elsewhere. We are proud to be affiliated with such a young, ambitious and driven media team and wish them only the best.

Stuart BradleyJoint Managing Partner - Phatisa




We find AGF a very useful publication, especially covering, as it does, all asset classes in Africa (as, uniquely, does Investec Asset Management).  The public funds data and macro stats are very useful, while the articles and interviews are insightful and often cover (in relative terms) neglected markets and asset classes.

Nick TimsManaging Director




I have found the AGF monthly magazine very informative and always containing some interesting research on the Private Equity industry not found elsewhere.

Emile Du ToitHead: PAIDF 2

Duet MENA Ltd lists its fund with EXANTE



EXANTE, the leading Hedge Fund Marketplace, has just listed Duet MENA Opportunities Fund and Duet MENA Horizon fund onto its platform. 

Duet MENA Opportunities is a long/short equity fund that seeks to generate superior risk adjusted returns with relatively low correlation to Middle East & North Africa equity and credit markets. The fund runs a quantitative momentum driven strategy and a fundamentally driven high conviction strategy.

 

Duet MENA Horizon is a long only equity fund that seeks to generate absolute and superior risk adjusted returns relative to MENA public equity indices. The fund extracts returns from MENA equity markets through a combination of thematic and bottom up fundamental analysis that results in a high conviction portfolio reflecting the team's top investment ideas in the MENA region.   

 

The Management Company Duet Group is a global alternative asset manager co-founded by Henry Gabay and Alain Schibl in 2002. Since its inception, the Duet Group has developed an established portfolio of products in areas of growing importance within the investing community, notably within the Emerging Markets. Duet’s Group investment teams are fully dedicated to their own strategies, and leverage their unique blend of experiences to find value for its investors in challenging market conditions. 

 

Units of the Duet MENA Opportunities Fund and Duet MENA Horizon Fund are available for trading on EXANTE's ATP as of today.
