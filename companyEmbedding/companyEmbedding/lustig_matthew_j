Explanation of Responses:

1. The Phantom Stock Units convert to Common Stock on a 1-for-1 basis.

2. The Phantom Stock Units are awarded under the Boston Properties, Inc. 2012 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the "2012 Plan") to non-employee directors who elected to receive Phantom Stock Units in lieu of director cash compensation fees. The Phantom Stock Units are to be settled in shares of Common Stock (except that fractional units, if any, will be settled in cash) upon the Reporting Person's retirement from the Boston Properties, Inc. Board of Directors.

3. Includes 26.80 Phantom Stock Units acquired as quarterly dividend equivalent rights on April 28, 2017. The rights were granted as a component of the Phantom Stock Units that were awarded under the Second Amendment and Restatement of the Boston Properties, Inc. 1997 Stock Option and Incentive Plan or, following May 15, 2012, under the 2012 Plan.
