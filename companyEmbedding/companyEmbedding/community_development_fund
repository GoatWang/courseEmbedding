 (HOUSING) Community Development Fund
Deadline: Rolling.
The Community Development Financial Institutions Fund makes capital grants, equity investments and awards for technical assistance to community development financial institutions (CDFIs).
More than 1,000 CDFIs serve economically distressed communities by providing credit, capital and financial services that often are unavailable from mainstream financial institutions. CDFIs have loaned and invested billions in the most distressed communities and helped ease homelessness while creating affordable housing.
Even better, the loans and investments have leveraged billions more dollars from the private sector for development activities in low-wealth communities across the nation. Insider's Tip: Since its inception, the fund has made more than $800 million in awards to community development organizations and financial institutions.

The CRA Triangle

Search this website





HomeThe CRA Triangle 

 

The best way to understand CRA is through The CRA Triangle below, first presented in Community Reinvestment Performance (Probus Publishing, Chicago, 1993). There are three corners of the CRA Triangle using the CRA acronym: C = Community groups, R = Regulators, and A = America’s banks and thrifts (see below). For CRA to properly work, there must be a constant dynamic of conflict and cooperation among these three corners, and this “dynamic tension” or give and take is critical to good CRA public policy. The CRA Triangle (and good CRA public policy) is distorted when two corners get too close to each other.

Dr. Kenneth H. Thomas and Senator William Proxmire, March 1995

Senator Proxmire was the Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee and is the “Father of CRA”.





















Senator Proxmire’s endorsement of Dr. Thomas’ first CRA book, Community Reinvestment Performance:















Dr. Thomas’ book, Community Reinvestment Performance, is far and away the best analysis of government regulation that I have seen in any field.  He spotlights the regulatory problems that continue in CRA and points out precisely how they are being overcome.  CRA will benefit enormously from this superlative examination and report.–William Proxmire















Historic Note: This was Senator Proxmire’s ONLY endorsement of any CRA publication.

Invest in The Community Development Fund
Community Development Fund Advisors is the registered investment adviser to The Community Development Fund (the “Fund”).  The Fund is an open-end, no-load, publicly traded mutual fund that offers daily liquidity. Its investment objective is to provide income consistent with the preservation of capital and investments that will be deemed to be qualified under The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, as amended (the CRA).  The Fund is only available to banks and thrifts to help them meet the requirements of the CRA which mandates that banks and thrifts make capital available to their entire community which they serve, including low- and moderate-income communities.
The Fund will invest primarily in securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or its agencies, and other investment grade fixed income securities; and may at times invest in securities rated below investment grade.  Under normal circumstances, the Fund will seek to invest at least 90% of its net assets in debt securities and other debt instruments that the Fund’s investment adviser believes will be CRA-qualifying.
There is no guarantee an investor will receive CRA credit for an investment in the Fund.  The Fund may hold short-term investments that produce relatively low yields, pending the selection of longer-term investments believed to be CRA-qualified.  The Fund may sell investments for CRA purposes at times when such sales may not be desirable for investment purposes.  An investment in this Fund is subject to leverage and interest rate risk, the credit risk of the issuers and the risks of investing in Asset-Backed Securities, Convertible Securities, Corporate Fixed Income Securities, Derivatives, and ETFs.   You may refer to the Prospectus for additional details.











 Learn More
To learn more, please contact Kenneth H. Thomas, Ph.D. at Ken@CommunityDevelopmentFund.com or 800-203-0209











Mutual fund investing involves risk including the loss of principal.  Bond and bond funds are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value as interest rates rise.  The Fund is non-diversified. Carefully consider the risks, investment objectives, charges and expenses of the Fund before investing. The Prospectus contains this and other important information. The Prospectus is available at http://communitydevelopmentfund.com/fund-literature.  Please read the Prospectus carefully before investing.  The Community Development Fund is distributed by Foreside Fund Services LLC, 3 Canal Plaza, Suite 100, Portland, ME 04101, which is not affiliated with Community Development Fund Advisors.

Development Fund



















Business in need of equity financing can look to the Development Fund as a possible solution. 







The North Dakota Development Fund coordinates efforts between all the sources of financing, the business and the community. Any project considered for this financing must be feasible and have a reasonable chance of succeeding.

The fund provides "gap financing" through loans and equity investments not available from most conventional lenders and is available to any primary-sector business with the exception of production agriculture. The Development Fund also administers the Regional Rural Revolving Loan Fund, which provides funding for primary-sector projects located in a community of less than 8,000 in population or located more than five miles outside the city limits. 

The fund is a secondary source of financing, subordinate to private sources. If a business can't handle added debt, the Development Fund can take an equity financing position.




 







Primary Sector Business
Primary sector includes individuals and businesses which, through the employment of knowledge or labor, add value to a product, process, or service that results in the creation of new wealth. Primary sector includes tourism and specific types of investor-owned agriculture, and is typically businesses such as manufacturers, food processors or export service companies. Investor-owned agriculture includes livestock feeding or milking operations, or other value added agriculture located apart from an individual farm operation that is professionally managed and has employees.
