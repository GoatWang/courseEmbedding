The rug  we received looked nothing like this.  It was totally red. I took it to Home Depot to return and they talked with the HD warehouse and it was reported that this rug is no longer being manufactured.  Yet the rug we received is not on the website.   Therefore we returned the rug.  Why would HD have a rug like the one above of their website and discontinue it.  This makes for poor merchandising and customer service.

It includes firing cannons that actually shoot the cannonballs a short distance. There's also a crane, a jail, and the chambers of Governor Broadside with figurine included. The other figurines are Lt. de Martinet, Captain Redbeard, complete with hat plume, and Flashfork. Smaller pieces include two small boats, pirate flags, telescopes for keeping an eye on the pirate enemies, and palm trees. The treasure chest is filled with tiny treasure. An underground passage beneath the fortress is the only way for the pirates to smuggle the treasure out without being caught by the soldiers.The LEGO Eldorado Fortress is a great set for any LEGO collector or toy enthusiast. This item comes from a time when the brand was busy creating unique bricks and specialized accessories. This LEGO brick set has amazing piecework and a distinctive nature. From the first brick to the last, expect to have a great time creating the Eldorado Fortress at home.This brick set was considered a technologically advanced set when released. It continues to be fun to play with and build. Each of the pirates, boats, and other accessories are of a high quality. Every piece in this pirate brick set is created from durable plastic. All of the paints used to create the faces and other details on the figurines last for generations. When you build the brick island, an original set of instructions are there for you to follow. You also have the ability to get creative and make the Eldorado Fortress the way you want it. Collectors and fans of LEGO can stay busy for hours working with these intricate parts of toy history.The brick Eldorado Fortress is one of the first LEGO products to feature actual shooting mechanisms. The cannon is a great way to bring live-action into make-believe play. Another bonus is that even newer LEGO figures are usable with this product. Each pirate is customized for a distinct look from a red beard to an eye patch. As the protagonist in your own play, you get to decide how the story goes. Have the pirates win the battle or doom them to a life of imprisonment. Attach them to the baseplate with the brick connection point in their feet to create a display.Product IdentifiersBrandLEGOModelPirates Eldorado FortressMPN6276UPC820650104909Key FeaturesThemePiratesSeriesPiratesRecommended Age8-12TypeBricks,Figures,Parts & PiecesPropertiesNumber of Pieces506 pieces Ratings and ReviewsWrite a review5.03 product ratings5340302010DurableWould recommendEntertainingMost relevant reviewsby teacup18Oct 03, 2012Great Product and a must have.I bought this lego set to add to my collection.

Older children will even put down the video game controller and start building when you give them a Lego set of the Death Star from Star Wars. Build it. Play with it. Take it apart. Repeat.

Let Go Of My Lego
Legos are small brick style building toys that allow the user to build anything. The same blocks that are used to make a race car can be used to make a fire station. All the blocks work together and when you toss in accessories such as wheels, roofs, and castle gates you are ready to create. Kids are only limited by their own imagination. Buy your parts in a set with a complete list of instruction or make up your own rules and buy individual pieces.

Stay Connected with K'NEX
Since the early 1990s, K'NEX has been producing interlocking plastic blocks, rods, connectors, gears, wheels, as well as other components, which users can piece together to form a wide variety of structures and models. Since the different pieces can interlock at various angles and directions, children age 5 and older will enjoy hours of constructing.

Go Old School With Lincoln Logs
John Lloyd Wright had an idea in the early 1900s, and it was a great idea. Provide children with notched miniature logs, and let them build small forts and buildings. Top it with a plastic roof, and you have a sturdy home where other toys can live. Over 100 years later, kids are still playing with Lincoln Logs.

Don't Forget the Little One
Most building block toys are recommended for children 3 and up, but thankfully Lego took this into consideration. The Duplo line by Lego is made for little tikes ages 1 1/2 and up. The pieces are sized bigger, so it doesn't create a choking hazard. In addition, the larger size makes it easy for small hands to put it together and pull it apart. Start with the basic building blocks and move up to theme based sets like a working railroad or princess castle with horse and carriage.Side Refine PanelShop by CategoryToys & HobbiesBuilding ToysBuilding Block ToysGeomag Building ToysK'NEX Building ToysLEGO Building ToysLincoln Logs Building ToysMagnetic Building SetsMarble RunsMeccano & Erector Building SetsMega Bloks Building ToysRokenbok Building ToysSupermag Building ToysTinkertoy Building ToysBuilding Toy Storage, Mats & Play TablesOther Building ToysSales & EventsShop All Toy DealsShop All EventsSelling on eBaySell DirectConsign Items

Character Families
LEGO makes several building sets that are centered on some of your most beloved characters. Some of the cult classic storylines that LEGO has focused on include Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Marvel Universe and DC Universe. Other well-known characters that have had a huge impact on the sets LEGO creates include Batman, Ninjago, Pirates of the Caribbean, Spiderman, Toy Story and Indiana Jones. LEGO has no forgotten about the young girls who love to build as well. They have an expansive collection of building sets centered on the Disney Princesses. From classic characters such as Cinderella and Belle from Beauty and the Beast to more recent favorites Anna and Elsa and Moana, LEGO offers a well rounded sampling of building sets for boys and girls.
LEGO Theme
Aside from the endless list of characters whose building sets are based off of, LEGO has several themes that they focus their packs on. For people who regularly enjoy the fine details of architecture throughout the world, LEGO has Creator which features monuments and historical buildings throughout famous cities. LEGO also has City packs that feature everyday people and locations, encouraging children to build and create their own cities and towns. Friends is another well rounded set of building packs they produce. Friends focuses on a set of girlfriends, the town they live in, and their daily interactions. Technic is another fun set of building packs that incorporates technology into the LEGO design. LEGO Duplo is centered on younger children to begin to get their minds thinking about building and creativity. Castle is another LEGO theme that has several building sets to go along with it.
