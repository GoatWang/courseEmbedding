What are analysts saying about Packaging Corporation of America stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Packaging Corporation of America stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Packaging Corporation anticipates second-quarter 2017 earnings of $1.45 per share, reflecting 16% year-over-year growth. It continues to implement its previously announced packaging segment price increases and expects higher corrugated products shipments in the second quarter. Energy costs are likely to improve as it enters into a seasonally milder weather. Moreover, the company will gain from acquisitions and its diverse product portfolio. The stock outperformed the Zacks categorized Containers-Paper/Plastic sub industry in the last one year. However, Packaging Corporation’s performance will be hurt by escalating expenses, continued price inflation on recycled fiber and strong competition." (7/11/2017)
2. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "PKG is executing at a high level and due to its virgin asset base and operating efficiency, it's better insulated against cost inflation than its peers. While mgmt is investing in internal projects to support the growth in its system, the capacity should be manageable and we like the optionality in the stock from a more transformative acquisition."

Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy).

Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 6 Hold Ratings, 4 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.40)Consensus Price Target: $104.33 (4.95% downside)
