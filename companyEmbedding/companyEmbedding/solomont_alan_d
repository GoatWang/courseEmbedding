            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Alan D. Solomont
Alan D. Solomont, former U.S. ambassador to Spain and Andorra and a lifelong social and political activist, serves as the Pierre and Pamela Omidyar Dean of the Jonathan M. Tisch College of Citizenship and Public Service at Tufts.
Prior to his posting to Madrid, Solomont chaired the bipartisan board of directors of the Corporation for National and Community Service, the federal agency that oversees such domestic service programs as AmeriCorps, Learn and Serve America, VISTA and Senior Corps. He was first appointed to the board by President Clinton in 2000, reappointed by President George W. Bush in 2007 and elected chair in 2009.
Like President Obama, who nominated him for the ambassadorship in the summer of 2009, Solomont as a young man worked as a community organizer, in the city of Lowell, Mass. He traces his interest in the problems of America’s cities to his mentor at Tufts, Antonia Chayes, the former dean of Jackson College, who taught urban studies in the political science department and served with her husband, Abram Chayes, in the Kennedy administration. To this day, Solomont said, she has been “an enormous influence on my intellectual growth.”
Throughout his career, Solomont has embraced the ability of political activism and public service to benefit society.
After graduating from Tufts with a B.A. in political science and urban studies, Solomont made his first trip to Spain on a Thomas J. Watson Fellowship for postgraduate study and travel abroad.
He returned to his native Massachusetts to work as a community organizer in Lowell. His mother was a nurse at Boston City Hospital, and he earned a B.S. in nursing from the University of Lowell (now the University of Massachusetts Lowell) in 1977.
Solomont spent much of his professional career in the health- and elder-care arenas. He built a network of elder-care facilities in New England as chair of Solomont Bailis Ventures. He invested in early-stage health-care companies and cofounded HouseWorks, a home-care company that helps seniors remain independent. He was also the founder and managing director of Angel Healthcare Investors.
A longtime leader in the Democratic Party, Solomont got his first exposure to national politics as an undergraduate in 1968, when he worked as a page during the tumultuous Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Later, he served as the party’s national finance chair from 1997 to 1998, and he was an early supporter of Barack Obama’s bid for the presidency. He played key roles in the presidential campaigns of John Kerry, Al Gore, Bill Clinton and Michael Dukakis.
Through the years, Solomont has remained deeply involved in Tufts. As a Tisch College senior fellow and visiting instructor, he taught an undergraduate political science seminar on the American presidency, a course known for the political luminaries and leaders he brought to campus.
A trustee emeritus of the university, Solomont was the founding chair of the Tisch College board of advisors. To mark the 10th anniversary of the college in 2011, his friends and colleagues endowed the Alan D. Solomont Lecture in recognition of his leadership as an active citizen. Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi, the first woman speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, gave the inaugural lecture, and Solomont himself was selected to deliver the second lecture this past April.
Solomont has served on the boards of a number of other nonprofit and for-profit organizations, including the Boston Medical Center, Boston Private Bank & Trust Co., Angel Healthcare Investors, the New Israel Fund, Israel Policy Forum, the University of Lowell, the University of Massachusetts, the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library Foundation and the WGBH Educational Foundation. He has chaired the boards of Combined Jewish Philanthropies of Greater Boston and Hebrew Senior Life, a nonprofit elder-care provider in Boston.

Alan D. Solomont – Tisch College of Civic Life
Alan D. Solomont became the Dean of the Jonathan M. Tisch College of Civic Life at Tufts University in January, 2014. The mission of Tisch College is to ensure that every student at Tufts University is educated to be an active citizen.
From January, 2010 until July, 2013, Solomont was the United States Ambassador to Spain and Andorra. As President Obama’s representative, Ambassador Solomont helped to strengthen Spain’s cooperation with the United States on matters of global security. He was a tireless advocate for American companies doing business in Spain, and he supported investment by Spanish companies in the United States. He and his wife Susan promoted the values of volunteering and citizen service throughout Spain.
Prior to his diplomatic service, Ambassador Solomont was an entrepreneur, philanthropist and political activist.  He served as Chairman of the bipartisan Board of Directors of the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS), the federal agency that oversees all domestic service programs, including AmeriCorps, Learn and Serve America, VISTA and Senior Corps.  He was initially appointed to the Board by President Clinton in 2000, re-appointed by President Bush in 2007 and elected chairman in 2009.
Ambassador Solomont spent his professional career in the health and elder care arenas.   He was Chairman of Solomont Bailis Ventures, investing in early stage health care companies. He was a co-founder of HouseWorks, a home care company that helps seniors remain independent and supports families caring for aging relatives.  He was also a founder and Managing Director of Angel Healthcare Investors.  In addition to managing his own businesses, he served on the boards of directors of several non-profit and for-profit organizations, including the Boston Medical Center, Boston Private Bank & Trust Co., Angel Healthcare Investors, Tufts University, the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library Foundation and the WGBH Educational Foundation.  He chaired the Boards of Combined Jewish Philanthropies of Greater Boston and Hebrew Senior Life, a large nonprofit elder care provider in Boston.
Ambassador Solomont has been a longtime leader in the Democratic Party, serving as its National Finance Chair in 1997-1998.  He was a crucial supporter of Barack Obama’s presidential campaign and is a longtime friend of Secretary of State, John Kerry.  Drawing on his personal involvement and interest in American politics, Ambassador Solomont taught an undergraduate political science course on the American Presidency as a Senior Fellow and Visiting Instructor at Tufts University.
Ambassador Solomont holds a B.A. in Political Science and Urban Studies from Tufts University and a B.S. in Nursing from the University of Massachusetts, Lowell.  After graduating from Tufts in 1970, he was awarded the Thomas J. Watson Fellowship for independent study and travel abroad, during which time he made his first visit to Spain.
He is married to Susan Lewis Solomont, and they have two grown daughters.

                    The Honorable Alan D. Solomont                    
U.S. Ambassador (Retired) 
Alan D. Solomont became the Dean of the Jonathan M. Tisch College of Citizenship and Public Service at Tufts University in January, 2014. The mission of Tisch College is to ensure that every student at Tufts University is educated to be an active citizen.
From January, 2010 until July, 2013, Solomont was the United States Ambassador to Spain and Andorra. As President Obama’s representative, Ambassador Solomont helped to strengthen Spain’s cooperation with the United States on matters of global security. He was a tireless advocate for American companies doing business in Spain, and he supported investment by Spanish companies in the United States. He and his wife Susan promoted the values of volunteering and citizen service throughout Spain.
Prior to his diplomatic service, Ambassador Solomont was an entrepreneur, philanthropist and political activist. He served as Chairman of the bipartisan Board of Directors of the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS), the federal agency that oversees all domestic service programs, including AmeriCorps, Learn and Serve America, VISTA and Senior Corps. He was initially appointed to the Board by President Clinton in 2000, re-appointed by President Bush in 2007 and elected chairman in 2009.
Ambassador Solomont spent his professional career in the health and elder care arenas. He was Chairman of Solomont Bailis Ventures, investing in early stage health care companies. He was a co-founder of HouseWorks, a home care company that helps seniors remain independent and supports families caring for aging relatives. He was also a founder and Managing Director of Angel Healthcare Investors. In addition to managing his own businesses, he served on the boards of directors of several non-profit and for-profit organizations, including the Boston Medical Center, Boston Private Bank & Trust Co., Angel Healthcare Investors, Tufts University, the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library Foundation and the WGBH Educational Foundation.

Department History







Department History
Since its creation in 1789, the Department of State has carried out a series
                        of reorganizations and has created new offices and bureaus to deal with new
                        diplomatic challenges.
This portion of our website contains a short history of the
                            department, biographies of the Secretaries of State, a database of Principal
                            Officers and Chiefs of Mission, and a history of the buildings of the Department
                            of State.
The Department of State has grown significantly over the years. The first
                        Secretary of State, Thomas Jefferson, oversaw a small staff of one chief
                        clerk, three other clerks, a translator, and a messenger and only maintained
                        two diplomatic posts, in London and Paris, as well as 10 consular posts. 
World War I (1914–1918) and World War II (1939–1945) brought vastly increased
                        global responsibilities to the United States as it emerged as a preeminent
                        power. New challenges after the end of the Cold War and the fall of the
                        Soviet Union, included: 
the newly independent states,
the global economy,
terrorism, and
the security of the American overseas presence. 

To address these changing global circumstances, the number of domestic and
                        overseas employees (not counting local employees) grew to: 
1,228 in 1900,
1,968 in 1940,
13,294 in 1960,
and 15,751 in the year 2000.

The number of diplomatic posts increased from 41 in 1900 to 168 in 2004 and
                        continues to grow.
