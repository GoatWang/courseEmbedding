Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

-0.80%


 (the "Company" or "Midland") and Centrue Financial Corporation  ("Centrue") today announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement under which Midland will acquire Centrue for estimated total consideration of $175.1 million, or $26.75 per share of Centrue common stock.  Midland expects the transaction to be 8-9% accretive to earnings per share in 2018, the first full year of combined operations.


                                        








Centrue Financial Corporation, the parent company of Centrue Bank, is headquartered in Ottawa, Illinois and had total assets of $978 million, net loans of $677 million and total deposits of $740 million as of December 31, 2016.  Established in 1874, Centrue is a regional, full-service community bank offering commercial, retail and mortgage banking services.  Centrue has 20 bank branches located principally in northern Illinois and has a top 5 deposit market share in Kankakee and LaSalle Counties. 


                                        








Leon J. Holschbach, President and Chief Executive Officer of Midland, commented,  "Centrue has built a highly attractive franchise through a commitment to superior customer service and being deeply invested in the success of the communities it serves.  Having competed against Centrue in our northern Illinois markets for many years, we are very familiar with their franchise and believe they will be an excellent cultural fit with Midland.  Indeed, Kurt Stevenson and I have known each other going way back and he has done an excellent job at Centrue.  With $978 million in assets, Centrue will add significant scale to our operations, provide meaningful opportunities to enhance our overall efficiencies, and increase our earnings power.  We look forward to welcoming the customers, employees and shareholders of Centrue to the Midland family."


                                        








Kurt R. Stevenson, President and CEO of Centrue, said, "Midland is an excellent merger partner for Centrue and the combination of our two companies will create an exceptionally strong community banking franchise with more than $4.0 billion in total assets.  As part of a larger financial institution with deeper resources, this transaction will significantly improve our ability to serve the needs of our customers, who will benefit from having access to a wider selection of financial products and services. Moreover, we will have an improved ability to accommodate the growth of our commercial banking relationships by offering increased borrowing capacity."        









The earnings per share accretion estimates for this transaction are based on estimated cost savings of approximately 40% of Centrue's non-interest expense, with all cost savings expected to be phased in by 2018.  The earnings per share accretion estimates do not include any assumption of revenue synergies.  Midland expects $18.2 million in one-time transaction-related charges.  Midland also expects to incur tangible book value per share dilution of less than 1.5% upon the closing of the transaction, with an expected earn-back period of approximately two years.


                                        








Expected benefits of the transaction include:


                                        










Increased earnings power driven by earnings accretion and greater operating scale;

                                    










An expanded base of stable, low-cost deposits;

                                    










Significant cross-selling opportunities with Midland's broader product and service offerings;

                                    










Greater penetration of key markets in northern Illinois and adds to Midland's already significant St. Louis MSA presence; and

                                    










The #1 and #2 deposit market share positions in the Kankakee and Ottawa-Peru, IL MSAs, respectively

                                    










Transaction Details

                                        








The estimated total consideration of $175.1 million (which includes cash consideration for outstanding equity awards) will be paid 65% in Midland common stock and 35% in cash.  Under the terms of the definitive agreement, upon consummation of the transaction, holders of Centrue common stock will have the right to receive a fixed exchange ratio of 0.7604 shares of Midland common stock, a fixed consideration of $26.75 in cash, or a combination of cash and stock for each share of Centrue common stock they own, subject to proration based on achieving the aforementioned consideration mix, and subject to potential adjustment based on Centrue's adjusted stockholders' equity at closing.  For purposes of determining the exchange ratio, the transaction utilizes Midland's 10-day volume-weighted average stock price through January 13, 2017, or $35.18 per share.  In addition, holders of Centrue preferred stock will have the right to receive newly issued shares of Midland preferred stock having similar terms.


                                        








The transaction is expected to close in mid-2017, subject to regulatory approvals, the approval of Centrue's and Midland's shareholders, and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.
