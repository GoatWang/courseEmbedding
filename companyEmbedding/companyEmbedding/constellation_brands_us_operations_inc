About CONSTELLATION BRANDS U.S. OPERATIONS, INC.

   You might say the company is the pathfinder star for a giant in the beverage business. Constellation Wines U.S. (CWUS) oversees the domestic winemaking operations of its parent, New York-based Constellation Brands. No matter the state of your pocketbook or degree of wine connoisseurship, CWUS offers a complete range of US-made vintages. They include super-premium and luxury wines (Estancia, Inniskillin, Robert Mondavi Winery, Simi, and Wild Horse), premium wines (Blackstone, Woodbridge), emerging wines (Barossa, Red Guitar), and specialty and value wines (Arbor Mist, Cook's, Wild Irish Rose, Vendange). CWUS operates 18 wineries and production facilities, most of which are in California.
  
Geographic Reach

   New York-based Constellation Wines U.S. operates 16 wineries and production facilities in California, and one each in New York and Washington. The company's largest wineries are the Woodbridge Winery in Acampo and the Mission Bell Winery in Madera, both in California.
  
Sales and Marketing

   CWUS sells its wines through wholesalers, retailers, as well as state and provincial alcoholic beverage control agencies.
  
Strategy

   The company is pursuing a strategy focusing on premium and above wines. To that end, it sold its Inglenook, Paul Masson, and Almenden operations to The Wine Group for $134 million in cash in 2009. Constellation used the funds to pay down debt so that it could better concentrate on premium wine -- which it did with that year's final integration of the operations of Clos du Bois, the #1 superpremium US wine brand, as well as the luxury brand, Wild Horse. (Both labels were acquired from Fortune Brands in 2007.)
  

   In a move to increase efficiencies, the winemaker has consolidated its distribution in key markets, signing multiyear agreements with large US beverage distributors Southern Glazer's Wine and Spirits, Republic National Distributing Company, National Wine & Spirits, and Johnson Brothers Liquor Company.
  
Mergers and Acquisitions

   To fill a gap in its portfolio of pinot noir brands, Constellation Brands in 2012 acquired the Mark West wine brand from Purple Wine Company for about $160 million. In 2011 the company acquired the remaining 50.1% of Ruffino S.r.l., making Ruffino a wholly owned business.

History[edit]
The company was established in 1945 by Marvin Sands in the Finger Lakes region of New York as Canandaigua Industries, selling bulk wine to bottlers in the eastern United States[6]. In its first year, the company sold approximately 200,000 gallons of wine and had gross sales of $150,000.[7]
The company was incorporated as Canandaigua Wine Company, Inc. in 1972 and went public in 1973.[8] Marvin's son Richard Sands became president in 1993 and CEO in 1996.[6] In 1999, company founder Marvin Sands passed away following a brief illness.[6]
In 2000, the company changed its name to Constellation Brands, Inc. to reflect the scope of the company and its range of brands.[7] In 2007, Rob Sands was named president and CEO.[9]
In 2013, Constellation acquired Grupo Modelo's U.S. beer business from Anheuser-Busch InBev. The transaction included full ownership of Crown Imports LLC which provided Constellation with complete, independent control of all aspects of the U.S. commercial business; a brewery in Nava, Mexico; exclusive perpetual brand license in the U.S. to import, market and sell Corona and the Modelo brands and the freedom to develop brand extensions and innovations for the U.S. market.[9]
In 2014, Constellation finalized a joint venture with Owens-Illinois and completed the acquisition of Anheuser-Busch InBev's glass production plant, located adjacent to the company's brewery in Nava, Mexico.[10]
Wine fraud[edit]
In 2010, a French court in Carcassonne, France, convicted 12 wine traders and producers for selling fake Pinot noir wine to buyers in the US, amongst them Constellation, in a scheme that lasted from January 2006 to March 2008. Constellation later faced and settled a class action lawsuit because it "should have known" that the wine was fake.[11]
Acquisitions[edit]




Constellation Brands moved its headquarters to a 120,000 square feet (11,000 m2) building on 11 acres (4.5 ha) in Victor, New York in 2009


Constellation Brands has expanded by acquiring other drinks companies.
In 1987, the company purchased the Manischewitz winery in Canandaigua, New York, and continues to license the Manischewitz name from R.A.B. Foods.[12]
In 1998 it acquired Matthew Clark plc in the United Kingdom, and after selling off its cider business, the Gaymer Cider Company, sold half of the business to Punch Taverns. Acquisitions include BRL Hardy (Australia)[13] and Nobilo (New Zealand) in 2003; Robert Mondavi Corp. for $1 billion in 2004;[14] Vincor International, Canada's largest wine company, for $1.44 billion in 2006;[15] Spirits Marque One (owner of Svedka Vodka) in 2007;[16] and Beam Wines Estates, the wine operations of Fortune Brands (which included several major brands such as Clos du Bois) for $885 million in 2008.[17] The company later moved to a more premium wine portfolio, divesting Almaden Vineyards, Inglenook Winery, and the Paul Masson winery in Madera, California, in 2008,[18] and its value spirits portfolio to the Sazerac Company in 2009.[19]
In June 2013 the company, which formerly imported Corona and other Modelo brands to the United States, acquired the US rights to those brands as a part of an anti-trust settlement permitting Modelo's acquisition by Anheuser-Busch InBev, along with a brewery in Piedras Negras, Mexico. It now produces its own versions of those products for the US, with Modelo serving all other countries.
In December 2015, Constellation announced the $1 billion acquisition of Ballast Point Brewing of San Diego.

History[edit]
The company was established in 1945 by Marvin Sands in the Finger Lakes region of New York as Canandaigua Industries, selling bulk wine to bottlers in the eastern United States[6]. In its first year, the company sold approximately 200,000 gallons of wine and had gross sales of $150,000.[7]
The company was incorporated as Canandaigua Wine Company, Inc. in 1972 and went public in 1973.[8] Marvin's son Richard Sands became president in 1993 and CEO in 1996.[6] In 1999, company founder Marvin Sands passed away following a brief illness.[6]
In 2000, the company changed its name to Constellation Brands, Inc. to reflect the scope of the company and its range of brands.[7] In 2007, Rob Sands was named president and CEO.[9]
In 2013, Constellation acquired Grupo Modelo's U.S. beer business from Anheuser-Busch InBev. The transaction included full ownership of Crown Imports LLC which provided Constellation with complete, independent control of all aspects of the U.S. commercial business; a brewery in Nava, Mexico; exclusive perpetual brand license in the U.S. to import, market and sell Corona and the Modelo brands and the freedom to develop brand extensions and innovations for the U.S. market.[9]
In 2014, Constellation finalized a joint venture with Owens-Illinois and completed the acquisition of Anheuser-Busch InBev's glass production plant, located adjacent to the company's brewery in Nava, Mexico.[10]
Wine fraud[edit]
In 2010, a French court in Carcassonne, France, convicted 12 wine traders and producers for selling fake Pinot noir wine to buyers in the US, amongst them Constellation, in a scheme that lasted from January 2006 to March 2008. Constellation later faced and settled a class action lawsuit because it "should have known" that the wine was fake.[11]
Acquisitions[edit]




Constellation Brands moved its headquarters to a 120,000 square feet (11,000 m2) building on 11 acres (4.5 ha) in Victor, New York in 2009


Constellation Brands has expanded by acquiring other drinks companies.
In 1987, the company purchased the Manischewitz winery in Canandaigua, New York, and continues to license the Manischewitz name from R.A.B. Foods.[12]
In 1998 it acquired Matthew Clark plc in the United Kingdom, and after selling off its cider business, the Gaymer Cider Company, sold half of the business to Punch Taverns. Acquisitions include BRL Hardy (Australia)[13] and Nobilo (New Zealand) in 2003; Robert Mondavi Corp. for $1 billion in 2004;[14] Vincor International, Canada's largest wine company, for $1.44 billion in 2006;[15] Spirits Marque One (owner of Svedka Vodka) in 2007;[16] and Beam Wines Estates, the wine operations of Fortune Brands (which included several major brands such as Clos du Bois) for $885 million in 2008.[17] The company later moved to a more premium wine portfolio, divesting Almaden Vineyards, Inglenook Winery, and the Paul Masson winery in Madera, California, in 2008,[18] and its value spirits portfolio to the Sazerac Company in 2009.[19]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
