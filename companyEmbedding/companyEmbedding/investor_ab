History, mergers and acquisitions[edit]
The company was founded in 1849 by Gustaf Ferdinand Hennig in Mölnlycke as a textile manufacturer.[4] In the 1940s Mölnlycke began supplying the health care industry with products, such as gauze.
1975 Mölnlycke AB was acquired by Svenska Cellulosa Aktiebolaget (SCA) (publ) where it made up their Clinical division.[4] At that time SCA was known as Bowater-Scott, and the new company, called Sancella Pty Limited, manufactured personal care products.[5]
1997 SCA sold the Clinical products division to Nordic Capital who merged it with Kolmi-Set acquired by Tamro[6] and named it Mölnlycke Health Care AB.[4] Mölnlycke Health Care started operations as an independent company in 1998.[4]
2001, Mölnlycke Health Care acquired the single-use surgical BARRIER product line from Johnson & Johnson.[7]
2005 Mölnlycke Health Care AB was acquired from Nordic Capital by Apax Partners in June 2005 and subsequently merged with Medlock Medical and Regent Medical. The merged company became Mölnlycke Health Care Group.[8]
2007 Apax Partners sold Mölnlycke Health Care Group to Investor AB and Morgan Stanley in January 2007.[9]
2008 Mölnlycke Health Care acquired Pharmaset in October 2008, a French manufacturer of surgical single-use kits.[10]
2009 The company acquired JKT, a Polish manufacturer of surgical disposable products.[11]
2010 The company acquired Rynel, Inc. in January 2010, an American manufacturer of hydrophilic polyurethane foam.[12]

Investor AB acquired Morgan Stanley Principal Investments' stake in Mölnlycke Health Care in August 2010.[13] The acquisition made Investor AB a 96% owner in the company. The remaining 4% is owned by management.[14]

The company is in a rapid growth from 2000 based on the competitive health care products and good management team.
2011 The company launched the construction of a new manufacturing facility at Brunswick Landing in June 2011, site of the former Naval Air Station Brunswick, in Brunswick, Maine, United States, representing a significant milestone for the company to become a leading health care product manufacturer in the world. The factory will produce health care products for U.S market from 2012, and significantly reduce the manufacturing cost and assist new product development.

2011, the company is ranked the 2nd largest advanced wound dressing company in the world and still keeps growing.

2012 The company acquires Brennen Medical.

The company acquires WoundEL® from Gerromed GmbH.
Mölnlycke Health Care establishes the subsidiary Mölnlycke Health Care Scotland Ltd.

2013 The company signed a licence agreement with Covalon Technologies.

2014 The company announced its expansion plans for its Wiscasset, Maine, manufacturing facility in January 2014.[15]
Sales and manufacturing[edit]
Mölnlycke Health Care has sales offices globally.[16] The company has split their production between several factories around the world. Production of their surgical products takes place in Belgium, Thailand, Malaysia, France, Poland and the Czech Republic. Production of wound care products takes place in the UK, Finland and U.S.[17]
Labor relations in Thailand Operation[edit]
Twenty-three founders and leaders of the Mölnlycke Health Care Labour Union at the company's plant in Thailand were allegedly dismissed in 2001 due to their involvement in trade union activities. The Industrial Relations Committee (IRC) of Thailand deemed the dismissal to be unfair and suggested the company reinstate the workers. At a later stage, two workers were reinstated, one of whom was elected as union president. In 2011 twenty-two workers were dismissed in the aftermath of what the company claims to be wild strikes, which again the IRC of Thailand deemed to be unfair.[18] Still claiming this to be wild strikes, Mölnlycke has appealed to the Labour Court for legal trial as either party in an IRC mediation has the right to appeal IRC's recommendation to the court system. The case was settled out of court in February 2013.
Labor environment in the Czech Republic[edit]
Mölnlycke's Czech Republic plant based in Karviná was highlighted for physical breakdowns of some female employees. For example, on August 5, 2014, three female workers (ages 39, 40 and 52) were taken from the production hall to a local hospital by ambulance.[19]
Brands[edit]
The Mölnlycke Health Care surgical division has five brands:

BARRIER[20]
ProcedurePak[20]
HiBi/Hibiclens[20]
Biogel[20]

The Mölnlycke Health Care wound care division has numerous brands. They include:

In 2011 twenty-two workers were dismissed in the aftermath of what the company claims to be wild strikes, which again the IRC of Thailand deemed to be unfair.[18] Still claiming this to be wild strikes, Mölnlycke has appealed to the Labour Court for legal trial as either party in an IRC mediation has the right to appeal IRC's recommendation to the court system. The case was settled out of court in February 2013.
Labor environment in the Czech Republic[edit]
Mölnlycke's Czech Republic plant based in Karviná was highlighted for physical breakdowns of some female employees. For example, on August 5, 2014, three female workers (ages 39, 40 and 52) were taken from the production hall to a local hospital by ambulance.[19]
Brands[edit]
The Mölnlycke Health Care surgical division has five brands:

BARRIER[20]

History, mergers and acquisitions[edit]
The company was founded in 1849 by Gustaf Ferdinand Hennig in Mölnlycke as a textile manufacturer.[4] In the 1940s Mölnlycke began supplying the health care industry with products, such as gauze.
1975 Mölnlycke AB was acquired by Svenska Cellulosa Aktiebolaget (SCA) (publ) where it made up their Clinical division.[4] At that time SCA was known as Bowater-Scott, and the new company, called Sancella Pty Limited, manufactured personal care products.[5]
1997 SCA sold the Clinical products division to Nordic Capital who merged it with Kolmi-Set acquired by Tamro[6] and named it Mölnlycke Health Care AB.[4] Mölnlycke Health Care started operations as an independent company in 1998.[4]
2001, Mölnlycke Health Care acquired the single-use surgical BARRIER product line from Johnson & Johnson.[7]
2005 Mölnlycke Health Care AB was acquired from Nordic Capital by Apax Partners in June 2005 and subsequently merged with Medlock Medical and Regent Medical. The merged company became Mölnlycke Health Care Group.[8]
2007 Apax Partners sold Mölnlycke Health Care Group to Investor AB and Morgan Stanley in January 2007.[9]
2008 Mölnlycke Health Care acquired Pharmaset in October 2008, a French manufacturer of surgical single-use kits.[10]
2009 The company acquired JKT, a Polish manufacturer of surgical disposable products.[11]
2010 The company acquired Rynel, Inc. in January 2010, an American manufacturer of hydrophilic polyurethane foam.[12]

Investor AB acquired Morgan Stanley Principal Investments' stake in Mölnlycke Health Care in August 2010.[13] The acquisition made Investor AB a 96% owner in the company. The remaining 4% is owned by management.[14]

The company is in a rapid growth from 2000 based on the competitive health care products and good management team.
2011 The company launched the construction of a new manufacturing facility at Brunswick Landing in June 2011, site of the former Naval Air Station Brunswick, in Brunswick, Maine, United States, representing a significant milestone for the company to become a leading health care product manufacturer in the world. The factory will produce health care products for U.S market from 2012, and significantly reduce the manufacturing cost and assist new product development.

2011, the company is ranked the 2nd largest advanced wound dressing company in the world and still keeps growing.

2012 The company acquires Brennen Medical.

The company acquires WoundEL® from Gerromed GmbH.
Mölnlycke Health Care establishes the subsidiary Mölnlycke Health Care Scotland Ltd.

2013 The company signed a licence agreement with Covalon Technologies.

2014 The company announced its expansion plans for its Wiscasset, Maine, manufacturing facility in January 2014.[15]
Sales and manufacturing[edit]
Mölnlycke Health Care has sales offices globally.[16] The company has split their production between several factories around the world. Production of their surgical products takes place in Belgium, Thailand, Malaysia, France, Poland and the Czech Republic. Production of wound care products takes place in the UK, Finland and U.S.[17]
Labor relations in Thailand Operation[edit]
Twenty-three founders and leaders of the Mölnlycke Health Care Labour Union at the company's plant in Thailand were allegedly dismissed in 2001 due to their involvement in trade union activities. The Industrial Relations Committee (IRC) of Thailand deemed the dismissal to be unfair and suggested the company reinstate the workers. At a later stage, two workers were reinstated, one of whom was elected as union president. In 2011 twenty-two workers were dismissed in the aftermath of what the company claims to be wild strikes, which again the IRC of Thailand deemed to be unfair.[18] Still claiming this to be wild strikes, Mölnlycke has appealed to the Labour Court for legal trial as either party in an IRC mediation has the right to appeal IRC's recommendation to the court system. The case was settled out of court in February 2013.
Labor environment in the Czech Republic[edit]
Mölnlycke's Czech Republic plant based in Karviná was highlighted for physical breakdowns of some female employees. For example, on August 5, 2014, three female workers (ages 39, 40 and 52) were taken from the production hall to a local hospital by ambulance.[19]

With more consumers inclining toward healthy offerings, companies in the Consumer Staples sector are gradually widening their organic product assortments. Sources revealed that Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (BUD  -  Free Report)	 is on track to acquire Hiball – manufacturer of healthy, clean and premium energy drinks as well as a provider of organic sparkling water and juices under its Alta Palla brand.Terms of the transaction, which is expected to close in the third quarter of 2017, remained under covers. Notably, the organic food space has witnessed compound annual growth rate of 15.3% in the last four years, and currently boasts a market worth over $11 billion in the country.  How will Hiball’s Buyout Impact BUD?Based in San Francisco, Hiball was founded a little over a decade back. With a perfect mix of guarana, ginseng, caffeine and certain important vitamins, the company’s energy drinks and sparkling water fall in line with today’s changing trends. As consumers’ demand for healthy, natural and energy-boosting products is growing considerably, Hiball has generated sales worth roughly $40 million over the past one year, as reported by The Wall Street Journal.The introduction of Hiball’s brands is likely to enhance AB InBev’s products portfolio and solidify its network by offering innovative products. Thus, we believe that Hiball’s addition to AB InBev’s will augment the latter’s top line. On the other hand, the move will benefit Hiball by solidifying its customer base, while maintaining its brand culture and focus on organic ingredients.AB InBev’s Portfolio Diversification On TrackHiball’s acquisition marks another milestone in AB InBev’s commitment toward portfolio diversification. Given the accelerated shift toward low and no alcohol products, the company remains focused on undertaking new ventures to meet changing consumer demand. Incidentally, this world’s largest brewer teamed up with Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report)	 last year to provide Teavana, a ready-to-drink tea. Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.’s (DPS  -  Free Report)	 deal with Bai Brands (low-calorie, coffee-fruit drinks maker) and Pepsico, Inc. ’s (PEP  -  Free Report)	 buyout of KeVita Inc. (producer of fermented probiotic and kombucha beverages) are evidence of other beverage players expanding into the fast-growing healthy and wellness categories.Coming back to AB InBev, this Belgian brewer keeps coming up with near beer alternatives along with no- and low-alcohol beers to provide greater choices to consumers. In fact, management expects the low and no-alcohol beer category to account for about 20% of its global beer volumes by 2025. Also, AB InBev is expanding its presence in the craft beer space, which further underscores its practice of exploiting all possible growth opportunities.These endeavors have helped this Budweiser owner to carve an impressive niche, thus emerging as the strongest player in the beer space. Also, these factors have led this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock to rise 9.6% so far this year, falling in line with the sector it belongs to. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.

Notably, the organic food space has witnessed compound annual growth rate of 15.3% in the last four years, and currently boasts a market worth over $11 billion in the country.  How will Hiball’s Buyout Impact BUD?Based in San Francisco, Hiball was founded a little over a decade back. With a perfect mix of guarana, ginseng, caffeine and certain important vitamins, the company’s energy drinks and sparkling water fall in line with today’s changing trends. As consumers’ demand for healthy, natural and energy-boosting products is growing considerably, Hiball has generated sales worth roughly $40 million over the past one year, as reported by The Wall Street Journal.The introduction of Hiball’s brands is likely to enhance AB InBev’s products portfolio and solidify its network by offering innovative products. Thus, we believe that Hiball’s addition to AB InBev’s will augment the latter’s top line. On the other hand, the move will benefit Hiball by solidifying its customer base, while maintaining its brand culture and focus on organic ingredients.AB InBev’s Portfolio Diversification On TrackHiball’s acquisition marks another milestone in AB InBev’s commitment toward portfolio diversification. Given the accelerated shift toward low and no alcohol products, the company remains focused on undertaking new ventures to meet changing consumer demand. Incidentally, this world’s largest brewer teamed up with Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report)	 last year to provide Teavana, a ready-to-drink tea. Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.’s (DPS  -  Free Report)	 deal with Bai Brands (low-calorie, coffee-fruit drinks maker) and Pepsico, Inc. ’s (PEP  -  Free Report)	 buyout of KeVita Inc. (producer of fermented probiotic and kombucha beverages) are evidence of other beverage players expanding into the fast-growing healthy and wellness categories.Coming back to AB InBev, this Belgian brewer keeps coming up with near beer alternatives along with no- and low-alcohol beers to provide greater choices to consumers. In fact, management expects the low and no-alcohol beer category to account for about 20% of its global beer volumes by 2025. Also, AB InBev is expanding its presence in the craft beer space, which further underscores its practice of exploiting all possible growth opportunities.These endeavors have helped this Budweiser owner to carve an impressive niche, thus emerging as the strongest player in the beer space. Also, these factors have led this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock to rise 9.6% so far this year, falling in line with the sector it belongs to. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.

Your Career





Owning and developing best-in-class companies
We are a long-term owner, focusing on doing what we deem best for each company. Through our international network, strong brand name and active ownership, we create significant value.
Objective and operating prioritiesWe are committed to generating an attractive long-term total return, exceeding the market cost of capital. Our long-term return requirement is the risk free interest rate plus an equity risk premium, in total 8-9 percent annually. Our operating priorities are to grow our net asset value, operate efficiently and pay a steadily rising dividend.

Grow our net asset value: To achieve attractive net asset value growth, we must own high-quality companies and be a good owner, supporting our companies to achieve profitable growth. We also need to allocate our capital successfully.
Operate efficiently: We maintain cost discipline to remain efficient and in order to maximize our operating cash flow.
Pay a steadily rising dividend: Our dividend policy is to distribute a large percentage of the dividends received from the listed core investments, as well as to make a distribution from other net assets corresponding to a yield in line with the equity market. The goal is to pay a steadily rising dividend.

Active ownershipWe are an active and long-term owner. Through substantial ownership and board participation, we drive the initiatives that we believe will create the most value for each individual Company.
We have a long-term investment perspective and support our companies in their efforts to create sustainable value. Our goal is to build strong and healthy, best-in-class companies. We aspire for all of our companies to perform better than their peers and to reach their full potential. However, our companies are diverse and therefore with different opportunities and challenges. Accordingly, we treat each company individually and independently.
Our model for active ownership is built on substantial ownership. We own significant minority stakes in our listed core investments, and are often the largest shareholder, as it enables us to influence board composition and impact key strategic decisions. Our subsidiaries are owned by Patricia Industries, which offers management teams and boards co-ownership.
What we invest inWe own companies within engineering, healthcare, financial services and technology; industries we understand well, and in which we can utilize our experience and network as well as our financial expertise.
We have a long-term investment horizon focusing on “buy-to-build”, with no exit strategy. Our base case is to develop our companies over time, as long as we see further value creation potential. Our business teams are responsible for regularly updating our view of the long-term fundamental values of our companies, serving as the starting point for our investment decisions. Our capital allocation focus is to invest through our existing wholly-owned subsidiaries within Patricia Industries and finding new ones. In addition, we will continue to strengthen our ownership in selected listed core investments, and invest in EQT’s funds. While not part of the strategy, if we arrive at the conclusion that a certain company no longer offers attractive potential, or that it would be better off with another main owner, we actively drive an exit process in order to find a better owner for the company and to maximize the value for our shareholders at the same time.
Long-term value-creating investmentsWe actively support all our companies in making long-term value-creating investments, which means that we are willing to sacrifice short-term profitability for longer-term value accretive investments. It is our firm belief that to become or remain best-in-class, companies must have the ability to invest in innovation, regardless of pressure from market or external forces. However, our long-term perspective is never an excuse for weak underlying short-term performance. Through our financial strength, we enable our companies to make the right investment decisions – at the right time. Access to capital, in combination with sound ownership and governance, creates opportunities to invest for the long-term.
New investmentsWhile we do not actively seek new investments within Listed Core Investments, we do not rule out additional investments should attractive opportunities arise. Patricia Industries constantly scouts the market for new companies to acquire. In addition to the industries we are invested in, new investments can be made in, for instance, infrastructure and business services. However, the main priority is to further develop and build the existing companies.
In any new investments, we look for certain characteristics; high-quality companies with strong market positions, flexible business models, strong corporate cultures, exposure to growth markets, strong cash flow, continuous focus on innovation and R&D, exposure to service and after-market sales and sustainable business models.
Cash flow platformOver the past few years, we have established a strong cash flow generation through Patricia Industries’ wholly-owned subsidiaries. This cash flow, together with the dividend from our listed core investments, allows us to finance investments in both existing and new companies without divesting assets. It also allows us to pay a steadily rising dividend.

Investor acquires BraunAbility – the U.S. market leader in automobile mobility products




















September 23, 2015 12:02 ET

 | Source: Investor AB




Patricia Industries, a division within Investor AB, has signed an agreement to
acquire the U.S. family-owned company BraunAbility. BraunAbility is the
established U.S. market leader in both of its core businesses – wheelchair
-accessible vehicles and wheelchair lifts. The company was founded nearly 50
years ago by Ralph Braun, who was himself disabled and built his first
wheelchair-accessible vehicle in 1972. Since then, the company has grown into
the most well-known and experienced name in the mobility industry, bringing
independence to millions of individuals across the world. BraunAbility will join
a roster of high-quality, high-growth companies in the Investor family,
including Permobil, the innovative provider of powered and manual wheelchairs
for people with severe walking disabilities. BraunAbility will continue to be
led by its current management team, which continues to be owners in the company.
2014 sales amounted to USD 415 m. More financial information, including the
acquisition price, will be given later.

“We are very pleased to have added BraunAbility as a new holding within Patricia
Industries, in line with our strategy to build out the portfolio of wholly-owned
subsidiaries”, comments Investor CEO Johan Forssell.

BraunAbility is Investor’s first North American subsidiary following the
creation of Patricia Industries earlier this year, and it will be managed out of
the New York office.

Börje Ekholm, CEO of Patricia Industries, comments: “BraunAbility’s history as a
family-owned business with a strong sense of mission and a consistent focus on
creating long-term value for its customers, employees and shareholders, is a
perfect fit with Investor’s own culture and values. Given our long-term value
creation objectives and experience within both healthcare and mobility, we
believe that Patricia Industries is well positioned to support BraunAbility in
its continued progress. Together with BraunAbility’s dedicated management and
employees, we look forward to contributing to the company’s continued success.

“With the support of Patricia Industries, we will be positioned to accelerate
our rate of growth, powered by product innovation, development of our brand
promise within the communities we serve and continued expansion into global
markets”, says Nick Gutwein, BraunAbility’s President and CEO. “The Wallenberg
family and the Investor Group share our commitment to serve wheelchair users
around the world through lasting customer relationships built on trust.
Together, we will advance our mission to provide products and services that
improve life with the most trusted lineup of transportation mobility solutions
in the world. This is a tremendous opportunity to extend for decades the legacy
that our founder Ralph Braun built.”

The acquisition is subject to approval from the relevant competition
authorities. Closing is expected during the fourth quarter 2015.

About BraunAbility
BraunAbility is the world’s leading manufacturer of wheelchair accessible
vehicles and wheelchair lifts for both personal use and commercial applications.
Founded nearly 50 years ago by Ralph Braun, the company was built on the age-old
adage, “Necessity is the mother of invention.” Ralph Braun was a young man who
used a wheelchair and had no reliable transportation to and from his place of
work. He built his first wheelchair accessible vehicle in 1972, and since then,
BraunAbility has grown into the most well-known and trusted brand in the
mobility industry, bringing independence to tens of thousands of individuals
around the world. For more information, please visit www.braunability.com.
