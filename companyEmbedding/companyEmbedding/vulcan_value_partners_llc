BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Mission & Values








Our Mission
To protect capital and achieve superior long-term results by executing our investment process with discipline.
Core Values
Serve Others Before Self.
We are servants first. We exist solely to improve the lives of those we serve – our client partners, employees, investment partners, our families, and our fellow man.
Perform With Discipline.
We are value investors. We demand a margin of safety and recognize that value and growth are different sides of the same coin. We are long-term investors, not speculators. A long-term time horizon is our competitive advantage. We will seek long-term investment partners, and we will never compromise our disciplined approach to sound investment.
Seek Excellence. Find Success.
Our focus is on excellence not on success. Success is the by-product of excellence. Our focus is on excellence and competence in all areas. Mediocrity will not exist here. We will execute our investment philosophy without compromise.
Remain Focused.
We will stay within our circle of competence and know where that circle ends.
Never Compromise Integrity.
We will perform with the highest standards of integrity and honesty in all our endeavors. The time is always right to do what is right. The glimpse of fleeting success will never compromise our standard. We will always perform with integrity and walk with humility.
Walk The Talk.
We believe in our discipline of investing. We practice what we preach. Vulcan Value Partners is the exclusive public equity investment vehicle for all our employees and employee partners. We ask no investor to invest where we do not invest ourselves. We are truly partners.

About Us
Vulcan Value Partners is an Investment Adviser registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  We are value investors—business analysts with a long-term time horizon focused on purchasing publicly traded companies that are competitively entrenched at significant discounts to intrinsic worth. Vulcan Value Partners was founded in 2007 by C.T. Fitzpatrick. Mr. Fitzpatrick has 20 years experience managing portfolios with proven long-term results. The remainder of the firm’s management team has a combined 70 years of investing, operating, and analytical experience. As an independently owned and operated firm, we believe that our capital should be invested alongside our client partners. That is why Vulcan Value Partners is the exclusive investment vehicle for all of our employees’ public equity investments. Our goal is to compound capital at real rates of return significantly in excess of inflation over our five year time horizon.
Our Name
The Vulcan Story:
Vulcan Value Partners. Our original inspiration of our name comes from Roman mythology. Vulcan, the Roman god of fire, was a worker god. With fire and hammer and discipline, he persistently, over time, shaped and refined precious metal from raw ore. Determination, endurance, and above all, discipline. All harnessed to refine the ordinary into the extraordinary. Discipline, harnessed and focused to create value over time.

"Discipline is the refining fire by which talent becomes ability."

Mission and Values








Performance is Our Mission
We are value investors—business analysts with a long-term time horizon focused on purchasing publicly traded companies that are competitively entrenched at significant discounts to intrinsic worth. Performance is our mission. We believe performance is best achieved through disciplined commitment to our long-term investment philosophy and the highest set of core values. Our goal is to compound capital at real rates of return significantly in excess of inflation over our five year time horizon. Believing that as owners and operators of the firm, our capital should be invested alongside our client partners, Vulcan Value Partners is the exclusive investment vehicle for all of our employees’ public equity investments.
The inspiration for our name comes from Vulcan, the Roman god of fire. Embracing the qualities of persistence, determination, endurance, and above all discipline, Vulcan was a worker god who harnessed the power of fire and used that power over time to refine raw ore into precious metal.
