IMI Global -- Our Leadership

John & Leann SaundersCEO & President and Founders of IMI GlobalEverything about IMI Global and the vision the company possesses can be attributed to its founders, John and Leann Saunders.  The Saunders themselves have three beautiful children and they understand first-hand the importance of providing safe, healthy meals to them each day, and trusting that the food they buy is what the brand, store or restaurant says it is.  Leann was also born and raised in the beef industry, and intimately understands the hard work and dedication it takes to produce healthy, great tasting, and safe beef products and the importance of programs that can provide additional revenue opportunities back to the ranch.Still, after nearly 20 years after starting IMI Global and slowly growing it into what is now the industry's leading third-party verification company, the Saunders continue to dedicate their lives to driving value for food producers through transparent and authentic communication with consumers about by who and how food is produced.

Fresh Produce Since 1909

M. Saunders Wholesale Produce has been selling fresh fruit and produce in Southern NH for over a hundred years. Today, the business is in its third generation and continues to strive to sell the freshest fruit and produce for the value.
In 1996,  the business expanded to include pre-cut fruits and vegetables. Many different blends of salad mix, cut vegetables and fruits are available –  all chemical free and certified kosher (KVH). These value added products have the potential to save your business time and money.

Thanks for taking a closer look at the services we offer!
Marc’s Corner
Hi,
   Iceberg, Romaine, Greenleaf, Broccoli and Cauliflower are dropping and quality is improving. However weather continues to be a factor out west. We may still see spikes in prices.
 Celery is very high in price. on a positive note we have some FL. Corn available. So far so good on the quality.  
 Thanks for your continued business and support,
 Marc Saunders
