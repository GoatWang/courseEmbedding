Transaction to accelerate Verizon’s position as a leading provider of fleet and mobile workforce management solutions
 
NEW YORK and DUBLIN – August 1, 2016 – Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE, Nasdaq: VZ) and Fleetmatics Group PLC (NYSE: FLTX) today announced they have entered into a definitive agreement under which Verizon will acquire Fleetmatics, a leading global provider of fleet and mobile workforce management solutions, for $60.00 per share in cash – representing a value of approximately $2.4 billion.
"Fleetmatics is a market leader in North America -- and increasingly internationally -- and they've developed a wide-range of compelling SaaS-based products and solutions for small- and medium-sized businesses," said Andrés Irlando, CEO of Verizon Telematics.
"The powerful combination of products and services, software platforms, robust customer bases, domain expertise and experience, and talented and passionate teams among Fleetmatics, the recently-acquired Telogis, and Verizon Telematics will position the combined companies to become a leading provider of fleet and mobile workforce management solutions globally," Irlando added.
“Verizon and Fleetmatics share a vision that the SaaS-based fleet management solution market is extraordinarily large, lightly penetrated, global and fragmented which can best be attacked together with a world class product offering and the largest distribution channel in the industry.”
Jim Travers, Chairman and CEO of Fleetmatics.

“Fleetmatics brings over 37,000 customers, approximately 737,000 subscribers, a broad portfolio of industry leading products, and a team of 1,200 professionals focused on solving the critical challenges of businesses that deploy mobile workforces. We are excited to partner with Verizon in fulfilling the mission of becoming the largest mobile workforce management company in the world,” Travers added.
In June, Verizon Telematics also announced the acquisition of Telogis, Inc., a global, cloud-based mobile enterprise management software company based in Aliso Viejo, Calif. That transaction closed on July 29.
With approximately 1,200 employees, Fleetmatics is headquartered in Dublin, Ireland, with North American headquarters in Waltham, Mass. The company’s Web-based solutions provide fleet operators with visibility into vehicle location, fuel usage, speed and mileage, and other insights into their mobile workforce, helping them to reduce operating costs, as well as increase revenue.
Verizon Telematics, a subsidiary of Verizon Communications, operates in more than 40 markets worldwide and offers comprehensive wireless, software and hardware solutions to consumers, enterprises, automakers and dealers to power connected-vehicle products around the world.
The acquisition is subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions, including the approval of Fleetmatics’ shareholders and the sanction of the Irish scheme of arrangement by which Verizon will acquire Fleetmatics by the Irish High Court, and is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016.
PJT Partners and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC are acting as financial advisors to Verizon. Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP, A&L Goodbody and Macfarlanes LLP are acting as legal advisors to Verizon. Morgan Stanley is acting as financial advisor to Fleetmatics. Goodwin Procter LLP and Maples and Calder are acting as legal advisors to Fleetmatics.
 
Fleetmatics cancels previously scheduled quarterly conference call
As a result of today’s announcement, Fleetmatics has cancelled its earnings call previously scheduled for August 9, 2016 and has withdrawn its most recent guidance with respect to 2016 as previously issued on May 4, 2016.

Verizon cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements
This communication contains forward-looking statements. These statements are based on estimates and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements include the Verizon group’s and the combined group’s estimated or anticipated future results, or other non-historical facts. Forward-looking statements also include those preceded or followed by the words “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “hopes” or similar expressions. For those statements, Verizon claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The following important factors, along with those discussed in Verizon’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), could affect future results and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements: integration of the Fleetmatics acquisition and benefits of the Fleetmatics acquisition; the risk that the required regulatory approvals for the proposed transaction are not obtained, are delayed or are subject to conditions that are not anticipated; the anticipated size of the markets and continued demand for Fleetmatics’ products; adverse conditions in the U.S. and international economies; the effects of competition in the markets in which Verizon or Fleetmatics operate; material changes in technology or technology substitution; disruption of Verizon or Fleetmatics’ key suppliers’ provisioning of products or services; changes in the regulatory environment, including any increase in restrictions on Verizon’s ability to operate its networks; breaches of network or information technology security, natural disasters, terrorist attacks or acts of war or significant litigation and any resulting financial impact not covered by insurance; Verizon’s high level of indebtedness; an adverse change in the ratings afforded Verizon’s debt securities by nationally accredited ratings organizations or adverse conditions in the credit markets affecting the cost, including interest rates, and/or availability of further financing; material adverse changes in labor matters, including labor negotiations, and any resulting financial and/or operational impact; significant increases in benefit plan costs or lower investment returns on plan assets; changes in tax laws or treaties, or in their interpretation; changes in accounting assumptions that regulatory agencies, including the SEC, may require or that result from changes in the accounting rules or their application, which could result in an impact on earnings; the inability to implement Verizon’s or the combined group’s business strategies; the inability to realize the benefits of Verizon’s or the combined group’s strategic acquisitions; those discussed in Fleetmatics’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and Amendment No. 1 thereto under the heading “Risk Factors,” as updated from time to time by Fleetmatics’ Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other documents of Fleetmatics on file with the SEC or in the proxy statement on Schedule 14A that will be filed with the SEC by Fleetmatics; and those discussed in Verizon’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 under the heading “Risk Factors,” as updated from time to time by Verizon’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other documents of Verizon on file with the SEC. There may be additional risks that neither Fleetmatics nor Verizon presently know or that Fleetmatics and Verizon currently believe are immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. In addition, forward-looking statements provide Fleetmatics’ and Verizon’s expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and views as of the date of this communication. Fleetmatics and Verizon anticipate that subsequent events and developments will cause Fleetmatics’ and Verizon’s assessments to change.  However, while Fleetmatics and Verizon may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, Fleetmatics and Verizon specifically disclaim any obligation to do so. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing Fleetmatics’ and Verizon’s assessments as of any date subsequent to the date of this communication.

        Complete the Picture

        Easy And effective dashboArd

        With a simple-to-read dashboard, you’re clicks away from identifying opportunities to improve, comparing driver performance, seeing changing trends and creating benchmarks on key fleet metrics. 
    






        Give customers  something to smile about 

        With Fleetmatics REVEAL, you’ll be able to respond to customer needs with more accuracy and at a faster rate. That means your fleet may be able to beat competition to prospects. Oh, how sweet victory can be.

Fleetmatics Group PLC Soars on Acquisition By Verizon Communications
The fleet management software company is selling to the telecom giant for a hefty premium.











                Timothy Green
            

                (TMFBargainBin)

Image source: Fleetmatics.
What: Shares of fleet management software provider Fleetmatics Group (NYSE:FLTX) surged on Monday after the company announced that it was being acquired by Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ). At 11:30 a.m. ET, Fleetmatics stock was up 39%, while Verizon stock had declined by less than 1%.
So what: Verizon will pay $60 in cash for each share of Fleetmatics, valuing the company at roughly $2.4 billion. The deal is expected to close during the fourth quarter of 2016 following approval by Fleetmatics' shareholders. Fleetmatics' earnings call, originally scheduled for August 9, has been canceled as a result of the announcement, and the company has withdrawn its guidance for 2016.
Andres Irlando, CEO of Verizon Telematics, a subsidiary of Verizon, explained the reasoning behind the deal: "The powerful combination of products and services, software platforms, robust customer bases, domain expertise and experience, and talented and passionate teams among Fleetmatics, the recently acquired Telogis, and Verizon Telematics will position the combined companies to become a leading provider of fleet and mobile workforce management solutions globally."
Fleetmatics brings 1,200 employees and 37,000 customers to Verizon. Fleetmatics won't move the needle for Verizon, with just $285 million of revenue in 2015 compared to $131 billion for Verizon. But the telecommunications giant is looking for ways to diversify beyond its core wireless business, and Fleetmatics will help make Verizon a larger player in the fleet and workforce management solutions industry.  





Now what: The $60 price tag that Verizon is paying for Fleetmatics' shares is close to the stock's all-time high. Unlike many fast-growing software-as-a-service companies, Fleetmatics has been consistently profitable on a GAAP basis. The company is too small to add much to Verizon's bottom line, but it should provide a positive benefit immediately.
Verizon is paying a premium for the stock, shelling out about 8.5 times 2015 revenue. But the company clearly believes that adding Fleetmatics will help jump-start its efforts in the fleet management market.
