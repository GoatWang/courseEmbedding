Teaching (Spring 2010): 
-Core Curriculum: "Frontiers of Science" 

My version of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, useful for illustrating the limited
range of human vision compared to the breadth of information about the Universe
reaching us in parts of the electromagnetic outside the visible band, is
available for non-commercial use. Both audio and illustrated versions
can be downloaded from
here.
Research Interests: 
- Large-scale structure and AGN
in radio surveys 
- The origin and evolution of neutron stars and
supernova remnants 
- Active galactic nuclei and the X-ray background 
I have recently completed a radio survey of the Galactic Plane that is 30 times more sensitive and has 30 times the angular resolution of the best existing Plane surveys. MAGPIS (the Multi-Array Galactic Plane Imaging Survey) was designed to complement the GLIMPSE infrared PLane survey withe the Spitzer Space telescope. Earlier, I was involved in another radio survey project, also using the Very Large Array, to
construct the equivalent of the Palomar Sky Survey for the radio Universe. Our
 FIRST
Survey, begun in 1993, has produced over 34,000
two-million pixel images covering 9200 square degrees of the sky at 20 cm. The
survey is complete for point sources to 1.0 mJy, and each of the ~850,000 radio sources catalogued has a position accurate to better than
1". This unprecedented astrometric accuracy has allowed us to increase the
number of optically identified radio sources by more than a factor of 100. We
are using the survey to map large scale structure by computing the radio source
angular correlation functions, detecting the weak-lensing shear produced by
the foreground mass distribution on the distant radio sources, calculating the
angular diameter-redshift relation  for classical double radio sources, and
identifying rich clusters at 
high redshift using bent-double radio galaxies
as tracers of high density environments. We are also conducting a FIRST Bright Quasar Survey  which has already led to the
discovery of over 1000 new quasars with R<18, the first radio-loud BAL objects, and a high
incidence of gravitational lenses. Several other projects using this unique
new resource are also underway, including a search for 
highly obscured quasars. In addition, I continue to pursue a long-standing
interest in the evolution of neutron stars and the supernova remnants in which
the youngest ones are found. We have several programs approved for observations
of
synchrotron nebulae their neutron stars with Chandra and Newton. Recent results on the pulsars inVela and 3C58 were of particular interest. In order to 
increase the number of young remnants known, we have begun a major survey
of the Galactic plane with the VLA and XMM Newton, complemented by the
MSX mid-IR survey. I also expect to use the new generation of X-ray
observatories to address the issue of the contribution of starburst galaxies  and AGN
to the cosmic X-ray background, and to study the high-redshift clusters we
are finding with FIRST.
