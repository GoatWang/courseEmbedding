Spinal Cord Injury Lawyer in the San Francisco Bay Area

 
 
 
 
 
 



Spinal Cord Injuries
A spinal cord injury can be catastrophic and life-altering. As reported by the National Library of Medicine, an injury to the spinal cord disrupts the signals that run back and forth between the body and the brain.
A spinal cord injury can be complete or incomplete. With complete spinal cord injury, the cord cannot transmit signals, resulting in paralysis below the level of the injury. Depending on the location of the injured area of the spine, the victim may suffer quadriplegia (with cervical injuries) or paraplegia (with injury to the lower vertebrae).
The National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center (NSCISC) reports approximately 12,500 new cases of spinal cord injury (SCI) every year in the U.S. This amounts to approximately 40 cases in every million people.
The spinal cord is not completely severed in most injury cases. SCI usually results from a blow that dislocates or fractures vertebrae, after which fragments of vertebrae press down on nerves or cut into the spinal cord.
Many different types of accidents and injuries can result in SCI. At The Law Offices of Edward C. Casey Jr., we help victims of spinal cord injury caused by the negligence, carelessness, or intentional conduct of another in a range of accidents and injuries, including:
 
“An estimated 276,000 people were living with spinal cord injury in the U.S. in 2014.”


Car accidents
Motorcycle accidents
Trucking accidents
Pedestrian accidents
Bicycle accidents
Construction accidents
Defective product injuries


 
Our founding attorney, Edward C. Casey Jr., has nearly three decades of experience. Our practice is devoted exclusively to helping injured people in the San Francisco Bay area — not assisting large corporations or insurance companies. We pride ourselves on our compassion, intelligence, and dedication to aggressively fighting for the maximum compensation for our clients.
If you or your loved one has suffered SCI in an accident that was someone else’s fault, contact our office as soon as possible. We are happy to meet with you at your convenience to discuss your options under the law, and what our California spinal cord injury attorney can do for you. We want to help you obtain the compensation you need and deserve!
