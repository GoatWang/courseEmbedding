ObsEva IPO: Early Stage Keeps Us Cautious On An IPO Investment - ObsEva (Pending:OBSV) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»ObsEva IPO: Early Stage Keeps Us Cautious On An IPO InvestmentJan.24.17 | About: ObsEva (OBSV) Don Dion Long/short equity, special situations, momentum, event-drivenMarketplaceIPO InsightsSummarySwitzerland-based OBSV is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing therapeutics to address problems with reproductive health and pregnancy.
        The company is set to price its NASDAQ Global IPO this Wednesday 1/25; lead underwriters are Credit Suisse Securities, Jeffries LLC, and Leerink Partners.
        ObsEva SA faces significant competition from larger pharmaceutical companies.
        While we see large demand for OBSV's product we are cautious on investing at the time of IPO.
        Overview ObsEva (Pending:OBSV) expects to raise $87 million in its upcoming IPO. Based in Geneva, Switzerland, ObsEva SA is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing treatments for women who experience difficulties with reproductive health and pregnancy. We previewed this deal on our IPO Insights platform. ObsEva SA will offer 6.45 million shares at an expected price range of $14 to $16. If the underwriters price the IPO at the midpoint of that range, OBSV will have a market capitalization of $444 million. OBSV filed for the IPO on December 30, 2016. Lead Underwriters: Credit Suisse Securities, Jeffries LLC, and Leerink Partners Business Summary: Clinical Stage Biopharmaceutical Company 

 (Source: SEC Filings) ObsEva SA focuses on the development and commercialization of novel therapeutics for women between the ages of 15 and 49 suffering from reproductive health and pregnancy complications. The company is working to develop treatments for endometriosis, uterine fibroids, and preterm labor. It is developing OBE2109, an oral hormone receptor antagonist for the treatment of pain associated with endometriosis and heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids in pre-menopausal women; OBE001, an oral oxytocin receptor antagonist to improve clinical pregnancy and live birth rates in women undergoing in vitro fertilization; and OBE022, an oral and selective receptor antagonist, as a once daily treatment for preterm labor in weeks 24 to 34 of pregnancy.
 Use of Proceeds And Highlights From Management's Analysis ObsEva was founded in 2012, and operations to date have focused on organizing and staffing the company, as well as obtaining licensing rights to its proposed therapeutics, conducting preclinical and clinical trials, and raising capital. The company has no revenue. None of its product candidates have received approval for sale. In addition, ObsEva has funded its operations to date through the sale of equity. The company notes that its net losses were $19.9 million in 2015 and $12.8 million in 2014. Its cumulative losses as of September 30, 2016 were $58.5 million. ObsEva expects to incur additional operating losses for the foreseeable future. Future expenses will come from additional clinical trials, hiring staff, expanding its intellectual property portfolio, acquiring licenses, and operating as a public company. The company also notes in its SEC filing that it will need substantial funding to bring any product candidates to market, and that additional funding may or may not be available. Potential Competition: AbbVie, Bayer and GlaxoSmithKline ObsEva SA faces significant competition from larger pharmaceutical companies including AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV), Myovant Sciences (NYSE:MYOV), Astellas Pharma, Bayer, Gedeon Richter, Takeda Pharmaceuticals, Visanne, Actavis, and GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK). Executive Management Highlights Co-founder and CEO Ernest Loumaye launched ObsEva in 2012. He previously co-founded PregLem, a Swiss specialty biopharmaceutical company. Dr. Loumaye holds a M.D. and a Ph.D. from Louvain University, with a specialization in Obstetrics and Gynecology. Chief Scientific Officer Jean-Pierre Gotteland has served in his position since September 2015. His previous experience comes from positions at PregLem, Serono, and Pierre Pabre Meclicament. Dr. Gotteland holds a Ph.D. in Organic Chemistry from the University Claude Bernard and an Engineering Diploma from Ecole Superieure de Chimie Industrielle. Conclusion: Consider Caution
 Given the early stage of OBSV's product candidates and uncertainty regarding approval, investing in the stock comes with high risk. At this point, we are hesitant although the market for OBSV's products is strong. We suggest investors consider a modest allocation at most. Don Dion's IPO Insights provides up-to-date information and analysis on the major IPOs each week, along with additional opportunities to invest and short these stocks at their quiet period and lockup period expirations, respectively.

ObsEva SA Announces the Completion of Phase 1 PK/PD Clinical Trial Evaluating Different Doses of OBE2109 and Add-Back Therapy
Jun 7 17
ObsEva SA announced the completion of a Phase 1 clinical trial aimed at evaluating the PK/PD relationship of OBE2109 combined with different doses of add-back therapy. OBE2109 is a novel, oral GnRH receptor antagonist that is currently in a Phase 2b clinical trial for the treatment of pain associated with endometriosis (EM) and in Phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) associated with uterine fibroids (UF) in pre-menopausal women. Although estrogen (E2) suppression is a well-validated strategy for alleviating symptoms of UF and EM, therapeutic benefit can be compromised by hypo-estrogenic effects, principally bone mineral density (BMD) loss. This often necessitates administration of add-back therapy (ABT) to patients, which delivers estrogen/progestogens to counteract the deleterious effects of BMD. The ongoing OBE2109 development program is investigating two complementary approaches to achieving what ObsEva believes is the optimal estrogen level to find a balance between efficacy and side effects. The first approach is to use a low dose of OBE2109 that targets an E2 range of 20 to 6 pg/mL, without the addition of add-back therapy. The second approach targets maximal E2 suppression with a high dose of OBE2109, combined with add-back therapy to bring exogenous E2 back to the desired level that is intended to aid BMD safety. The present Phase 1 clinical trial reported herein aimed to evaluate the pharmacodynamics, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of the oral GnRH receptor antagonist OBE2109 alone or co-administered with E2/NETA add-back therapy. This was a prospective, randomized, parallel group study involving 76 healthy, Caucasian women of child-bearing potential. Subjects were randomized to one of five arms for a period of six weeks to receive either 100 mg of OBE2109 alone or with one of two ABT doses (E2/NETA: 0.5mg/0.1mg or 1mg/0.5mg), or 200 mg of OBE2109 alone or with the standard dose of ABT (E2/NETA: 1mg/0.5mg).

We estimate that the net proceeds to us from the sale of the common shares that
we are offering will be $86.8 million, based on the initial public offering
price of $15.00 per common share, after deducting the underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We currently estimate that we will use the net proceeds from this offering,
together with our existing cash and cash equivalents, as follows:

• approximately $49.0 million to advance the development of OBE2109;

• approximately $11.0 million to advance the development of OBE001;

• approximately $8.0 million to advance the development of OBE022; and

• the remainder to fund other research and development activities, as well as 
  for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including to pursue
  our strategy to in-license or acquire additional product candidates, although
  we have no agreements or commitments for any specific acquisitions or 
  in-licenses as of the date of this prospectus.            

This expected use of net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash and
cash equivalents represents our intentions based upon our current plans and
business conditions, which could change in the future as our plans and business
conditions evolve. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary
significantly depending on numerous factors, including the progress of our
development, the status of and results from clinical trials, as well as any
collaborations that we may enter into with third parties for our product
candidates, and any unforeseen cash needs.

As a result, our management will have broad discretion in the application of the
net proceeds from this offering, and investors will be relying on the judgment
of our management regarding the application of those net proceeds. Pending these
uses, we plan to invest these net proceeds in short-term, interest bearing
deposits.

Based on the planned use of proceeds described above, we believe that the net
proceeds from this offering and our current cash and cash equivalents will be
sufficient to enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure
requirements for more than 12 months. We anticipate these funds will be
sufficient for the completion of our Phase 2b clinical trial of OBE2109 in
patients with endometriosis, the initiation of our two Phase 3 clinical trials
of OBE2109 in patients with uterine fibroids, the initiation and completion of
our European Phase 3 clinical trial of OBE001 in women undergoing IVF and the
completion of our Phase 1 and DDI clinical trials and the subsequent initiation
and completion of a Phase 2 clinical trial of OBE022 for the treatment of
preterm labor. We anticipate that we will need additional funds to complete our
two Phase 3 clinical trials of OBE2109 in patients with uterine fibroids. We
have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and we
could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect.


Biopharmaceutical product development is highly competitive and subject to rapid
and significant technological advancements. Our success is highly dependent upon
our ability to in-license, acquire, develop and obtain regulatory approval for
new and innovative products on a cost-effective basis and to market them
successfully. In doing so, we face and will continue to face intense competition
from a variety of businesses, including large, fully integrated, 
well-established pharmaceutical companies who already possess a large share of
the market, specialty pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies, academic
institutions, government agencies and other private and public research
institutions in the European Union, United States and other jurisdictions.

With respect to OBE2109, there are no GnRH antagonists currently approved for
the treatment of pain associated with endometriosis or heavy menstrual bleeding
associated with uterine fibroids. However, we are aware that AbbVie Inc.,
Myovant Sciences, Inc. and Astellas Pharma Inc. are developing GnRH antagonist
product candidates for treatment of symptoms associated with endometriosis or
uterine fibroids. We also anticipate competing with GnRH agonists, including
Lupron (leuprolide acetate), marketed by AbbVie Inc. and Takeda Pharmaceuticals,
Visanne, which is approved for the treatment of endometriosis outside the United
States and marketed by Bayer, ulipristal acetate, which is approved for the
treatment of moderate-to-severe symptoms of uterine fibroids outside the United
States and marketed by Gedeon Richter in Europe and other regions, and by
Actavis (Allergan) in Canada. Actavis (Allergan) has stated that it expects to
submit an NDA for ulipristal acetate with the FDA in 2017. In addition, oral
contraceptives and NSAIDs are routinely used as a first-line therapy for
treatment of symptoms associated with endometriosis and uterine fibroids and
have a meaningful success rate at mitigating the symptoms associated with these
conditions.

With respect to OBE001, there are no oxytocin receptor antagonists approved for
use in connection with IVF. However, we are aware that Ferring Pharmaceuticals
Inc. has been developing barusiban, an oxytocin receptor antagonist, to be
administered subcutaneously, for use in connection with IVF. Ferring
Pharmaceuticals’ atosiban, an oxytocin receptor antagonist, has been used in
investigator initiated trials in connection with IVF outside the United States.

With respect to OBE022, we anticipate competing with atosiban, which has been
approved to delay preterm birth outside of the United States, as well as
currently available prostaglandin inhibitors, such as NSAIDs. We are also aware
that GlaxoSmithKline is developing retosiban, an oxytocin receptor antagonist,
to delay preterm birth.

We may also compete with other companies acquiring and developing or marketing
drug therapies or products for women’s reproductive health diseases.

Many of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may
compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and
expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing,
conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing
approved drugs than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the biopharmaceutical
industry could result in even more resources being concentrated among a small
number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be
significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with
large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in
recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel,
establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials,
as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our
programs.

Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors
develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or
less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than
OBE2109, OBE001 or OBE022 or any other product candidate that we may develop.
Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their
product candidates more rapidly than we may obtain approval for our product
candidates, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market
position before we are able to enter the market. Any new product that competes
with an approved product must demonstrate compelling advantages in efficacy,
convenience, tolerability and safety in order to overcome price competition and
to be commercially successful.

In addition, established biopharmaceutical companies may invest heavily to
accelerate discovery and development of novel compounds or to in-license novel
compounds that could make OBE2109, OBE001, OBE022 or any of our future product
candidates less competitive.


Company Description
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and
commercialization of novel therapeutics for serious conditions that compromise a
woman’s reproductive health and pregnancy. Our goal is to build the leading
women’s reproductive health and pregnancy company focused on


 conditions where
current treatment options are limited and significant unmet needs exist.

We are focused on providing therapeutic solutions for women between the ages of
15 and 49 who suffer from reproductive health conditions that affect their
quality of life, ability to conceive or that complicate pregnancy and the health
of newborns. There are millions of women of reproductive age affected by
conditions such as endometriosis, uterine fibroids and preterm labor, or that
require in vitro fertilization, or IVF, to conceive. Our most advanced product
candidates are designed to address the symptoms associated with endometriosis
and uterine fibroids and to improve clinical pregnancy and live birth rates in
women undergoing IVF. Endometriosis is an often painful disorder in which tissue
that normally lines the inside of the uterus, called the endometrium, grows
outside of the uterus, causing monthly bleeding and chronic inflammatory
reactions inside the abdomen, that may result in ovarian cyst formation, scar
tissue and adhesions. Uterine fibroids, also known as leiomyomata or myoma, are
common non-cancerous tumors that develop in the muscular wall of the uterus and
have disabling symptoms such as heavy menstrual bleeding. We are also developing
a product candidate to treat preterm labor.

We are advancing a pipeline of orally-administered innovative new chemical
entities, or NCEs, for the treatment of symptoms associated with endometriosis
and uterine fibroids, improvement of clinical pregnancy and live birth rates in
women undergoing IVF and treatment of preterm labor. 
--- 

We were founded in November 2012 by former executives of PregLem SA, or PregLem,
a Swiss-based specialty biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development
and commercialization of innovative drugs for women’s reproductive health. While
at PregLem, our senior management team collaborated in the clinical development
and commercialization of several women’s reproductive health therapeutics,
including Esmya (ulipristal acetate) for the treatment of uterine fibroids.
PregLem was subsequently acquired by Gedeon Richter in 2010. We believe we will
be able to leverage our senior management team’s long-standing experience
working together and with key opinion leaders, patient groups, payors,
reproductive health networks, fertility clinics, obstetricians and
gynecologists, or OB/GYNs, nurses and pharmacists to identify, in-license or
acquire, develop and commercialize product candidates.

Our portfolio currently consists of three in-licensed NCEs in clinical
development for four indications intended to address areas that we believe
present significant unmet medical needs.

OBE2109 for the Treatment of Pain Associated with Endometriosis and Heavy
Menstrual Bleeding Associated with Uterine Fibroids

We are developing OBE2109 as a novel, oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone, or
GnRH, receptor antagonist, which is a type of drug that binds to the receptor
and thus inhibits GnRH from eliciting a response from the same receptor, for the
treatment of pain associated with endometriosis and heavy menstrual bleeding
associated with uterine fibroids in pre-menopausal women. As of 2014, we believe
that approximately 2.5 million women in the United States were diagnosed and
being treated for endometriosis, and the majority of those women experience
significant pain during menstrual periods. According to a study published in the
American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology in 2003, uterine fibroids affect an
estimated 20 to 40% of women over the age of 30 in the United States based on
clinical cases and women who undergo treatment.

In 2015, we in-licensed OBE2109 from Kissei Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., or Kissei,
a Japanese pharmaceutical company. Prior to in-licensing OBE2109, Kissei
completed a preclinical program, a Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy female
volunteers of Japanese and European descent and three Phase 2a clinical trials
in patients of Japanese descent with endometriosis, including one trial that
included a subgroup of patients with both endometriosis and uterine fibroids. In
these trials, OBE2109 was observed to have a linear pharmacokinetic, or PK,
profile, a predictable dose-dependent suppression of estradiol, which is a form
of the hormone estrogen, and a dose range that was well-tolerated and provided
symptom relief. A drug’s PK profile refers to the specific way in which a given
drug is handled by the body over time, including the particular patterns of the
specified drug’s absorption, distribution and elimination from the body, while a
drug’s pharmacodynamic, or PD, profile refers to the biochemical and
physiological effects of a drug on the body. We expect OBE2109 to potentially
reduce pain symptoms associated with endometriosis and heavy menstrual bleeding
associated with uterine fibroids, while mitigating bone mineral density loss and
other adverse effects associated with excessive estradiol suppression.

We are currently conducting a multiple-dose, placebo-controlled Phase 2b
clinical trial of OBE2109 in patients with endometriosis across 46 sites in the
United States and 15 sites in Central and Eastern Europe, with a target
enrollment of 330 patients, which we refer to as the EDELWEISS clinical
trial. We expect to report the primary efficacy results from the 24-week
evaluation period of the EDELWEISS clinical trial in the first half of 2018. For
the uterine fibroids indication, we intend to commence a Phase 3 clinical
program with two Phase 3 clinical trials, which we refer to as the PRIMROSE
clinical trials, in the first half of 2017. We expect to report data from these
Phase 3 PRIMROSE clinical trials in the first half of 2020.

There are currently no GnRH receptor antagonists approved for the treatment of
symptoms associated with endometriosis or uterine fibroids. However, we are
aware that AbbVie Inc., Myovant Sciences, Inc. and Astellas Pharma Inc. are
developing GnRH receptor antagonists for the treatment of symptoms associated
with endometriosis or uterine fibroids. Based on publicly available information
for these other products in development, we believe OBE2109 has the following
potential advantages:

• Favorable and consistent PK profile. OBE2109 has been observed to have a  
  consistent PK profile and low variability due to high bioavailability and low
  volume of distribution. We believe some of the competitive product candidates
  have low bioavailability and high volume of distribution due to drug 
  accumulation in fat, which we believe may translate into variable efficacy and
  safety. In addition, OBE2109’s half-life allows for once daily dosing across 
  indications, while one of the competitive product candidates is being 
  developed for twice daily dosing. 

• Personalized dosing. Based on OBE2109’s consistent PK and PD profiles observed
  in preclinical studies and clinical trials, we are currently evaluating 
  personalized dosing that can be tailored to a patient’s individual response. 
  We believe this may allow us to pursue a label for varied dosing based on a 
  patient’s estradiol levels and symptoms. We believe other products in clinical
  development are currently only being evaluated for one or two dosing options,
  which do not appear to account for individual patient characteristics, 
  individual response or patient preference. 

• No systematic need for add-back therapy. For symptoms associated with both
  endometriosis and uterine fibroids, we are developing OBE2109 as a stand-alone
  treatment (without need for add-back therapy) and in association with add-back
  therapy (fixed-dose combination therapy) to fulfill the needs of a broad 
  patient population with endometriosis or uterine fibroids. Add-back therapy 
  refers to the administration of additional estrogen during treatment to 
  counteract the side effects of excessive suppression of estradiol. We believe
  at least one other product in clinical development is only being evaluated as
  a fixed-dose combination therapy that includes add-back therapy, which we 
  believe may not be suitable for treatment of women with poor tolerance or
  contraindications to add-back therapy. We also believe that at least one of 
  the other products in clinical development has demonstrated, at the dose being
  developed in the clinical trials, a bone mineral density loss at 24 weeks of
  treatment comparable to Lupron, a GnRH agonist used for the treatment of 
  endometriosis and uterine fibroids.  

• Compliance benefit. OBE2109 may have an advantage in patient compliance due to
  the lack of observed food effect and the ability to be taken once anytime 
  throughout the day, as compared to certain of the competitive product 
  candidates, which we believe need to be taken on an empty stomach.

OBE001 (nolasiban) to Improve IVF Outcomes

We are developing OBE001 (nolasiban), an oral oxytocin receptor antagonist, to
improve clinical pregnancy and live birth rates in women undergoing IVF. In
Europe, approximately 620,000 IVF treatments were performed in 2012, and in the
United States, approximately 210,000 IVF treatments were performed in 2014. The
IVF process has an overall live birth rate of approximately 33% in the United
States and 21% in Europe.

We in-licensed OBE001 from Merck Serono, which previously completed preclinical
studies and Phase 1 clinical trials in 103 healthy female volunteers that
evaluated the safety and PK profile of OBE001.

In 2016, we completed our 247-patient Phase 2 clinical trial of OBE001 in women
undergoing IVF. In this Phase 2 clinical trial, OBE001 did not reach the primary
endpoint of demonstrating a statistically significant increase in pregnancy rate
at six weeks after embryo transfer. In our post-hoc analysis, which excluded
patients with progesterone levels in the top quartile of the patient pool, we
identified a statistically significant dose-proportional increase in pregnancy
rate at 10 weeks as well as live birth rates. We believe that high progesterone
levels can lead to a premature closing of the embryo implantation window. Based
on these results, we intend to initiate a European Phase 3 clinical trial in 
women undergoing IVF in the first half of 2017 and expect to report data for the
primary endpoint in the second quarter of 2018.

OBE022 for the Treatment of Preterm Labor

We are developing OBE022, an oral and selective prostaglandin F2?, or PGF2?,
receptor antagonist, as a once daily treatment for preterm labor in weeks 24 to
34 of pregnancy.

Preterm labor, defined as the body commencing the birthing process prior to 37
weeks, is characterized by uterine contractions, cervical dilation and rupture
of the fetal membranes that surround and protect the fetus during pregnancy.
Preterm labor can lead to preterm birth, which is currently the leading
worldwide cause of death of newborn babies. According to the National Center for
Health Statistics, approximately 9.6% of babies in the United States were born
preterm in 2014.

We in-licensed OBE022 from Merck Serono in 2015. Based on its PK profile and
efficacy observed in animal models, we believe OBE022 has the potential to
become a first-in-class therapy to suppress preterm labor and delay or avoid
preterm birth, without significant safety concerns for the fetus. We are
currently conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial assessing the safety, tolerability
and PK profile of OBE022 in healthy post-menopausal female volunteers after
single doses of 10 mg to 1,300 mg and multiple doses between 100 mg per day and
1,000 mg per day over 7 consecutive days. Based on preliminary data, OBE022 was
observed to have a favorable safety profile and to be well-tolerated at doses up
to 1,300 mg after single dose administration and up to 1,000 mg per day after
multiple dose administration over 7 days, each of which are above the estimated
clinical effective dose.

We estimate that the net proceeds to us from the sale of the common shares that
we are offering will be $86.8 million, based on the initial public offering
price of $15.00 per common share, after deducting the underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We currently estimate that we will use the net proceeds from this offering,
together with our existing cash and cash equivalents, as follows:

• approximately $49.0 million to advance the development of OBE2109;

• approximately $11.0 million to advance the development of OBE001;

• approximately $8.0 million to advance the development of OBE022; and

• the remainder to fund other research and development activities, as well as 
  for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including to pursue
  our strategy to in-license or acquire additional product candidates, although
  we have no agreements or commitments for any specific acquisitions or 
  in-licenses as of the date of this prospectus.            

This expected use of net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash and
cash equivalents represents our intentions based upon our current plans and
business conditions, which could change in the future as our plans and business
conditions evolve. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary
significantly depending on numerous factors, including the progress of our
development, the status of and results from clinical trials, as well as any
collaborations that we may enter into with third parties for our product
candidates, and any unforeseen cash needs.

As a result, our management will have broad discretion in the application of the
net proceeds from this offering, and investors will be relying on the judgment
of our management regarding the application of those net proceeds. Pending these
uses, we plan to invest these net proceeds in short-term, interest bearing
deposits.

Based on the planned use of proceeds described above, we believe that the net
proceeds from this offering and our current cash and cash equivalents will be
sufficient to enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure
requirements for more than 12 months. We anticipate these funds will be
sufficient for the completion of our Phase 2b clinical trial of OBE2109 in
patients with endometriosis, the initiation of our two Phase 3 clinical trials
of OBE2109 in patients with uterine fibroids, the initiation and completion of
our European Phase 3 clinical trial of OBE001 in women undergoing IVF and the
completion of our Phase 1 and DDI clinical trials and the subsequent initiation
and completion of a Phase 2 clinical trial of OBE022 for the treatment of
preterm labor. We anticipate that we will need additional funds to complete our
two Phase 3 clinical trials of OBE2109 in patients with uterine fibroids. We
have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and we
could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect.


Biopharmaceutical product development is highly competitive and subject to rapid
and significant technological advancements. Our success is highly dependent upon
our ability to in-license, acquire, develop and obtain regulatory approval for
new and innovative products on a cost-effective basis and to market them
successfully. In doing so, we face and will continue to face intense competition
from a variety of businesses, including large, fully integrated, 
well-established pharmaceutical companies who already possess a large share of
the market, specialty pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies, academic
institutions, government agencies and other private and public research
institutions in the European Union, United States and other jurisdictions.

With respect to OBE2109, there are no GnRH antagonists currently approved for
the treatment of pain associated with endometriosis or heavy menstrual bleeding
associated with uterine fibroids. However, we are aware that AbbVie Inc.,
Myovant Sciences, Inc. and Astellas Pharma Inc. are developing GnRH antagonist
product candidates for treatment of symptoms associated with endometriosis or
uterine fibroids. We also anticipate competing with GnRH agonists, including
Lupron (leuprolide acetate), marketed by AbbVie Inc. and Takeda Pharmaceuticals,
Visanne, which is approved for the treatment of endometriosis outside the United
States and marketed by Bayer, ulipristal acetate, which is approved for the
treatment of moderate-to-severe symptoms of uterine fibroids outside the United
States and marketed by Gedeon Richter in Europe and other regions, and by
Actavis (Allergan) in Canada. Actavis (Allergan) has stated that it expects to
submit an NDA for ulipristal acetate with the FDA in 2017. In addition, oral
contraceptives and NSAIDs are routinely used as a first-line therapy for
treatment of symptoms associated with endometriosis and uterine fibroids and
have a meaningful success rate at mitigating the symptoms associated with these
conditions.

With respect to OBE001, there are no oxytocin receptor antagonists approved for
use in connection with IVF. However, we are aware that Ferring Pharmaceuticals
Inc. has been developing barusiban, an oxytocin receptor antagonist, to be
administered subcutaneously, for use in connection with IVF. Ferring
Pharmaceuticals’ atosiban, an oxytocin receptor antagonist, has been used in
investigator initiated trials in connection with IVF outside the United States.

With respect to OBE022, we anticipate competing with atosiban, which has been
approved to delay preterm birth outside of the United States, as well as
currently available prostaglandin inhibitors, such as NSAIDs. We are also aware
that GlaxoSmithKline is developing retosiban, an oxytocin receptor antagonist,
to delay preterm birth.

We may also compete with other companies acquiring and developing or marketing
drug therapies or products for women’s reproductive health diseases.

Many of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may
compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and
expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing,
conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing
approved drugs than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the biopharmaceutical
industry could result in even more resources being concentrated among a small
number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be
significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with
large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in
recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel,
establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials,
as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our
programs.

Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors
develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or
less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than
OBE2109, OBE001 or OBE022 or any other product candidate that we may develop.
Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their
product candidates more rapidly than we may obtain approval for our product
candidates, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market
position before we are able to enter the market. Any new product that competes
with an approved product must demonstrate compelling advantages in efficacy,
convenience, tolerability and safety in order to overcome price competition and
to be commercially successful.

In addition, established biopharmaceutical companies may invest heavily to
accelerate discovery and development of novel compounds or to in-license novel
compounds that could make OBE2109, OBE001, OBE022 or any of our future product
candidates less competitive.


Company Description
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and
commercialization of novel therapeutics for serious conditions that compromise a
woman’s reproductive health and pregnancy. Our goal is to build the leading
women’s reproductive health and pregnancy company focused on


 conditions where
current treatment options are limited and significant unmet needs exist.

We are focused on providing therapeutic solutions for women between the ages of
15 and 49 who suffer from reproductive health conditions that affect their
quality of life, ability to conceive or that complicate pregnancy and the health
of newborns. There are millions of women of reproductive age affected by
conditions such as endometriosis, uterine fibroids and preterm labor, or that
require in vitro fertilization, or IVF, to conceive. Our most advanced product
candidates are designed to address the symptoms associated with endometriosis
and uterine fibroids and to improve clinical pregnancy and live birth rates in
women undergoing IVF. Endometriosis is an often painful disorder in which tissue
that normally lines the inside of the uterus, called the endometrium, grows
outside of the uterus, causing monthly bleeding and chronic inflammatory
reactions inside the abdomen, that may result in ovarian cyst formation, scar
tissue and adhesions. Uterine fibroids, also known as leiomyomata or myoma, are
common non-cancerous tumors that develop in the muscular wall of the uterus and
have disabling symptoms such as heavy menstrual bleeding. We are also developing
a product candidate to treat preterm labor.

We are advancing a pipeline of orally-administered innovative new chemical
entities, or NCEs, for the treatment of symptoms associated with endometriosis
and uterine fibroids, improvement of clinical pregnancy and live birth rates in
women undergoing IVF and treatment of preterm labor. 
--- 

We were founded in November 2012 by former executives of PregLem SA, or PregLem,
a Swiss-based specialty biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development
and commercialization of innovative drugs for women’s reproductive health. While
at PregLem, our senior management team collaborated in the clinical development
and commercialization of several women’s reproductive health therapeutics,
including Esmya (ulipristal acetate) for the treatment of uterine fibroids.
PregLem was subsequently acquired by Gedeon Richter in 2010. We believe we will
be able to leverage our senior management team’s long-standing experience
working together and with key opinion leaders, patient groups, payors,
reproductive health networks, fertility clinics, obstetricians and
gynecologists, or OB/GYNs, nurses and pharmacists to identify, in-license or
acquire, develop and commercialize product candidates.

Our portfolio currently consists of three in-licensed NCEs in clinical
development for four indications intended to address areas that we believe
present significant unmet medical needs.

OBE2109 for the Treatment of Pain Associated with Endometriosis and Heavy
Menstrual Bleeding Associated with Uterine Fibroids

We are developing OBE2109 as a novel, oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone, or
GnRH, receptor antagonist, which is a type of drug that binds to the receptor
and thus inhibits GnRH from eliciting a response from the same receptor, for the
treatment of pain associated with endometriosis and heavy menstrual bleeding
associated with uterine fibroids in pre-menopausal women. As of 2014, we believe
that approximately 2.5 million women in the United States were diagnosed and
being treated for endometriosis, and the majority of those women experience
significant pain during menstrual periods. According to a study published in the
American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology in 2003, uterine fibroids affect an
estimated 20 to 40% of women over the age of 30 in the United States based on
clinical cases and women who undergo treatment.

In 2015, we in-licensed OBE2109 from Kissei Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., or Kissei,
a Japanese pharmaceutical company. Prior to in-licensing OBE2109, Kissei
completed a preclinical program, a Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy female
volunteers of Japanese and European descent and three Phase 2a clinical trials
in patients of Japanese descent with endometriosis, including one trial that
included a subgroup of patients with both endometriosis and uterine fibroids. In
these trials, OBE2109 was observed to have a linear pharmacokinetic, or PK,
profile, a predictable dose-dependent suppression of estradiol, which is a form
of the hormone estrogen, and a dose range that was well-tolerated and provided
symptom relief. A drug’s PK profile refers to the specific way in which a given
drug is handled by the body over time, including the particular patterns of the
specified drug’s absorption, distribution and elimination from the body, while a
drug’s pharmacodynamic, or PD, profile refers to the biochemical and
physiological effects of a drug on the body. We expect OBE2109 to potentially
reduce pain symptoms associated with endometriosis and heavy menstrual bleeding
associated with uterine fibroids, while mitigating bone mineral density loss and
other adverse effects associated with excessive estradiol suppression.

We are currently conducting a multiple-dose, placebo-controlled Phase 2b
clinical trial of OBE2109 in patients with endometriosis across 46 sites in the
United States and 15 sites in Central and Eastern Europe, with a target
enrollment of 330 patients, which we refer to as the EDELWEISS clinical
trial. We expect to report the primary efficacy results from the 24-week
evaluation period of the EDELWEISS clinical trial in the first half of 2018. For
the uterine fibroids indication, we intend to commence a Phase 3 clinical
program with two Phase 3 clinical trials, which we refer to as the PRIMROSE
clinical trials, in the first half of 2017. We expect to report data from these
Phase 3 PRIMROSE clinical trials in the first half of 2020.

There are currently no GnRH receptor antagonists approved for the treatment of
symptoms associated with endometriosis or uterine fibroids. However, we are
aware that AbbVie Inc., Myovant Sciences, Inc. and Astellas Pharma Inc. are
developing GnRH receptor antagonists for the treatment of symptoms associated
with endometriosis or uterine fibroids. Based on publicly available information
for these other products in development, we believe OBE2109 has the following
potential advantages:

• Favorable and consistent PK profile. OBE2109 has been observed to have a  
  consistent PK profile and low variability due to high bioavailability and low
  volume of distribution. We believe some of the competitive product candidates
  have low bioavailability and high volume of distribution due to drug 
  accumulation in fat, which we believe may translate into variable efficacy and
  safety. In addition, OBE2109’s half-life allows for once daily dosing across 
  indications, while one of the competitive product candidates is being 
  developed for twice daily dosing. 

• Personalized dosing. Based on OBE2109’s consistent PK and PD profiles observed
  in preclinical studies and clinical trials, we are currently evaluating 
  personalized dosing that can be tailored to a patient’s individual response. 
  We believe this may allow us to pursue a label for varied dosing based on a 
  patient’s estradiol levels and symptoms. We believe other products in clinical
  development are currently only being evaluated for one or two dosing options,
  which do not appear to account for individual patient characteristics, 
  individual response or patient preference. 

• No systematic need for add-back therapy. For symptoms associated with both
  endometriosis and uterine fibroids, we are developing OBE2109 as a stand-alone
  treatment (without need for add-back therapy) and in association with add-back
  therapy (fixed-dose combination therapy) to fulfill the needs of a broad 
  patient population with endometriosis or uterine fibroids. Add-back therapy 
  refers to the administration of additional estrogen during treatment to 
  counteract the side effects of excessive suppression of estradiol. We believe
  at least one other product in clinical development is only being evaluated as
  a fixed-dose combination therapy that includes add-back therapy, which we 
  believe may not be suitable for treatment of women with poor tolerance or
  contraindications to add-back therapy. We also believe that at least one of 
  the other products in clinical development has demonstrated, at the dose being
  developed in the clinical trials, a bone mineral density loss at 24 weeks of
  treatment comparable to Lupron, a GnRH agonist used for the treatment of 
  endometriosis and uterine fibroids.  

• Compliance benefit. OBE2109 may have an advantage in patient compliance due to
  the lack of observed food effect and the ability to be taken once anytime 
  throughout the day, as compared to certain of the competitive product 
  candidates, which we believe need to be taken on an empty stomach.

OBE001 (nolasiban) to Improve IVF Outcomes

We are developing OBE001 (nolasiban), an oral oxytocin receptor antagonist, to
improve clinical pregnancy and live birth rates in women undergoing IVF. In
Europe, approximately 620,000 IVF treatments were performed in 2012, and in the
United States, approximately 210,000 IVF treatments were performed in 2014. The
IVF process has an overall live birth rate of approximately 33% in the United
States and 21% in Europe.

We in-licensed OBE001 from Merck Serono, which previously completed preclinical
studies and Phase 1 clinical trials in 103 healthy female volunteers that
evaluated the safety and PK profile of OBE001.

In 2016, we completed our 247-patient Phase 2 clinical trial of OBE001 in women
undergoing IVF. In this Phase 2 clinical trial, OBE001 did not reach the primary
endpoint of demonstrating a statistically significant increase in pregnancy rate
at six weeks after embryo transfer. In our post-hoc analysis, which excluded
patients with progesterone levels in the top quartile of the patient pool, we
identified a statistically significant dose-proportional increase in pregnancy
rate at 10 weeks as well as live birth rates. We believe that high progesterone
levels can lead to a premature closing of the embryo implantation window. Based
on these results, we intend to initiate a European Phase 3 clinical trial in 
women undergoing IVF in the first half of 2017 and expect to report data for the
primary endpoint in the second quarter of 2018.

OBE022 for the Treatment of Preterm Labor

We are developing OBE022, an oral and selective prostaglandin F2?, or PGF2?,
receptor antagonist, as a once daily treatment for preterm labor in weeks 24 to
34 of pregnancy.

Preterm labor, defined as the body commencing the birthing process prior to 37
weeks, is characterized by uterine contractions, cervical dilation and rupture
of the fetal membranes that surround and protect the fetus during pregnancy.
Preterm labor can lead to preterm birth, which is currently the leading
worldwide cause of death of newborn babies. According to the National Center for
Health Statistics, approximately 9.6% of babies in the United States were born
preterm in 2014.

We in-licensed OBE022 from Merck Serono in 2015. Based on its PK profile and
efficacy observed in animal models, we believe OBE022 has the potential to
become a first-in-class therapy to suppress preterm labor and delay or avoid
preterm birth, without significant safety concerns for the fetus. We are
currently conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial assessing the safety, tolerability
and PK profile of OBE022 in healthy post-menopausal female volunteers after
single doses of 10 mg to 1,300 mg and multiple doses between 100 mg per day and
1,000 mg per day over 7 consecutive days. Based on preliminary data, OBE022 was
observed to have a favorable safety profile and to be well-tolerated at doses up
to 1,300 mg after single dose administration and up to 1,000 mg per day after
multiple dose administration over 7 days, each of which are above the estimated
clinical effective dose.
