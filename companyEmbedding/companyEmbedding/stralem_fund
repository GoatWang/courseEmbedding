Large Cap Equity Strategy

The investment objective of the US Large Equity StrategyTM (LCES) is to deliver above market returns with less risk during both up and down markets.
INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY

                  The investment philosophy of the Large Cap Equity Strategy   is predicated on the belief that there are four types of market  environments, two types of bull markets and two types of bear markets each  characterized by momentum and valuation factors. Market environments affect portfolio  structure so it is critical to identify and prepare for changing market environments.
GROWTH AND PRESERVATION OF CAPITAL

                  The Large Cap Equity Strategy adds value by purchasing a set of fundamentally solid growth  companies along with a set of companies that deliver strong cash flow  and adjusting  the balance between these two groups depending on where we are in the market  cycle. We define ourselves as conservative growth managers who also focus on preserving  capital during down markets.
This philosophy was developed more than a century ago and  was brought to the firm by a founding partner. It has proven to be successful at  navigating a variety of market environments over a long period of time.

THE INVESTMENT STRATEGY
Stralem manages one strategy, the US Large Cap Equity StrategyTM (LCES),  a long-only conservative growth strategy, fully invested in large-capitalization US equities. The strategy  looks at the market in light of the belief that there are four 
                                types of market environments: two types of bull markets and two types of bear markets, each  characterized by momentum and valuation factors. 
                                By adapting portfolio construction to changing market environments, the philosophy has led to skillfully navigating the full market cycle.

PROPRIETARY RISK MANAGEMENT MODEL

                    Stralem uses a proprietary Relative Growth Value Model to manage risk on both an individual stock and sector level.  This model reinforces our buy and sell discipline protecting us from paying too much for growth or being unwilling to sell winners.

Morningstar categories help investors and investment professionals make meaningful comparisons between funds. The categories make it easier to build well-diversified portfolios, assess potential risk, and identify top-performing funds.

NOTES TO PERFORMANCE
Stralem & Company (“Stralem”) is an independent, SEC  registered investment adviser established in 1966.  The Large Cap Equity  Strategy ™ Composite (LCES) consists of fully discretionary large  capitalization equity accounts. The investment objective of the LCES is to  deliver above market returns with less risk during both up and down markets.  The investment philosophy of the Large Cap Equity Strategy is predicated on the  belief that there are four types of market environments, two types of bull  markets and two types of bear markets each characterized by momentum and  valuation factors. Market environments affect portfolio structure so it is critical  to identify and prepare for changing market environments. The Large Cap Equity  Strategy adds value by purchasing a set of fundamentally solid growth companies  along with a set of companies that deliver strong cash flow and adjusting the  balance between these two groups depending on where we are in the market cycle.  Stralem defines the LCES as a conservative growth strategy that also focuses on  preserving capital during down markets.
For comparison purposes, the composite is measured against the S&P 500 index. The S&P 500 index is widely recognized as a leading indicator of the U.S. equity markets. Prior to 7/1/2014, the Russell 1000 growth index was presented in addition to the S&P 500 as an additional benchmark for the LCES composite. 
Stralem claims compliance with the Global Investment  Performance Standards (GIPS®).  The firm maintains  a complete list and description of composites, which is available upon request.  To obtain a presentation that complies with the requirements of the GIPS  standards and/or a list and description of all firm composites, contact Stralem  at 212-888-8123.
A full disclosure presentation is available through the  following link:

Results are based on fully discretionary accounts under  management, including those accounts no longer with the firm.  Past  performance is not indicative of future results.  Policies for valuing  portfolios, calculating performance, and preparing compliant presentations are  available upon request.
The U.S. Dollar is the currency used to express performance.  Returns are presented both gross and net of management fees and include the  reinvestment of all income. There are portfolios included in the composite  which have directed brokerage arrangements and are not charged trading  commissions by their broker. These portfolios represent approximately 4% of  composite assets. Performance for these accounts do not include transaction  costs, and it has been determined that there is no material impact on composite  performance.  Returns are presented gross of custodial fees and  withholding taxes but net of all trading expenses. Gross returns will be  reduced by investment advisory fees and other expenses that may be incurred in  the management of the account.  Actual investment advisory fees incurred  by clients may vary.  Net of fee performance is calculated using a  weighted-average fee based on actual fees. From 2008 to 2015, net performance  is calculated using a model fee of 0.70%. From 2006 to 2008, net performance is  calculated using a weighted-average fee based on actual fees. Prior to 2006,  net performance is calculated using the highest client's management fee in the  composite. From 2000 - 2005 the highest fee was 1.50%. Prior to 2000 the highest  fee was 1.00%. A fee schedule is an integral part of a complete  presentation and is described in Part 2 of the firm’s ADV, which is available  upon request.

In An Aging Bull Market Don't Slam the Brakes, 
Proceed With Caution
The  market goes up over time, but not all the time. That's been easy to forget over  the past eight years. When bull markets get long in the tooth like the current  one, times get tough for investors who lean toward caution.

Navigating Todays Volatile Stock Market
In the aftermath of the Financial Crisis, the stock market returned nearly 250% from the trough in 2009, and experienced remarkably smooth upward trajectory. More recently, market conditions have changed and volatility has staged a comeback. What were the drivers of this historic return, how was this period unique in stock market history and what should investors consider going forward?

Irene Bergman Obituary
 With great sadness Stralem mourns the loss of our colleague, Irene Bergman, on 
                        September 29, 2016. Bloomberg Article > New York Times Obituary > 
The Oldest Woman on Wall Street
 Celebrating her 100th birthday on August 2, 2015, Miss Irene Bergman, SVP,  financial advisor, reflects on 
                        her long career in financial services and more than four decades with Stralem. Still offering advice to 
                        clients today, she says the secret to success is "Patience and the discipline to stick to your philosophy 
                      even in the face of irrational markets."Read more > Play video >

Mutual fund investing  involves risk. Principal loss is possible. The Fund’s investment objectives,  risks, charges and expenses must be considered carefully before investing.

Advised by Stralem & Company, an independent asset manager founded in 1966, Stralem Equity Fund is designed to deliver strong investment performance during both up and down markets with reduced volatility, the Large Cap Equity Strategy (LCES)  looks at the market in light of the the belief that there are four types of market environments: two types of bull markets and two types of bear markets, each  characterized by momentum and valuation factors. By adapting portfolio construction to changing market environments, the philosophy has led to skillfully navigating the full market cycle. Learn more





Mutual fund investing involves risk, including the potential loss of principal.
An investor should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fund carefully before investing. Click here for a  Prospectus/Summary Prospectus, which contains this and other important information, or call 866-822-9555. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing. The Fund may not be suitable for all investors. 
*As of 6/30/17,  Morningstar rating of 3 stars overall, 3, 2 and 4 stars (STEFX)  for the three-, five- and ten-year periods among 1,223, 1,223, 1,080 and 802 large blend funds, respectively. The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three- year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.
