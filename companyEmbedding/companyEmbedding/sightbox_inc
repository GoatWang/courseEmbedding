What Contacts Do You Wear?



Daily Disposable Lenses
I put in a fresh pair of lenses every day.


Extended Wear Disposable Lenses
I change my lenses every 2-4 weeks.




                            Sightbox is designed to deliver contacts to daily disposable wearers exclusively.

See all frequently asked questions




        	Do I need a prescription to buy contact lenses?
        

        	Can I use my current optometrist or office?
        

        	How is Sightbox different than vision insurance?
        

        	How does Sightbox pricing compare?
        















        	Yes. Current U.S. law, mandated by the FDA, requires all contact lens purchases to be verified against a valid contact lens prescription. Prescriptions for contact lenses are only available after receiving an eye exam, which is included with all Sightbox memberships.
        

        	Yes. As long as your prescription is for contact lenses carried by Sightbox, we can use it to begin shipping lenses to you after you sign up. Since all Sightbox memberships include an annual eye exam, we will wait until your current prescription nears expiration before reaching out to schedule your next exam on your behalf.
        

        	Vision insurance companies charge a monthly fee and, in return, will require co-pays, mailing in rebates and other hassles. They simply 'contribute' toward the cost of an eye exam and a 'portion' of your contact lens expense. Most plans do not cover a contact lens fitting. Often, for contact wearers, vision insurance bills you for more than they will pay out. We encourage you to do the math on your plan. Sightbox is probably a better deal. Remember that your Sightbox contact lens delivery is always free and your first box is shipped overnight.
             
            One misconception we like to point out, is that some people believe they need vision insurance to protect them from eye injuries or other health issues related to your eyes - your medical insurance will do that. We encourage you to give your medical insurance provider a call to find out for yourself.
        

        	The upfront cost of getting contact lenses can be prohibitive for many wearers. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) reports that nearly 40% of Americans don't get an regular eye health exam because of the upfront cost. This is where we come in, Sightbox finances the upfront cost of an eye exam AND we deliver your annual supply of lenses right to your doorstep. This allows you to spread out your payments over time.
             
WITHOUT Sightbox, you will likely pay upwards of $200 for an eye exam and contact lens fitting, and between $400 and $1070 for an annual supply of contact lenses, depending on the type and brand. All-in, you can pay between $600 and $1270 in one day.
             
WITH Sightbox, you will receive an eye exam and your first delivery of contacts starting as low as $39. We finance your vision care so that the upfront cost is more manageable. Over the course of a year, your total annual expense with Sightbox will fall between $470 and $1070 per year. Prices vary based on the lenses you're prescribed.
        

 




What Contacts Do You Wear?



Daily Disposable Lenses
I put in a fresh pair of lenses every day.


Extended Wear Disposable Lenses
I change my lenses every 2-4 weeks.




                            Sightbox is designed to deliver contacts to daily disposable wearers exclusively.

Sightbox Privacy Policy
Last updated: November 27, 2016
This Privacy Policy describes how information about you is collected, used and disclosed by Sightbox, Inc. This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect when you visit our website and mobile application (collectively, the "Services"), or when you otherwise interact with us.
We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you a notification). We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Services or otherwise interact with us to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.
Information Collection
Information You Provide to Us. We collect information you provide directly to us.  For example, we collect information when you create a membership account ("Membership Plan"), participate in any interactive features of the Services, fill out a form, participate in a contest or promotion, request customer support or otherwise communicate with us.   The types of information we collect may include your name (and/or patient's name if different from your own), email address, gender, date of birth, postal address, phone number, credit card information, contact lens prescription, your health care provider's name, and any other information you choose to provide.
Information We Collect Automatically When You Use the Services. When you access or use our Services, we automatically collect information about you, and we may associate it with information that you provide directly to us, including:

Log Information:  We collect log information about your use of the Services, including the type of browser you use, access times, pages viewed, your IP address and the page you visited before navigating to our Services.
Device Information:  We collect information about the computer or mobile device you use to access our Services, including the hardware model, operating system and version, unique device identifiers and mobile network information.
Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies:  We use various technologies to collect information, including cookies and web beacons.  Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that help us improve our Services and your experience, see which areas and features of our Services are popular and count visits.  Web beacons are electronic images that may be used in our Services or emails and help deliver cookies, count visits and understand usage and campaign effectiveness.  For more information about cookies, and how to disable them, please see "Your Choices" below.

Information We Collect From Other Sources. We may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through our Services.  For example, we may receive your contact lens prescription from your eye care professional. Additionally, if you create or log into your account through a social media site, we will have access to certain information from that site, such as your name, account information and friends lists, in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by such social media site.
Use of Information
We may use information about you for various purposes, including to:

Provide, maintain and improve our Services;
Send you technical notices, updates, security alerts and support and administrative messages;
Respond to your comments, questions and requests and provide customer service;
Communicate with you about products, services, offers, promotions, rewards and events offered by Sightbox and others, and provide news and information we think will be of interest to you;

Carry out any other purpose described to you at the time the information was collected.

Sharing of Information
We may share information about you as follows or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy:

With vendors, consultants and other service providers who need access to such information to carry out work on our behalf;
In response to a request for information if we believe disclosure is in accordance with, or required by, any applicable law, regulation or legal process;
If we believe your actions are inconsistent with our user agreements or policies, or to protect the rights, property and safety of Sightbox or others;
In connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company;
Between and among Sightbox and our current and future parents, affiliates, subsidiaries and other companies under common control and ownership; and
With your consent or at your direction.

We may also share aggregated or de-identified information, which cannot reasonably be used to identify you.
Social Sharing Features
The Services may offer social sharing features and other integrated tools (such as the Facebook "Like" button), which let you share actions you take on our Services with other media, and vice versa.  Your use of such features enables the sharing of information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the entity that provides the social sharing feature.  For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the entities that provide these features.
Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others
We may allow others to provide analytics services and serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet and in applications.  These entities may use cookies, web beacons, device identifiers and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Services and other websites and applications, including your IP address, web browser, mobile network information, pages viewed, time spent on pages or in apps, links clicked and conversion information.  This information may be used by Sightbox and others to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests on our Services and other websites and better understand your online activity.

If you wish to deactivate your account, please contact us, but note that we may retain certain information as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.  We may also retain cached or archived copies of information about you for a certain period of time.
Cookies. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default.  If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies. Please note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of our Services.
Promotional Communications. You may opt out of receiving promotional emails or text messages from Sightbox by following the instructions in those emails or text messages or by contacting us. If you opt out, we may still send you non-promotional emails, such as those about your account or our ongoing business relations.

Here's what some of them have to say about us.

 
 
 












MELISSA B.
Rahway, New Jersey
"I figured that a company making my life this much easier would cost an arm and a leg, but it actually doesn't. Sightbox actually made it easier to work eye care into my budget. Everyone's got that one thing they forget to budget for and for me it's often eye care. I open the last box of contacts, not realizing it's the last box..."

DENISE F.
El Paso, Texas
"Becoming self employed and not having vision insurance meant that I would have to dig into my "investment fund" in order to get an updated prescription and contacts. I came across a Sightbox ad on Pinterest, did a few calculations and not only would I be saving money in the long run, but now I had the opportunity to make affordable monthly payments while doing so."

SARA P.
Albuquerque, New Mexico
"I am absolutely elated with the ease and benefit of Sightbox! No more $270+ exam/fitting fees that hit my bank account at once. Not only is Sightbox helping me with a more affordable benefit of paying monthly but the entire process of signing up, going in for my exam and fitting, and getting my contacts has been a breeze because they handle everything.  I will be recommending this service to all my friends and family as they have gained a customer for life!"

PATRICK H.
Independence, Missouri
"Sightbox is an easy affordable way to get contact lenses without having to pay a fortune up front. The process was easy and the support very helpful.  Since I have a prescription that limits my lens choice to two different manufacturers world wide, finding a company like this that would work with that supplier was a very pleasent surprise."

ASSANTE S.
New York, New York
"I don't have any vision insurance, or understanding of how expensive things are out of pocket. I've been overdue for about a year to get a new exam, prescription and lenses. Sightbox made it easy for me to know exactly what I was getting for my money throughout the year."
