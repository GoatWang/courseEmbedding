youtube video of John H. Kispert’s talk available here!
 
Part of our series featuring senior level executives with deep ties to Japan.
Spansion is a Sunnyvale-based leading embedded systems maker that grew out of a Fujitsu-AMD joint venture. In what has been called “one of the most dramatic and unlikely turnarounds in Silicon Valley history,” after joining the company in 2009 CEO John H. Kispert brought Spansion out of bankruptcy to become a strong industry player with over $1 billion in sales and 10,000 customers worldwide.
In 2013, Spansion made a bold move, purchasing Fujitsu’s microcontroller and analog business for $175 million. The deal has expanded Spansion’s work force by more than 1,000, and it puts the company in the unique position of being able to offer embedded systems technologies, ranging from Flash memory, microcontrollers and analogs and system-on-chip solutions.
CEO John H. Kispert will share the approach his company has taken to integrate two companies with vastly different cultures, geographical markets and product lines. He’ll focus on some of the particular considerations Spansion has made given that acquisitions of a piece of a Japanese company by a foreign firm is not something common in Japan. He will also share some of the history of the company, and how as a leader in the memory business Japan has always been an important part of Spansion’s strategy. And having had intensive interactions with Japanese customers and suppliers throughout his career in the semiconductor industry, he will share some of the things that he has found most effective in forming strong working relationships with Japanese.
John H. Kispert
John H. Kispert is the chief executive officer at Spansion and serves as a member of the Spansion board. He joined Spansion in 2009 and led Spansion’s turnaround, successfully refocusing the company’s strategy for growth.
Kispert has a broad background spanning executive and operational roles at semiconductor and technology companies. Prior to joining Spansion, Kispert spent 13 years in a number of executive management roles at KLA-Tencor, including president and chief operations officer. Prior to KLA-Tencor, Kispert held several senior management positions with IBM. He serves on the board of directors of Gigamon Inc.
Kispert received his bachelor’s degree in political science from Grinnell College and his MBA from the University of California, Los Angeles.
Spansion
Spansion is a global leader in Flash memory-based embedded systems solutions. Spansion’s Flash memory, microcontrollers, mixed-signal and analog products drive the development of faster, more intelligent and energy efficient electronics. Spansion is at the heart of electronics systems, connecting, controlling, storing and powering everything from automotive electronics and industrial systems to the highly interactive and immersive consumer devices that are enriching people’s daily lives.

This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.
