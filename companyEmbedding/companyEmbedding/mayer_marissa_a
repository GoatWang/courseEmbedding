Early life and education[edit]
Mayer was born in Wausau, Wisconsin, the daughter of Margaret Mayer, art teacher of Finnish descent,[13] and Michael Mayer, an environmental engineer who worked for water companies.[14][15][16] Her grandfather, Clem Mayer, had polio when he was 7 and served as mayor of Jackson, Wisconsin, for 32 years.[17][18][19] She has a younger brother.[14] She would later describe herself as having been "painfully shy" as a child and teenager.[20] She "never had fewer than one after-school activity per day," participating in ballet, ice-skating, piano, swimming, debate, and Brownies.[14] During middle school and high school, she took piano and ballet lessons, the latter of which taught her "criticism and discipline, poise, and confidence."[20] At an early age, she showed an interest in math and science.[21]
When she was attending Wausau West High School, Mayer was on the curling team and the precision dance team.[20] She excelled in chemistry, calculus, biology, and physics.[22] She took part in extracurricular activities, becoming president of her high school's Spanish club, treasurer of the Key Club, captain of the debate team, and captain of the pom-pom squad.[20] Her high school debate team won the Wisconsin state championship and the pom-pom squad was the state runner-up.[17] During high school, she worked as a grocery clerk.[23] After graduating from high school in 1993,[24] Mayer was selected by Tommy Thompson, then the Governor of Wisconsin, as one of the state's two delegates to attend the National Youth Science Camp in West Virginia.[25]
Intending to become a pediatric neurosurgeon,[26] Mayer took pre-med classes at Stanford University.[20] She later switched her major from pediatric neuroscience to symbolic systems,[27] a major which combined philosophy, cognitive psychology, linguistics, and computer science.[14] At Stanford, she danced in the university ballet's Nutcracker, was a member of parliamentary debate, volunteered at children's hospitals, and helped bring computer science education to Bermuda's schools.[28] During her junior year, she taught a class in symbolic systems, with Eric S. Roberts as her supervisor. The class was so well received by students that Roberts asked Mayer to teach another class over the summer.[20] Mayer went on to graduate with honors from Stanford with a BS in symbolic systems in 1997[27][28] and an MS in computer science in 1999.[29] For both degrees, her specialization was in artificial intelligence. For her undergraduate thesis, she built travel-recommendation software that advised users in natural-sounding human language.[26] In 2009, the Illinois Institute of Technology granted Mayer an honoris causa doctorate degree in recognition of her work in the field of search.[30][31]
Mayer interned at SRI International in Menlo Park, California, and Ubilab, UBS's research lab based in Zurich, Switzerland.[26] She holds several patents in artificial intelligence and interface design.[32][33]
Career[edit]
Google[edit]

After graduating from Stanford, Mayer received 14 job offers,[27] including a teaching job at Carnegie Mellon University[28] and a consulting job at McKinsey & Company.[20] She joined Google in 1999 as employee number 20 and was the company's first female engineer.[34][35] She started out writing code and overseeing small teams of engineers, developing and designing Google's search offerings.[11] She became known for her attention to detail[36] which helped land her a promotion to product manager,[37] and later became director of consumer web products.[17][38] She oversaw the layout of Google's well-known, unadorned search homepage.[38][39][40] She was also on the three-person team responsible for Google AdWords, which is an algorithm used by advertisers to get insight into the products consumers want. AdWords helped deliver 96% of the company's revenue in the first quarter of 2011.

In 2002, Mayer started the Associate Product Manager (APM) program, a Google mentorship program aimed to recruit new talents and cultivate and train them for leadership roles within the company. Each year, Mayer selected a number of junior employees for the two-year program, which would see them take on a number of extracurricular assignments and intensive evening classes.[20][36][41] Notable graduates of the program include Bret Taylor and Justin Rosenstein.[41] In 2005 she became Vice President of Search Products and User Experience.[42] Mayer held key roles in Google Search, Google Images, Google News, Google Maps, Google Books, Google Product Search, Google Toolbar, iGoogle, and Gmail.[43]
Mayer was the vice president of Google Search Products and User Experience until the end of 2010, when she was asked by then-CEO Eric Schmidt to head the Local, Maps, and Location Services.[36][44] In 2011, she secured Google's acquisition of survey site Zagat for $125 million.[36] While Mayer was working at Google, she taught introductory computer programming at Stanford and mentored students at the East Palo Alto Charter School.[17][26] She was awarded the Centennial Teaching Award and the Forsythe Award from Stanford.[45]
Yahoo[edit]

On July 16, 2012, Mayer was appointed president and CEO of Yahoo!, effective the following day. She is also a member of the company's board of directors.[46][47] To simplify the bureaucratic process and "make the culture the best version of itself", Mayer launched a new online program called PB&J. It collects employee complaints, as well as their votes on problems in the office; if a problem generates at least 50 votes, online management automatically investigates the matter.[48] In February 2013, Mayer oversaw a major personnel policy change at Yahoo! that required all remote-working employees to convert to in-office roles.[49] Having worked from home toward the end of her pregnancy, Mayer returned to work after giving birth to a boy, and built a mother's room next to her office suite—Mayer was consequently criticized for the telecommuting ban, in spite of the fact many remote employees were largely unavailable and unresponsive weeks at a time.[50] In April 2013, Mayer changed Yahoo!'s maternity leave policy, lengthening its time allowance and providing a cash bonus to parents.[51] CNN noted this was in line with other Silicon Valley companies, such as Facebook and Google.[52][53] Mayer has been criticized for many of her management decisions in pieces by The New York Times and The New Yorker.[54][55]
On May 20, 2013, Mayer led Yahoo! to acquire Tumblr in a $1.1 billion acquisition.[56][57] In February 2016, Yahoo! acknowledged that the value of Tumblr had fallen by $230 million since it was acquired. In July 2013, Yahoo! reported a fall in revenues, but a rise in profits compared with the same period in the previous year. Reaction on Wall Street was muted, with shares falling 1.7%.[58] In September 2013, it was reported that the stock price of Yahoo! had doubled over the 14 months since Mayer's appointment.[59] However, much of this growth may be attributed to Yahoo!'s stake in the Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group, which was acquired before Mayer's tenure.[60]

In November 2013, Mayer instituted a performance review system based on a bell curve ranking of employees, suggesting that managers rank their employees on a bell curve, with those at the low end being fired.[61][62] Employees complained that some managers were viewing the process as mandatory.[62] In February 2016, a former Yahoo! employee filed a lawsuit against the company claiming that Yahoo's firing practices have violated both California and federal labor laws.[63]
In 2014, Mayer was ranked sixth on Fortune's 40 under 40 list,[64] and was ranked the 16th most-powerful businesswoman in the world that year according to the same publication.[65] In March 2016 Fortune would name Mayer as one of the world's most disappointing leaders.[66][54][55] Yahoo! stocks continued to fall by more than 30% throughout 2015, while 12 key executives left the company.[67]
In December 2015, the New York-based hedge fund SpringOwl, a shareholder in Yahoo Inc., released a statement arguing that Mayer be replaced as CEO.[68] Starboard Value, an activist investing firm that owns a stake in Yahoo, likewise wrote a scathing letter regarding Mayer's performance at Yahoo.[69] By January 2016, it was further estimated that Yahoo!'s core business has been worth less than zero dollars for the past few quarters.[70] In February 2016, Mayer confirmed that Yahoo! was considering the possibility of selling its core business.[71] In March 2017, it was reported that Mayer could receive a $23 million termination package upon the sale of Yahoo! to Verizon.[72]
Mayer announced her resignation on June 13, 2017.[73] In spite of large losses in advertising revenue at Yahoo! and a 50% reduction in staff during her 5 years as CEO, Mayer was paid a total of $239 million over that time, mainly in stock and stock options.[74] On the day of her resignation, Mayer publicly highlighted many of the company's achievements during her tenure, including: creating $43B in market capitalization, tripling Yahoo stock, growing mobile users to over 650 million, building a $1.5B mobile ad business, and transforming Yahoo's culture.[73]

Allegations of WARN Act violations and gender-based discrimination[edit]
Scott Ard, a prominent editorial director, fired from Yahoo! in 2015, filed a lawsuit alleging that “Mayer encouraged and fostered the use of (an employee performance-rating system) to accommodate management’s subjective biases and personal opinions, to the detriment of Yahoo!’s male employees." He claimed that, prior to his firing, he had received "fully satisfactory" performance reviews since starting at the company in 2011 as head of editorial programming for Yahoo!'s home page; however, he was relieved of his role, which was given to a woman who had been recently hired.[75][76][77]
An earlier lawsuit was filed by Gregory Anderson, who was fired in 2014, alleging the company’s performance management system was arbitrary and unfair and disguised layoffs as terminations for the purpose of evading state and federal WARN Acts, making it the first WARN Act and gender discrimination lawsuit Yahoo! and Mayer faced in 2016.[78][79][80]
Boards and honors[edit]
As well as sitting on the boards of directors of Walmart and Jawbone, Mayer also sits on several non-profit boards such as Cooper–Hewitt, National Design Museum, New York City Ballet, San Francisco Ballet, and San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.[81][82][83][84] Mayer actively invests in technology companies, including crowd-sourced design retailer Minted,[85][86] live video platform Airtime,[86] wireless power startup uBeam,[86] online DIY community/e-commerce company Brit + Co.,[86][87] mobile payments processor Square,[86] home décor site One Kings Lane,[86][88] genetic testing company Natera,[86] and nootropics and biohacking company Nootrobox.[89]
Mayer was named to Fortune magazine's annual list of America's 50 Most Powerful Women in Business in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 with ranks at 50, 44, 42, 38, 14 and 8 respectively.[90] In 2008, at age 33, she was the youngest woman ever listed. Mayer was named one of Glamour Magazine's Women of the Year in 2009.[91] She was listed in Forbes Magazine's List of The World's 100 Most Powerful Women in 2012, 2013 and 2014, with ranks of 20, 32 and 18 respectively. In September 2013, Mayer became the first CEO of a Fortune 500 company to be featured in a Vogue magazine spread.[14] In 2013, she was also named in the Time 100 and became the first woman listed as number one on Fortune magazine's annual list of the top 40 business stars under 40 years old.[92] Mayer eventually made Fortune magazine history in 2013, as the only person to feature in all three of its annual lists during the same year: Businessperson of the Year (No. 10), Most Powerful Women (at No. 8), and 40 Under 40 (No. 1) at the same time.[93] On 24 December 2015, Mayer was listed by UK-based company Richtopia at number 14 in the list of 500 Most Influential CEO's.[94] In March 2016, in contrast, Fortune named Mayer as one of the world's most disappointing leaders.[66]
Personal life[edit]
Mayer married lawyer and investor Zachary Bogue on December 12, 2009.[37][95][96] On the day Yahoo! announced her hiring, Mayer revealed that she was pregnant;[97][98][99] she gave birth to a baby boy on September 30, 2012.[100] Although she asked for suggestions via social media,[101] the name Macallister was eventually chosen for her baby's name from an existing list.[102] On December 10, 2015, Mayer announced that she had given birth to identical twin girls,[103][104] Marielle and Sylvana.[105]
Mayer is Lutheran,[106] but said, referencing Vince Lombardi's "Your God, your family and the Green Bay Packers" quote, her priorities are "God, family and Yahoo!, except I'm not that religious, so it's really family and Yahoo!."[107] Since 2008, Mayer has lived on the 38th-floor penthouse suite at the Four Seasons Hotel in San Francisco.[20][43]

I think the most interesting thing is what happens next.”Marissa MayerSynopsisMarissa Mayer, born on May 30, 1975, in Wausau, Wisconsin, was appointed CEO of Yahoo in 2012. Prior to joining Yahoo, she spent 13 years at Google, where her work in product development largely contributed to the site's unique look and feel. At the time of Mayer's Yahoo appointment, she was one of only 20 female CEOs in charge of a Fortune 500 company.Early LifeBorn in Wausau, Wisconsin, on May 30, 1975, Marissa Ann Mayer has described her early years as a small-town childhood, complete with ballet lessons, ice skating, Brownies and debate team competitions. The daughter of an engineer and an art teacher, Mayer demonstrated an early affinity for math and science. While at Wausau West High, she worked at a local grocery store, where she memorized the number codes for produce items in order to streamline the checkout process. Although she grew up thinking she would be a doctor, while at Stanford University, Mayer developed a passion for computers and went on to earn both a Bachelor of Science in symbolic systems and an Master of Science in computer science, with a specialization in artificial intelligence. But it was perhaps her research internships at SRI International in Menlo Park, California, and the UBS research lab in Zurich that helped her net 14 job offers fresh out of grad school.Professional SuccessMayer's 14th job offer came from Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who quizzed her on artificial intelligence while sitting at a ping-pong table that the company used for conferences. In 1999, Google wasn't yet an Internet search giant. In fact, the company had only 19 employees. Upon accepting an offer to lead Google's user interface and Web server teams, Mayer became the company's 20th employee and its first female engineer. Her tenure at Google involved work on some of the company's most recognizable and successful products, including Google Maps, Google Earth, Street View, Google News and Gmail. Known as a fashionista with an eye for design, Mayer is widely credited for the unique look and feel that has come to characterize the Google experience. For example, she was responsible for approving each "doodle" (the custom logos commemorating holidays and events) appearing on the Google home page. Mayer spent more than a decade at Google accumulating accolades for her work ethic, eye for detail and vision. In a 2008 interview, however, she seemed to be looking ahead to her next act. "I helped build Google," Mayer said, "but I don't like to rest on [my] laurels. I think the most interesting thing is what happens next." What happened next for Mayer captured tremendous interest both in Silicon Valley and around the world. In July 2012, she was appointed president and CEO of Yahoo, a company besieged by declining stock prices, layoffs and slowing ad revenue. Tasked with course-correcting the company, Mayer became the fifth CEO hired by Yahoo in five years, as well as one of only 20 women running a Fortune 500 company. As a female technology CEO, Mayer follows in the footsteps of former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina and former eBay CEO Meg Whitman. And many believe that she just may have what it takes to turn Yahoo around. In September of 2013, Mayer was ranked number one by Fortune magazine in its annual "40 Under 40" list of business leaders. It was also during this month that Mayer posed in the September issue of Vogue magazine. The photo featured Mayer on a chaise lounge in a form-fitting blue dress. The divisive image brought about a debate over whether the seductive pose took away from her authoritative role as a CEO.Personal LifeAdding even more interest to the appointment, Mayer and her husband, venture capitalist Zachary Bogue, gave birth to their first child—a baby boy named Macallister—on September 30, 2012.In September 2015, Mayer wrote on her Tumblr blog, that she was pregnant with identical twins and would give birth in December. “Since my pregnancy has been healthy and uncomplicated and since this is a unique time in Yahoo’s transformation, I plan to approach the pregnancy and delivery as I did with my son three years ago, taking limited time away and working throughout,” Mayer wrote. Mayer’s plan to take a limited time off after her pregnancy sparked a debate in the press and on social media about the length of maternity leave for working moms. After the birth of her first child in 2012, Mayer took only two weeks off before returning to work. For Yahoo employees, however, she doubled paid maternity leave from eight weeks to 16 weeks in 2013. “Moving forward, there will be a lot to do for both my family and for Yahoo; both will require hard work and thoughtful prioritization,” Mayer wrote on Tumblr. “However, I’m extremely energized by and dedicated to both my family and Yahoo and will do all that is necessary and more to help both thrive.  The future looks extremely bright on both fronts.”Fact CheckWe strive for accuracy and fairness.

The Age of the Product Manager
















Marissa Mayer’s “flaws” are part of what makes her a new, better kind of CEO.

        By David Auerbach

A new Vanity Fair profile of Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer describes someone who is not a manager of people so much as a manager of ideas. As a Google product manager and later executive, Mayer was credited with enforcing a rigid vision across Google’s user-facing properties; she became the linchpin of integration between products, and she kept tabs on every engineer and designer, high and low. She is also accused of being stubbornly single-minded, ignoring others’ opinions, disrespecting seniority and prestige, and being more focused on vision than on necessary compromises or Yahoo’s quarterly earnings.






David Auerbach


David Auerbach is a writer and software engineer based in New York, and a fellow at New America.






 


Mayer is far from perfect, but you will never find a great product manager with all those strengths and none of those weaknesses. In the case of someone like Mayer or Steve Jobs—who was accused of many of the same flaws—those strengths and weaknesses make for far better results than the executive alternative, whether it’s a corporate hatchet woman like HP’s Carly Fiorina, an overpaid functionary like Citi’s Vikram Pandit, or an unrepentant economy wrecker like Lehman’s Dick Fuld, not to mention undistinguished wheel tillers like Apple’s John Sculley and his current reincarnation, Tim Cook. Whatever Mayer does with Yahoo, she at least has a fighting chance to revive the company, something that could never have been said of her predecessors.


Mayer’s approach is not so different from that of Jobs. Though a CEO, Jobs had a far greater involvement in the creative side of Apple than his counterparts did, and Apple’s boom came with Jobs combining a high-level vision with concrete ideas about user experience and design. Jobs had excellent programmers, excellent designers, and excellent raw technology. But unless you can coordinate and reconcile many individual visions, large-scale projects will drown in competing agendas and the incompatible ideas of people on different teams. Many sources have stressed how intimately involved Mayer has been in the details of the user experience both at Google and Yahoo, which often frustrated individual contributors. In his own profile of Mayer, Business Insider’s Nicholas Carlson saw this style of comprehensive product management as a defect, but the truth is quite the opposite. Her confidence and meticulousness are far more valuable than the business connections of the overentitled, macho executives she replaced.

Jobs and Mayer are exceptionally visible figures and not representative of a typical high-quality PM, but I want to draw attention to how their most valuable skills have very little to do with the traditional values people associate with an executive. Their skills came from working in the trenches, not in boardrooms.



Recognizing that people management is not superior to product management, many startups have separated the two.



In fact, Google has acted as an incubator for many product managers who have gone on to be major forces in the tech world—not just Mayer, but Bret Taylor (Google Maps co-creator and later CTO of Facebook), Paul Buchheit (a lead developer of Gmail and Google AdSense, and now a partner at Y Combinator), and Emily White (incoming COO of Snapchat). And Mayer was integral in nurturing that talent as founder of Google’s Associate Product Manager program, which Wired called “an incubation system for tech rock stars”—including Taylor, who was one of Google's early APMs.


The product manager ideally does not take credit for the deep skills of the people with whom she works. Instead, she works as a peer to draw the necessary connections between them and keep them in sync. She pays attention to the existing self-organization of small groups of smart people and sympathetically exerts soft power to try to leverage their skills on a larger scale, without wrecking what they already do well. She does not build from the ground up, but helps fit pieces together—horizontally. (This less dominant, more agile approach—call it “peer-to-peer managing”—may be part of why teams with more women seem to have higher collective intelligence.)




The good PM provides a forum for talented engineers to do the right work in the right way. Without it, individuals literally cannot do quality work, and you end up with something like healthcare.gov.

A product manager is not a manager in the traditional executive sense. Traditional corporate culture is tremendously vertical. Since the 1980s, business culture has celebrated the CEO, the manager of a company who knows how to delegate and set a grand vision that the people under him then execute. After the Great Recession and George W. Bush’s “CEO presidency,” delegation and vision no longer seem like enough. The big top-down visions extolled in the vertical corporate model are cheap—the devil is in the details, as the last 10 years of Steve Ballmer’s mission statements should prove.


In the case of bad product management, you still see the problems of underbaked vision. Take the head of game studio 22cans, Peter Molyneux, who’s a bit of a Barnum-esque figure in gaming. I was reading up on his latest project, the Kickstarter-funded “god game” Godus, when I saw a conversation in a Godus beta update video that sent shivers down my spine: Molyneux asks one of his programmers for an update, the programmer starts to talk about the work there is to do, but Molyneux cuts him off, and then suggests that the programmers race each other to completion. The programmer seems adrift; Molyneux seems clueless and imperious. (For contrast, the affable PM-engineer interaction in this Prison Architect alpha update video bespeaks a team that’s honest with each other about things both good and bad.)


Pretty much every new Microsoft product of the last 10 years fell prey to lousy execution of a half-baked vision, from the Kin to the Surface to Windows 8. But you can see difficulties of product management affecting other companies as well. Facebook’s user experience is simply a mess, still not offering any significant search capabilities and now driven by a desperate need to make amends for its disappointing IPO and subsequent share price flat-lining. Google’s user experience seems to be splitting in two, with its traditionally austere search properties bearing little resemblance to the more gaudy presentation of Google Plus, with Gmail and YouTube seemingly caught in the middle.


Google’s technological acumen is second to none, but when it comes to coherent product design, Apple is the one to beat. Google’s purchase of Motorola Mobility hints at its recognition that it would never be able to coordinate closely enough with another company to make the ideal hardware for the Android OS. With user interfaces now several orders of magnitude more complicated than any pre-1980s electronic device, the details are now the vision.


Another way that the vertical corporate model misleads is by creating the impression that executives control the people below them. It’s not President Obama’s fault that contractors made such a hash of healthcare.gov, but it is his fault for not ensuring that there was a qualified person supervising the project end to end—the role Jeffrey Zients has now belatedly taken on. The legacy of Henry Ford is to think of people as cogs in a machine, each cog more or less capable of being switched out at will. In this model, low-level workers are interchangeable, only becoming critical as they rise up the corporate ladder. Far from the case in reality, this is especially untrue in high-innovation sectors, where skills vary so wildly that one programmer can sometimes do the work of 10 others, and the departure of a single key programmer can be far more destructive than the loss of half a dozen managers.

            That is a pretty strong trend recently where companies are run by people who make decisions based on their internal ideology rather than expectations and needs of customers.  More...

Recognizing that people management is not superior to product management, many startups have separated the two disciplines. Because performance reviews, HR headaches, and recruitment slogging are distractions from actual innovation, these startups—including Google—created dedicated people management positions. Meanwhile, they made product managers into individual contributors or supervisors of small teams defined not by organizational structure but by deliverables.


Because a PM has a disproportionate impact on setting strategy and deciding what work actually gets done, she is the key to success or failure. She can singlehandedly ruin a project. I remember, none too fondly, a PM for whom “soft power” was an oxymoron; he led by yelling, bullying, and backstabbing those who got in his way. He was eventually forced out of the group after the toxic synergy of his personal and professional defects forced an exodus of talent. This goes to show that traditional managerial politics do not produce innovation. The Vanity Fair article makes the telling point that Mayer tended to be more generous to her talented juniors than to other executives—precisely the opposite of the executive back-scratching mentality. To be a great PM, you don’t have to be especially nice to your co-workers. But you do have to value them.

Marissa Mayer Has a Secret Weapon | WIRED




Marissa Mayer Has a Secret WeaponSubscribeSearchPhotoVideoBackchannelMagazineWired InsiderGet Our NewsletterWIRED's biggest stories, delivered to your inbox.submitAuthor: Steven LevySteven Levybusiness07.23.1210:25 amMarissa Mayer Has a Secret WeaponPhoto:Telstar LogisticsSharesharetweetcommentemailAuthor: Steven LevySteven Levybusiness07.23.1210:25 amMarissa Mayer Has a Secret WeaponPhoto:Telstar LogisticsEveryone agrees that one of Marissa Mayer’s most urgent tasks at Yahoo will be hiring great managers and product people. Yahoo’s talent pool has been reduced to puddles, as the best techies have gone elsewhere and promising newcomers have come down with colorblindness when it comes to purple. Some people wonder whether even Mayer can lure back the brains.Read More:With Mayer at Helm, Will Geeks Give Yahoo a Second Glance?Dear Marissa Mayer, Please Kill the '!' on Yahoo!It turns out, though, that the new CEO has a unique advantage in fulfilling this quest. For the past decade, she has been the doyen of a collection of some of the most talented young engineers and product managers in all of technology. These are the hand-selected prime talents of an accelerated leadership program at Google called Associate Product Manager (APM).Mayer invented this program, led it and never gave it up. It was a key part of her tenure at Google. And now she may reap some benefits.Don’t be fooled by the modest title, prefixed by that timid word “associate.” The most coveted entry post at Google is spelled APM. This is an incubation system for tech rock stars. “The APM program is one of our core values – I’d like to think of one of them as the eventual CEO of the company,” Google’s Executive Chair Eric Schmidt once told me.Consider the first APM, a fresh Stanford grad named Brian Rakowski. He became a key leader of the team that built the Chrome browser and now is the VP of the Chrome operation. The second was Wesley Chan, who made Google Toolbar a success, then launched Google Analytics and Google Voice. He’s now picking winners for Google Ventures. Another early APM was Bret Taylor, who earned his bones by launching Google Maps. He left Google and co-founded Friendfeed, then become the Chief Technical Officer of Facebook.Though not all APMs achieve such glory, they are generally recognized as elite. At any given time at Google, there are over 40 APMs active in the two-year program. And since Google has been hiring them since the early 2000s there are over 300 who have been through the program.And the glue to the whole shebang was Marissa Mayer, who was the APM boss, mentor, den mother and role model.Mayer thought up the program in early 2002. Google had been struggling to find PMs who could work within the peculiar company culture — team leaders who would not be bosses but work consensually with the wizards who produce code. Ideally, a Google product manger would understand the technical issues and sway the team to his or her viewpoint by strong data-backed arguments, and more than a bit of canny psychology. But experienced PMs from places like Microsoft, or those with MBAs, didn't understand the Google way, and tried to force their views on teams.So Mayer came up with an idea: Google would hire computer science majors who just graduated or had been in the workplace fewer than 18 months. The ideal applicants must have technical talent, but not be total programming geeks – APMs had to have social finesse and business sense. Essentially they would be in-house entrepreneurs. They would undergo a multi-interview hiring process that made the Harvard admissions regimen look like community college. The chosen ones were thrown into deep water, heading real, important product teams. (As the first APM, Rakowski was asked to launch a nascent project called Gmail. By the way, I hear Rakowski is taking over the program now that Mayer is gone.) “We give them way too much responsibility,” Mayer once told me, “to see if they can handle it.” Also, Google had APMs perform tasks for top management, like note-taking at high-level executive meetings or drawing up white papers on ambitious potential products.The program has a been massive success, with APMs filling key roles in dozens of key Google products, ranging from apps to search to ads. The program has been so successful that Google has created a variation for leaders of non-product teams. These are called Marketing APMs. Though not quite as prestigious as APMs, these Googlers are not exactly chopped liver. For instance, Kevin Systrom was an MAPM — before he left Google and founded Instagram.The one constant in the program has been Mayer. Her staff ran the program, and continued to do so, even after she moved from heading search products to local services in 2011. You didn’t get to be an APM unless you connected with her; she was the last interview in a long series, and she’d typically make ultimate decision. (“Tell me about a product you love,” she’d ask candidates. There was no right answer. But not describing the choice with passionwas the wrong answer.)Marissa Mayer (third from right) leading APMs on a trip in 2007.
Photo: Steven LevyOnce you become an APM, Mayer was available as mentor and counselor. She made time in her insanely busy schedule to meet. She worked behind the scenes to address any issues that arose.Halfway through the two-year program, Mayer herself would lead the group on a summer trip to visit international Google outposts. (I accompanied the trip in 2007; we went to Tokyo, Beijing, Bangalore, and Tel Aviv. This year, one of the cities included Jakarta.) It would be a bonding experience for each year’s group of APMs — bonding with each other and to Mayer.Many, if not most, of the APMs keep in touch with Mayer after they graduate from the program, meeting with her periodically for a career check, and consulting with her when they considered a move. This occurs even after APMs leave Google. (It’s not surprising that a high percentage of APMs go elsewhere. APMs are chosen for their ambition and independence. Those traits are often at odds with working at a big company.)In short, Marissa Mayer has developed a deep connection to over three hundred of most talented tech people in Silicon Valley. They may still be at Google, they may have moved to companies like Facebook or Dropbox, or they may have started their own budding enterprises like Optimizely. But in some sense they are all Marissa’s acolytes.It would be not be surprising if some of these baccalaureate APMs wind up at Yahoo. In addition, former APMs all have their own networks, and can tip off Mayer to promising hires. Naturally, one of the first e-mails that Mayer sent after accepting her new job was a blast to the entire APM network, informing them of her move and assuring them that she will still be in touch. She reminded them that they are all part of a very special family.And Mayer would presumably be happy to welcome some of these family members to her new home at Yahoo.#Entrepreneurs#google#Marissa Mayer#YahooMost PopularcultureWe Know How 'Valerian' Got Made—But Not Why It FailedAuthor: Adam RogersAdam RogersgearTurn Off Your Push Notifications.

Marissa Mayer and the New Breed of Product Manager CEOs


The Yahoo boss's combination of skills is vastly different from that of most traditional CEOs. She isn't a perfect executive, but she embodies the traits that companies need in a leader.

In the past year as Yahoo's CEO, Marissa Mayer has been able to double the search engine's stock price, recharge the Yahoo brand, have a baby, and top Fortune's "40 Under 40" list.
As Slate writes, Mayer is not a perfect manager, but that's because she doesn't manage people, she manages ideas. It's this kind of chief executive, a visionary product manager, that startups need to bring innovative products to customers.
The new ideal CEO that Auerbach describes, doesn't chalk up all the company's success as her own, but rather recognizes it's due to the skilled team members who work for her. "She works as a peer to draw the necessary connections between them and keep them in sync. She pays attention to the existing self-organization of small groups of smart people and sympathetically exerts soft power to try to leverage their skills on a larger scale, without wrecking what they already do well," he writes. "She does not build from the ground up, but helps fit pieces together--horizontally."
Mayer is a blend of strengths and weaknesses that doesn't remind anyone of the typical executive who delegates her vision to underlings and scratches other board members' backs. Instead, she's more in the Steve Jobs mold. "As a Google product manager and later executive, Mayer was credited with enforcing a rigid vision across Google's user-facing properties; she became the linchpin of integration between products, and she kept tabs on every engineer and designer, high and low," David Auerbach writes in Slate. "She is also accused of being stubbornly single-minded, ignoring others' opinions, disrespecting seniority and prestige, and being more focused on vision than on necessary compromises or Yahoo's quarterly earnings."
Because of that notoriously hands-on, stubborn approach, Auerbach writes, Mayer is able to craft a vision and see it through until it's perfect. "Her confidence and meticulousness are far more valuable than the business connections of the over-entitled, macho executives she replaced," he writes. Even though some of Mayer's tactics as product manager-in-chief, like not letting anyone work remotely, have been criticized, she's a more desirable type of executive than a "corporate hatchet woman like HP's Carly Fiorina," and "an unrepentant economy wrecker like Lehman's Dick Fuld."
So however you think of Mayer, as a coder-geek-icon, a super-woman CEO, or a stubborn smarty-pants, you need to recognize that her abilities as a product manager "have very little to do with the traditional values" of the stereotypical CEO. The new breed of executive develops skills "from working in the trenches, not in boardrooms," Auerbach writes.
So, what kind of CEO are you? Are you a manager of people, or a manager of products and ideas? Let us know what you think is the best kind of executive to lead a startup.

Early life and education[edit]
Mayer was born in Wausau, Wisconsin, the daughter of Margaret Mayer, art teacher of Finnish descent,[13] and Michael Mayer, an environmental engineer who worked for water companies.[14][15][16] Her grandfather, Clem Mayer, had polio when he was 7 and served as mayor of Jackson, Wisconsin, for 32 years.[17][18][19] She has a younger brother.[14] She would later describe herself as having been "painfully shy" as a child and teenager.[20] She "never had fewer than one after-school activity per day," participating in ballet, ice-skating, piano, swimming, debate, and Brownies.[14] During middle school and high school, she took piano and ballet lessons, the latter of which taught her "criticism and discipline, poise, and confidence."[20] At an early age, she showed an interest in math and science.[21]
When she was attending Wausau West High School, Mayer was on the curling team and the precision dance team.[20] She excelled in chemistry, calculus, biology, and physics.[22] She took part in extracurricular activities, becoming president of her high school's Spanish club, treasurer of the Key Club, captain of the debate team, and captain of the pom-pom squad.[20] Her high school debate team won the Wisconsin state championship and the pom-pom squad was the state runner-up.[17] During high school, she worked as a grocery clerk.[23] After graduating from high school in 1993,[24] Mayer was selected by Tommy Thompson, then the Governor of Wisconsin, as one of the state's two delegates to attend the National Youth Science Camp in West Virginia.[25]
Intending to become a pediatric neurosurgeon,[26] Mayer took pre-med classes at Stanford University.[20] She later switched her major from pediatric neuroscience to symbolic systems,[27] a major which combined philosophy, cognitive psychology, linguistics, and computer science.[14] At Stanford, she danced in the university ballet's Nutcracker, was a member of parliamentary debate, volunteered at children's hospitals, and helped bring computer science education to Bermuda's schools.[28] During her junior year, she taught a class in symbolic systems, with Eric S. Roberts as her supervisor. The class was so well received by students that Roberts asked Mayer to teach another class over the summer.[20] Mayer went on to graduate with honors from Stanford with a BS in symbolic systems in 1997[27][28] and an MS in computer science in 1999.[29] For both degrees, her specialization was in artificial intelligence. For her undergraduate thesis, she built travel-recommendation software that advised users in natural-sounding human language.[26] In 2009, the Illinois Institute of Technology granted Mayer an honoris causa doctorate degree in recognition of her work in the field of search.[30][31]
Mayer interned at SRI International in Menlo Park, California, and Ubilab, UBS's research lab based in Zurich, Switzerland.[26] She holds several patents in artificial intelligence and interface design.[32][33]
Career[edit]
Google[edit]

After graduating from Stanford, Mayer received 14 job offers,[27] including a teaching job at Carnegie Mellon University[28] and a consulting job at McKinsey & Company.[20] She joined Google in 1999 as employee number 20 and was the company's first female engineer.[34][35] She started out writing code and overseeing small teams of engineers, developing and designing Google's search offerings.[11] She became known for her attention to detail[36] which helped land her a promotion to product manager,[37] and later became director of consumer web products.[17][38] She oversaw the layout of Google's well-known, unadorned search homepage.[38][39][40] She was also on the three-person team responsible for Google AdWords, which is an algorithm used by advertisers to get insight into the products consumers want. AdWords helped deliver 96% of the company's revenue in the first quarter of 2011.

In 2002, Mayer started the Associate Product Manager (APM) program, a Google mentorship program aimed to recruit new talents and cultivate and train them for leadership roles within the company. Each year, Mayer selected a number of junior employees for the two-year program, which would see them take on a number of extracurricular assignments and intensive evening classes.[20][36][41] Notable graduates of the program include Bret Taylor and Justin Rosenstein.[41] In 2005 she became Vice President of Search Products and User Experience.[42] Mayer held key roles in Google Search, Google Images, Google News, Google Maps, Google Books, Google Product Search, Google Toolbar, iGoogle, and Gmail.[43]
Mayer was the vice president of Google Search Products and User Experience until the end of 2010, when she was asked by then-CEO Eric Schmidt to head the Local, Maps, and Location Services.[36][44] In 2011, she secured Google's acquisition of survey site Zagat for $125 million.[36] While Mayer was working at Google, she taught introductory computer programming at Stanford and mentored students at the East Palo Alto Charter School.[17][26] She was awarded the Centennial Teaching Award and the Forsythe Award from Stanford.[45]

On July 16, 2012, Mayer was appointed president and CEO of Yahoo!, effective the following day. She is also a member of the company's board of directors.[46][47] To simplify the bureaucratic process and "make the culture the best version of itself", Mayer launched a new online program called PB&J. It collects employee complaints, as well as their votes on problems in the office; if a problem generates at least 50 votes, online management automatically investigates the matter.[48] In February 2013, Mayer oversaw a major personnel policy change at Yahoo! that required all remote-working employees to convert to in-office roles.[49] Having worked from home toward the end of her pregnancy, Mayer returned to work after giving birth to a boy, and built a mother's room next to her office suite—Mayer was consequently criticized for the telecommuting ban, in spite of the fact many remote employees were largely unavailable and unresponsive weeks at a time.[50] In April 2013, Mayer changed Yahoo!'s maternity leave policy, lengthening its time allowance and providing a cash bonus to parents.[51] CNN noted this was in line with other Silicon Valley companies, such as Facebook and Google.[52][53] Mayer has been criticized for many of her management decisions in pieces by The New York Times and The New Yorker.[54][55]
On May 20, 2013, Mayer led Yahoo! to acquire Tumblr in a $1.1 billion acquisition.[56][57] In February 2016, Yahoo! acknowledged that the value of Tumblr had fallen by $230 million since it was acquired. In July 2013, Yahoo! reported a fall in revenues, but a rise in profits compared with the same period in the previous year. Reaction on Wall Street was muted, with shares falling 1.7%.[58] In September 2013, it was reported that the stock price of Yahoo! had doubled over the 14 months since Mayer's appointment.[59] However, much of this growth may be attributed to Yahoo!'s stake in the Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group, which was acquired before Mayer's tenure.[60]

In November 2013, Mayer instituted a performance review system based on a bell curve ranking of employees, suggesting that managers rank their employees on a bell curve, with those at the low end being fired.[61][62] Employees complained that some managers were viewing the process as mandatory.[62] In February 2016, a former Yahoo! employee filed a lawsuit against the company claiming that Yahoo's firing practices have violated both California and federal labor laws.[63]
In 2014, Mayer was ranked sixth on Fortune's 40 under 40 list,[64] and was ranked the 16th most-powerful businesswoman in the world that year according to the same publication.[65] In March 2016 Fortune would name Mayer as one of the world's most disappointing leaders.[66][54][55] Yahoo! stocks continued to fall by more than 30% throughout 2015, while 12 key executives left the company.[67]
In December 2015, the New York-based hedge fund SpringOwl, a shareholder in Yahoo Inc., released a statement arguing that Mayer be replaced as CEO.[68] Starboard Value, an activist investing firm that owns a stake in Yahoo, likewise wrote a scathing letter regarding Mayer's performance at Yahoo.[69] By January 2016, it was further estimated that Yahoo!'s core business has been worth less than zero dollars for the past few quarters.[70] In February 2016, Mayer confirmed that Yahoo! was considering the possibility of selling its core business.[71] In March 2017, it was reported that Mayer could receive a $23 million termination package upon the sale of Yahoo! to Verizon.[72]
Mayer announced her resignation on June 13, 2017.[73] In spite of large losses in advertising revenue at Yahoo! and a 50% reduction in staff during her 5 years as CEO, Mayer was paid a total of $239 million over that time, mainly in stock and stock options.[74] On the day of her resignation, Mayer publicly highlighted many of the company's achievements during her tenure, including: creating $43B in market capitalization, tripling Yahoo stock, growing mobile users to over 650 million, building a $1.5B mobile ad business, and transforming Yahoo's culture.[73]

Allegations of WARN Act violations and gender-based discrimination[edit]
Scott Ard, a prominent editorial director, fired from Yahoo! in 2015, filed a lawsuit alleging that “Mayer encouraged and fostered the use of (an employee performance-rating system) to accommodate management’s subjective biases and personal opinions, to the detriment of Yahoo!’s male employees." He claimed that, prior to his firing, he had received "fully satisfactory" performance reviews since starting at the company in 2011 as head of editorial programming for Yahoo!'s home page; however, he was relieved of his role, which was given to a woman who had been recently hired.[75][76][77]
An earlier lawsuit was filed by Gregory Anderson, who was fired in 2014, alleging the company’s performance management system was arbitrary and unfair and disguised layoffs as terminations for the purpose of evading state and federal WARN Acts, making it the first WARN Act and gender discrimination lawsuit Yahoo! and Mayer faced in 2016.[78][79][80]
Boards and honors[edit]
As well as sitting on the boards of directors of Walmart and Jawbone, Mayer also sits on several non-profit boards such as Cooper–Hewitt, National Design Museum, New York City Ballet, San Francisco Ballet, and San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.[81][82][83][84] Mayer actively invests in technology companies, including crowd-sourced design retailer Minted,[85][86] live video platform Airtime,[86] wireless power startup uBeam,[86] online DIY community/e-commerce company Brit + Co.,[86][87] mobile payments processor Square,[86] home décor site One Kings Lane,[86][88] genetic testing company Natera,[86] and nootropics and biohacking company Nootrobox.[89]
Mayer was named to Fortune magazine's annual list of America's 50 Most Powerful Women in Business in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 with ranks at 50, 44, 42, 38, 14 and 8 respectively.[90] In 2008, at age 33, she was the youngest woman ever listed. Mayer was named one of Glamour Magazine's Women of the Year in 2009.[91] She was listed in Forbes Magazine's List of The World's 100 Most Powerful Women in 2012, 2013 and 2014, with ranks of 20, 32 and 18 respectively. In September 2013, Mayer became the first CEO of a Fortune 500 company to be featured in a Vogue magazine spread.[14] In 2013, she was also named in the Time 100 and became the first woman listed as number one on Fortune magazine's annual list of the top 40 business stars under 40 years old.[92] Mayer eventually made Fortune magazine history in 2013, as the only person to feature in all three of its annual lists during the same year: Businessperson of the Year (No. 10), Most Powerful Women (at No. 8), and 40 Under 40 (No. 1) at the same time.[93] On 24 December 2015, Mayer was listed by UK-based company Richtopia at number 14 in the list of 500 Most Influential CEO's.[94] In March 2016, in contrast, Fortune named Mayer as one of the world's most disappointing leaders.[66]
Personal life[edit]
Mayer married lawyer and investor Zachary Bogue on December 12, 2009.[37][95][96] On the day Yahoo! announced her hiring, Mayer revealed that she was pregnant;[97][98][99] she gave birth to a baby boy on September 30, 2012.[100] Although she asked for suggestions via social media,[101] the name Macallister was eventually chosen for her baby's name from an existing list.[102] On December 10, 2015, Mayer announced that she had given birth to identical twin girls,[103][104] Marielle and Sylvana.[105]
Mayer is Lutheran,[106] but said, referencing Vince Lombardi's "Your God, your family and the Green Bay Packers" quote, her priorities are "God, family and Yahoo!, except I'm not that religious, so it's really family and Yahoo!."[107] Since 2008, Mayer has lived on the 38th-floor penthouse suite at the Four Seasons Hotel in San Francisco.[20][43]

Early life and education[edit]
Mayer was born in Wausau, Wisconsin, the daughter of Margaret Mayer, art teacher of Finnish descent,[13] and Michael Mayer, an environmental engineer who worked for water companies.[14][15][16] Her grandfather, Clem Mayer, had polio when he was 7 and served as mayor of Jackson, Wisconsin, for 32 years.[17][18][19] She has a younger brother.[14] She would later describe herself as having been "painfully shy" as a child and teenager.[20] She "never had fewer than one after-school activity per day," participating in ballet, ice-skating, piano, swimming, debate, and Brownies.[14] During middle school and high school, she took piano and ballet lessons, the latter of which taught her "criticism and discipline, poise, and confidence."[20] At an early age, she showed an interest in math and science.[21]
When she was attending Wausau West High School, Mayer was on the curling team and the precision dance team.[20] She excelled in chemistry, calculus, biology, and physics.[22] She took part in extracurricular activities, becoming president of her high school's Spanish club, treasurer of the Key Club, captain of the debate team, and captain of the pom-pom squad.[20] Her high school debate team won the Wisconsin state championship and the pom-pom squad was the state runner-up.[17] During high school, she worked as a grocery clerk.[23] After graduating from high school in 1993,[24] Mayer was selected by Tommy Thompson, then the Governor of Wisconsin, as one of the state's two delegates to attend the National Youth Science Camp in West Virginia.[25]
Intending to become a pediatric neurosurgeon,[26] Mayer took pre-med classes at Stanford University.[20] She later switched her major from pediatric neuroscience to symbolic systems,[27] a major which combined philosophy, cognitive psychology, linguistics, and computer science.[14] At Stanford, she danced in the university ballet's Nutcracker, was a member of parliamentary debate, volunteered at children's hospitals, and helped bring computer science education to Bermuda's schools.[28] During her junior year, she taught a class in symbolic systems, with Eric S. Roberts as her supervisor. The class was so well received by students that Roberts asked Mayer to teach another class over the summer.[20] Mayer went on to graduate with honors from Stanford with a BS in symbolic systems in 1997[27][28] and an MS in computer science in 1999.[29] For both degrees, her specialization was in artificial intelligence. For her undergraduate thesis, she built travel-recommendation software that advised users in natural-sounding human language.[26] In 2009, the Illinois Institute of Technology granted Mayer an honoris causa doctorate degree in recognition of her work in the field of search.[30][31]
Mayer interned at SRI International in Menlo Park, California, and Ubilab, UBS's research lab based in Zurich, Switzerland.[26] She holds several patents in artificial intelligence and interface design.[32][33]
Career[edit]
Google[edit]

After graduating from Stanford, Mayer received 14 job offers,[27] including a teaching job at Carnegie Mellon University[28] and a consulting job at McKinsey & Company.[20] She joined Google in 1999 as employee number 20 and was the company's first female engineer.[34][35] She started out writing code and overseeing small teams of engineers, developing and designing Google's search offerings.[11] She became known for her attention to detail[36] which helped land her a promotion to product manager,[37] and later became director of consumer web products.[17][38] She oversaw the layout of Google's well-known, unadorned search homepage.[38][39][40] She was also on the three-person team responsible for Google AdWords, which is an algorithm used by advertisers to get insight into the products consumers want. AdWords helped deliver 96% of the company's revenue in the first quarter of 2011.

In 2002, Mayer started the Associate Product Manager (APM) program, a Google mentorship program aimed to recruit new talents and cultivate and train them for leadership roles within the company. Each year, Mayer selected a number of junior employees for the two-year program, which would see them take on a number of extracurricular assignments and intensive evening classes.[20][36][41] Notable graduates of the program include Bret Taylor and Justin Rosenstein.[41] In 2005 she became Vice President of Search Products and User Experience.[42] Mayer held key roles in Google Search, Google Images, Google News, Google Maps, Google Books, Google Product Search, Google Toolbar, iGoogle, and Gmail.[43]
Mayer was the vice president of Google Search Products and User Experience until the end of 2010, when she was asked by then-CEO Eric Schmidt to head the Local, Maps, and Location Services.[36][44] In 2011, she secured Google's acquisition of survey site Zagat for $125 million.[36] While Mayer was working at Google, she taught introductory computer programming at Stanford and mentored students at the East Palo Alto Charter School.[17][26] She was awarded the Centennial Teaching Award and the Forsythe Award from Stanford.[45]
Yahoo[edit]




Michael Arrington and Marissa Mayer at TechCrunch Disrupt


On July 16, 2012, Mayer was appointed president and CEO of Yahoo!, effective the following day. She is also a member of the company's board of directors.[46][47] To simplify the bureaucratic process and "make the culture the best version of itself", Mayer launched a new online program called PB&J. It collects employee complaints, as well as their votes on problems in the office; if a problem generates at least 50 votes, online management automatically investigates the matter.[48] In February 2013, Mayer oversaw a major personnel policy change at Yahoo! that required all remote-working employees to convert to in-office roles.[49] Having worked from home toward the end of her pregnancy, Mayer returned to work after giving birth to a boy, and built a mother's room next to her office suite—Mayer was consequently criticized for the telecommuting ban, in spite of the fact many remote employees were largely unavailable and unresponsive weeks at a time.[50] In April 2013, Mayer changed Yahoo!'s maternity leave policy, lengthening its time allowance and providing a cash bonus to parents.[51] CNN noted this was in line with other Silicon Valley companies, such as Facebook and Google.[52][53] Mayer has been criticized for many of her management decisions in pieces by The New York Times and The New Yorker.[54][55]
On May 20, 2013, Mayer led Yahoo! to acquire Tumblr in a $1.1 billion acquisition.[56][57] In February 2016, Yahoo! acknowledged that the value of Tumblr had fallen by $230 million since it was acquired. In July 2013, Yahoo! reported a fall in revenues, but a rise in profits compared with the same period in the previous year. Reaction on Wall Street was muted, with shares falling 1.7%.[58] In September 2013, it was reported that the stock price of Yahoo! had doubled over the 14 months since Mayer's appointment.[59] However, much of this growth may be attributed to Yahoo!'s stake in the Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group, which was acquired before Mayer's tenure.[60]

In November 2013, Mayer instituted a performance review system based on a bell curve ranking of employees, suggesting that managers rank their employees on a bell curve, with those at the low end being fired.[61][62] Employees complained that some managers were viewing the process as mandatory.[62] In February 2016, a former Yahoo! employee filed a lawsuit against the company claiming that Yahoo's firing practices have violated both California and federal labor laws.[63]
In 2014, Mayer was ranked sixth on Fortune's 40 under 40 list,[64] and was ranked the 16th most-powerful businesswoman in the world that year according to the same publication.[65] In March 2016 Fortune would name Mayer as one of the world's most disappointing leaders.[66][54][55] Yahoo! stocks continued to fall by more than 30% throughout 2015, while 12 key executives left the company.[67]
In December 2015, the New York-based hedge fund SpringOwl, a shareholder in Yahoo Inc., released a statement arguing that Mayer be replaced as CEO.[68] Starboard Value, an activist investing firm that owns a stake in Yahoo, likewise wrote a scathing letter regarding Mayer's performance at Yahoo.[69] By January 2016, it was further estimated that Yahoo!'s core business has been worth less than zero dollars for the past few quarters.[70] In February 2016, Mayer confirmed that Yahoo! was considering the possibility of selling its core business.[71] In March 2017, it was reported that Mayer could receive a $23 million termination package upon the sale of Yahoo! to Verizon.[72]
Mayer announced her resignation on June 13, 2017.[73] In spite of large losses in advertising revenue at Yahoo! and a 50% reduction in staff during her 5 years as CEO, Mayer was paid a total of $239 million over that time, mainly in stock and stock options.[74] On the day of her resignation, Mayer publicly highlighted many of the company's achievements during her tenure, including: creating $43B in market capitalization, tripling Yahoo stock, growing mobile users to over 650 million, building a $1.5B mobile ad business, and transforming Yahoo's culture.[73]

Allegations of WARN Act violations and gender-based discrimination[edit]
Scott Ard, a prominent editorial director, fired from Yahoo! in 2015, filed a lawsuit alleging that “Mayer encouraged and fostered the use of (an employee performance-rating system) to accommodate management’s subjective biases and personal opinions, to the detriment of Yahoo!’s male employees." He claimed that, prior to his firing, he had received "fully satisfactory" performance reviews since starting at the company in 2011 as head of editorial programming for Yahoo!'s home page; however, he was relieved of his role, which was given to a woman who had been recently hired.[75][76][77]
An earlier lawsuit was filed by Gregory Anderson, who was fired in 2014, alleging the company’s performance management system was arbitrary and unfair and disguised layoffs as terminations for the purpose of evading state and federal WARN Acts, making it the first WARN Act and gender discrimination lawsuit Yahoo! and Mayer faced in 2016.[78][79][80]
Boards and honors[edit]
As well as sitting on the boards of directors of Walmart and Jawbone, Mayer also sits on several non-profit boards such as Cooper–Hewitt, National Design Museum, New York City Ballet, San Francisco Ballet, and San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.[81][82][83][84] Mayer actively invests in technology companies, including crowd-sourced design retailer Minted,[85][86] live video platform Airtime,[86] wireless power startup uBeam,[86] online DIY community/e-commerce company Brit + Co.,[86][87] mobile payments processor Square,[86] home décor site One Kings Lane,[86][88] genetic testing company Natera,[86] and nootropics and biohacking company Nootrobox.[89]
Mayer was named to Fortune magazine's annual list of America's 50 Most Powerful Women in Business in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 with ranks at 50, 44, 42, 38, 14 and 8 respectively.[90] In 2008, at age 33, she was the youngest woman ever listed. Mayer was named one of Glamour Magazine's Women of the Year in 2009.[91] She was listed in Forbes Magazine's List of The World's 100 Most Powerful Women in 2012, 2013 and 2014, with ranks of 20, 32 and 18 respectively. In September 2013, Mayer became the first CEO of a Fortune 500 company to be featured in a Vogue magazine spread.[14] In 2013, she was also named in the Time 100 and became the first woman listed as number one on Fortune magazine's annual list of the top 40 business stars under 40 years old.[92] Mayer eventually made Fortune magazine history in 2013, as the only person to feature in all three of its annual lists during the same year: Businessperson of the Year (No. 10), Most Powerful Women (at No. 8), and 40 Under 40 (No. 1) at the same time.[93] On 24 December 2015, Mayer was listed by UK-based company Richtopia at number 14 in the list of 500 Most Influential CEO's.[94] In March 2016, in contrast, Fortune named Mayer as one of the world's most disappointing leaders.[66]
Personal life[edit]
Mayer married lawyer and investor Zachary Bogue on December 12, 2009.[37][95][96] On the day Yahoo! announced her hiring, Mayer revealed that she was pregnant;[97][98][99] she gave birth to a baby boy on September 30, 2012.[100] Although she asked for suggestions via social media,[101] the name Macallister was eventually chosen for her baby's name from an existing list.[102] On December 10, 2015, Mayer announced that she had given birth to identical twin girls,[103][104] Marielle and Sylvana.[105]
Mayer is Lutheran,[106] but said, referencing Vince Lombardi's "Your God, your family and the Green Bay Packers" quote, her priorities are "God, family and Yahoo!, except I'm not that religious, so it's really family and Yahoo!."[107] Since 2008, Mayer has lived on the 38th-floor penthouse suite at the Four Seasons Hotel in San Francisco.[20][43]

Early life and education[edit]
Mayer was born in Wausau, Wisconsin, the daughter of Margaret Mayer, art teacher of Finnish descent,[13] and Michael Mayer, an environmental engineer who worked for water companies.[14][15][16] Her grandfather, Clem Mayer, had polio when he was 7 and served as mayor of Jackson, Wisconsin, for 32 years.[17][18][19] She has a younger brother.[14] She would later describe herself as having been "painfully shy" as a child and teenager.[20] She "never had fewer than one after-school activity per day," participating in ballet, ice-skating, piano, swimming, debate, and Brownies.[14] During middle school and high school, she took piano and ballet lessons, the latter of which taught her "criticism and discipline, poise, and confidence."[20] At an early age, she showed an interest in math and science.[21]
When she was attending Wausau West High School, Mayer was on the curling team and the precision dance team.[20] She excelled in chemistry, calculus, biology, and physics.[22] She took part in extracurricular activities, becoming president of her high school's Spanish club, treasurer of the Key Club, captain of the debate team, and captain of the pom-pom squad.[20] Her high school debate team won the Wisconsin state championship and the pom-pom squad was the state runner-up.[17] During high school, she worked as a grocery clerk.[23] After graduating from high school in 1993,[24] Mayer was selected by Tommy Thompson, then the Governor of Wisconsin, as one of the state's two delegates to attend the National Youth Science Camp in West Virginia.[25]
Intending to become a pediatric neurosurgeon,[26] Mayer took pre-med classes at Stanford University.[20] She later switched her major from pediatric neuroscience to symbolic systems,[27] a major which combined philosophy, cognitive psychology, linguistics, and computer science.[14] At Stanford, she danced in the university ballet's Nutcracker, was a member of parliamentary debate, volunteered at children's hospitals, and helped bring computer science education to Bermuda's schools.[28] During her junior year, she taught a class in symbolic systems, with Eric S. Roberts as her supervisor. The class was so well received by students that Roberts asked Mayer to teach another class over the summer.[20] Mayer went on to graduate with honors from Stanford with a BS in symbolic systems in 1997[27][28] and an MS in computer science in 1999.[29] For both degrees, her specialization was in artificial intelligence. For her undergraduate thesis, she built travel-recommendation software that advised users in natural-sounding human language.[26] In 2009, the Illinois Institute of Technology granted Mayer an honoris causa doctorate degree in recognition of her work in the field of search.[30][31]
Mayer interned at SRI International in Menlo Park, California, and Ubilab, UBS's research lab based in Zurich, Switzerland.[26] She holds several patents in artificial intelligence and interface design.[32][33]
Career[edit]
Google[edit]

After graduating from Stanford, Mayer received 14 job offers,[27] including a teaching job at Carnegie Mellon University[28] and a consulting job at McKinsey & Company.[20] She joined Google in 1999 as employee number 20 and was the company's first female engineer.[34][35] She started out writing code and overseeing small teams of engineers, developing and designing Google's search offerings.[11] She became known for her attention to detail[36] which helped land her a promotion to product manager,[37] and later became director of consumer web products.[17][38] She oversaw the layout of Google's well-known, unadorned search homepage.[38][39][40] She was also on the three-person team responsible for Google AdWords, which is an algorithm used by advertisers to get insight into the products consumers want. AdWords helped deliver 96% of the company's revenue in the first quarter of 2011.

In 2002, Mayer started the Associate Product Manager (APM) program, a Google mentorship program aimed to recruit new talents and cultivate and train them for leadership roles within the company. Each year, Mayer selected a number of junior employees for the two-year program, which would see them take on a number of extracurricular assignments and intensive evening classes.[20][36][41] Notable graduates of the program include Bret Taylor and Justin Rosenstein.[41] In 2005 she became Vice President of Search Products and User Experience.[42] Mayer held key roles in Google Search, Google Images, Google News, Google Maps, Google Books, Google Product Search, Google Toolbar, iGoogle, and Gmail.[43]
Mayer was the vice president of Google Search Products and User Experience until the end of 2010, when she was asked by then-CEO Eric Schmidt to head the Local, Maps, and Location Services.[36][44] In 2011, she secured Google's acquisition of survey site Zagat for $125 million.[36] While Mayer was working at Google, she taught introductory computer programming at Stanford and mentored students at the East Palo Alto Charter School.[17][26] She was awarded the Centennial Teaching Award and the Forsythe Award from Stanford.[45]
Yahoo[edit]




Michael Arrington and Marissa Mayer at TechCrunch Disrupt


On July 16, 2012, Mayer was appointed president and CEO of Yahoo!, effective the following day. She is also a member of the company's board of directors.[46][47] To simplify the bureaucratic process and "make the culture the best version of itself", Mayer launched a new online program called PB&J. It collects employee complaints, as well as their votes on problems in the office; if a problem generates at least 50 votes, online management automatically investigates the matter.[48] In February 2013, Mayer oversaw a major personnel policy change at Yahoo! that required all remote-working employees to convert to in-office roles.[49] Having worked from home toward the end of her pregnancy, Mayer returned to work after giving birth to a boy, and built a mother's room next to her office suite—Mayer was consequently criticized for the telecommuting ban, in spite of the fact many remote employees were largely unavailable and unresponsive weeks at a time.[50] In April 2013, Mayer changed Yahoo!'s maternity leave policy, lengthening its time allowance and providing a cash bonus to parents.[51] CNN noted this was in line with other Silicon Valley companies, such as Facebook and Google.[52][53] Mayer has been criticized for many of her management decisions in pieces by The New York Times and The New Yorker.[54][55]
On May 20, 2013, Mayer led Yahoo! to acquire Tumblr in a $1.1 billion acquisition.[56][57] In February 2016, Yahoo! acknowledged that the value of Tumblr had fallen by $230 million since it was acquired. In July 2013, Yahoo! reported a fall in revenues, but a rise in profits compared with the same period in the previous year. Reaction on Wall Street was muted, with shares falling 1.7%.[58] In September 2013, it was reported that the stock price of Yahoo! had doubled over the 14 months since Mayer's appointment.[59] However, much of this growth may be attributed to Yahoo!'s stake in the Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group, which was acquired before Mayer's tenure.[60]

In November 2013, Mayer instituted a performance review system based on a bell curve ranking of employees, suggesting that managers rank their employees on a bell curve, with those at the low end being fired.[61][62] Employees complained that some managers were viewing the process as mandatory.[62] In February 2016, a former Yahoo! employee filed a lawsuit against the company claiming that Yahoo's firing practices have violated both California and federal labor laws.[63]
In 2014, Mayer was ranked sixth on Fortune's 40 under 40 list,[64] and was ranked the 16th most-powerful businesswoman in the world that year according to the same publication.[65] In March 2016 Fortune would name Mayer as one of the world's most disappointing leaders.[66][54][55] Yahoo! stocks continued to fall by more than 30% throughout 2015, while 12 key executives left the company.[67]
In December 2015, the New York-based hedge fund SpringOwl, a shareholder in Yahoo Inc., released a statement arguing that Mayer be replaced as CEO.[68] Starboard Value, an activist investing firm that owns a stake in Yahoo, likewise wrote a scathing letter regarding Mayer's performance at Yahoo.[69] By January 2016, it was further estimated that Yahoo!'s core business has been worth less than zero dollars for the past few quarters.[70] In February 2016, Mayer confirmed that Yahoo! was considering the possibility of selling its core business.[71] In March 2017, it was reported that Mayer could receive a $23 million termination package upon the sale of Yahoo! to Verizon.[72]
Mayer announced her resignation on June 13, 2017.[73] In spite of large losses in advertising revenue at Yahoo! and a 50% reduction in staff during her 5 years as CEO, Mayer was paid a total of $239 million over that time, mainly in stock and stock options.[74] On the day of her resignation, Mayer publicly highlighted many of the company's achievements during her tenure, including: creating $43B in market capitalization, tripling Yahoo stock, growing mobile users to over 650 million, building a $1.5B mobile ad business, and transforming Yahoo's culture.[73]

Allegations of WARN Act violations and gender-based discrimination[edit]
Scott Ard, a prominent editorial director, fired from Yahoo! in 2015, filed a lawsuit alleging that “Mayer encouraged and fostered the use of (an employee performance-rating system) to accommodate management’s subjective biases and personal opinions, to the detriment of Yahoo!’s male employees." He claimed that, prior to his firing, he had received "fully satisfactory" performance reviews since starting at the company in 2011 as head of editorial programming for Yahoo!'s home page; however, he was relieved of his role, which was given to a woman who had been recently hired.[75][76][77]
An earlier lawsuit was filed by Gregory Anderson, who was fired in 2014, alleging the company’s performance management system was arbitrary and unfair and disguised layoffs as terminations for the purpose of evading state and federal WARN Acts, making it the first WARN Act and gender discrimination lawsuit Yahoo! and Mayer faced in 2016.[78][79][80]
Boards and honors[edit]
As well as sitting on the boards of directors of Walmart and Jawbone, Mayer also sits on several non-profit boards such as Cooper–Hewitt, National Design Museum, New York City Ballet, San Francisco Ballet, and San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.[81][82][83][84] Mayer actively invests in technology companies, including crowd-sourced design retailer Minted,[85][86] live video platform Airtime,[86] wireless power startup uBeam,[86] online DIY community/e-commerce company Brit + Co.,[86][87] mobile payments processor Square,[86] home décor site One Kings Lane,[86][88] genetic testing company Natera,[86] and nootropics and biohacking company Nootrobox.[89]
Mayer was named to Fortune magazine's annual list of America's 50 Most Powerful Women in Business in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 with ranks at 50, 44, 42, 38, 14 and 8 respectively.[90] In 2008, at age 33, she was the youngest woman ever listed. Mayer was named one of Glamour Magazine's Women of the Year in 2009.[91] She was listed in Forbes Magazine's List of The World's 100 Most Powerful Women in 2012, 2013 and 2014, with ranks of 20, 32 and 18 respectively. In September 2013, Mayer became the first CEO of a Fortune 500 company to be featured in a Vogue magazine spread.[14] In 2013, she was also named in the Time 100 and became the first woman listed as number one on Fortune magazine's annual list of the top 40 business stars under 40 years old.[92] Mayer eventually made Fortune magazine history in 2013, as the only person to feature in all three of its annual lists during the same year: Businessperson of the Year (No. 10), Most Powerful Women (at No. 8), and 40 Under 40 (No. 1) at the same time.[93] On 24 December 2015, Mayer was listed by UK-based company Richtopia at number 14 in the list of 500 Most Influential CEO's.[94] In March 2016, in contrast, Fortune named Mayer as one of the world's most disappointing leaders.[66]
Personal life[edit]
Mayer married lawyer and investor Zachary Bogue on December 12, 2009.[37][95][96] On the day Yahoo! announced her hiring, Mayer revealed that she was pregnant;[97][98][99] she gave birth to a baby boy on September 30, 2012.[100] Although she asked for suggestions via social media,[101] the name Macallister was eventually chosen for her baby's name from an existing list.[102] On December 10, 2015, Mayer announced that she had given birth to identical twin girls,[103][104] Marielle and Sylvana.[105]
Mayer is Lutheran,[106] but said, referencing Vince Lombardi's "Your God, your family and the Green Bay Packers" quote, her priorities are "God, family and Yahoo!, except I'm not that religious, so it's really family and Yahoo!."[107] Since 2008, Mayer has lived on the 38th-floor penthouse suite at the Four Seasons Hotel in San Francisco.[20][43]

Early life and education[edit]
Mayer was born in Wausau, Wisconsin, the daughter of Margaret Mayer, art teacher of Finnish descent,[13] and Michael Mayer, an environmental engineer who worked for water companies.[14][15][16] Her grandfather, Clem Mayer, had polio when he was 7 and served as mayor of Jackson, Wisconsin, for 32 years.[17][18][19] She has a younger brother.[14] She would later describe herself as having been "painfully shy" as a child and teenager.[20] She "never had fewer than one after-school activity per day," participating in ballet, ice-skating, piano, swimming, debate, and Brownies.[14] During middle school and high school, she took piano and ballet lessons, the latter of which taught her "criticism and discipline, poise, and confidence."[20] At an early age, she showed an interest in math and science.[21]
When she was attending Wausau West High School, Mayer was on the curling team and the precision dance team.[20] She excelled in chemistry, calculus, biology, and physics.[22] She took part in extracurricular activities, becoming president of her high school's Spanish club, treasurer of the Key Club, captain of the debate team, and captain of the pom-pom squad.[20] Her high school debate team won the Wisconsin state championship and the pom-pom squad was the state runner-up.[17] During high school, she worked as a grocery clerk.[23] After graduating from high school in 1993,[24] Mayer was selected by Tommy Thompson, then the Governor of Wisconsin, as one of the state's two delegates to attend the National Youth Science Camp in West Virginia.[25]
Intending to become a pediatric neurosurgeon,[26] Mayer took pre-med classes at Stanford University.[20] She later switched her major from pediatric neuroscience to symbolic systems,[27] a major which combined philosophy, cognitive psychology, linguistics, and computer science.[14] At Stanford, she danced in the university ballet's Nutcracker, was a member of parliamentary debate, volunteered at children's hospitals, and helped bring computer science education to Bermuda's schools.[28] During her junior year, she taught a class in symbolic systems, with Eric S. Roberts as her supervisor. The class was so well received by students that Roberts asked Mayer to teach another class over the summer.[20] Mayer went on to graduate with honors from Stanford with a BS in symbolic systems in 1997[27][28] and an MS in computer science in 1999.[29] For both degrees, her specialization was in artificial intelligence. For her undergraduate thesis, she built travel-recommendation software that advised users in natural-sounding human language.[26] In 2009, the Illinois Institute of Technology granted Mayer an honoris causa doctorate degree in recognition of her work in the field of search.[30][31]
Mayer interned at SRI International in Menlo Park, California, and Ubilab, UBS's research lab based in Zurich, Switzerland.[26] She holds several patents in artificial intelligence and interface design.[32][33]
Career[edit]
Google[edit]

After graduating from Stanford, Mayer received 14 job offers,[27] including a teaching job at Carnegie Mellon University[28] and a consulting job at McKinsey & Company.[20] She joined Google in 1999 as employee number 20 and was the company's first female engineer.[34][35] She started out writing code and overseeing small teams of engineers, developing and designing Google's search offerings.[11] She became known for her attention to detail[36] which helped land her a promotion to product manager,[37] and later became director of consumer web products.[17][38] She oversaw the layout of Google's well-known, unadorned search homepage.[38][39][40] She was also on the three-person team responsible for Google AdWords, which is an algorithm used by advertisers to get insight into the products consumers want. AdWords helped deliver 96% of the company's revenue in the first quarter of 2011.

In 2002, Mayer started the Associate Product Manager (APM) program, a Google mentorship program aimed to recruit new talents and cultivate and train them for leadership roles within the company. Each year, Mayer selected a number of junior employees for the two-year program, which would see them take on a number of extracurricular assignments and intensive evening classes.[20][36][41] Notable graduates of the program include Bret Taylor and Justin Rosenstein.[41] In 2005 she became Vice President of Search Products and User Experience.[42] Mayer held key roles in Google Search, Google Images, Google News, Google Maps, Google Books, Google Product Search, Google Toolbar, iGoogle, and Gmail.[43]
Mayer was the vice president of Google Search Products and User Experience until the end of 2010, when she was asked by then-CEO Eric Schmidt to head the Local, Maps, and Location Services.[36][44] In 2011, she secured Google's acquisition of survey site Zagat for $125 million.[36] While Mayer was working at Google, she taught introductory computer programming at Stanford and mentored students at the East Palo Alto Charter School.[17][26] She was awarded the Centennial Teaching Award and the Forsythe Award from Stanford.[45]
Yahoo[edit]

On July 16, 2012, Mayer was appointed president and CEO of Yahoo!, effective the following day. She is also a member of the company's board of directors.[46][47] To simplify the bureaucratic process and "make the culture the best version of itself", Mayer launched a new online program called PB&J. It collects employee complaints, as well as their votes on problems in the office; if a problem generates at least 50 votes, online management automatically investigates the matter.[48] In February 2013, Mayer oversaw a major personnel policy change at Yahoo! that required all remote-working employees to convert to in-office roles.[49] Having worked from home toward the end of her pregnancy, Mayer returned to work after giving birth to a boy, and built a mother's room next to her office suite—Mayer was consequently criticized for the telecommuting ban, in spite of the fact many remote employees were largely unavailable and unresponsive weeks at a time.[50] In April 2013, Mayer changed Yahoo!'s maternity leave policy, lengthening its time allowance and providing a cash bonus to parents.[51] CNN noted this was in line with other Silicon Valley companies, such as Facebook and Google.[52][53] Mayer has been criticized for many of her management decisions in pieces by The New York Times and The New Yorker.[54][55]
On May 20, 2013, Mayer led Yahoo! to acquire Tumblr in a $1.1 billion acquisition.[56][57] In February 2016, Yahoo! acknowledged that the value of Tumblr had fallen by $230 million since it was acquired. In July 2013, Yahoo! reported a fall in revenues, but a rise in profits compared with the same period in the previous year. Reaction on Wall Street was muted, with shares falling 1.7%.[58] In September 2013, it was reported that the stock price of Yahoo! had doubled over the 14 months since Mayer's appointment.[59] However, much of this growth may be attributed to Yahoo!'s stake in the Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group, which was acquired before Mayer's tenure.[60]

In November 2013, Mayer instituted a performance review system based on a bell curve ranking of employees, suggesting that managers rank their employees on a bell curve, with those at the low end being fired.[61][62] Employees complained that some managers were viewing the process as mandatory.[62] In February 2016, a former Yahoo! employee filed a lawsuit against the company claiming that Yahoo's firing practices have violated both California and federal labor laws.[63]
In 2014, Mayer was ranked sixth on Fortune's 40 under 40 list,[64] and was ranked the 16th most-powerful businesswoman in the world that year according to the same publication.[65] In March 2016 Fortune would name Mayer as one of the world's most disappointing leaders.[66][54][55] Yahoo! stocks continued to fall by more than 30% throughout 2015, while 12 key executives left the company.[67]
In December 2015, the New York-based hedge fund SpringOwl, a shareholder in Yahoo Inc., released a statement arguing that Mayer be replaced as CEO.[68] Starboard Value, an activist investing firm that owns a stake in Yahoo, likewise wrote a scathing letter regarding Mayer's performance at Yahoo.[69] By January 2016, it was further estimated that Yahoo!'s core business has been worth less than zero dollars for the past few quarters.[70] In February 2016, Mayer confirmed that Yahoo! was considering the possibility of selling its core business.[71] In March 2017, it was reported that Mayer could receive a $23 million termination package upon the sale of Yahoo! to Verizon.[72]
Mayer announced her resignation on June 13, 2017.[73] In spite of large losses in advertising revenue at Yahoo! and a 50% reduction in staff during her 5 years as CEO, Mayer was paid a total of $239 million over that time, mainly in stock and stock options.[74] On the day of her resignation, Mayer publicly highlighted many of the company's achievements during her tenure, including: creating $43B in market capitalization, tripling Yahoo stock, growing mobile users to over 650 million, building a $1.5B mobile ad business, and transforming Yahoo's culture.[73]

Allegations of WARN Act violations and gender-based discrimination[edit]
Scott Ard, a prominent editorial director, fired from Yahoo! in 2015, filed a lawsuit alleging that “Mayer encouraged and fostered the use of (an employee performance-rating system) to accommodate management’s subjective biases and personal opinions, to the detriment of Yahoo!’s male employees." He claimed that, prior to his firing, he had received "fully satisfactory" performance reviews since starting at the company in 2011 as head of editorial programming for Yahoo!'s home page; however, he was relieved of his role, which was given to a woman who had been recently hired.[75][76][77]
An earlier lawsuit was filed by Gregory Anderson, who was fired in 2014, alleging the company’s performance management system was arbitrary and unfair and disguised layoffs as terminations for the purpose of evading state and federal WARN Acts, making it the first WARN Act and gender discrimination lawsuit Yahoo! and Mayer faced in 2016.[78][79][80]
Boards and honors[edit]
As well as sitting on the boards of directors of Walmart and Jawbone, Mayer also sits on several non-profit boards such as Cooper–Hewitt, National Design Museum, New York City Ballet, San Francisco Ballet, and San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.[81][82][83][84] Mayer actively invests in technology companies, including crowd-sourced design retailer Minted,[85][86] live video platform Airtime,[86] wireless power startup uBeam,[86] online DIY community/e-commerce company Brit + Co.,[86][87] mobile payments processor Square,[86] home décor site One Kings Lane,[86][88] genetic testing company Natera,[86] and nootropics and biohacking company Nootrobox.[89]
Mayer was named to Fortune magazine's annual list of America's 50 Most Powerful Women in Business in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 with ranks at 50, 44, 42, 38, 14 and 8 respectively.[90] In 2008, at age 33, she was the youngest woman ever listed. Mayer was named one of Glamour Magazine's Women of the Year in 2009.[91] She was listed in Forbes Magazine's List of The World's 100 Most Powerful Women in 2012, 2013 and 2014, with ranks of 20, 32 and 18 respectively. In September 2013, Mayer became the first CEO of a Fortune 500 company to be featured in a Vogue magazine spread.[14] In 2013, she was also named in the Time 100 and became the first woman listed as number one on Fortune magazine's annual list of the top 40 business stars under 40 years old.[92] Mayer eventually made Fortune magazine history in 2013, as the only person to feature in all three of its annual lists during the same year: Businessperson of the Year (No. 10), Most Powerful Women (at No. 8), and 40 Under 40 (No. 1) at the same time.[93] On 24 December 2015, Mayer was listed by UK-based company Richtopia at number 14 in the list of 500 Most Influential CEO's.[94] In March 2016, in contrast, Fortune named Mayer as one of the world's most disappointing leaders.[66]
Personal life[edit]
Mayer married lawyer and investor Zachary Bogue on December 12, 2009.[37][95][96] On the day Yahoo! announced her hiring, Mayer revealed that she was pregnant;[97][98][99] she gave birth to a baby boy on September 30, 2012.[100] Although she asked for suggestions via social media,[101] the name Macallister was eventually chosen for her baby's name from an existing list.[102] On December 10, 2015, Mayer announced that she had given birth to identical twin girls,[103][104] Marielle and Sylvana.[105]
Mayer is Lutheran,[106] but said, referencing Vince Lombardi's "Your God, your family and the Green Bay Packers" quote, her priorities are "God, family and Yahoo!, except I'm not that religious, so it's really family and Yahoo!."[107] Since 2008, Mayer has lived on the 38th-floor penthouse suite at the Four Seasons Hotel in San Francisco.[20][43]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.source> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11x1gf2m6>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/type.object.type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.rate> 4.5 .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .


If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
