Avara Pharmaceutical ServicesAvara’s acquisitions to date have been from respected, global brands. Aside from capabilities, what do these facilities offer to your customers?Every Avara location has a long, proven history in the industry and adds to our growing state-of-the-art capabilities, but we are especially proud of the professional experience offered by the personnel at every facility. Avara was founded and is run by an experienced team of industry veterans who understand the working relationship between sponsor and CDMO from both perspectives. Similarly, we understand that it’s important for industry experience to exist at every level of the organization.Avara’s capabilities are extensive and will continue to grow into 2017, but the Avara team is what ultimately allows us to differentiate from other CDMOs. Though our facilities have proven capable of delivering the highest quality pharmaceuticals — including blockbuster products — that are compliant with regulatory requirements in every major market global market, our people make this possible. With every acquisition, we strive to maintain all positions in a given facility to ensure that we have the most experienced teams possible at every location. For Avara’s customers, this translates to seamless production and offers additional confidence in Avara’s ability to deliver the highest quality products on time, in full and at a fair price.How will Avara’s most recent acquisitions - in Avlon, Avonmouth, England and Norman, Oklahoma - help further the company’s growth?At Avara, we remain committed to growing our global network of world-class facilities. Our most recently acquired locations, like those last year in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, and Shannon, Ireland, have proven commercial records and will increase our flexibility, allowing us to respond with greater agility to the needs of our global customers. The Avlon manufacturing facility and Norman manufacturing and packaging facilities also add a combine 54 years of experience and help expand our global reach and overall capacity.The global CDMO market remains incredibly competitive and these acquisitions allow us to strengthen our offerings. In addition to capability, the Avlon facility also complements our API operations in Shannon, and the Norman location adds considerable analytical capabilities while also complementing both the packaging and manufacturing capabilities of our site in Arecibo, a former Merck location that just celebrated its first year with Avara. With expanded capacity and new or enhanced capabilities, we can continue to offer a fantastic customer experience in the CDMO market by remaining highly responsive and committed to delivering as promised. We also understand the value of offering a full suite of services and the packaging and warehousing facilities at our Norman location offer additional supply chain options to our customers.What are Avara’s current capabilities and how do you see those expanding in the future?We remain focused on key regions around the world and on expanding our current capabilities, which include API development and manufacturing, solid dose drug product manufacturing and fill-finish operations. With FDA- and cGMP compliant operations and our kilo-capable API facility specifically focused on maximizing production while minimizing associated issues, we strive to serve customers at various stages of production. The industry continues to see biopharmaceuticals grow in complexity and significance around the world, and we plan to expand our development and manufacturing expertise in this area to support global growth. As always, the customer experience remains central and we believe that these additional capabilities will help Avara better serve its global customers.Tim Tyson, Chairman and CEO of Avara Pharmaceutical Services, was recently Chairman and previously CEO of Aptuit. Prior to that he was President and CEO of Valeant Pharmaceuticals and served as President of GlaxoSmithKline Global Manufacturing & Supply, where he had responsibility for over 100 manufacturing sites and outsourced manufacturing worldwide. Mr. Tyson holds a Bachelors degree in Engineering from the United States Military Academy at WestPoint and MBA and MPA degrees from Jacksonville State University (USA).

About Blood Done Sign My Name
“Daddy and Roger and ’em shot ’em a nigger.”  Those words, whispered to ten-year-old Tim Tyson by a playmate, heralded a ?restorm that would forever transform the tobacco market town of Oxford, North Carolina.On May 11, 1970, Henry Marrow, a twenty-three-year-old black veteran, walked into a crossroads store owned by Robert Teel and came out running. Teel and two of his sons chased and beat Marrow, then killed him in public as he pleaded for his life.Like many small Southern towns, Oxford had barely been touched by the civil rights movement. But in the wake of the killing, young African Americans took to the streets. While lawyers battled in the courthouse, the Klan raged in the shadows and black Vietnam veterans torched the town’s tobacco warehouses. Tyson’s father, the pastor of Oxford’s all-white Methodist church, urged the town to come to terms with its bloody racial history. In the end, however, the Tyson family was forced to move away.Tim Tyson’s riveting narrative of that fiery summer brings gritty blues truth, soaring gospel vision, and down-home humor to a shocking episode of our history. Like To Kill a Mockingbird, Blood Done Sign My Name is a classic portrait of an unforgettable time and place. 




About Blood Done Sign My Name
"Daddy and Roger and ’em shot ’em a nigger."Those words, whispered to ten-year-old Tim Tyson by one of his playmates in the late spring of 1970, heralded a firestorm that would forever transform the small tobacco market town of Oxford, North Carolina. On May 11, 1970, Henry Marrow, a 23-year-old black veteran, walked into a crossroads store owned by Robert Teel, a rough man with a criminal record and ties to the Ku Klux Klan, and came out running.  Teel and two of his sons chased Marrow, beat him unmercifully, and killed him in public as he pleaded for his life. In the words of a local prosecutor: "They shot him like you or I would kill a snake."Like many small Southern towns, Oxford had barely been touched by the civil rights movement.  But in the wake of the killing, young African Americans took to the streets, led by 22-year-old Ben Chavis, a future president of the NAACP. As mass protests crowded the town square, a cluster of returning Vietnam veterans organized what one termed "a military operation." While lawyers battled in the courthouse that summer in a drama that one termed "a Perry Mason kind of thing," the Ku Klux Klan raged in the shadows and black veterans torched the town’s tobacco warehouses.  With large sections of the town in flames, Tyson’s father, the pastor of Oxford’s all-white Methodist church, pressed his congregation to widen their vision of humanity and pushed the town to come to terms with its bloody racial history. In the end, however, the Tyson family was forced to move away.Years later, historian Tim Tyson returned to Oxford to ask Robert Teel why he and his sons had killed Henry Marrow. "That nigger committed suicide, coming in here wanting to four-letter-word my daughter-in-law," Teel explained. The black radicals who burned much of Oxford also told Tim their stories. "It was like we had a cash register up there at the pool hall, just ringing up how much money we done cost these white people," one of them explained. "We knew if we cost ’em enough goddamn money they was gonna start changing some things."In the tradition of To Kill a Mockingbird, Blood Done Sign My Name is a classic work of conscience, a defining portrait of a time and place that we will never forget. Tim Tyson’s riveting narrative of that fiery summer and one family’s struggle to build bridges in a time of destruction brings gritty blues truth, soaring gospel vision, and down-home humor to our complex history, where violence and faith, courage and evil, despair and hope all mingle to illuminate America’s enduring chasm of race.From the Hardcover edition.

About Blood Done Sign My Name
"Daddy and Roger and ’em shot ’em a nigger."Those words, whispered to ten-year-old Tim Tyson by one of his playmates in the late spring of 1970, heralded a firestorm that would forever transform the small tobacco market town of Oxford, North Carolina. On May 11, 1970, Henry Marrow, a 23-year-old black veteran, walked into a crossroads store owned by Robert Teel, a rough man with a criminal record and ties to the Ku Klux Klan, and came out running.  Teel and two of his sons chased Marrow, beat him unmercifully, and killed him in public as he pleaded for his life. In the words of a local prosecutor: "They shot him like you or I would kill a snake."Like many small Southern towns, Oxford had barely been touched by the civil rights movement.  But in the wake of the killing, young African Americans took to the streets, led by 22-year-old Ben Chavis, a future president of the NAACP. As mass protests crowded the town square, a cluster of returning Vietnam veterans organized what one termed "a military operation." While lawyers battled in the courthouse that summer in a drama that one termed "a Perry Mason kind of thing," the Ku Klux Klan raged in the shadows and black veterans torched the town’s tobacco warehouses.  With large sections of the town in flames, Tyson’s father, the pastor of Oxford’s all-white Methodist church, pressed his congregation to widen their vision of humanity and pushed the town to come to terms with its bloody racial history. In the end, however, the Tyson family was forced to move away.Years later, historian Tim Tyson returned to Oxford to ask Robert Teel why he and his sons had killed Henry Marrow.

Praise

    “Admirable and unexpected…a riveting story that will have his readers weeping with both laughter and sorrow.” —Chicago Tribune“Blood Done Sign My Name is a most important book and one of the most powerful meditations on race in America that I have ever read.” —Cleveland Plain Dealer“Pulses with vital paradox . . . It’s a detached dissertation, a damning dark-night-of-the-white-soul, and a ripping yarn, all united by Tyson’s powerful voice, a brainy, booming Bubba profundo.” —Entertainment Weekly“If you want to read only one book to understand the uniquely American struggle for racial equality and the swirls of emotion around it, this is it.” —Milwaukee Journal Sentinel“Engaging and frequently stunning.” —San Diego Union-Tribune

Publisher's Description▼▲
“Daddy and Roger and ’em shot ’em a nigger.”  Those words, whispered to ten-year-old Tim Tyson by a playmate, heralded a ?restorm that would forever transform the tobacco market town of Oxford, North Carolina.On May 11, 1970, Henry Marrow, a twenty-three-year-old black veteran, walked into a crossroads store owned by Robert Teel and came out running. Teel and two of his sons chased and beat Marrow, then killed him in public as he pleaded for his life.Like many small Southern towns, Oxford had barely been touched by the civil rights movement. But in the wake of the killing, young African Americans took to the streets. While lawyers battled in the courthouse, the Klan raged in the shadows and black Vietnam veterans torched the town’s tobacco warehouses. Tyson’s father, the pastor of Oxford’s all-white Methodist church, urged the town to come to terms with its bloody racial history. In the end, however, the Tyson family was forced to move away.Tim Tyson’s riveting narrative of that fiery summer brings gritty blues truth, soaring gospel vision, and down-home humor to a shocking episode of our history. Like To Kill a Mockingbird, Blood Done Sign My Name is a classic portrait of an unforgettable time and place.

Detailed item info
SynopsisIn 2014, protesters ringed the White House, chanting, "How many black kids will you kill? Michael Brown, Emmett Till " Why did demonstrators invoke the name of a black boy murdered six decades before? In 1955, white men in the Mississippi Delta lynched a fourteen-year-old from Chicago named Emmett Till. His murder was part of a wave of white terrorism in the wake of the 1954 Supreme Court decision that declared public school segregation unconstitutional. The national coalition organized to protest the Till lynching became the foundation of the modern civil rights movement. Only weeks later, Rosa Parks thought about young Emmett as she refused to move to the back of a city bus in Montgomery, Alabama. Five years later, the Emmett Till generation, forever marked by the vicious killing of a boy their own age, launched sit-in campaigns that turned the struggle into a mass movement. "I can hear the blood of Emmett Till as it calls from the ground," shouted a black preacher in Albany, Georgia. But what actually happened to Emmett Till--not the icon of injustice but the flesh-and-blood boy? Part detective story, part political history, Timothy Tyson's The Blood of Emmett Till draws on a wealth of new evidence, including the only interview ever given by Carolyn Bryant, the white woman in whose name Till was killed. Tyson's gripping narrative upends what we thought we knew about the most notorious racial crime in American history., In 2014, protesters ringed the White House, chanting, -How many black kids will you kill? Michael Brown, Emmett Till - Why did demonstrators invoke the name of a black boy murdered six decades before? In 1955, white men in the Mississippi Delta lynched a fourteen-year-old from Chicago named Emmett Till. His murder was part of a wave of white terrorism in the wake of the 1954 Supreme Court decision that declared public school segregation unconstitutional. The national coalition organized to protest the Till lynching became the foundation of the modern civil rights movement. Only weeks later, Rosa Parks thought about young Emmett as she refused to move to the back of a city bus in Montgomery, Alabama. Five years later, the Emmett Till generation, forever marked by the vicious killing of a boy their own age, launched sit-in campaigns that turned the struggle into a mass movement. -I can hear the blood of Emmett Till as it calls from the ground, - shouted a black preacher in Albany, Georgia. But what actually happened to Emmett Till--not the icon of injustice but the flesh-and-blood boy? Part detective story, part political history, Timothy Tyson's The Blood of Emmett Till draws on a wealth of new evidence, including the only interview ever given by Carolyn Bryant, the white woman in whose name Till was killed. Tyson's gripping narrative upends what we thought we knew about the most notorious racial crime in American history., The event that launched the civil rights movement the 1955 lynching of young Emmett Till now reexamined by an award-winning author with access to never-before-heard accounts from those involved as well as recently recovered court transcripts from the trial. In 1955, a fourteen-year-old black boy named Emmett Till, who had come down from Chicago to visit relatives in Mississippi, was murdered by a group of white men. He had gone into a small country store a few days earlier and made flirtatious remarks to a white woman, twenty-one-year-old Carolyn Bryant; Bryant s husband and brother-in-law were two of Till s attackers. They were never convicted, but Till s lynching became one of the most notorious hate crimes in American history. It set off a wave of protests across the country, helped the NAACP gain thousands of members, and inspired famous activists like Rosa Parks to stand up and fight for equal rights for the first time. Part detective story, part political history, Timothy Tyson s "The Blood of Emmett Till" revises the history of the Till case, not only changing the specifics that we thought we knew, but showing how the murder ignited the modern civil rights movement. Tyson uses a wide range of new sources, including the only interview ever given by Carolyn Bryant; the transcript of the murder trial, missing since 1955 and only recovered in 2005; and a recent FBI report on the case. In a time where discussions of race are once again coming to the fore, "The Blood of Emmett Till "redefines a crucial moment in civil rights history.", This extraordinary New York Times bestseller reexamines a pivotal event of the civil rights movement--the 1955 lynching of Emmett Till--"and demands that we do the one vital thing we aren't often enough asked to do with history: learn from it" ( The Atlantic ). In 1955, white men in the Mississippi Delta lynched a fourteen-year-old from Chicago named Emmett Till. His murder was part of a wave of white terrorism in the wake of the 1954 Supreme Court decision that declared public school segregation unconstitutional. Only weeks later, Rosa Parks thought about young Emmett as she refused to move to the back of a city bus in Montgomery, Alabama. Five years later, Black students who called themselves "the Emmett Till generation" launched sit-in campaigns that turned the struggle for civil rights into a mass movement. Till's lynching became the most notorious hate crime in American history. But what actually happened to Emmett Till--not the icon of injustice, but the flesh-and-blood boy? Part detective story, part political history, The Blood of Emmett Till "unfolds like a movie" ( The Atlanta Journal-Constitution ), drawing on a wealth of new evidence, including a shocking admission of Till's innocence from the woman in whose name he was killed. "Jolting and powerful" ( The Washington Post ), the book "provides fresh insight into the way race has informed and deformed our democratic institutions" (Diane McWhorter, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Carry Me Home ) and "calls us to the cause of justice today" (Rev. Dr. William J. Barber, II, president of the North Carolina NAACP).Product IdentifiersISBN-101476714843ISBN-139781476714844Key DetailsAuthorTimothy B.

Till's memory burns brighter with each year and is a touchstone for understanding white violence against black men in our nation today.", "An insightful addition to the tragedy that energized many American citizens to fight against racism.", "An insightful, revealing and important new inquiry into the tragedy that mobilized and energized a generation of Americans to stand and fight against racial bigotry.", "Apply[s] diligent research, scrupulous perspective and a vigorous aptitude for weaving pertinent public and intimate details.", "Bolstered by prodigious research... the well-presented details... add atmosphere. In addition, Tyson is masterful at explaining how the Till murder became a major cause of the civil rights movement. Especially resonant today is the author's focus on obtaining voting rights for blacks in Southern states that denied those rights before the Till murder.... Tyson skillfully demonstrates how, in our allegedly post-racial country, a "national racial caste system" remains in place.", "Compelling.... With Tyson's new book, and Carolyn Bryant Donham's remarks, we have reason to revisit a period in our history when bigotry, blood, and sacrifice became a call to action. ", "Elegant and sophisticated .... Tyson successfully connects the dots, and without actually saying so (he worked on the book for years prior to Nov. 8, 2016), draws a resolute if symbolic line between Emmett Till... and the white supremacist foreground of this country.", "From one of our finest civil rights historians comes this harrowing, brilliant, and crucial book. The full story of Emmett Till has never before been told. It will terrify you; it should. It will inspire you; it must.", "Groundbreaking new evidence and Tyson's masterful prose make The Blood of Emmett Till a devastating indictment of America, both past and present.", "I couldn't stop reading Timothy Tyson's The Blood of Emmett Till . It is civil rights history that captivates the reader like a mystery novel....", "In many ways, Timothy Tyson is the ideal author to explore new details surrounding the lynching death of Emmett Till....", "More than simply a retelling of the story of Till's death and the subsequent trial, the book incorporates new sources into the narrative... In the course of telling this story, Tyson explores larger, more important lessons about America's long, bitter struggle with race.", "Such a powerful sweep of history.... With a tone at once measured and urgent, Tyson calls us to action, prods us to create a radically different future by making good on, and learning from, the past.", "Till's memory burns brighter with each passing year and remains a touchstone for understanding white violence against black men today.", "Tim Tyson has universalized the Emmett Till story to make it an American tragedy. His bracing, granular narrative provides fresh insight into the way race has informed and deformed our democratic institutions.", "Tim Tyson's profound eloquence and groundbreaking evidence capture the cries of Emmett Till and the rise of a movement, and will call us to the cause of justice today.", "Tyson does an admirable job of condensing and updating information about the case, using a 2006 FBI report on Till's murder to weave together a historical tapestry.", "Tyson's remarkable achievement is that each thread is explored in detail, backstories as well as main events, while he maintains a page-turning readability for what might seem a familiar tale. Cinematically engaging, harrowing, and poignant, Tyson's monumental work illuminates Emmett Till's murder and serves as a powerful reminder that certain stories in history merit frequent retelling.", "What sets Tyson's book apart is the wide-angle lens he uses to examine the lynching, and the ugly parallels between past and present... A terrific writer and storyteller, Tyson compels a closer look at a heinous crime and the consequential decisions, large and small, that made it a national issue.", "When Cain killed Abel, the Bible tells us, God said, 'Listen! Your brother's blood cries out to me from the ground.' His blood screamed from the earth for the truth to be told. Tim Tyson's profound eloquence and groundbreaking evidence capture the cries of Emmett Till and the rise of a movement, and call us to the cause of justice today.", "[A] powerful, moving book.... [Tyson] has expertly unearthed and synthesized... to give a fuller picture than we've ever had of the minute-by-minute details of the crime, and of what people were saying and thinking about the Emmett Till case as it unfolded. It will certainly be the definitive account of this crucial catalyst for the civil rights struggle."

A book is the nearest thing we have to telepathy, sending thoughts from the author's mind directly to the readers even over a gap of two thousand years. Even with all our technology, there is no better way to make a brain to brain connection than by simply reading a book. Go Way Back to the BeginningAntique books and manuscripts offer an amazing look into history, you can see the thoughts of the past as they saw them themselves. Antiquarian and collectible books don't just look good on the shelf, they also grow in value. There is nothing like picking up an old book to really feel the past. Explore the Human ConditionThe beauty of fiction and literature is that it lets you explore the human condition in a way that mere recitations of fact can never duplicate. Rather than focusing on the mundane, these books bring out the emotional truth of human experience. They show you who you really are by exposing you to other experiences you could never have discovered yourself. These books are the underpinnings of human culture. See how someone else sees the world. Discover the World Around YouNon fiction books offer the widest range of human experience, joined only by their commitment to the truth. From self-help to space travel, they run the gamut of human thought. Learn how to deal with your family, how to save money for that trip, or how the Egyptians built the pyramids. Follow famous lives, or study esoteric philosophies. It's all there for you to find. Non fiction gives us the foundations of human civilization, the story of how everything works. Keep Learning for LifeEducation is the gateway to success, and textbooks are your key to that door. From elementary readers to calculus texts, these books are the doors to our full potential. Textbooks not only give us facts, they give us the tools to interpret and make use of those facts. They are the key to organizing our thoughts and making our brains work for us. It's not just academia either, mechanics textbooks can help you learn how to fix your car.Tell us what you think - opens in new window or tabSide Refine PanelShop by CategoryAntique Books and ManuscriptsAudiobooksBook & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsSee all in Book & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsBook Wholesale LotsOther Book & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsWholesale AudiobooksWholesale MagazinesBook AccessoriesSee all in Book AccessoriesAddress BooksBlank Diaries & JournalsBook CoversBook LightsBook PlatesBook Stands & HoldersBookendsBookmarksOther Book AccessoriesCatalogsSee all in CatalogsAgriculture CatalogsArt & Exhibitions CatalogsAuction CatalogsClothing & Fashion CatalogsDepartment Stores CatalogsMusic & Instruments CatalogsOther CatalogsOwner's Manuals CatalogsToys & Hobbies CatalogsChildren & Young Adult BooksSee all in Children & Young Adult BooksChildren & YA Non-Fiction BooksChildren's Fiction BooksChildren's Picture BooksOther Children & Young Adult BooksYoung Adult Fiction BooksCookbooksFiction & Literature BooksMagazine Back IssuesNonfiction BooksOther BooksTextbooks & Educational Books

Nonfiction books span the gamut of human experience, and some people have done unbelievable things. Nonfiction isn't limited to memoirs and biographies, either; it covers anything that isn't made up.Take a Step Into the PastHistory has always been a popular form of nonfiction, largely because there are so many different kinds of history. You can study everything from military history, to the history of quilting on the Canadian prairies. Anything people have ever done has a history, and in most cases you can find a nonfiction book about it. History covers everything from the broad sweep of empires to the personal stories of a single week in an individual's life. It's the story of humanity.Discover Your Inner SpiritualityEven as the world grows more and more materialistic, people find themselves turning toward nonfiction books on religion and spirituality. These books provide many people a way to find meaning in a world that is moving faster and faster every day. You can find everything from closely reasoned apologetics for the major faiths, to New Age life guides in the same place. Perhaps you'll succeed at your quest for meaning between the pages of a nonfiction book.Everyone Has to EatAll cultures have one thing in common; recipes. No matter what the culture, someone has written a cookbook, spreading cuisine around the world. You can find books on French, German, Italian, Caribbean, and just about any other form of cuisine you can imagine. In addition to cookbooks, there is also a whole world of diet books. Whether you want to lose weight, gain weight, or manage a health condition, there is a diet book to fit your needs.The Eyes Have ItArt and photography books bring the vision of the world to your very eyes. Art is fundamental to the human experience, and just one art book can show you millions of dollars' worth of old masters from around the world without the need to leave your couch. Photography books let you see the world as people like Ansel Adams and F-Stop Fitzgerald see it.Tell us what you think - opens in new window or tabSide Refine PanelShop by CategoryBooksNonfiction BooksBook AccessoriesAntique Books and ManuscriptsAudiobooksCatalogsChildren & Young Adult BooksCookbooksFiction & Literature BooksMagazine Back IssuesTextbooks & Educational BooksBook & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsOther BooksFormatsee allHardcoverPaperbackMixed LotSubjectsee allArt & PhotographyBiography & AutobiographyBooks on CollectingHistoryMilitary & WarReligion & SpiritualitySports & RecreationTransportationPublication Yearsee all1800-18991900-19491950-19992000-20102011-NowSpecial Attributessee all1st EditionDust JacketEx-LibraryIllustratedLarge PrintSignedLanguagesee allConditionsee allBrand NewLike NewVery GoodGoodAcceptableNot SpecifiedPricePlease provide a valid price range$-$Buying Formatsee allAll ListingsAuctionBuy It NowItem Locationsee allDefaultWithindistance2 miles5 miles10 miles15 miles20 miles50 miles75 miles100 miles150 miles200 miles500 miles750 miles1000 miles1500 miles2000 milesofGoUS OnlyNorth AmericaWorldwideDelivery Optionssee allFree ShippingFree In-store PickupShow onlysee allReturns AcceptedCompleted ItemsSold ItemsDeals & SavingsMore refinements...
