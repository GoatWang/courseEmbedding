The ranking is computed by rank ordering all professors based on number of publications in the topical and/or methodology.  ICI is computed by determining the drop in ranking "levels" if the professor were to leave the university (thus a higher number means a more valuable researcher).  The colors correspond to a heat map (see legend at bottom of table) showing the research areas in which the individual excels.

                           A two-phase study, involving both laboratory and field investigations, has demonstrated the feasibility of using reverse osmosis
                              to provide potable water from acid mine drainage. The laboratory investigations involved the determination of methods for
                              controlling iron fouling and the selection of a process flow sheet. During the field test, the process developed in Phase
                              I was used to treat acid mine drainage from an underground abandoned anthracite coal mine. Treatment prior to reverse osmosis
                              consisted of filtration (10 microns) followed by ultraviolet light disinfection. Brine from the RO unit was treated by neutralization,
                              oxidation, and settling. Results obtained indicated that membrane fouling due to iron was satisfactorily controlled, but calcium
                              sulfate fouling limited the recovery of product water to about 75%. Product water was of potable quality in all respects except
                              for iron, manganese, and pH. Calcium sulfate precipitate on the RO membrane was successfully removed using a solution of ammoniated
                              citric acid at pH 8

                           The report documents a study to develop a treatment system for combined sewer overflows. The processes of chemical oxidation,
                              screening, dissolved-air flotation, and disinfection were evaluated in the laboratory. A 5 MGD demonstration system was designed,
                              installed and evaluated. Suspended solids and volatile suspended solids removal in the range of 65-80% were consistently obtained
                              at influent concentrations of 150 to 600 mg/l. BOD and COD removals were slightly lower at 55 to 65% for influent concentrations
                              of 50 to 500 mg/l. Addition of chemical flocculents (ferric chloride and a cationic polyelectrolyte) was necessary to obtain
                              these removals. Without the use of chemical flocculents, removal of BOD, COD, suspended solids, and volatile suspended solids
                              were all in the range of 40-50%. The screening flotation system provided sufficient detention time (difference 15 minutes)
                              for adequate disinfection with hypochlorite salts. Cost estimates are presented

                           Pilot scale tubular and spiral wound Reverse Osmosis (RO) units were used to establish the feasibility of renovating municipal
                              sewage. Results indicated that prior treatment with ferric chloride and alum will be necessary even when using the tubular
                              RO system. RO produced an approximate 100 mg/ TDS of inorganic ions in the effluent, but an estimated 40 to 50% of the soluble
                              organic material permeated the membranes at high feed water recoveries. Approximately 70% of the organic material passing
                              the membrane was ethanol, but other organics may pass through the membranes from other sewages. 92% water recovery rates,
                              with no precipitation problems in the RO concentrate, were achieved, but RO product waters would require further treatment
                              for organic removal prior to discharge. The feasibility of biodegrading RO concentrates was also established

About this Textbook




The present advanced text-cum-reference book is designed not only for advanced undergraduate and graduate students, but also for academic and industrial researchers who work with heterocyclic compounds. It presents a comprehensive account of the syntheses, reactions, properties and applications of all the most significant classes of heterocyclic compounds. Heterocyclic Chemistry has been organised in three volumes. This second volume contains six chapters: Introduction, Five-Membered Heterocycles with One Heteroatom, Benzo-Fused Five-Membered Heterocycles with One Heteroatom, Five-Membered Heterocycles with Two Heteroatoms, Five-Membered Heterocycles with More Than Two Heteroatoms, and Meso-Ionic Heterocycles. Recent developments in heterocyclic chemistry are emphasized.Each chapter starts with the principles of structure and reactivity for the compound class in question, followed by a detailed treatment of synthesis, structure and reactions for the individual members of that class. The subject is illustrated with a large number of figures and schemes. This book is an essential tool for advanced students and for academic and industrial researchers in organic, medicinal, pharmaceutical, dye and agricultural chemistry.

An Experimental Investigation of the Effect of Cost Information and Feedback on Product Cost Decisions

Abstract
In this paper we report the results of an experiment designed to investigate the potential benefits of more accurate costing systems. Subjects in our experiment participated in one of four single-person decision making settings which varied in terms of the accuracy of costing systems (less accurate versus more accurate cost reports), and the complexity of the economic environment (less heterogeneous versus more heterogeneous products). The costing systems provided imperfect reports that subjects could use to select forecasts of future product costs. Forecast accuracy determined the resulting payoffs for subjects. In addition to having the cost reports when makingforecasts, subjects also observed the association between forecasts and actual profits for previous periods and the rank ordering of the products' relative usage of resources at each of the production processes.The results from our experiment indicate that subjects did not select forecasts based only on reported costs. Rather they updated forecasts using profit feedback and the supplemental rank information about the products' relative usage of resources. We found that profits decreased as the complexity of economic environment increased; but increased with the accuracy of cost reports.The profits associated with less accurate costing systems, however, were not as low as we would have predicted had the subjects used the cost reports as their forecasts. In fact, using profit feedback, subjects were able to converge toward optimal profits even with imperfect cost information.
