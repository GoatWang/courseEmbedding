Concierge Services







Some family clients prefer to have us assist in a variety of adjunct services related to their operation and administration. These include:
Bill Paying – We operate checking or bill paying accounts to assist family members in specific areas, such as disbursing moneys on their behalf from private foundations, or for mobile families with multiple residences, operating the bill paying needs of specific properties.
Travel Arrangements – We have vetted travel and private airplane charter services that can help efficiently fill an occasional need by clients. We currently supervise operations of privately owned jet services for select clients, and provide guidance on the merits of operating your own plane or participating in a jet leasing service.
Vehicle Management – We arrange purchase and delivery of specialized automobiles and other vehicles according to client needs.
Caretaker Recruiting – We have established relationships with several recruiters specializing in identifying and qualifying personal caretakers that can provide services from personal live-in help to property management of residences, ranches, or farms.
Health Care Advocacy – We have engaged the services of an independent health advisory firm which gives our clients access to objective medical advice for any type of problem, whether it’s a short term issue or something that requires ongoing treatment.
We serve as a single source that our family office clients can call with any need or issue related to their affairs. We will either implement solutions ourselves or find solutions promptly to make their lives as convenient and cost effective as possible.

Investment Process







STEP ONE:
STRATEGIC CONSULTING PROCESS

First, we determine your unique financial circumstances.
We review and analyze your unique investment and administrative goals, objectives and needs, your investment horizon and appetite for risk, in the context of a changing and complex tax, regulatory, and economic and financial environment. We also take special note of and accommodate any financial, regulatory, legal, or social constraints. We strive to design a portfolio structure that uniquely fits your special circumstances.
The strategic consulting process includes, but is not limited to, an analysis of the:

Investment objectives and preferences;
Prudent risk parameters;
Asset allocation;
Legal and other constraints;
Net cash flow requirements;
Administration and custody arrangements;
Money managers’ performance;
Money managers’ investment process;
Fee structure

This strategic consulting process is critical. The information gathered at this step is used as the foundation for all subsequent decisions regarding the investment program.
STEP TWO:
DESIGN OPTIMAL PORTFOLIO

Second, we design an allocation plan that is intended to achieve your financial goals.
Our asset optimization program is designed to provide an understanding of the trade-offs between investment risk and return. These simulations assist us in determining a set of optimal asset allocation strategies, which we believe have the highest probability of meeting your needs.
Our asset allocation model includes a set of capital market assumptions characterizing the expected future market performance of the major asset classes. These capital markets expectations reflect a five-year outlook for the broad asset classes and include expected returns, risks, and the correlations between the asset classes. Asset mix variables specific to each sub-asset class are incorporated in the asset allocation model. These variables include: risk tolerance, asset class preference, time horizon, and expected return.
STEP THREE:
FORMULATION OF INVESTMENT GUIDELINES AND OBJECTIVES —
INVESTMENT POLICY STATEMENT

Third, we prepare a written IPS that provides a framework to guide the investment process.
The Investment Policy Statement (IPS) is an invaluable strategic planning tool for sound investment management. We view the IPS as a working document, the contents of which will change in accordance with any changes made to the asset allocation variables described above. This document serves to clearly articulate the investment process and parameters for all concerned.
The completed IPS includes risk/reward characteristics for the investable assets, performance benchmarks, as well as control procedures and guidelines for the total portfolio.
STEP FOUR:
MANAGER SEARCH AND SELECTION

Fourth, we seek to utilize top quartile managers for each asset class and investment style.
In order to maximize our objectivity and focus on your unique needs, we leverage the money management databases available to us through our affiliation with Zephyr Associates. Zephyr Associates is a global leader in the development of analytical software tools used to analyze investment managers, mutual funds, financial markets, and investment portfolios. Zephyr’s extensive resources enable us to study the global breadth of money managers, focusing on the best specialists available in each asset class.
Our search process begins with a thorough screening process where we analyze each manager’s ability to generate consistently superior returns relative to both peer group and benchmark indices. Equally important to us is that each manager is capable of producing excellent results not just when markets are performing well, but also when markets are not performing well.
The search process itself follows a formal multi-step process. When analyzing candidates for search purposes several critical factors are considered. Among these factors are:

Quantitative – manager style, assets under management, length of track record, fees, performance history, risk statistics, and correlations; and
Qualitative – manager reputation, client base profile, geographic locations, personnel, management type (team vs. star system), client service/communication, publicity (positive or negative).

The result of this disciplined search process is a manageable number of candidates for each style category.
STEP FIVE:
MONITOR & SUPERVISE

Fifth, we maintain rigorous supervision to seek to insure that your portfolio achieves its investment goals.
Our performance evaluation process seeks to measure the absolute and relative performance results of every investment manager. The objective of the process is to establish a reliable monitoring process through verification and documentation of performance results relative to benchmarks and guidelines.
We use both internal and external performance measurement capabilities to provide a comprehensive and informative evaluation of the total portfolio and individual portfolio managers on an ongoing basis. The organization and content of a performance measurement report enables you to determine “why” performance results were achieved, and to identify adjustments, which periodically become necessary to maintain performance and management risk. While the performance measurement is easy to understand, often the more important element is the interpretation and insights, which we gather from these statistics.
In summary, our investment management services include:


A review of your current investment program;
A comprehensive asset allocation analysis;
A written Investment Policy Statement;
Selection of appropriate Investment Managers;
A review of your investment plan; and
Performance monitoring.


Fees
Manchester Capital Management is only compensated on a percentage fee on assets basis, with the percentage varying depending on the size of assets.
Family Office Services – Minimum $50 million in assets
Investment Management Services – Only by Special Requests
Past performance is not indicative of any specific investment or future results.  As with any investment, there is the possibility of profit as well as the risk of loss.

Financial Planning







Our Financial Planning service coordinates our investment management process with a clients’ short and long-term objectives, their risk exposures (personal liability, health insurance, life insurance, property insurance, etc.), and their estate plans (the purpose and eventual destination of their assets).
We serve as the financial quarterback, working with all of a client’s advisors, including legal and tax professionals, to help integrate a complete plan with measurable goals and expected outcomes. During this process we review all documents and specifics, and then construct planning scenarios that forecast asset value changes.
Specific planning assignments may include:

Building Net Worth statements and forecasting changes over time.
Managing personal Cash Flow statements and linking those flows to investment management decisions.
Helping to answer the question: what can I prudently withdraw from my accounts?
Protecting health, property, and business continuity by reviewing and recommending insurance designs.
Recommending trust or charitable structures to effectively distribute wealth to family or non-profit organizations.
Analyzing tax and investment structures to complement investment goals.

Like an Investment Plan, all Financial Plans should be reviewed periodically or anytime a significant event happens in the life of a client. These events may include the birth or death of a family member, changes in a client’s business structure, the acquisition or loss of assets, such as a primary or secondary residence, or changes in lifetime gifting desires. In many ways, financial planning is risk management in its purest form. We strive to identify and thereby avoid financial threats and personal hazards through careful planning and analysis.
Nothing contained on this website constitutes investment, legal, tax or other advice and is not to be relied on in making an investment or other decision.

Zacks Investment Research lowered shares of CA Inc. (NASDAQ:CA) from a buy rating to a hold rating in a research report released on Monday morning. 
According to Zacks, “CA is a leading information technology (IT) management software company. We are optimistic about CA’s acquisition strategy, which has enhanced its IT management, software and services portfolio. Moreover, we believe that the diversity of its products and the increased efficiency offered by them will attract customers across sectors, lending stability to its business model. Additionally, CA’s “go to market” sales strategy integrates the commercial functions of sales, marketing, brand management, pricing and consumer insight, which helps it in lowering costs, thereby improving the bottom line. Nonetheless, intensifying competition from peers, an uncertain economic environment, currency headwinds and the weak IT spending forecast by Gartner are other concerns. Notably, shares of the company has underperformed the broader market over the last one year period.”
Other equities research analysts have also issued reports about the company. Jefferies Group LLC  restated a buy rating and issued a $38.00 price target on shares of CA in a research report on Friday, April 28th. Oppenheimer Holdings, Inc.  restated a market perform rating on shares of CA in a research report on Friday, May 12th. Raymond James Financial, Inc.  restated a market perform rating on shares of CA in a research report on Thursday, June 22nd.
