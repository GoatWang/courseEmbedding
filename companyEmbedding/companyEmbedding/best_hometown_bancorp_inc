(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations at March 31, 2017 and for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the Company. The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto, appearing in Part 1, Item 1 of this report.  CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  This Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements, which can be identified by the use of words such as "estimate," "project," "believe," "intend," "anticipate," "plan," "seek," "expect," "will," "may" and words of similar meaning. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to:  � statements of our goals, intentions and expectations;  � statements regarding our business plans, prospects, growth and operating strategies;  � statements regarding the asset quality of our loan and investment portfolios; and  � estimates of our risks and future costs and benefits.  These forward-looking statements are based on our current beliefs and expectations and are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, these forward-looking statements are subject to assumptions with respect to future business strategies and decisions that are subject to change. We are under no duty to and do not take any obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date of this Form 10-Q, except as required by law.  The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements:  � general economic conditions, either nationally or in our market areas, that are worse than expected;  � competition among depository and other financial institutions;  � changes in the interest rate environment that reduce our margins or reduce the fair value of financial instruments;  � adverse changes in the securities markets;  � changes in laws or government regulations or policies affecting financial institutions, including changes in regulatory fees and capital requirements;  � our ability to enter new markets successfully and capitalize on growth opportunities;  � changes in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits;  � changes in accounting policies and practices, as may be adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board;  � changes in our organization, compensation and benefit plans;  � changes in our financial condition or results of operations that reduce capital; and  Table of Contents  � changes in the financial condition or future prospects of issuers of securities that we own.  Additional factors that may affect our results are discussed in Best Hometown Bancorp, Inc.'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 30, 2017, including under the section titled "Risk Factors". These factors and the other factors listed above should be considered in evaluating the forward-looking statements, and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements.  Critical Accounting Policies  There are no material changes to the critical accounting policies disclosed in the Registrant's Form S-1 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Comparison of Financial Condition at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016  Our total assets increased $4.6 million, or 4.2%, to $114.0 million at March 31, 2017 from $109.4 million at December 31, 2016. The increase in total assets is primarily due to the $1.4 million increase in net loans and the purchase of bank owned life insurance of $3.4 million. The increase in total assets was supported by increases in our total deposits and FHLB advances of $4.6 million, or 4.9%, to $99.1 million at March 31, 2017 from $94.5 million at December 31, 2016.  Gross loans increased by $1.5 million, or 2.0%, to $76.9 million at March 31, 2017 from $75.5 million at December 31, 2016. All of our loan portfolio segments increased except for our one-to four-family owner and non-owner occupied loans. Our commercial and multifamily, construction and land, commercial business, and consumer loan segments increased by $535,000, $276,000, $1.1 million, and $234,000, respectively. In total, our one-to four-family, owner occupied and non-owner occupied loans decreased to $52.4 million at March 31, 2017 from $53.0 million at December 31, 2016. The decrease in one-to four-family loans and increase in all other loan segments, particularly, commercial and multi-family and commercial business loans, reflects our strategy of focusing our lending efforts more on commercial lending and an increase in demand for these types of loans during the first quarter of 2017.  Securities available for sale increased by $314,000, or 1.2%, to $25.5 million at March 31, 2017 from $25.2 million at December 31, 2016. The increase reflects approximately $1.8 million in purchase of additional U.S. government agency mortgage-backed securities, net of approximately $1.4 million in paydowns on these securities. Our strategy is to limit our investing activities and deploy as much of our funds into higher-yielding loans.  Real estate owned, net increased to $29,000 at March 31, 2017, which was the result of one foreclosure on a one-to four-family residential loan during the three months ended March 31, 2017, resulting in a charge off of approximately $4,000.  Our deposits increased $1.6 million, or 1.8%, to $90.1 million at March 31, 2017 from $88.5 million at December 31, 2016, with $807,000, or 16.8%, of the increase in noninterest-bearing deposits and $844,000, or 1.0%, in interest bearing deposits. The increase reflects a steady demand by our deposit products, particularly our money market savings and checking accounts.  FHLB advances increased to $9.0 million at March 31, 2017 from $6.0 million at December 31, 2016. In March of this quarter, we borrowed $3.0 million in a short-term, 6-month, advance at a variable rate of LIBOR -16 basis points to fulfill short-term liquidity needs to match our loan growth.  Shareholders' equity decreased by $82,000, or 0.64%, to $12.7 million at March 31, 2017. The decrease in shareholders' equity reflects our net loss of $115 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2017, offset mainly by a decrease of $37,000, or 2.1%, of accumulated other comprehensive loss related to available-for-sale securities and the defined benefit and postretirement medical plans.  Table of Contents  Nonperforming Assets The table below sets forth the amounts and categories of our nonperforming assets at the dates indicated. At March 31, At December 31, 2017 2016 (Dollars in thousands) Non-accrual loans: Real estate mortgage loans: One- to four-family, owner occupied $ 19 $ 39 One- to four-family, non-owner occupied - 30 Commercial and multi-family 68 69 Construction and land 14 16 Total non-accrual loans 101 154 Accruing loans past due 90 days or more: Consumer loans - - Accruing troubled debt restructured loans: Real estate mortgage loans: One- to four-family, owner occupied 87 87 Total accruing troubled debt restructured loans 87 87 Total non-performing loans 188 241 Foreclosed real estate held for sale: One- to four-family 29 - Total foreclosed real estate held for sale 29 - Total non-performing assets $ 217 $ 241 Total non-performing loans to total gross loans 0.24 % 0.32 % Total non-performing assets to total assets 0.19 % 0.22 %  Interest income that would have been recorded had our non-accruing loans been current in accordance with their original terms was $4,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and no income was recognized on these loans for the three months ended March 31, 2017. There were no nonaccrual loans at March 31, 2016.  Interest income that would have been recorded had our trouble debt restructured loans been current in accordance with their original terms was $1,000 and $4,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. Interest of $1,000 and $4,000 was recognized on these loans and is included in net income for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.  The decrease in nonperforming assets is a reflection of strong credit quality within our loan portfolio.  Table of Contents  Analysis of Net Interest Margin  The following table sets forth average balance sheets, average annualized yields and rates, and certain other information at and for the periods indicated. No tax-equivalent yield adjustments were made, as the effect thereof was not material. All average balances are daily average balances. Nonaccrual loans were included in the computation of average balances, but have been reflected in the tables as loans carrying a zero yield. The yields set forth below include the effect of net deferred costs, discounts and premiums that are amortized or accreted to income.   For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 March 31, 2016 Interest Interest Average and Yield/ Average and Yield/ Balance Dividends Cost Balance Dividends Cost (Dollars in Thousands) Assets: Interest-earning assets: Loans $ 76,040 818 4.30 % $ 73,170 821 4.49 % Investment securities 25,848 101 1.56 11,361 46 1.62 Interest-bearing deposits 3,083 9 1.17 5,744 9 0.63 Total interest-earning assets 104,971 928 3.54 90,275 876 3.88 Noninterest-earning assets 5,330 7,407 Total assets $ 110,301 $ 97,682 Liabilities and equity: Interest-bearing liabilities: Checking accounts $ 442 1 0.92 % $ 290 - - % Savings accounts 7,345 1 0.06 7,950 1 0.05 Money market accounts 13,294 15 0.46 8,927 5 0.23 Certificates of deposit 62,817 244 1.58 60,580 232 1.56 Total interest-bearing deposits 83,898 261 1.26 77,747 238 1.24 FHLB advances and other 6,355 38 2.43 6,194 71 4.66 Total interest-bearing liabilities 90,253 299 1.34 83,941 309 1.50 Noninterest bearing deposits 6,286 4,008 Other noninterest-bearing liabilities 2,895 2,845 Total liabilities 99,434 90,794 Equity 10,867 6,888 Total liabilities and equity $ 110,301 $ 97,682 Net interest income $ 629 $ 567 Interest rate spread 2.20 % 2.38 % Net interest margin 2.40 % 2.51 % Average interest-earning assets to average interest-bearing liabilities 1.16 X 1.08 X  Table of Contents  Comparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 and 2016  General. We recognized a net loss of $115,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 as compared to a net loss of $133,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The decrease in net loss was primarily attributed to an increase in net interest income of $62,000, or 11.0%, to $629,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from $567,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016, offset partially by an increase in noninterest expense of $50,000, or 6.8%, to $784,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $734,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016.  Interest Income. Interest income increased $52,000, or 5.9%, to $928,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from $876,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase in interest income reflects an increase in the average balances of interest-earning assets, which increased to $104.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from $90.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase in the average balances of interest-earning assets reflects our emphasis on investing in interest-earning assets the funds received from our conversion and public offering on June 29, 2016 and funds from increasing deposit levels since March 31, 2016. For the three months ended March 31, 2017 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016, the average balance of loans increased to $76.0 million from $73.2 million and the average balance of investments increased to $25.8 million from $11.4 million. The average balance of interest-bearing deposits decreased to $3.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 as compared to $5.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 as more of our excess funds were deployed into higher-yielding loans and investment securities. The increase in the average balance of our interest-earning assets offset the decrease in the average yield on interest-earning assets, which decreased 34 basis points to 3.54% from 3.88% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in yield on loans reflects the sustained lower interest rate environment in our highly competitive market area, particularly for commercial loans. The decrease of 6 basis points in yield on our investment securities reflects the impact of higher prepayments on our mortgage-backed securities, which had a negative impact on the investment portfolio's overall yield.  Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased by $10,000, or 3.2%, to $299,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from $309,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The decrease reflects a decrease in the average rate of our interest-bearing liabilities of 16 basis points to 1.34% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from 1.50% for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The decrease in our average cost of funds reflects the 2.23 basis point decrease in the cost of FHLB advances to 2.43% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from 4.66% for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The decrease in the average rate on FHLB advances was related to the maturity of $3.0 million of our advances and refinancing these maturing advances with advances with lower rates during the first quarter of 2016. Interest expense on FHLB advances decreased $33,000, or 46.5%, to $38,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from $71,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The decrease in the average cost of FHLB advances was offset partially by an increase in interest expense from our deposits, which increased $23,000, or 9.70%, to $261,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from $238,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase was primarily caused by an increase in the average balance of our deposits of $6.2 million, or 8.0%, to $83.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from $77.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 due to the growth in our deposits. Money market accounts grew in average balance by $4.4 million, or 49.4%, to $13.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from $8.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Certificates of deposit grew in average balance by $2.2 million, or 3.6%, to $62.8 million from $60.6 million for the same periods.  Net Interest Income. Net interest income increased $62,000, or 10.9%, to $629,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from $567,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016, which was largely a reflection of the increase in the ratio of average interest-earning assets to average interest-bearing liabilities to 1.16X for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from 1.08X for the three months ended March 31, 2016.  Provision for Loan Losses. There was no provision for loan losses for the three months ended March 31, 2017 or 2016, which is a reflection of our continued strong credit quality as evidenced by our continued low and decreasing levels of nonperforming loans.  Our total allowance for loans losses was 1.5% of total gross loans at March 31, 2017 as compared to 1.6% at December 31, 2016. We do not have an allowance for specifically identified impaired loans as we generally charge off identified impairments on impaired loans to the allowance for loan losses to a net realizable value on those loans. We do maintain an unallocated portion in our general allowance that we believe represents those probable incurred losses within our loan portfolio not specifically identified with any particular portfolio segment. We believe that with our increased emphasis on commercial lending as opposed to mortgage lending there are inherent credit risks that we have not yet quantified through historical experience.  Noninterest Income. Noninterest income increased $6,000, or 17.6%, to $40,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from $34,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase reflects both the recognition of $2,000 of income on bank owned life insurance related to the $3.4 million of bank owned life insurance purchased in March of 2017 and the increase of $5,000 in other noninterest income, which was due to higher loan related fees resulting from increased lending during the three months ended March 31, 2017 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016.  Table of Contents  Noninterest Expense. Noninterest expense increased $50,000, or 6.8%, to $784,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from $734,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase largely attributed to increases in salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment expenses, and professional and supervisory fees. Salary and employee benefits increased by $16,000, or 3.9%, to $428,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from $412,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase reflects normal pay increases for employees, additional expense associated with our ESOP, and the addition of our new chief financial officer and compliance officer. Occupancy and equipment expenses increased by $30,000, or 34.5%, to $117,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from $87,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase was primarily related to increased depreciation costs resulting from depreciation of renovation costs incurred for the renovation of our main office. Professional and supervisory fees increased by $10,000, or 12.0%, to $93,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from $83,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase in professional and supervisory fees was related to the increased costs associated with our conversion to a public company subsequent to the period ended March 31, 2016. These increases were partially offset by decreases in FDIC deposit insurance premiums and real estate owned expenses. FDIC deposit insurance premiums decreased by $13,000, or 62.0%, to $8,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from $21,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016, and real estate owned expenses decreased by $8,000, or 89.0%, to $1,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from $9,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. FDIC deposit insurance premiums decreased as a result of the reduction of insurance premiums by the FDIC.  Income Tax Expense. There was no provision for income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2017 or March 31, 2016. A valuation allowance has been recorded against all components of the net deferred tax asset, except for the unrealized loss on available for sale securities, based upon our cumulative operating losses in recent years.  The deferred tax asset will only be recognized in future periods upon the Company's ability to realize and maintain profitable results of operations.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Our primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows, loan repayments, FHLB advances, and repayments, maturities and calls of investment securities. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. Our Asset/Liability Committee is responsible for establishing and monitoring our liquidity targets and strategies in order to ensure that sufficient liquidity exists for meeting the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawals of our customers as well as unanticipated contingencies. We believe that we have enough sources of liquidity to satisfy our short- and long-term liquidity needs as of March 31, 2017.  We regularly monitor and adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of: (i) expected loan demand; (ii) expected deposit flows; (iii) yields available on interest-earning deposits and securities; and (iv) the objectives of our asset/liability management program. Excess liquid assets are invested generally in interest-earning and non interest-earning deposits and short- and medium-term securities.  Liquidity management is both a daily and long-term function of business management. If we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally, we have borrowing agreements with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago (FHLB) that provide an additional source of funds. Our FHLB advances totaled $9.0 million at March 31, 2017. In addition, the Company has an irrevocable standby letter of credit with the FHLB of $2.7 million at March 31, 2017 to secure public deposits. At March 31, 2017, we had the ability to borrow up to an additional $37.3 million from the FHLB, subject to pledging additional collateral. We also have an unused open line of credit at The Independent BankersBank that would allow us to borrow up to $2.5 million at March 31, 2017.  The Company is subject to various regulatory capital requirements, including a risk-based capital measure. The risk-based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk-weighted assets by assigning balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet items to broad risk categories. At March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company exceeded all regulatory capital requirements. The Company is considered "well capitalized" under regulatory guidelines.  The net proceeds from the stock offering significantly increased our liquidity and capital resources. Over time, the initial level of liquidity will be reduced as net proceeds from the stock offering are used for general corporate purposes, including the funding of new loans. Our results of operations will be enhanced by the net proceeds from the stock offering, resulting in increased net  Table of Contents  interest income. However, due to the increase in equity resulting from the net proceeds raised in the stock offering, our return on equity will be adversely affected.

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.
