Keith Busse, relaxed and assured in a brown leather chair in his


well-appointed Fort Wayne office, was several minutes into his earnest






explanation about the importance of education.
He had talked about how education had helped him rise from a childhood
of modest means, how it can help others and why his company and
foundation give millions of dollars to educational initiatives.
And then, suddenly, he paused, his face stiffened and tears pooled in
his eyes. When he resumed speaking, the voice was soft and halting.
“If I could give every deserving kid in this community an opportunity to
be educated, I’d do it,” he said, his voice trailing to a whisper. “I
believe that.”
He paused again, brushed at the tears on his cheeks, and fought for composure.
“I just know how hard I struggled,” he continued. “If I can make the
path clearer, better for others, then responsible people, I think, give
back. I love kids.”
This from a man who is at the helm of the nation’s fifth-largest
producer of carbon steel products — a company, he said, that could
generate as much as $6 billion in revenue this year and produce 5 1/2 to
6 million tons of steel. This from a man whose net worth, by his own
admission, is in the tens of millions of dollars and who owns homes in
Aboite Township, Lake Wawasee and Sarasota, Fla.
Give the 67-year-old founder, chairman and CEO of Steel Dynamics Inc.
any reasonable time to talk about his life and career, and education,
children and family will be recurring topics. But so, too, will be his
love for the art of a deal and his perpetual attraction to risks and
life’s edges, whether it’s driving a race car, flying a World War II
airplane or buying the fastest Jet Skis and snowmobiles on the market.
He is a complex, self-made maverick of great compassion, shrewd
leadership, uncommon daring and community influence. Such stature wasn’t
in his plan, he said. All he ever really wanted growing up in Fort
Wayne was to become an engineer — because he loved tinkering with things
— and raise a family. He never had a thought of running a large company
or acquiring significant wealth. In fact, the mere idea of affluence
was far from his reach as a child.
His story, told in measured, friendly and sometimes folksy tones, is, he said, a testament to hard work and perseverance.
His father, Earl, and mother, Roxie, pieced together jobs to keep Busse
and his younger sister, Marsha, fed, clothed and schooled. His father
was a firefighter who also took jobs pounding tent stakes for area fairs
and delivering flowers. His mother worked government jobs, including
helping register voters.
What they couldn’t give Busse in financial privilege they made up for in values that he tries to follow to this day.
“The value system they gave me was excellent,” he said. “It revolved
around honesty, integrity, work ethic — things of that nature.
“I was raised in a parochial grade school and, if nothing else, felt
that the Ten Commandments were value systems we should live by. None of
us do and we all break some commandments along the way. But I never
stole anything in my life. You either work hard to get it or you don’t
get it. And you don’t take advantage of people.
“I was always raised to treat people well, be polite and to respect
them. Respect was a big thing in my family. Honesty and integrity were
big things.”
Armed with those values and a dedication to his schoolwork, Busse
applied and was accepted to Purdue University in West Lafayette upon
graduating from North Side High School. He was rocket-ready to fulfill
his dream of becoming an engineer — until the matter of tuition came up.
“Mom and Pop said, ‘Son, where are you getting the money?’ I assumed
that since my friends were going off to college — IU and Purdue — that
I’d go off to college and the money would be taken care of somehow. I’d
have to work when I was down there. I understood that. But the system of
lending money to students — you know, student loans — didn’t exist back
then to my knowledge.”
He asked his godfather, Charles Diek, for advice and his godfather told
him: “Sometimes the path you mentally choose in your head isn’t the
trail you end up driving your cart down. I know you wanted to be an
engineer, but the money for that kind of education is not in place at
this point in time.”
Diek loaned Busse $750 and suggested Busse go to International Business
College to get a two-year degree in accounting. Busse complied and
helped pay for his schooling by pumping gas and unloading tires and
batteries at a Montgomery Ward service station.
After graduating, he took several accounting jobs, got married, began
raising a family and decided to go back to school to further his
education at then-Saint Francis College. He landed, through tireless
work, significant accounting and management jobs at Wayne Pump Co. and
later Dresser Industries while obtaining a bachelor’s degree in business
from Saint Francis and a master’s degree in business from Indiana
University-Purdue University Fort Wayne.
The marriage, meanwhile, was the first of two in Busse’s life, and Busse
is unusually forthright in his assessment of the demise of both. In
hindsight, he understands the dynamics that led to the divorces, and
even today harbors a regret or two.
But he has profound pride in the five now-grown children those marriages
brought — Dawn, Michael, Angela, Christopher and Aaron — and in a sixth
“semi-adopted” child, whose story underscores Busse’s passion for
giving young people opportunity.
He met Anastasia Grotov, then 16, on a business trip to Russia in the
early ’90s and, with the blessing of Anastasia’s father, fulfilled her
dream of visiting America. Anastasia spent several months living with
Busse’s family, eventually went on to graduate with a finance degree
from the University of California at Berkeley, and she and her
Russian-born physicist husband, Yuri, are now Steel Dynamics employees.
Busse’s dream — or rather the dream he never imagined as a child — was
still a ways off after he finished college and joined Charlotte,
N.C.-based Nucor in 1972 at the age of 29. But with the help of mentor
and Nucor legendary leader Ken Iverson, he steadily rose through the
ranks of the company, became vice president and set the course for
unthinkable success.
Busse tells stories of risk and innovation at Nucor, of helping keep his
division afloat during the recession of the early ’80s — sometimes with
a profit cushion of only a few hundred dollars — and of playing an
instrumental role in Nucor’s unveiling of a minimill later in the decade
that revolutionized steelmaking.
That minimill, constructed for $282 million in Crawfordsville and
employing advanced German technology, used electric arc furnaces instead
of blast furnaces, cast ribbons of steel 2 inches thick instead of
nearly a foot thick and in all phases was more efficient and less
expensive than the operations of “big boys” like U.S. Steel and
Bethlehem Steel.
Busse’s involvement with the technology made him and colleagues Mark
Millett and Richard Teets Jr. hot commodities, and all three were on the
verge of going their separate ways when, Busse said, he invited them to
a meeting and a beer at a Crawfordsville Holiday Inn.
“I postulated,” he said, “that instead of all of us going our separate
ways in life and leaving Nucor that we ought to think about doing this
(minimill technology) ourselves, because there’s no one else who knows
how to do it.
“’Right now, we’re pretty unique characters,’ I told them, ‘and we might
have a shot at going out and raising $400 million to create a brand new
steel company, which hadn’t been done in a hundred years.’
“Of course, they looked at me, laughed at me and thought I was nuts.”
But the three eventually worked up a business plan, raised $400 million
in financing and got started on SDI’s Butler plant in 1993. Of the $400
million, about $110,000 came from Busse, Millett and Teets.
There were a fair number of doubters that the three could pull it off,
Busse said, but today Steel Dynamics’ influence in the steelmaking
industry is unquestioned. Publicly held SDI has five steel mills
utilizing minimill technology — in Butler, Columbia City, Pittsboro,
Roanoke, Va., and Huntington, W.Va. — and four galvanizing facilities.
It purchased local metal recycler OmniSource Corp. in 2007 and operates
72 recycling centers around the country. SDI employs more than 5,900
people.
The risk, Busse said, paid off, like so many other risks he’s taken. He
once invested in a Fort Wayne gun shop, H&H Firearms, and helped
elevate the business’ profits. He recently became a shareholder in
Dealership Holdings LLC, the entity that oversees the string of Kelley
auto dealerships, and said restructuring has already boosted the
enterprise’s bottom line.
Even the mere act of steelmaking itself, he pointed out, carries risk.
“There’s something exciting about 3,000-degree hot metal that’s dangerous,” he said. “I mean, it’s like living on the edge.”
Then he quickly added: “In this business, you cannot afford to have an
accident because somebody loses their life. So our safety record is the
most important thing we focus on inside this company. Safety, safety,
safety, safety.”
One venture that didn’t pan out was a partnership in a Corvette Classics
Museum along Interstate 69 that never seemed to draw enough visitors.
Busse said he still has 44 of the Corvettes once housed in the museum.
But his overall record of success and penchant for always staying
active, always trying new things and caring about people — his
employees, his family and the community at large — has propelled Busse’s
name to prominence in recent years.
He serves on no fewer than seven boards of regional organizations and is
spearheading business advocacy through the recent formation of the
Regional Chamber of Northeast Indiana.
Since 2008, Busse’s name has also been attached to four
education-related facilities in northeast Indiana: the Keith Busse
School of Business and Entrepreneurial Leadership at the University of
Saint Francis, the Steel Dynamics Inc. Keith E. Busse Technology Center
at Ivy Tech Community College-Northeast, the Keith E. Busse/Steel
Dynamics Athletic and Recreation Center at Trine University and the
Keith Busse Steel Dynamics Alumni Center under construction at IPFW.
Steel Dynamics or its foundation donated hefty amounts to each project,
but Busse said he never asked that his name or his company’s name be
emblazoned front and center. That simply wouldn’t be in keeping with his
humble beginnings or his heart for giving others a shot at success.
“They don’t have to put my name on it,” he said, sipping coffee from a
plain Styrofoam cup. “It’s not what’s important. It’s not about ego for
me.
“If the people who receive the benefit of all this have done their
homework and they understand that I’m someone who has pulled himself up
by his bootstraps — I was not born with a silver spoon — I guess what’s
refreshing about being known to others is that it creates a can-do
spirit in them. It’s important that they understand that an education is
valuable and that it is a gift and that they can go out and do things
with that gift.
“I hope it’s an inspiration,” he said. “I know I would be inspired by
someone who went out and, in spite of all the odds being against him,
did something with his life.”

			Keith E. Busse is a co-founder of our Company, is the non-executive Chairman of the Board and has been a director since inception. Prior to his retirement on December 31, 2011, Mr. Busse had been our Chief Executive Officer since inception. Mr. Busse also, from 1993 until May 2007, was our President, at which time he became Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Prior to 1993, for a period of twenty-one years, Mr. Busse worked for Nucor Corporation in various capacities, including general manager of its Vulcraft subsidiary in St. Joe, Indiana. In 1986, Mr. Busse was appointed by Nucor to be the general manager of, and to head the construction and operation of, the world's first flat roll steel mini-mill utilizing thin-slab-casting steel technology at Crawfordsville, Indiana. Mr. Busse holds an undergraduate degree in accounting from International Business College, a degree in business finance from St. Francis College (now the University of St. Francis) and a master's degree in business administration from Indiana University. Mr. Busse was named Steelmaker of the Year in 2005 by the Association of Iron and Steel Technology and was named by Business Week Magazine as one of the Top 10 entrepreneurs in the United States. He serves as a director of Accuride Corporation, a public company and previously served as Chairman of the board of Tower Financial Corporation until the company was acquired by Old National Bancorp in 2014. Mr. Busse's ongoing contributions to the Board, as one of the most innovative and strategic minds in the steel business, and his leadership skills as both visionary and as motivator, are invaluable, even as the Company has matured and is poised for further growth.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/24/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.
