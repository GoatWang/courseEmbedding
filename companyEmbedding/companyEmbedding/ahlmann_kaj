Kaj Ahlmann, Retired Chairman, President and CEO of Employers Reinsurance, Joins SSA & Company Advisory Board | Business Wire
























































Kaj Ahlmann, Retired Chairman, President and CEO of Employers 
      Reinsurance, Joins SSA & Company Advisory Board






August 31, 2009 04:46 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today SSA 
      & Company, a global operations consulting firm, announced that 
      Kaj Ahlmann, retired chairman, president and CEO of Employers 
      Reinsurance (a division of General Electric), will be joining the 
      company’s Advisory Board.
    


      "As the CEO of a multi-billion dollar company, Kaj’s breadth of 
      experience and deep understanding and appreciation for process 
      improvement continues SSA & Company’s strong history of engaging the 
      counsel, advice and experience of Fortune 500 CEOs and board members to 
      innovate our services,” says Scott Miller, CEO of SSA & Company, and the 
      former CEO and Chairman of Hyatt Hotels. “His perspective on the broader 
      business world and his deep expertise in the insurance industry are a 
      tremendous addition to our team.”
    

      Mr. Ahlmann added to Mr. Miller’s remarks, saying, “I’m very excited 
      about working with SSA & Company. In today’s economy, companies need to 
      focus on process and operational effectiveness more than ever. This is 
      particularly true for companies in the financial services and insurance 
      industries. I believe SSA & Company is on the leading edge of process 
      improvement and has the innovative, customized approach CEOs demand.”
    

      After retiring from his CEO position at Employer’s Reinsurance, Mr. 
      Ahlmann began his own consulting business, offering advice to financial 
      services firms, including insurance companies. He currently serves as a 
      director for the Deutsche Bank Advisory Council, Cyrus Re, the American 
      Institute for Chartered Property Casualty Underwriters, RLI Corporation, 
      and is a past chair of the Reinsurance Association of America. He and 
      his family also own and operate the Six 
      Sigma Ranch, Vineyards and Winery in Lower Lake, California.
    

      SSA & Company has led innovation in the business process improvement 
      industry, in large part because of the company’s connection with CEOs, 
      both past and present. Its Strategic 
      Process Management (SPM) approach to business improvement delivers 
      results in 90 days and generates returns of five to ten times the size 
      of the initial investment. It is rapidly becoming a new standard for 
      process improvement, and is helping industries that have not 
      historically focused on process improvement, such as insurance, retail, 
      private equity and technology, uncover and solve major sources of waste.
    

      “We exist to help our clients deliver greater results by applying 
      innovative models like SPM,” says David Niles, President and COO of SSA 
      & Company. “And we are constantly identifying new places and ways to 
      apply those models. Adding Kaj to our team of advisors helps us continue 
      to build our understanding of what executives need and want, and gives 
      us a unique understanding of the challenges facing the insurance 
      industry.”
    

      SSA & Company’s Advisory Board includes an impressive group of 
      executives, including Ram Charan, a noted business consultant and 
      author, and Steve Kerr, the former Chief Learning Officer of Goldman 
      Sachs and GE, and now, Kaj Ahlmann. “We are very fortunate to have such 
      renowned and experienced executives involved with SSA & Company,” says 
      Miller. “There is no question that it gives both us and our clients 
      perspective and insight that no other consulting company can provide.”
    

ABOUT SSA & COMPANY


SSA 
      & Company, with its offices in the U.S., Europe, and Asia, helps 
      leading companies increase their margins, grow revenues and improve 
      working capital across multiple industry sectors, including financial 
      services, industrial manufacturing, retail/consumer products, 
      pharmaceuticals, healthcare, energy, technology, and communications. 
      Founded in 1994 by the progenitors of the Six Sigma revolution at 
      Motorola, the company developed the Six Sigma methodology, teaching 
      companies like GE, AlliedSignal, DuPont and AXA how to achieve a higher 
      level of quality, with substantially lower costs. Since then, SSA & 
      Company has helped hundreds of companies, both large and small, improve 
      how they operate, delivering billions of dollars of bottom-line benefits 
      through higher margins, revenue growth, and more efficient use of 
      capital. Today, the company continues to improve upon and evolve beyond 
      its Lean Six Sigma legacy, developing the approach into one of the most 
      widely used and regarded management systems - a way to transform 
      businesses using analysis, rigor, and individual empowerment.

Kaj Ahlmann’s Bio

Share!







Kaj Ahlmann joined Deutsche Bank as Global Head, Strategic Services and Chair, Advisory Board in 2009 after having provided independent services to the Council of Global Insurance Asset Management (GIAM), Deutsche Asset Management (DeAM), since 2006.
Mr. Ahlmann brings nearly 35 years of experience with various companies related to the reinsurance and insurance industries and asset management. From 2001 to 2003, Ahlmann was the Chairman and CEO of inreon, a global electronic reinsurance venture created by Munich Re, Swiss Re, Internet Capital Group and Accenture. He was Vice Chairman and Executive Officer of E. W. Blanch Holdings, Inc., a provider of integrated risk management and distribution services, from 1999 to 2001. Prior to that position, from 1993 to 1999, he was Chairman, President and CEO of Employers Reinsurance Corporation, a global reinsurance company and served as a Director of the parent organization, GE Capital Services. During this tenure, he was part of the team of officers who introduced the Six Sigma methods in GE Capital Services.
Kaj Ahlmann served on the board of Erie Indemnity Company, Erie Insurance Group from 2003 to 2008, and SCPIE Holdings, Inc., from 2006 to 2008, Cyrus Re from 2005 to 2010. He currently serves on the boards of the American Institute for CPCU (AICPCU), RLI Corporation and the Advisory Board of Six Sigma Academy.
In 2000, Kaj Ahlmann and his wife Else purchased a 4,300-acre ranch in Lake County, California and named it Six Sigma Ranch. They celebrated the release of the first wines under the Six Sigma® label in 2006.
Kaj Ahlmann applies the Six Sigma methods to regulate the grape growing and winemaking processes by monitoring and refining data at each stage. But the most important consideration is the voice of the customer. Data is constantly being gathered about consumer preferences and used for guidance in the winemaking process. According to Ahlmann, when people see the Six Sigma® name on the bottle, they know that the wine is truly a marriage of science and art.
Kaj Ahlmann received a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics in 1971, and a Master’s Degree in Mathematical Statistics & Probability and Actuarial Science in 1975 both at the University of Copenhagen.

Name
Kaj Ahlmann



Title
Owner, Six Sigma Ranch & Winery



Biography
Kaj Ahlmann joined Deutsche Bank as Global Head, Strategic Services and Chair, Advisory Board in 2009 after having provided independent services to the Council of Global Insurance Asset Management (GIAM), Deutsche Asset Management (DeAM), since 2006.
Mr. Ahlmann brings nearly 35 years of experience with various companies related to the reinsurance and insurance industries and asset management. From 2001 to 2003, Ahlmann was the Chairman and CEO of inreon, a global electronic reinsurance venture created by Munich Re, Swiss Re, Internet Capital Group and Accenture. He was Vice Chairman and Executive Officer of E. W. Blanch Holdings, Inc., a provider of integrated risk management and distribution services, from 1999 to 2001. Prior to that position, from 1993 to 1999, he was Chairman, President and CEO of Employers Reinsurance Corporation, a global reinsurance company and served as a Director of the parent organization, GE Capital Services. During this tenure, he was part of the team of officers who introduced the Six Sigma methods in GE Capital Services.
Kaj Ahlmann served on the board of Erie Indemnity Company, Erie Insurance Group from 2003 to 2008, and SCPIE Holdings, Inc., from 2006 to 2008, Cyrus Re from 2005 to 2010. He currently serves on the boards of the American Institute for CPCU (AICPCU), RLI Corporation and the Advisory Board of Six Sigma Academy.
In 2000, Kaj Ahlmann and his wife Else purchased a 4, 300-acre ranch in Lake County, California and named it Six Sigma Ranch. They celebrated the release of the first wines under the Six Sigma® label in 2006. (Visit the website at http://www.sixsigmaranch.com.)
Kaj Ahlmann applies the Six Sigma methods to regulate the grape growing and winemaking processes by monitoring and refining data at each stage. But the most important consideration is the voice of the customer. Data is constantly being gathered about consumer preferences and used for guidance in the winemaking process. According to Ahlmann, when people see the Six Sigma® name on the bottle, they know that the wine is truly a marriage of science and art.
Kaj Ahlmann received a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics in 1971, and a Master’s Degree in Mathematical Statistics & Probability and Actuarial Science in 1975 both at the University of Copenhagen.
