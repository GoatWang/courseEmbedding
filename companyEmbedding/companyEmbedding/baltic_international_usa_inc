Give Differently with Gifts of HopePowering the Future:
Gifts That Shine a Light of Hope

  GIVE 



One Gift Can Change a Life

Hope is powerful and life-affirming—It creates opportunities to thrive. When you give a Gift of Hope, you give girls access to education, help children receive urgent medical care, provide struggling families the means to grow food and earn a living, and so much more.
Are Gifts of Hope Real?
Your Gifts of Hope are actual items desperately needed by communities around the world. Your donation will be matched to a project that includes the item that you selected. If the need for a particular item is filled or Plan's fundraising goal for the project has been met, we will apply your donation to a similar project or where needed most. Project costs vary widely from country to country, continent to continent, for the same materials and services. The costs listed usually reflect an average cost. Donations to Plan International USA are tax-deductible to fullest extent allowed by law.
Let Them Know You’ve Given a Gift of Hope On Their Behalf!
When you give a Gift of Hope to a loved one, you can also send them an e-card when you've finished checking out!

My Name is Josue

				I am a 16 year old boy							

			Josue and family live in a community where most people generate income through fishing and farming activities.

Many are situated dangerously close to the main road. Water for drinking is obtained from nearby wells and hand pumps. Access to sanitary waste facilities is limited. Traditional medicines are typically used to cure illnesses. For emergency medical treatment, people must travel long distances to reach hospitals. Some homes have electricity but there are frequent brown-outs. Banking services are non-existent. Although your sponsored family works hard, it is difficult to make ends meet. Your sponsorship will make a difference in their lives.

Because I am a Girl
I have the right to
Learn, Lead, 
Decide, and Thrive


Join the Movement 





When given the chance, girls can change the world.
We know that when a girl realizes her rights, she can be an agent of change, both for herself and for her community and country.
Because I am a Girl is a movement driven by Plan International to transform power relations so girls everywhere can  learn, lead, decide, and thrive. 
 
























Give


Your gift to the Girl Fund will ensure that girls living in the developing world have access to the most basic human rights to learn, lead, decide, and thrive. 






Projects


Find out how our projects around the world are ensuring girls realize their rights, and discover how you can partner with us. 






Phase One Report


Because I am a Girl Phase One projects were designed in partnership with girls, families, communities, and institutions in nine countries to ensure marginalized girls have the opportunity to reach their full potential. This report outlines progress that has been made with your support. 






Our extensive research shows that girls continue to be the single most excluded group in the world. They face discrimination and abuse simply for being young and female. 
Girls are often denied their right to equal opportunity and engagement in society. Many are unable to attend school or make important decisions about their own futures and bodies, and they are far too often the victims of gender-based violence.
We believe that gender equality is central to achieving long-term change. We have a vision of a world that values girls, promotes their rights, and ends injustice.

OUR PRIORITIES:
LEARN
All girls have the right to quality, safe education and access to lifelong learning. An educated girl is more likely to marry later and have fewer, healthier children. She has a better chance of staying healthy herself.
LEAD
All girls and young women have the right to take part fully in the political life of their community and country. We’ll support and empower young female leaders to drive social, economic, and political change.
DECIDE
All girls have a right to decide if and when to marry or start a family. Ensuring girls are able to make decisions about their futures is fundamental to achieving gender equality.
THRIVE
Girls have a right to reach their full potential and achieve their personal ambitions. To do this, they must be able to live free from violence and discrimination and have equal economic opportunities.

                    TeamBaltic International USA, Inc.Our CompanyBaltic International USA, Inc. ("BIUSA") is a Texas corporation that has provided capital, management, and technical services to start-up and established private companies. In most instances, we are directly involved in management, and in all instances assists in allocation of capital either directly from us or through the investment of third parties. BIUSA has not taken significant profits or management fees from these investments. We currently plan to investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation. Our principal business objective will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate, short-term earnings. We will not restrict our potential candidate target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location and, thus, may acquire any type of business.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


(unaudited)



NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION



The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of
Baltic International USA, Inc. have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of
the Securities and Exchange Commission, and should be read in conjunction with
the financial statements and notes thereto contained in our Annual Report filed
with the SEC on Form 10-K.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments,
consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation
of financial position and the results of operations for the interim periods
presented have been reflected herein.  The results of operations for interim
periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the
full year.  Notes to the consolidated financial statements which would
substantially duplicate the disclosure contained in the consolidated financial
statements for fiscal 2016 as reported in the Form 10-K have been omitted.



NOTE 2 - FINANCIAL CONDITION



We have incurred operating losses since inception.  At March 31, 2017, we
had an accumulated deficit of $17,485,013 and current assets and current
liabilities of $2,979 and $3,576,744, respectively, resulting in a working
capital deficit of $3,573,765.  Net cash used in operating activities was $0 in
the three months ended March 31, 2017 and $0 in three months ended March 31,
2016.  We currently have limited cash resources available and have obligations
due or past due.


Management believes that we will be able to achieve a satisfactory level
of liquidity to meets its business plan and capital needs for the next twelve
months.  Additionally, management believes we have the ability to obtain
additional financing from key officers, directors and certain investors.
Management also believes that we can continue to defer certain amounts payable
by us that are either currently payable or past due.  However, there can be no
assurance we will be successful to meet its liquidity needs.  There is
substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.

NOTE 3 - LOSS PER COMMON SHARE



Stock warrants and options are considered to be dilutive for earnings per
share purposes if the average market price during the period exceeds the
exercise price and we had earnings for the period.  For the periods ended
March 31, 2017 and 2016, all stock warrants and options are considered
anti-dilutive.  Supplemental disclosures for loss per share are as follows:

Item 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS



The following discussions contain forward-looking information.  Readers
are cautioned that such information involves risks and uncertainties, including
those created by general market conditions, competition and the possibility of
events may occur which limit our ability to maintain or improve its operating
results or execute its primary growth strategy.  Although we believe that the
assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of
the assumptions could be inaccurate, and there can therefore be no assurance
that the forward-looking statements included herein will prove to be accurate.
The inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by
us or any other person that our objectives and plans will be achieved.



Current Plan of Operations



Our current business objective for the next 12 months is to investigate
and, if such investigation warrants, acquire a target company or business
seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation.  Our
principal business objective for the next 12 months and beyond will be to
achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business rather
than immediate, short-term earnings.  We will not restrict our potential
candidate target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical
location and, thus, may acquire any type of business.


We do not currently engage in any business activities that provide us with
positive cash flows.  As such, the costs of investigating and analyzing
business combinations for the next approximately 12 months and beyond will be
paid with our current cash on hand and through funds from financing to be
obtained.


During the next 12 months, we anticipate incurring costs related to filing
of Exchange Act reports and costs relating to consummating an acquisition.


We believe we will be able to meet these costs with our current cash on
hand and additional amounts, as necessary, to be loaned to or invested in us by
our stockholders or other investors.


We may consider a business which has recently commenced operations, is a
developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into new products
or markets, is seeking to develop a new product or service, or is an
established business which may be experiencing financial or operating
difficulties and is in need of additional capital.  In the alternative, a
business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company
which does not need substantial additional capital, but which desires to
establish a public trading market for its shares, while avoiding, among other
things, the time delays, significant expense, and loss of voting control which
may occur in a public offering.


Any target business that is selected may be a financially unstable company
or an entity in its early stages of development or growth, including entities
without established records of sales or earnings.  In that event, we will be
subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of
financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies.
In addition, we may effect a business combination with an entity in an industry
characterized by a high level of risk, and, although our management will
endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, there
can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant
risks.


8





We anticipate that the selection of a business combination will be complex
and extremely risky.  Because of general economic conditions, rapid
technological advances being made in some industries and shortages of available
capital, our management believes that there are numerous firms seeking even the
limited additional capital which we will have and/or the perceived benefits of
becoming a publicly traded corporation.  Such perceived benefits of becoming a
publicly traded corporation include, among other things, facilitating or
improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be obtained,
providing liquidity for the principals of and investors in a business, creating
a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key
employees, and offering greater flexibility in structuring acquisitions, joint
ventures and the like through the issuance of stock.  Potentially available
business combinations may occur in many different industries and at various
stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative
investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult
and complex.



Quality Resource Technologies



In October 2010, we acquired 10% ownership of Quality Resource
Technologies, Inc.  Quality Resource Technologies is to develop, manufacture
and sell innovative light-weight fiber reinforced shipping container and
storage units.  We had announced a spin-off of our interest in Quality Resource
Technologies, Inc. to our shareholders.  However, we cancelled the spin-off and
continue to own an interest in Quality Resource Technologies, Inc.



Liquidity and Capital Resources



We had $2,979 in cash at March 31, 2017, compared to $2,979 at
December 31, 2016.


At March 31, 2017, we had working capital deficit of $3,573,765 as
compared to $3,578,099 at December 31, 2016.  The increase in the working
capital deficit is due primarily to the accrual of additional liabilities.


Net cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended
March 31, 2017 was $0 as compared to $0 for the same period of 2016.


We have incurred operating losses since inception.  At March 31, 2017, we
had an accumulated deficit of $17,485,013 and current assets and current
liabilities of $2,979 and $3,576,744, respectively, resulting in a working
capital deficit of $3,573,765.  We currently have limited cash resources
available and have obligations due or past due.






Item 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK



There has been no material change in our market risks since the end of the
fiscal year 2016.


9









Item 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES



Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, after evaluating
the effectiveness of our "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the
end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, has concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide
reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports
that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and
Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure.


There were no significant changes in our internal control over financial
reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that materially affected, or
were reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting.



Limitations on the Effectiveness of Internal Control



Our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures
or our internal control over financial reporting will necessarily prevent all
fraud and material errors.  An internal control system, no matter how well
conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of the control system are met.  Further, the design of a
control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and
the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.  Because
of the inherent limitations on all internal control systems, no evaluation of
controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances
of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.  These inherent
limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be
faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.
Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some
persons, by collusion of two or more people, and/or by management's override of
the controls.  The design of any system of internal control is also based in
part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there
can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals
under all potential future conditions.  Over time, controls may become
inadequate because of changes in circumstances, and/or the degree of compliance
with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.  Because of the inherent
limitations in a cost-effective internal control system, financial reporting
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected on a timely
basis.

is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly
during the period in which this report is being prepared;


b.  designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused

reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal
control over financial reporting; and


5.  As the registrant's sole certifying officer, I have disclosed, based on my
most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the
registrant's auditors and the audit committee of registrant's board of

a.  all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial information; and


b.  any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
controls over financial reporting.

Give Differently with Gifts of HopePowering the Future:
Gifts That Shine a Light of Hope

  GIVE 



One Gift Can Change a Life

Hope is powerful and life-affirming—It creates opportunities to thrive. When you give a Gift of Hope, you give girls access to education, help children receive urgent medical care, provide struggling families the means to grow food and earn a living, and so much more.
Are Gifts of Hope Real?
Your Gifts of Hope are actual items desperately needed by communities around the world. Your donation will be matched to a project that includes the item that you selected. If the need for a particular item is filled or Plan's fundraising goal for the project has been met, we will apply your donation to a similar project or where needed most. Project costs vary widely from country to country, continent to continent, for the same materials and services. The costs listed usually reflect an average cost. Donations to Plan International USA are tax-deductible to fullest extent allowed by law.
Let Them Know You’ve Given a Gift of Hope On Their Behalf!
When you give a Gift of Hope to a loved one, you can also send them an e-card when you've finished checking out!
Didn't See Our Gifts of Hope Catalog in Your Mailbox?

My Name is Dennis

				I am a 16 year old boy							

			Dennis and family live in a rural community. Agriculture is the livelihood of most people. Rice, corn and coconuts are the major crops. A growing number of small-scale farmers have started to venture into livestock and poultry production to increase income. Those living along the coast engage in fishing as a source of income. Public transportation to the capital city and from village to village is available through habal-habal (motorcycles for hire), buses, or multi-cabs. During the rainy season, roads become impassable and people resort to horseback as an alternative. Medical facilities are limited. There are shortages of supplies, medical equipment and staff. Many rely on unprotected rivers and streams for water resulting in water-borne illnesses especially among children. Schools are in disrepair. More teaching materials, school supplies and textbooks are needed. The families are working hard to improve their lives. Your help is greatly appreciated.

HealthAccording to the family, Dennis has been healthy and not suffered from any serious illness.






My Name is Marcelino

				I am a 1 year old boy							

			Marcelino and the people of Nicaragua are friendly and eager to communicate. Homes are crowded as extended families live together, so there will be much activity to discuss. Your family earns their living as day laborers, working when opportunities are available. Civil war and natural disasters have damaged the country's infrastructure. Most poor families earn their living through subsistence farming. They cannot afford basic needs, and health care. The families are deeply motivated to improve their situation. Your help is greatly appreciated.

My Name is Kheraj

				I am a 1 year old boy							

			Kheraj and family live in an isolated rural community. Houses are made of mud and must often be repaired. People struggle to make a living from their plot of land and their few animals, but sometimes the rains do not come, or come too late, and it is hard to keep their animals healthy. Schools are overcrowded and poorly equipped. There are very few health centers available. Safe water resources and sanitary waste facilities are limited. The families are eager to improve their lives. Your help is greatly appreciated.

My Name is Roda

				I am a 2 year old girl							

			Roda and family live in a community in Malawi's northern region. Houses are made of thatched grass and mud. Agriculture is the livelihood of most of the population. People get water for their needs from wells Plan installed. Several schools exist but the classrooms need renovation. There are shortages of school supplies, teaching materials and desks and chairs. Accessing medical help is challenging for families. The most reliable hospitals are far and in most cases lack the essential drugs necessary for treatments. The families are working hard to improve their lives. Your help is greatly appreciated.

Phase One Report


Because I am a Girl Phase One projects were designed in partnership with girls, families, communities, and institutions in nine countries to ensure marginalized girls have the opportunity to reach their full potential. This report outlines progress that has been made with your support. 






Our extensive research shows that girls continue to be the single most excluded group in the world. They face discrimination and abuse simply for being young and female. 
Girls are often denied their right to equal opportunity and engagement in society. Many are unable to attend school or make important decisions about their own futures and bodies, and they are far too often the victims of gender-based violence.
We believe that gender equality is central to achieving long-term change. We have a vision of a world that values girls, promotes their rights, and ends injustice.

OUR PRIORITIES:
LEARN
All girls have the right to quality, safe education and access to lifelong learning. An educated girl is more likely to marry later and have fewer, healthier children. She has a better chance of staying healthy herself.
LEAD
All girls and young women have the right to take part fully in the political life of their community and country. We’ll support and empower young female leaders to drive social, economic, and political change.
DECIDE
All girls have a right to decide if and when to marry or start a family. Ensuring girls are able to make decisions about their futures is fundamental to achieving gender equality.
THRIVE
Girls have a right to reach their full potential and achieve their personal ambitions. To do this, they must be able to live free from violence and discrimination and have equal economic opportunities.
