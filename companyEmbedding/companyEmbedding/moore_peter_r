Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time.

                                            We wish Todd and his family all best. No one can control the markets and for 13 years he did an amazing job for us. These bloodthirsty lawyers will stop at nothing to tarnish his name for their own gain.

I moved while opening the credit card account so I did not receive statements on time (or maybe they did not send it to me). Called and got $17 back. As for the rest, I...show more

Amazon.com Store Card


                                            IF I COULD GIVE IT A ZERO I WOULD! Amazon/Synchrony Bank will cut your limit out of no where, even when making monthly payments. I've spent almost a year trying to pay off a card THEY maxed out and now they have sent to collections AS IM PAYING IT! DO NOT APPLY FOR THIS CARD!

                                            The one star is generous! I purchased car insurance and paid 450.00 for the policy and had to cancel 3 days later and only received a refund for $220!

Wow, Timothy, you have really done it this time. I have tried plenty of shakes in my time, and these are delicious. I purchased to two pack, my favorite is by far the vanilla, it goes so nicely with other fruit that I mix in with it. I just purchased another two and this will keep me busy for a while, again thanks Chef Tim.

Thank you for these lovely shakes Chef Tim, these are just so nice and the kids love them. It is so nice to have something that they actually think is a treat, but is great for them, a parents dream. I have followed you for years and love your mantra, would love to see more cooking videos though 🙂

I loved this book, I read it in a short period and can’t wait to try the recipes they appear to be fairly simple and explained well….

Izzyvia Amazon






I bought this book for my Type one diabetic sister and she loved it!!!!! No, she is not a vegan, but as a vegan myself I’m always looking for ways to introduce animal-free foods to my friends and family.

BMagsvia Amazon






Surprisingly the recipes are good

Patriciavia Amazon






Though I don’t suffer from diabetes, I still try to stay informed about reversing or slowing down this disease. I know many people that do suffer from this disease and you can bet that this will be a recommended resource! It was very informative and eye-opening. I didn’t know that nuts were a no-no if you suffer from this diabetes. Good job!!

Kevin Hornevia Amazon






Wonderful book!!!! Checked out a friends and now I am ordering my own!!! It’s a have to have it book I will get his other one as well later on.

Johnvia Amazon

Dudley Moore (April 19, 1935 – March 27, 2002) and David Cassidy (born April 12, 1950), original 11 x 14 glossy photograph by celebrity photographer Peter Warrack. Vintage photograph from the original negative. Printed by Warrack as part of his personal archive. Previously unpublished.
In his early 20's, Peter Warrack lived in London, Rome, and Athens working for entertainment magazines and writing articles about events that he attended, like the Cannes Film Festival. It was during this period of time that his interest in photography began to develop. Over the years, Peter began to amass a very extensive collection of photographs of people he met. He attended many events and met many famed individuals of the time. He always took the time to research people before meeting them and was able to talk with them about their careers, their travels and even their families. This impressed them and they felt comfortable in his company; many became personal friends over the years. Their comfort level always translated into the way he captured the personality of those individuals, as he would engage them in easy, friendly conversation while taking candid photos. Until now his personal collection and archive has been completely unpublished.
Verso bears official "Peter Warrack Archive" credit label, else blank and clean. In very good condition.
Provenance: From the Peter Warrack Estate.

Satisfaction 100% Guaranteed
