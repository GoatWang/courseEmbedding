Item Description: Holy Cow Press, United States, 2007. Paperback. Book Condition: New. Language: English . Brand New Book. While Ann Iverson makes direct references to contemporary political events, she mutes their potential polarizing effect by considering them within a non-politicized context: her life. Consequently, no matter one s position on our nation s response to September 11, to the war on terror, or the president, one can appreciate these poems. --Rachel Lintula Ann Iverson s second collection of poetry conveys the emotional journey of a son s first and second deployment to Baghdad, as well as the spiritual and physical adjustment to a move from the inner city to a country-like suburb. In spare, distinctive imagery, Iverson ponders the personal, familial, and social transitions brought about by life change. She thoughtfully considers the tension within relationships that change often engenders and by doing so, personalizes a national tragedy and the subsequent war in Iraq. In Even Though she juxtaposes the surreal war and its reality with her common life experience: I cleared my throat and raised my voice, / though the city did not respond. / And the soldiers stay away too long, / for years and years and years / Even though we call to them. / Even though they hear. Ann Iverson received her MALS and MFA from Hamline University in Minnesota. Her writing has been featured on The Writer s Almanac with Garrison Keillor and has appeared in The Oklahoma Review and MARGIE: The American Journal of Poetry. Her first collection, Come Now to the Window, was published by the Laurel Poetry Collective. She currently is the director of arts and sciences at Dunwoody College of Technology in Minneapolis. She and her husband live in East Bethel, Minnesota.  Bookseller Inventory # AAC9780977945849

A quote by Louis Comfort Tiffany in the book "It is my dearest wish to help young artists of our country to appreciate more the study of nature, and to assist them in establishing themselves in the art world." From the book, "It was this purpose that in 1918 led Louis Comfort Tiffany to establish a foundation to operate Laurelton Hall - his estate at Cold Spring Harbor, Long Island - as a summer retreat for young artists and craftspeople.Today, the Tiffany Foundation makes biennial monetary awards in painting, sculpture, printmaking, photography, video, and craft media - thus continuing the approach of direct grants to artists originally adopted by the trustees in 1946." A great book in very good condition - a wonderful addition to any collection. Additional digital images available upon request.  Bookseller Inventory # 000607

An Icon at 40: The Untold Story of Allen Iverson | Bleacher Report Bleacher Report LogoSearch IconSign UpLoginFacebook LogoTwitter LogoCopy Link IconNBAAn Icon at 40: The Untold Story of Allen IversonChris PalmerSenior WriterMay 28, 2015 CommentsComment Bubble IconGetty imagesPROLOGUE IOn this moonless night, lightning bugs flashed brilliantly in the yards along Jordan Drive. Moths fluttered around the hopelessly dim porch lights. The air was warm and muggy. Darkness covered the neighborhood's working-class splendor. There wasn't a single siren to disturb the calm. It was absolutely beautiful.This was the night their boyhood would end. Each would tell himself quietly not to cry.Allen Iverson and crew tried to play cards like it was a normal night. Bubba Chuck, as he's known, had taught them to play tonk. He gave them what little money he had then would win it right back. He was the most upbeat. He made jokes to put others at ease. This is what Chuck did. Still, it was his life that would change when the sun came up.Allen Iverson was going to jail tomorrow.They sat around unsure of what to say. They fired up the Sega thinking Tecmo Bowl would provide the much-needed distraction. They put down the controllers within minutes. The Five Heartbeats came on TV. They watched in silence.It was all too much. They were confused. How did it get to this point? They were scared. Chuck was scared, which scared them most of all. Because he was never scared.Just after midnight, Iverson lay on his bed—his Air Force 1s still on—in his small room in the little blue house at 106 Jordan Drive. There were Michael Jackson posters on his wall. Iverson's lightness of being filled the room. Then suddenly, he was a bolt of lightning. A convoluted mash-up of swagger, naivete and confusion.He practiced the speech he would give the judge after receiving his slap on the wrist. A burst of confidence followed.He was still Chuck.He was still going to Notre Dame. Touchdown Jesus would wait with open arms. An ankle bracelet wouldn't be that bad. His jeans would cover it when he went to the mall. Tawanna would still love him tomorrow. She would kiss him when he got out of court. He would come see her at work. They could go to Hardee's.A slap on the wrist.He had no idea how wrong he was. Well, maybe some. "That judge," he said lying back on his bed, "That white motherf----r got some power."Getty imagesPROLOGUE IIThe Bentley barreled down Schuylkill Expressway. Despite Philly's vexing bumper-to-bumper rush-hour traffic, they were making good time.Gary Moore, Iverson's longtime manager, piloted the $200,000 coupe down the shoulder of the annoyingly packed thoroughfare. When they were running late, the shoulder became their personal HOV lane. Moore was quite adept at dodging the many dangers of the road: orange construction barrels, potholes, rocks and debris from fender benders. He knew the shortcuts, speed traps and the traffic lights that seemed to take forever.They were in what Moore called "the danger zone," which meant they had left Iverson's house at 5:30 or later. He had to be at the arena at 6. He lived 45 minutes away on a good day.It could actually be dangerous getting Iverson to games on time. Other motorists were always pulling onto the shoulder. No one ever seemed to check the rearview before they did so. The threat of traffic tickets was constant. Moore, or whoever drove Allen, faced unrelenting constant pressure. Despite Moore's best laid plans, there was never enough time.Time was as precious a luxury as there could be in the world surrounding the league's most polarizing player. Iverson was utterly unfazed by the daily emptying of the hourglass. He actually preferred it."If we weren't rushing late," Iverson liked to say, "it just wouldn't feel right."Iverson seemed to be comfortable in a constant state of semi-controlled chaos and ever-percolating melodrama. It either focused or pleasantly distracted him. No one really knew.In the front seat next to Moore, he casually talked on his cell phone and dealt with the annoyances that came along with being one of the most famous basketball players in the world—requests for tickets, money and time. Family squabbles, trade rumors, bad press. Sometimes, it was his wife, Tawanna, whom he had kissed goodbye not 20 minutes before.On this day, Mo—as Iverson called Moore—couldn't work his magic and proved less than equal to Philly's unforgiving traffic snarls. Iverson arrived at the arena 10 minutes before tipoff. Sixers coach Larry Brown was furious. He had been looking for a reason to trade him, spent many hours in Sixers general manager Billy King's office complaining about Iverson. Brown said Iverson never listened to him. Allen hated that. He insisted he heard every word. He would definitely hear what Brown said next. He walked up to Allen and spoke in a low, controlled tone. He told Iverson that this was the last straw. "Either you go, or I go."Getty ImagesPROLOGUE IIIHe owned hotels on Park Place, Boardwalk and even Marvin Gardens—not to mention a controlling interest in the Electric Company. Those little red plastic buildings in the high rent district meant he was firmly in control.The team was staying in Charlottesville that night. Hours earlier, Bethel High had captured the 1993 Virginia state boys basketball championship behind Iverson's verve and moxie. That was a distant memory. Now, his teammates had gathered in his hotel room to engage in one of his lifelong passions: Monopoly.His trial was still four months away, but you couldn't tell as he moved his game piece—the vintage boot—and wagged a wad full of gold-colored $500 bills. He was ruthless and cunning. He talked trash and dared people to land on his property. He smiled as he cut side deals with other players to eliminate threats to his budding empire. The game was in its second hour when the phenom tucked his stash in his pocket."Hold up," Iverson said. "I gotta go do something."The best basketball player in the state got up and left the room. He propped the door open with the latch and walked barefoot down the carpeted hallway. He stopped at the last door and knocked."Allen, what's up?" asked his high school coach, Michael Bailey, after answering the door. "Is everything all right?"The coach had a number of family members in town. After chatting with Bailey's relatives for several minutes, he walked Iverson to the door. The coach and the player hugged. He noticed the play money in his pocket."You sure you're OK?" asked Bailey."I just wanted to make sure I talked to you before you went to bed," he answered.A random act of Iverson.Bailey would experience a dozen of them in the years to come. It would take him the better part of a decade to figure out they weren't random at all. Last summer, Iverson picked up the phone and called Bailey."Allen, is everything all right?" the coach would ask instinctively. "Everything is fine, Coach," Iverson replied. "I just wanted to hear your voice."Getty ImagesIt's been said that life is just a series of snapshots, glimpses of things that have been. Tiny, personal moments that begin to reveal the measure of a man. Whether he was sublime or insignificant is of no consequence.Iverson's story is an oft-told one. But that well-worn, dog-eared narrative—one to which we clung so desperately—was always slightly out of focus. To the informed, it lacked context.Too many snapshots missing. The blank spaces replaced instead by assumption, disregard and resentment toward the thing we couldn't figure out.His transcendent talent was always the lure. But his complexity, his truth led us to real emotional paydirt. He was an otherworldly athlete we could connect with.He defined toughness yet was easily wounded. His pain was equal parts burden and badge of honor. It calloused to become an impenetrable shell. He used it to survive.We fetishized his authenticity while giving him complete control over its application. Then we had the audacity to find fault with the finished product.Expressing himself was often a clumsy, anxious proposition. He would rant. He would cry. He would brood. A plume of emotion left across the sky. This was the same beautifully flawed boy who sparked a revolution without intention.At his best, he burned charm. When he did, he was irresistible. We wanted more. He doled it out in small portions because it was never really for us. We watched with envious eyes as he stuck his finger in the face of conformity while never realizing the personal cost of his defiance."I was the first one do all that stuff, and I took an ass-whooping for it," says Iverson. "Tattoos, cornrows, headbands, hip-hop. I never meant to start any trends. I got my butt kicked, but if that meant that the guys who came after me could be themselves, then it was worth it."Allen Iverson didn't just defy conventions. He reinvented them. He gave birth to a generation who gave him love where none had existed before.Getty Images"I didn't want to be Michael or Magic," says LeBron James. "I wanted to be Allen Iverson.""He changed everything," Carmelo Anthony says. "An entire generation owes him."Chris Paul calls him simply the most influential player of all time.He wasn't perfect. An icon in wolf's clothing. But there was so much of Allen Iverson in us—that was both scary and comforting.He flew the flag of the underdog and planted it firmly where it made you the most uncomfortable. You don't have enough snapshots to understand.He was woefully misunderstood. Our fault, not his. But it was the very thing that forged his resolve. Like fire on steel. He kept us at arm's length. He didn't need us. Yet still he was ours. And that we quietly loved above all things.Allen Iverson on the night the Sixers retired his No. 3 jersey.Matt Slocum/Associated Press/Associated PressChapter One: A Counterculture Icon at 40He sits at a large table in a boardroom on the 16th floor of Showtime's New York offices. In front of him is a small paper plate piled high with spicy Buffalo wings next to a bottle of Texas Pete hot sauce. The discarded bones are neatly lined up on the edge of the plate."What up, Chris?" Iverson says enthusiastically in that familiar rasp. "What we doing today?"He's wearing a white T-shirt with gold zippers, several gold chains, baggy blue jeans and white-on-white Air Force 1s fresh out of the box. His braids are covered by a white do-rag and a backward Yankees fitted. There's a gold diamond-studded Rolex on his right wrist.In other words, it's Allen Iverson.His cheeks are a little fuller, and damn if he ain't an inch shorter from when you last met, but it's him. His familiar expressive, round eyes that for so long broadcast his pain to the world are particularly bright.In a rare, lengthy, wide-ranging interview, Iverson displays a myriad of emotions while bouncing from subject to subject, crashing into questions with both abandon and care. He is warm, funny and talkative. He doesn't miss an opportunity to land a comedic jab at his interviewer. He's got a holster full of zingers and revels in a direct hit.Iverson says he has rededicated himself to his family and worked hard to manage the vices that have caused so much turmoil in his life. He divorced in 2013 but says his primary focus is rebuilding his relationship with his partner of 25 years."We've had ups, downs, good times, bad times, been divorced, apart, together, everything," he says of Tawanna, his high school sweetheart, ex-wife and mother of his five children. "We're going to be together forever. That's the way it's gonna be."He lives quietly outside of Miami. The dewy, sweet air agrees with him. As do the warm breezes off the ocean that gently rattle the neighborhood palms that line his green, bucolic suburb. On a typical day, Iverson gets up at about seven—six if his human alarm clock children wake him up. He helps get the kids ready for school. Tawanna brushes their hair. He fixes breakfast. Their homework is usually packed the night before. He drops them off at school most days then runs an errand or two. Back at home, he'll check emails or return phone calls.He likes to be outside to stave off claustrophobia. He needs to keep moving. He looks for things to keep him busy."You need me to go to the store? You need me to make a run?" he'll ask Tawanna.He goes to his kids' gymnastic competitions, basketball games and school functions. Holiday-themed plays and the year-end talent shows are his favorite.Iverson says he's a regular dad now.Nathaniel S. Butler/Getty Images"I'm just a regular 24/7 dad now," he says. "I'm doing the things that I never paid attention to. They never had a full-time father, but they do now. I'm here for those things now. Being older, I can't imagine a parent not wanting to be in their kid's life. I will just never understand it. To me, it's priceless."On a typical lazy afternoon, he'll jump on the computer. Google a few things. Maybe a vacation spot. Sometimes, he'll search YouTube for hours looking for funny videos.One of his daily goals is to laugh. "That's why I hang around idiots," he jokes. His friend Kian Pennington, sitting next to him in the boardroom, misses the joke and looks dazed. "See? I surround myself with people who make me laugh."He drives more now than at any period in his life. If he needs toothpaste or paper towels, he goes to the store to get it. If his car needs gas, he pumps it. He loves broccoli. Still listens to Brandy. He checks the mailbox. He's a big fan of Ronda Rousey."Could you beat her in the Octagon?" I ask."Hell no!" he says. "And I ain't trying to find out."In the afternoon, he picks the kids up from school and gets them ready for dinner. In the evening, he and Tawanna will watch a movie or two before going to sleep."I live such a normal life," he says. "I absolutely love it."Until the bowling alley incident—a brawl that eventually led to Iverson, a 17-year-old, being convicted as an adult of maiming by mob—turned his life upside down, he says he would have gone to Notre Dame to play quarterback, return kicks and win the Heisman Trophy. He would have done what Lou Holtz asked and showed them he was faster than Raghib "Rocket" Ismail. "I loved those gold helmets," Iverson says longingly. Then it would be on to the NFL, hopefully the Cowboys.Iverson has given up defending himself from critics and responding to every rumor the Internet can churn out. He hears what people say about him on social media and goes out of his way to avoid stories about himself. He doesn't care if you think he's broke ("Far from it," he says), in a custody battle or addicted to one vice or another."I used to be like, 'Nothing bothers me,'" he says. "But that's not true. When I read something negative, it hurts. Look, I'm a human being...I'm a real person. I'm human, man. My feelings can be hurt, too. I'm tired of being hurt."His voice steadies. He locks in. He wants you to know this."I'm not sitting on the Internet looking for good stories about me. I can't be happy with the good ones if I'm going to be upset with the bad ones. Oh, they wrote a good story about me? Well, isn't that great. But OK, then what about the f----d-up one they just wrote? You can't win, so I just block everything out."He downshifts.There's a new rumor circulating that he's managing hip-hop acts. "That's news to me," he says. "If I am, I missed all the meetings and never got the checks." Getty ImagesChapter Two: A.I. In RetirementIverson can't remember the last time he played basketball, save for shooting around with his 11-year-old son Isaiah in the driveway."I didn't want to retire," he says. "I miss the game, but I'm happy where I am. I don't miss everything that comes with basketball, though. I have days where I don't even think about basketball."Still, he likes to talk ball. He's been plugged into the playoffs. "What the hell happened to the Clippers last night?" he says to no one in particular.He watches League Pass almost nightly. His favorite player is Russell Westbrook. "He's a certified killer," Iverson says. "Certified! He reminds me a lot of me."On Steph Curry: "How good is this dude where you can't decide what's better, his handle or his jump shot? He's a bad boy. He's official! But his release ain't quicker than Dell's. I know—I had to guard him."He wants to see Melo get a ring. Says Kyrie has a better handle than he had. Loves Monta. Isaiah Thomas, too. Jamal Crawford is "just crazy." Pulls for D-Rose. Roots harder for players who haven't won it all. Says he'll never become an analyst because he hates criticizing players. In 14 seasons, the player he had the most trouble guarding was Steve Nash. "I couldn't believe how good he was," he says, shaking his head. Little-known Marcus Banks was the toughest defender he ever faced.Where is his draft-day suit? "Probably balled up in my son's closet," he says.He learned his transcendent crossover from a Georgetown walk-on from New York named Dean Berry. "He was killing me every day in practice, so I finally asked him to show me how to do the move," Iverson remembers. Dean, who arguably changed the game of basketball by proxy, was so little-used, he didn't even have his name on the back of his jersey.Iverson considers his most memorable game to be the 60 he dropped on the Magic in 2005."Who was guarding you?" I ask."Nobody."I ask him if he could still dunk, and he just laughs. "Man, I don't want to think about that," he says. "I'll mess around and kill myself. I don't wanna break my neck."Remember the follow jam off the missed free throw in Seattle?"Young legs, man. I'm old now. Too old."What about today's NBA fashion?"No comment," he says. "If I say what I really want, there's a lot of people who are going to be pissed off."Would you ever wear skinny jeans?"What the hell would I look like wearing some skinny jeans?" he says. "Skinny as I am? I might disappear."Your all-time Big Three?"Wow," he says dreamily. "Me, Mike and Shaq." He looks at me. "We'd go 82-0 even with you in the backcourt."The crowd of Showtime execs and important types who have quietly crept into the room to catch a glimpse of Iverson has swelled to nearly 30. They roar. Hang on his every word."Listen," I shoot back, "I'd be wide open every play.""I'm just bulls------g you," Iverson says with a huge smile and a devilish cackle. He extends a long-ass arm to dap. "My bad, my bad."In 2002, he came within minutes of being traded. He met with Billy King and Larry Brown in a particularly tense meeting in King's office. If the meeting didn't go well, he was gone."They would have pulled the trigger," says Iverson. "I knew it."He didn't want to leave Philly. His anxiety was made worse when his kids would come home from school with messages from their friends asking Iverson not to leave the Sixers.In the end, he would agree that he could work with Brown. Iverson asked to be a captain and promised to set a good example. Iverson says afterward, still stressed from the meeting and mourning the recent death of his best friend Rahsaan Langford, he got in his car and drove straight to the arena for what would become the infamous "Practice" press conference."I was supposed to announce to the city that I was here to stay," he says, "but then they started talking about practice."Outside of not winning an NBA championship, his biggest disappointment is being left off the 2008 Olympic team. He met with USA Basketball director Jerry Colangelo and felt confident he was in the mix. Months later, Colangelo sent Iverson a two-paragraph letter saying he wouldn't be invited to participate."That one really stung," says Iverson. He pauses for several seconds. "That hurt. I still think about it to this day. I wanted it so bad. I wanted another shot. It was my chance to make it all right. I was all in. Me and Tim Duncan talked about it a lot. It was our dream to come back in four years and win gold."Today, the 40-year-old stay-at-home dad has a new dream."I want to become a professional fisherman," says Iverson with absolute sincerity. "I want to get good enough to compete with the best in the world and be on ESPN. I'm good right now, but I could be the best. That's my dream right now. I'm really going to make it happen."As a kid, he stood on the rocks on the shores of Newport News and tried to hook blue catfish in the James River—which poured into Chesapeake Bay—with a makeshift rod.Iverson can spend hours at Bass Pro Shops picking out the best equipment. He owns half a dozen rods and has expert knowledge of hooks, lures and everything else that goes in a tackle box. He knows the best bait for different types of fish. His main catch are blue fish, stripers and flounders. He once spent a half-hour wrestling a wily marlin on the high seas that weighed half as much as him. "That thing tasted good, though," he says. "We were eating fish for breakfast, lunch and dinner."They're gonna need to give me a fishing reality show," says Iverson. He's smiling wide. Nodding his head slightly. "Just watch me."Chapter Three: "I Love This Girl"He put out word to the kids in the neighborhood that he was looking for Bubba Chuck. Problem was no one had seen him. But that wasn't unusual. He was known to disappear. Sometimes, you'd have to try a half-dozen places before the kid would turn up. They had been teammates in youth football, but for the past week, he was a ghost. Michael Jackson, despite being 12 years old, had developed a reputation as something of a capable barber around the neighborhood though opinions of his work varied.One day, Chuck asked him to borrow the very clippers Jackson used to make a name for himself. So he loaned his 11-year-old friend, Allen Iverson, his beloved shears. He expected them back the next day. Jackson had taken them from his father's cabinet without asking, and there would be consequences. A week passed. Then a few more days.Soon, Jackson knew he would never see those clippers again. He lived a 10-minute walk from Chuck's house on Jordan Drive but still couldn't track him down. Jackson never quite knew when he was staying there. Sometimes, his mom, Ann, would answer the door.One day, he saw the kid sauntering down the street."Hey, Chuck!" said Jackson. "I need my clippers back."The kid was as quick on his feet as he was on a naked bootleg, so Jackson was ready for any possible excuse."My grandmother's house burned down," said Chuck without hesitation. "The clippers were inside."Jackson bought it.He knew he would have to answer to his father, but it hardly mattered. He liked Chuck. They had bumped heads. Competed like mad. Argued over this. Fussed over that. They ran sprints together on the field behind Aberdeen Elementary. Chuck was fast. Jackson was faster. They were complete opposites. One wore do-rags and liked to rap. The other wore dress slacks and was in student council. They were born to hate each other.Chuck loved him from the start.Close friends for decades: Michael Jackson (No. 45) and Iverson (No. 10)Courtesy of Michael JacksonTheir world opened up in the 10th grade when they turned 16 and Jackson's father gave him a 1981 Toyota Tercel with no AC that he spray-painted black. They dubbed it the Jack Mobile."That thing was a piece of s--t," says Iverson, "but we went everywhere in it. We loved that car. It was the greatest. It created so many memories for us."Jackson would pick Iverson up before school, and they would sing Boyz II Men or Jodeci the whole ride, hoping the tape wouldn't pop. They drove it to practice, to pick up food, to the Coliseum Mall to buy sneakers.One afternoon, Iverson stopped by Jackson's to tell him about a girl he met at a party. He got the number. She didn't know who he was. He called right away. He was so excited. He went on and on. Man, she was so pretty. Her hair was pretty. Her skin was pretty. Her eyes were pretty. I never met a girl like this. She wasn't acting like other girls. She was just sitting there. Not acting pressed or nothing. She was different, man—just different.Tawanna Turner was a grade above Allen. She went to Kecoughtan High across town and was quiet, smart and didn't take lip from anyone. She was far from impressed with the skinny boy with the raspy voice and clever words. But he was willing to work.She was a sales clerk at Deejay's, a trendy clothing store in the Coliseum Mall. Every boy wanted to date a girl who worked there because the prettiest girls in the city worked there. One's social standing would soar with the simple act of securing a phone number. Boys were known to go to the store and try on three or four outfits as a ruse to get to know one of the sales girls. They seemed to always have boyfriends, though.Tawanna lived on the other side of town in a nice neighborhood, and Iverson would often sneak into her house long after her parents fell asleep to be with her. He would call Jackson to come pick him up at all hours of the night. He'd head down Mercury Boulevard and make that left on Fox Hill Road. He knew the trip front to back."I used to get him in so much trouble," remembers Iverson.One time after being scooped up around three in the morning, Iverson sat in the passenger seat of the Jack Mobile and was strangely quiet. Jackson knew he wanted to say something."I really like this girl," Iverson finally said. "She's just...""That's cool," replied Jackson. "You guys are great together.""I think I love her," Iverson continued. "For real."It wasn't unusual for Iverson to be attached to whomever he was dating, but Jackson had never heard Iverson say he loved a girl before and was slightly taken aback."That's great, Chuck.""Man, you not hearing me," Iverson implored. "I love this girl." Gary Moore was Iverson's childhood mentor and occasional guardian, later his manager and closest advisor.Courtesy of Gary MooreChapter Four: The Man Behind the StarGary Moore sits in the upstairs game room of the four-bedroom, comfortably appointed home he shares with his wife Phyllis on a lush golf course in Suffolk, Virginia. There's a red velvet pool table, several pictures of him with Iverson and a signed and framed DeSean Jackson jersey. The basketball from the 2001 All-Star Game, in which Iverson won MVP, sits in a glass case.As his manager, he has driven him to over 1,000 games, practices and appearances. He became one of the NBA's most visible, no-nonsense gatekeepers. It was Moore's decision to hire personal security when he thought Iverson's nightlife was getting out of hand. He's been present for nearly every milestone in Iverson's career."God sent me to him all those years ago," he likes to say. "He was the son I never had.""Without Mo, I would have never made it," says Iverson. "You would have never heard of me."When Iverson turned pro, Moore kept his job as a purchasing agent at Hampton University. Iverson would call every day. Sometimes three or four times a day. Life was off without Moore. He never knew how much money he had. He didn't know how his Reebok deal worked. His first agent, David Falk, never told him anything. He would pay whatever a dealer asked for a car. Iverson hated to haggle.Moore, 59, was frustrated with Iverson's carelessness with money. Iverson asked him to leave Hampton and come to Philly. Moore says he told Iverson he would oblige, but only if they did it legit. He drew up a contract, which outlined his duties and paid him a modest salary that both he and Iverson signed.Iverson trusted him above all others.After all, Moore had helped design Iverson's deferred payment Reebok deal, which included a $32 million payout when he turned 55."Because I didn't want him to retire broke," he says.Iverson and Moore.Courtesy of Gary MooreMoore played high school football and baseball in Newport News and was good enough that he had hopes of going pro. But chronic knee pain put an end to his diamond dreams, and he settled in nearby Aberdeen and began coaching youth league football.He had known Ann Iverson as a teenager from the neighborhood, but they ran with different crowds. In his late 20s, he got a job as a forklift operator at an Avon cosmetics distribution plant where Ann worked in the packaging department. When she found out Moore coached football, she asked if he could find Allen and persuade him to join.When Moore first saw Iverson, he was playing two-hand touch on a ratty patch of grass in the notorious Stuart Gardens projects in Newport News. The eight-year-old skated past desperate kids aiming to tag him. He called plays. He kept score. He even coached opposing players.Sometimes, he would reverse field just to make it more challenging. His toothpick arm could fling the ball 40 yards through the summer air."Even as kids, we could tell he was different," says Jackson. "Anyone who says otherwise is lying."Iverson would play five seasons under Moore up until the time he enrolled in Hampton's Bethel High. When his home life would unravel, which it often did, he would stay with Moore. He had his own room in the three-bedroom rancher Moore bought in Hampton. On Christmases, he put cleats and wristbands under the tree. A facemask Iverson would use on varsity was his favorite present.Moore taught Iverson to tie a tie and would eventually buy him suits for the significant moments in his life: his sentencing, his announcement to go pro, the day he was drafted.Moore would drive him to school and pick him up from practice. That was the easiest way to watch him. Then Allen would disappear. He always did."When he wasn't right in front of me, I was always concerned," says Moore. "Never worried—I put my worries on God—but definitely concerned."The streets were one thing, but what Moore really feared was the pervasive racial tension that seemed to hover over Hampton like a toxic fog. As a teenager, Moore's father told him never to go to the bowling alley. "There was just so much racist activity there," says Moore. "I never set foot in that place."Black boys were told by their elders not to venture into Poquoson (the pejoratively termed "redneck part of town") by themselves. The N-word would drop like Molotovs from moving cars. Once you crossed Pine Chapel Road and went over the bridge, you were in unwelcome territory.But invincible athletes weren't concerned with the lessons of those who came before. They just loved to bowl. On Valentine's Day in the winter of '93, the night of the most notorious event in recent Peninsula history, Jackson waited at teammate Xavier Gunn's house for their friends to return from Circle Lanes.When the boys returned, they didn't seem worried. In fact, they were hardly worked up. They started to play cards, but first, Iverson called Moore, told him he didn't do anything, that he wasn't involved in the fight at all. But he was Allen Iverson, so it didn't matter."Allen," said Moore just after midnight, "we're going to need a lawyer."Getty ImagesChapter Five: The Night He Swerved Past DeathTawanna wanted to do something special for his birthday. This was the Big 3-0. They had been together for half his life. They had three children and another on the way. She arranged to buy three cars—one for each decade of his life. There was the white drop-top Bentley coupe, the matte gray Lamborghini Murcielago and the Mercedes AMG. When he arrived home one afternoon, they were arranged in a row like a car show.This amused some in his circle, because even though Iverson loved cars, he rarely drove. He had been driven to just about every game, practice, appearance, restaurant or club he'd ever been to. No one was actually sure if he even had a license."Allen just really couldn't drive that well," says Moore.But when he needed them one particular day, he summoned some driving skills that likely saved his life.Less than a mile from his house, on a winding, tree-lined road, Iverson crested a small hill that sharply banked right at the top, preventing motorists from seeing oncoming traffic. To drivers in either direction, a small amount of faith was required until clear sight lines were restored.Iverson was nearly at the top when an oncoming car emerged in his lane headed straight for the white Bentley he had just gotten for his birthday. Neither Iverson nor the other driver had time to apply the brakes without a head-on collision.Iverson instantaneously yanked the wheel to the right, missing the car by inches, sending the Bentley careening off the road. He hadn't touched the brakes. Without losing any speed, the car was headed for a massive 100-year-old elm tree.The car fishtailed wildly.Iverson yanked the wheel back to the left and was able to steer out of the tailspin in the dewy grass. When the car came to rest, he and Jackson sat in silence, hearts racing, trying to get a handle on the moment."That could have been it," said a shaken Iverson still gripping the wheel. "Just like that, it could have been over."Iverson wasn't wearing his seat belt. He never did."If not for his reflexes, we would probably be dead," says Jackson. "I've never seen him react like that. Something was guiding his hand."Iverson steered the car back onto the empty road and made a U-turn to head back home. He pulled in the driveway, jumped out of the car and ran to the front door. He burst into the house and called out for Tawanna with a desperate voice. When she came down the staircase, he pulled her close and hugged her tightly without saying a word. The children ambled into the room, curious why Dad was back so soon. He embraced them one by one.When his nerves settled, Iverson got back into the car as Tawanna and the children stood in the doorway. He looked at the children and thought about the moments in his life. There was prom night when he was decked out in an all-white tux. Moore helped Iverson put on his bow tie. Tawanna radiated in a fuchsia sequin dress. The beat-up Toyota with tinted windows and rims that someone loaned him did just fine.There was his wedding night. The newlyweds danced their first dance to Musiq Soulchild's dreamy track "Love." Tawanna put her arms over his shoulder, her left hand on the back of Allen's head. Iverson put his chin on her shoulder and closed his eyes. Her parents cried. Ann's heart glowed. They swayed slowly. Iverson placed his left hand protectively in the small of her back. She raised her right hand to the sky as if to testify. They might as well have been the only two in the room.Fast-forward back to that fateful night—Iverson put the car in gear. For the first time in his adult life, he put on his seat belt.A portrait of Iverson's state championship Bethel team. A.I. loved to be surrounded by his teammates.Courtesy of Gary MooreChapter Six: Fear of IsolationIverson worked in the bakery at City Farm. The jail was located on the banks of the same river he fished from as a kid. He was allowed to occasionally play hoops. Tom Brokaw came down from New York and interviewed him on NBC dressed in his all-white prison garb. Women would send him underwear in the mail.Moore visited Iverson daily and helped him draft a handwritten letter asking for a second chance that he mailed to then-Virginia Gov. Douglas Wilder, who would grant him clemency after serving four months of a highly controversial 15-year sentence following a racially charged trial. (Ten years were suspended.) It would be his final act in office.When Coach Bailey would visit, bringing with him a group of teammates, Iverson would turn his back to the glass partition. He didn't want his friends to see the tears running down his face.Ann Iverson did interviews telling the world they would be OK. That her baby was too strong. That he was going to buy her a cherry red Jaguar, her favorite car.Moore stares at the ceiling in his game room with an exasperated look and sighs.Seventeen-year-old Allen Iverson was tried and convicted as an adult of maiming by mob in 1993.Via NPR.org/ESPNLost in the carnage of what many, in hindsight, see as injustice was the fact that Iverson's football career was effectively over, something that angers Moore to this day."He was a far better football player than a basketball player," says Moore. "Far, far better. We talked about Notre Dame all the time. That was our dream. We watched the Fighting Irish on TV every Saturday. He was never supposed to be in the NBA. We were focused on the NFL. He should be in Canton as we speak."People in the area still debate whether or not Michael Vick or Iverson was the better quarterback.Twenty-two years later, the wounds are still raw. The thoughts bubbling just beneath the surface are bad enough. Still, he tries to brush it off."It's no big deal," he says just above a whisper. "Water under the bridge.""When he was sentenced, I knew I would do one thing," says Jackson. "I was on a mission through education. I had to put myself in a position to give him a job if he ever needed one."Last May, Jackson completed his doctorate in education at Ohio State and works as a principal in the Columbus school system.On Iverson's first night of freedom, they gathered at Gunn's house and tried to reclaim normalcy. They didn't ask him what it was like. He didn't tell them about screams that echoed throughout the prison all night or fires people would start or how the prison guards would try to intimidate. He didn't tell them how lonely he was."I've tried to delete all those memories out of my head," says Iverson. "I want to put those times behind me where I don't have to speak about it anymore."They played cards for hours before breaking out the Monopoly set. Before long, it was late, and the boys were getting tired. As Iverson packed up the game, he grew quiet. And that's when Jackson saw something he says he'll never forget."He had this look in his eyes that said, 'Please don't leave me,'" he remembers. "But you don't really understand it as kids. It would take me years to understand the significance."Iverson hated to be alone. When he was released from City Farm, people noticed he would avoid isolation at all cost.Iverson got up and told them he was taking a shower."Y'all still gonna be here when I get back, right?" he asked. A.I. and Kobe entered the league together.  It was Iverson who would become the cultural icon.Courtesy of Gary MooreChapter Seven: The Preeminent Icon of Sports' First Hip-Hop GenerationThere is an old oak tree keeping watch over the corner lot. The lawn is more dirt than grass. Several children's bicycles lean against the side of the house. Some pink, some with flat tires. A "No Trespassing" sign is tacked haphazardly to the front of the house.This is the weathered, one-level house where Allen Iverson once practiced his speech to a judge.It's an unlikely origin for an agent of change."He was an early entrant into the hip-hop era," former NBA Commissioner David Stern says of Iverson. "But I don't think it ever became a hip-hop league."In a recent conversation with the retired Stern about the impact of Iverson, I mention his well-known distaste of rap music and its surrounding culture."Actually, I like hip-hop," he says, "but I was more of a Beatles man myself."Stern says he doesn't remember the white wave cap Iverson wore to the Rookie of the Year presentation. Or the tilted cap, black leather jacket and platinum chain he rocked when he picked up the 2001 MVP. Even if he did remember, he's adamant Iverson's clothes didn't matter."Those things bothered other people in our organization more than it did me," he says. "But I think Iverson endeared himself to certain segments of our fanbase and hurt himself with others."Iverson feels the league singled him out."The dress code was all about me," he insists."It had nothing to do with Allen Iverson," says Stern. "Nothing at all.""Wow," says Iverson. "OK, that's fair. It had nothing to do with Allen Iverson, but it had everything to do with everyone looking like Allen Iverson."Getty Images"So did the dress code target certain players?" I ask the commish."What was the dress code?" he counters. I fumble with an answer not knowing the rule verbatim."See, you don't even know," he admonishes. "We asked our players to wear slacks and a shirt with a collar. End of dress code.""Was race a factor?" I ask."Our league was always on the razor's edge with race," says Stern. "But in a good way in that we were at the forefront of a national discussion. But the dress code wasn't about hip-hop. It was so blown out of proportion. I despised the reaction to it."Still, Iverson considers it an honor to be regarded as a cultural touchstone and an inspiration to so many."I definitely wanted to be like Allen Iverson," says Celtics guard Isaiah Thomas. "I don't think anyone would have gotten tattoos, cornrows and headbands if not for him. But he really taught us how to be ourselves."Chris Paul chose No. 3 because of Iverson. The clean-cut point guard even wanted to grow cornrows himself at one point.John Wall grew up wanting to be Iverson. "He was my favorite player," says Wall. "I don't know anyone who didn't love A.I. He was a role model for me, and I just loved everything about him."When Iverson's jersey was retired in March 2014, dozens of NBA players took to social media to honor him.LeBron James wrote on Instagram: "Pound for pound!! What a pleasure to compete against u and also become a friend in the process. U the reason why I got tattoos, wore a headband and arm sleeve. Thanks for everything!! #AITheGoat #BubbaChuck #HOFNext"It has received over 430,000 likes."Your impact on the game will be felt for generations," wrote Kobe Bryant.Baron Davis recently tweeted: "He had a real influence on my game #mostimportantplayer #favorite #Legendary""He was like a god," says Lakers guard Wayne Ellington, who grew up in Philly during Iverson's prime. One day, then-Sixers guard Lou Williams took Ellington to hang out with Iverson."I kept looking at him thinking, 'Man, that's Allen Iverson,'" Ellington remembers.Iverson is humbled upon hearing these accounts."I'm not going to pat myself on the back yet because I'm not done," he says. "When I'm an old man surrounded by my wife, kids and grandkids laying on a bed somewhere and I'm finished, then I'll pat myself on the back. Then I'll just fade away."But if I ever come back to this life," he says, "I want to come back as Allen Iverson."EPILOGUEIt's a strange thing when a cultural icon hits 40.There are no more stands to take. No more minds to change. Only diapers and bed sheets. The garbage needs to be taken out. The pantry isn't going to restock itself.Tawanna has been after him to cut his iconic locks. He's outlived them, she says. Plus, maintaining them is such a hassle. He has to fly his hairdresser in every three weeks, put her up and get her a car when she arrives at the airport. On the brink of 40, his hair-care regimen remains among the most costly in sports.In February 2009, he had a nightmare. He dreamed he cut off his rows. He walked to the bathroom in the middle of the night and took off his do-rag."Oh, my God! I did!" he laughs at the memory.The next day, Iverson walked into NBA All-Star practice, and his peers let him have it. Shaq led the way. LeBron was nearly in tears. Guys were palming his head. He started growing his hair back the very next day.It was major news when A.I. sheared his iconic cornrows.Getty Images"I ain't never cutting my hair again," he declares, pounding on the table. Then a beat. He knows he'll do whatever Tawanna asks. "Nah, I'll cut it. But the time has to be right."He has decided he will cut his hair off for good after his Hall of Fame induction speech. (He's eligible in 2016.) He'll let Tawanna cut it herself."I want to give my speech the way I looked in my career," he says. "That's the way I want to be remembered. I'll shave it close right after. I might have to get that corporate look."Allen Iverson winks at you."What else you got?" he asks.Iverson's childhood home on Jordan Drive.Chris Palmer for Bleacher ReportThere is one last thing.I hand Iverson my iPhone. There is a picture of the house he lived in when he was rearranging Virginia state record books on both the gridiron and the basketball court.He holds it out in front of him with his lanky right arm. He stares at it for several seconds. Goes to speak, then stops. The room is deathly quiet. He's caught off guard. I wait for him to speak. He doesn't. His eyes moisten."What do you see?" I ask."That's home," he says quietly. His voice cracks. "Glad to see it's still standing. Yep, that's home. That's where Tawanna used to do all my homework."RelatedNBAReport: Kyrie Asked Cavs to Trade HimAdam Wellsvia Bleacher ReportNBAReport: Cavs, D-Rose to Meet in PersonMike  Chiarivia Bleacher ReportNBAYao Denies Interest in Buying RocketsTim Danielsvia Bleacher ReportNBAWho Won the NBA Offseason?Adam Fromalvia Bleacher Report

Allen Ezail Iverson (born June 7, 1975) is an American former professional basketball player who played for 14 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played both the shooting guard and point guard positions. Iverson was an eleven-time NBA All-Star, won the All-Star game MVP award in 2001 and 2005, and was the NBA's Most Valuable Player (MVP) in 2001. Iverson is now the captain/coach of 3's Company in the BIG3.
Iverson attended Bethel High School in Hampton, Virginia, and was a dual-sport athlete. He earned the Associated Press High School Player of the Year award in both football and basketball, and won the Division AAA Virginia state championship in both sports.[1] After high school, Iverson attended Georgetown University for two years, where he set the school record for career scoring average (22.9 points per game) and won Big East Defensive Player of the Year awards both years.[2]
Following two successful years at Georgetown, Iverson declared eligibility for the 1996 NBA draft, and was selected by the Philadelphia 76ers with the first overall pick. He was named the NBA Rookie of the Year in the 1996–97 season. Winning the NBA scoring title during the 1998–99, 2000–01, 2001–02, and 2004–05 seasons, Iverson was one of the most prolific scorers in NBA history, despite his relatively small stature (listed at 6 feet, 0 inches). His regular season career scoring average of 26.7 points per game ranks seventh all-time, and his playoff career scoring average of 29.7 points per game is second only to Michael Jordan. Iverson was also the NBA Most Valuable Player of the 2000–01 season and led his team to the 2001 NBA Finals the same season. Iverson represented the United States at the 2004 Summer Olympics, winning the bronze medal. He also played for the Denver Nuggets, Detroit Pistons, and the Memphis Grizzlies, before ending his NBA career with the 76ers during the 2009–10 season.
Iverson was rated the fifth-greatest NBA shooting guard of all time by ESPN in 2008.[3] He officially announced his retirement from professional basketball on October 30, 2013.[4] On April 4, 2016, Iverson was elected into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.[5]

Early life
Allen Iverson was born on June 7, 1975[6] in Hampton, Virginia to a single 15-year-old mother, Ann Iverson, and was given his mother's maiden name after his father Allen Broughton left her.[7]
He attended Bethel High School, where he started as quarterback for the school football team,[8] while also playing running back, kick returner, and defensive back.[9] He also started as point guard for the school basketball team. During his junior year, Allen was able to lead both teams to Virginia state championships, as well as earning The Associated Press High School Player of the Year award in both sports.[10]
On February 14, 1993, Iverson and several of his friends were involved in an altercation with several patrons at a bowling alley in Hampton, Virginia.[11] Allegedly, Iverson's crowd was raucous and had to be asked to quiet down several times, and eventually a shouting duel began with another group of youths. Shortly thereafter, a huge fight erupted, pitting the white crowd against the black crowd. During the fight, Iverson allegedly struck a woman in the head with a chair. He, andthree of his friends ,who are also black, were the only people arrested. Iverson, who was 17 at the time, was convicted as an adult of the felony charge of maiming by mob, a rarely used Virginia statute that was designed to combat lynching.[12] Iverson and his supporters maintained his innocence, claiming that he left the alley as soon as the trouble began. Iverson said of the incident:

For me to be in a bowling alley where everybody in the whole place know who I am and be crackin' people upside the head with chairs and think nothin' gonna happen? That's crazy! And what kind of a man would I be to hit a girl in the head with a damn chair? I rather have 'em say I hit a man with a chair, not no damn woman.[12]

Iverson drew a 15-year prison sentence, with 10 years suspended. After Iverson spent four months at Newport News City Farm, a correctional facility in Newport News, he was granted clemency by Virginia Governor Douglas Wilder, and the Virginia Court of Appeals overturned the conviction in 1995 for insufficient evidence.[12] This incident and its impact on the community is explored in the documentary film No Crossover: The Trial of Allen Iverson. Iverson said of his time in prison:

I had to use the whole jail situation as something positive. Going to jail, someone sees something weak in you, they'll exploit it. I never showed any weakness. I just kept going strong until I came out.[12]

The prison sentence forced him to complete his senior year of high school at Richard Milburn High School, a school for at-risk students, instead of competing in sports at Bethel.[12] However, the three years Iverson spent there were enough to convince Georgetown University head coach John Thompson to come out and meet Iverson, and offer him a full scholarship to join the Georgetown Hoyas basketball team.[12]
College basketball
In his first season at Georgetown in 1994–95, Iverson won the Big East Rookie of the Year award and was named to the All Rookie Tournament First Team.[13] That season, Iverson led the Hoyas to the Sweet 16 round of the NCAA tournament, where they lost to North Carolina.[14]
In his second and final season at Georgetown in 1995–96, Iverson led the team to a Big East championship and all the way to the Elite 8 round of the NCAA tournament, where they lost to Massachusetts.[15] He ended his college career as the Hoyas' all-time leader in career scoring average, at 22.9 points per game.[2] Iverson was named as a First Team All American.
Following the conclusion of his sophomore year, Iverson declared for the 1996 NBA draft. He was the first player under Coach Thompson to leave Georgetown early for the NBA.[12]

Early years (1996–2000)




Iverson was selected first overall in 1996


After two seasons at Georgetown, Iverson was selected first overall by the Philadelphia 76ers in the 1996 NBA draft. Listed at 6 ft 0 in (1.83 m) tall, Iverson became the shortest first overall pick ever, in a league normally dominated by taller players.
Coming to a Philadelphia team that had just finished the previous season with a dismal 18-64 record, Iverson was only able to help the Sixers to a 22–60 record in 1996–97.[16] In a game against the 55-8 Chicago Bulls, Iverson scored 37 points and memorably crossed over Michael Jordan.[17] He broke Wilt Chamberlain's rookie record of three straight games with at least 40 points, doing so in five straight games, including a 50-point effort in Cleveland against the Cavaliers.[18][19] Averaging 23.5 points per game, 7.5 assists per game and 2.1 steals per game for the season, Iverson was named the NBA Rookie of the Year.
Aided by the arrivals of Theo Ratliff, Eric Snow, Aaron McKie, and new coach Larry Brown, Iverson continued to help the 76ers move forward the following season, as they improved nine games to finish 31-51.[20]
The lockout-shortened 1998–1999 season would mark great improvement for the 76ers. Iverson averaged 26.8 points (which led the league, earning his first scoring title) and was named to his first All NBA first team. The Sixers finished the season at 28-22, earning Iverson his first trip to the playoffs.[21] He started all ten playoff games and averaged 28.5 points per game despite being hampered by a number of nagging injuries. Iverson led the Sixers to an upset over the number three seeded Orlando Magic in four games, before losing to the Indiana Pacers in the second round in six games.[22]
Prior to the next season, Iverson signed a six-year, $70 million contract extension.[23] That year, the Sixers would continue to improve under Iverson's leadership, as they finished 49-33, once again qualifying for the playoffs (this time earning the fifth seed, one spot higher than the previous year's sixth seed).[24] In the playoffs, Iverson averaged 26.2 points, 4.8 assists, 4 rebounds and 1.3 steals per game. Philadelphia would advance past the Charlotte Hornets in the opening round, but was eliminated by Indiana in the second round in six games for the second straight year.[25]
That season, Iverson was selected to the Eastern Conference All-Star team for the first time of what would be 11 straight selections. He was the only player other than Shaquille O'Neal to receive a MVP vote that year. In the 2000 off-season, the 76ers actively tried to trade Iverson after his numerous disagreements with then-coach Larry Brown, and had agreed to terms with the Detroit Pistons before Matt Geiger, who was included in the deal, refused to forfeit his $5 million trade kicker.[26] When it became apparent that Iverson would remain a member of the Sixers, Iverson and Brown put their differences aside to make another attempt at a NBA championship.
MVP season and trip to the Finals (2000–01)




Iverson attempting a free throw against the Lakers


During the 2000–01 season, Iverson led his team to a franchise record 10-0 start to the season, and was named starter at the 2001 NBA All-Star Game, where he won the game MVP. The Sixers posted a 56–26 record on the year, the best in the Eastern Conference that season, earning the top seed. He also averaged a then-career high 31.1 points, winning his second NBA scoring title in the process. Iverson won the NBA steals title at 2.5 a game. Iverson was named NBA Most Valuable Player; at 6 feet and 165 pounds, he became the shortest and lightest player to win the MVP award. He had 93 first-place votes out of a possible 124.[27] He was also named to the All NBA First team for his accomplishments. In the playoffs, Iverson and the Sixers defeated the Indiana Pacers in the first round, before meeting Vince Carter-led Toronto Raptors in the Eastern Semifinals. The series went the full seven games. In the next round, the Sixers defeated the Milwaukee Bucks, also in seven games, to advance to the 2001 NBA Finals against the defending champion Los Angeles Lakers, featuring the duo of Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal.
Iverson led the Sixers to their first finals since their 1983 championship. In game one of the 2001 NBA Finals, Iverson scored a playoff high 48 points and beat the heavily favored Lakers 107–101; it was the Lakers' only playoff loss that year. In the game, he notably stepped over Tyronn Lue after hitting a crucial shot.[28] Iverson would go on to score 23, 35, 35, and 37 in games 2–5, all losing efforts though the Sixers were not swept like many predicted. Iverson enjoyed his most successful season as an individual and as a member of the Sixers during the 2000–01 NBA season.
Iverson began using a basketball sleeve during this season during his recovery from bursitis in his right elbow.[29] Other players, including Carmelo Anthony, and Kobe Bryant,[30] adopted the sleeves as well, as did fans who wore the sleeve as a fashion statement.[31] Iverson continued wearing his sleeve long after his elbow had healed.[30] Some believed that the sleeve improved Iverson's shooting ability. Steven Kotler of Psychology Today suggested that such sleeves may act as a placebo to prevent future injuries.[30]
Early playoff exits and Larry Brown's departure (2001–2003)




Iverson in 2003


Fresh off their trip to the NBA Finals, Iverson and the Sixers entered the 2001–2002 season with high expectations, but were plagued by injuries, and only able to muster a 43-39 record to just sneak into the playoffs.[32] Despite playing in only 60 games that season and being hampered by injuries, Iverson averaged 31.4 points per game to earn his second consecutive scoring title. The 76ers lost to the Boston Celtics in the first round of the playoffs 3-2 in the five game series. After the defeat, Brown criticized Iverson for missing team practices. Iverson responded by saying, "We're sitting here, I'm supposed to be the franchise player, and we're in here talking about practice,"[33] and went on a rant that included the word "practice" fourteen times.[34]
The 2002–2003 season started off poorly for the Sixers, who had just traded defensive-standout Dikembe Mutombo to New Jersey, and saw a decrease in both offensive and defensive production from Aaron McKie and Eric Snow, all three of whom were key components to their Finals appearance two years prior. Iverson would once again put up stellar scoring numbers (27.6 points per game) however, and the Sixers regrouped following the All-Star break to make the playoffs with a 48-34 record.[35] They were able to defeat Baron Davis and the New Orleans Hornets in the opening round of the playoffs. Iverson later described Davis as the most difficult opposing point guard to defend in his career.[36] In the six-game second round series, the 76ers were eliminated by the Detroit Pistons.
Head Coach Larry Brown left the 76ers in 2003, following the playoff loss. After his departure from the 76ers, both he and Iverson indicated that the two were on good terms and genuinely fond of one another.[37] Iverson later reunited with Brown when Iverson became the co-captain of the 2004 United States Olympic men's basketball team. In 2005, Iverson said that Brown was without a doubt "the best coach in the world".
Disappointment and frustration (2003–2006)
Randy Ayers became the next coach of the 76ers, but failed to develop any chemistry with his players, and was fired following a 21–31 start to the season. During the latter part of the 2003–04 NBA season, Iverson bristled under the disciplinarian approach of the Sixers' interim head coach Chris Ford. This led to a number of contentious incidents, including Iverson being suspended for missing practice, fined for failing to notify Ford that he would not attend a game because he was sick, and refusing to play in a game because he felt "insulted" that Ford wanted Iverson to come off the bench as he worked his way back from an injury.[38] Iverson missed a then-career-high 34 games in a disastrous season that saw the Sixers miss the postseason for the first time since the 1997 season.
The 2004–2005 season saw Iverson and the Sixers bounce back under the tutelage of new head coach Jim O'Brien, and additions of their first round draft pick Andre Iguodala, and All-Star forward Chris Webber, who was acquired in a mid-season trade. A rejuvenated Iverson won his fourth NBA scoring title with 31 points and averaged 8 assists for the year, and helped the 76ers climb back into the postseason with a 43-39 record.[39] They would go on to lose to the eventual Eastern Conference champion Detroit Pistons, who were led by Larry Brown, in the first round. In the series, Iverson had three double-doubles, including a 37-point, 15 assist performance in Philadelphia's lone win of the series.
Despite O'Brien helping the team back into the postseason, disagreements with players and management led to his firing after just one season. He was replaced by Sixers' legend Maurice Cheeks, in a personnel move Iverson praised, as Cheeks had been an assistant coach with the team when they reached the NBA Finals in 2001.[40] During the 2005–2006 season, Iverson averaged a career high 33.0 points per game. The Sixers, however, missed the playoffs for the second time in three years.
On April 18, 2006, Iverson and Chris Webber arrived late to the Sixers' fan appreciation night and home game finale. Players are expected to report 90 minutes before game time, but both Iverson and Webber arrived around tipoff. Coach Maurice Cheeks notified the media that neither would be playing and general manager Billy King announced that Iverson and Webber would be fined.[41] During the 2006 off-season, trade rumors had Iverson going to Denver, Atlanta, or Boston. None of the deals were completed. Iverson had made it clear that he would like to stay a Sixer.[42]
Iverson and the Sixers began the 2006–07 NBA season at 3-0 before stumbling out to a 5-10 record through 15 games.[43] Following the disappointing start, Iverson reportedly demanded a trade from the Sixers (although he would deny that).[44] As a result, Iverson was told he would not play in any more games. During the following game against the Washington Wizards, which was televised nationally on ESPN, Sixers Chairman Ed Snider confirmed the trade rumors by stating "We're going to trade him. At a certain point, you have to come to grips with the fact that it's not working. He wants out and we're ready to accommodate him."[45]
Iverson ended his 10-year Philadelphia tenure with the highest scoring average in team history (28.1), and is second all-time on the points list (19,583), and the Sixers did not win another playoff series after his departure until 2012.
Denver Nuggets (2006–2008)




Allen Iverson during his tenure with the Denver Nuggets


On December 19, 2006, the Philadelphia 76ers sent Iverson and forward Ivan McFarlin to the Denver Nuggets for Andre Miller, Joe Smith, and two first-round picks in the 2007 NBA draft. At the time of the trade, Iverson was the NBA's number two leading scorer with new teammate Carmelo Anthony being number one.[46]
On December 23, 2006, Iverson played his first game for the Nuggets. He had 22 points and 10 assists in a losing effort to the Sacramento Kings.[47] In Iverson's first year as a Nugget they made the playoffs. They won the first game and lost the next four to the San Antonio Spurs.[48]
Iverson was fined $25,000 by the NBA for criticizing referee Steve Javie following a game between the Nuggets and Iverson's former team, the Philadelphia 76ers, played January 2, 2007. During the course of the game, Iverson committed two technical fouls and was ejected from the game. After the game, Iverson said, "I thought I got fouled on that play, and I said I thought that he was calling the game personal I should have known that I couldn't say anything anyway. It's been something personal with me and him since I got in the league. This was just the perfect game for him to try and make me look bad."[49]
Former referee Tim Donaghy supported the claim that Javie had a longstanding hatred for Iverson in his book, Personal Foul: A First-Person Account of the Scandal that Rocked the NBA, which a Florida business group published through a self-publishing arm of Amazon.com[50] after it was dropped by a division of Random House, who cited liability issues after reviewing the manuscript.[51]
In a December 2009 interview with 60 Minutes, Donaghy said he and fellow referees thought the punishment was too light. Before Iverson's Nuggets played the Utah Jazz on January 6, 2007, Donaghy said he and the two other officials working the game agreed not to give Iverson favorable calls as a way to "teach him a lesson". Iverson attempted 12 free throws, more than any other player on either team. On 12 drives to the basket, he drew five fouls, three of which Donaghy whistled himself, and did not receive a call on one play in which he was obviously fouled by Utah's Mehmet Okur.[52]
Iverson returned to Philadelphia on March 19, 2008 to a sell-out crowd and received a standing ovation in a 115–113 loss.[53]
Detroit Pistons and Memphis Grizzlies (2008–2009)




Iverson, as a member of the Pistons


On November 3, 2008, Iverson was dealt from the Denver Nuggets to the Detroit Pistons for guard Chauncey Billups, forward Antonio McDyess and center Cheikh Samb.[54] Iverson, who had worn a #3 jersey his entire NBA career, switched to number 1 for the Pistons, which Billups previously wore for the team.
Iverson scored at least 24 in four of his first five games with Detroit (They won 3 of the 5),[55] and would score 20 or more and 6 or more assists on a consistent basis, but as the season wore on he would lose playing time to Rodney Stuckey. Some have speculated that Pistons President of Basketball Operations Joe Dumars did not envision a long-term role for Iverson on the team, but traded for him to make Stuckey the point guard of the future and free cap space with Iverson's expiring contract.[56]
On April 3, 2009, it was announced that Iverson would not play the remainder of the 2008–09 season. Dumars cited Iverson's ongoing back injury as the reason for his deactivation, although two days prior Iverson stated publicly that he'd rather retire than be moved to the bench as Pistons coach Michael Curry had decided.[57]
On September 10, 2009, Iverson signed a one-year contract with the Memphis Grizzlies.[58] Iverson stated that "God chose Memphis as the place that I will continue my career", and that "I feel that they are committed to developing a winner."[59]
However, Iverson again expressed his displeasure at being a bench player,[60] and left the team on November 7, 2009 for "personal reasons".[61] On November 16, the Grizzlies announced the team terminated his contract by "mutual agreement".[62] Iverson played three games for the Grizzlies, averaging 12.3 ppg, 1.3 rpg, and 3.7 apg in 22.3 mpg.
Return to the 76ers (2009–2010)




Iverson shoots a jump shot in 2010


On November 25, 2009, analyst Stephen A. Smith published on his blog a statement attributed to Iverson announcing plans for retirement, which also said, "I feel strongly that I can still compete at the highest level."[63]
Less than a week later on November 30, Iverson and his representatives met with a Philadelphia 76ers delegation about returning to his former team,[64] and accepted a contract offer two days later. General manager Ed Stefanski declined to go into the terms of the agreement, but an unnamed source told the Associated Press that Iverson agreed to a one-year non-guaranteed contract at the league minimum salary. Iverson would receive a prorated portion of the $1.3 million minimum salary for players with at least 10 years of experience, and the contract would become guaranteed for the remainder of the 2009–10 season if he remained on the roster on January 8, 2010.[65] Stefanski said the team made the decision to pursue Iverson after starting guard Louis Williams suffered a broken jaw and was expected to miss at least 30 games.[66]
On December 7, 2009, Iverson made his return to Philadelphia, garnering a thunderous ovation from the sold-out crowd, in a loss against his former team, the Denver Nuggets.[67] He finished the game with 11 points, 6 assists, 5 rebounds, a steal, and no turnovers.[68] Iverson's first win in his return to Philadelphia came one week later, in a 20-point effort against the Golden State Warriors, ending the Sixers' 12-game losing streak (which stood at 9 games before Iverson returned).[69] He shot 70 percent from the field in the game.[70]
On January 3, 2010, he returned to Denver to face the Nuggets; Iverson scored 17 points and had seven assists in the 108-105 win.[71] He was voted as a starter for the All-Star Game for the 11th straight season.[72] He scored a season-high 23 points (on 56% shooting from the field) in a 99-91 loss to Kobe Bryant and the defending champion Lakers.[73][74]
On February 22, 2010, Iverson left the 76ers indefinitely, citing the need to attend to his 4-year-old daughter Messiah's health issues, which he revealed years later as Kawasaki Disease.[75][76] On March 2, Ed Stefanski announced Iverson would not return to the 76ers for the rest of the season to deal with the personal matter.[77] His final NBA game was a loss against Derrick Rose and the Chicago Bulls on February 20, 2010.[78]
Beşiktaş (2010–2011)
On October 26, 2010, Yahoo! Sports reported that Iverson agreed in principle to a two-year, $4 million net income contract with Beşiktaş, a Turkish Super League team competing in the second-tier level of pan-European professional basketball, the EuroCup (the competition below the EuroLeague level).[79] The club announced the signing at a press conference in New York City, on October 29, 2010.[80] Wearing jersey #4,[81] Iverson made his debut for Beşiktaş on November 16, 2010, in a EuroCup 91-94 loss to Serbian side Hemofarm. Iverson scored 15 points in 23 minutes.[82]
Iverson returned to the United States in January 2011 for calf surgery.[83][84] He only played ten games for Beşiktaş that season, and did not play professional basketball after that.
Official retirement
In January 2013, Iverson received an offer to play for the Texas Legends of the NBA D-League, but he declined.[85]
On October 30, 2013, Iverson announced his retirement from basketball, citing he'd lost his desire to play.[86] At the 76ers 2013–14 season home opener that night, he received a standing ovation at the beginning of the second quarter. The retirement ceremony was attended by former Georgetown coach John Thompson and Sixers great Julius Erving.[87] Iverson said he would always be a Sixer "until I die", and that while he always thought the day he retired would be a "tough" day, he instead stated it was rather a "happy" day.[86]
In November 2013, the 76ers announced that they would officially retire Iverson's number 3 in a special halftime ceremony on March 1, 2014 when the Sixers hosted the Washington Wizards.[88][89] The ceremony took place in front of 20,000 spectators and 76ers greats such as Julius Erving, Moses Malone, and former team president Pat Croce.[90]
BIG3
In 2017, the creation of the 3-on-3 professional basketball league BIG3 was announced, with Iverson set to be a player and coach on 3's Company.[91] In March, it was announced that Iverson's co-captain would be DerMarr Johnson.[92] 3's Company drafted Andre Owens, Mike Sweetney, and Ruben Patterson during the 2017 BIG3 Draft.[93] On June 25, 3's Company played its first game of the inaugural BIG3 season against the Ball Hogs.[94] In the game, Iverson scored 2 points on 1-for-6 shooting in 9 minutes of play.[95] On only playing 9 minutes, Iverson stated, "I signed up to be a coach, player and captain. Coach part is going to go on throughout the game. Playing part is not going to be what you expect. You're not going to see the Allen Iverson of old out there."[94]
National team career




Iverson after a 2006 game with Barcelona


1995 World University Games
Iverson was a member of the USA World University Games Team in Japan in 1995, that included future NBA stars Ray Allen and Tim Duncan, among others. Iverson led all USA players in scoring, assists, and steals, averaging 16.7 points per game, 6.1 assists per game, and 2.9 steals per game. He helped lead the team to an undefeated record en route to a 141-81 victory over the host country, Japan, for the gold medal.[96]
2003 FIBA Americas championship
Iverson was selected to be part of Team USA for the 2003 FIBA Americas Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Puerto Rico in August of that year. USA had a perfect 10–0 record, and won the gold medal as well as qualifying for a berth in the 2004 Olympics. Iverson started all eight games that he played in, and was second on the team with 14.3 points per game, while also posting 3.8 assists per game, 2.5 rebounds per game, 1.6 steals per game, and shooting 56.2 percent (41–73 FGs) from the field, 53.6 percent (15–28 3pt FGs) from 3-point and 81.0 percent (17–21 FTs) from the foul line.[97]
In the USA's 111–71 victory over Canada on August 25, he accounted for a USA Olympic Qualifying single game record 28 points and made a single game record seven 3-pointers. Playing just 23 minutes, he shot 10-for-13 overall, 7-for-8 from the 3-point line, 1-for-1 from the foul line and added three assists, three steals, and one rebound. All seven of his 3-point field goals were made during the final 7:41 of the third quarter.[98]
He finished the tournament ranked overall tied for 10th in scoring, tied for fourth in steals, fifth in 3-point percentage, tied for seventh in assists, and ninth in field goal percentage (.562). Iverson also missed the USA's final two games because of a sprained right thumb which was suffered in the first half of the August 28 Puerto Rico game. In a game against Puerto Rico, he recorded 9 points on 4-for-6 shooting from the field overall, and added five assists and three rebounds in 26 minutes of action in the USA's 101–74 exhibition game victory on August 17 in New York. He was also named to the 2003 USA Senior National Team on April 29, 2003.

Personal life




Iverson and rap star Nelly at a Reebok photoshoot.


During the 1997 offseason, Iverson and his friends were stopped by a police officer for speeding late at night and was arrested for carrying a concealed weapon and for possession of marijuana. He pleaded no contest and was sentenced to community service.[99]
During the 2000 offseason, Iverson recorded a rap single called "40 Bars". However, after being criticized for its controversial lyrics, he eventually was unable to release it. Going under his moniker, Jewelz, the album was alleged to have made derogatory remarks about homosexuals. After criticism from activist groups and NBA Commissioner David Stern, he agreed to change the lyrics, but ultimately never released the album.[100]
In August 2001, he married his high school sweetheart Tawanna at The Mansion on Main Street in Voorhees, New Jersey.[101] In 2002, Iverson was alleged to have thrown Tawanna out of their home after a domestic dispute and later threatening two men with a gun while looking for her. All charges against him were later dropped after the judge cited lack of evidence with contradictory statements from witnesses.[102]
On February 24, 2004, Iverson urinated in a trash can at Bally's Atlantic City casino and was told by casino management not to return.[103]
On December 9, 2005, after the Sixers defeated the Charlotte Bobcats, Iverson paid a late-night visit to the Trump Taj Mahal. After winning a hand at a three-card-stud poker table, Iverson was overpaid $10,000 in chips by a dealer. When the dealer quickly realized the mistake and requested the chips back, Iverson refused and a heated head-turning argument between him and casino staff began. Atlantic City casino regulations reportedly state that when a casino makes a payout mistake in favor of the gambler, he or she must return the money that they did not legitimately win by playing.[103]
Also in 2005, Iverson's bodyguard Jason Kane was accused of assaulting a man at a Washington, D. C. nightclub after the man, Marlin Godfrey, refused to leave the club's VIP section so Iverson's entourage could enter. Godfrey suffered a concussion, a ruptured eardrum, a burst blood vessel in his eye, a torn rotator cuff, cuts and bruises, and emotional distress. Although Iverson did not touch Godfrey himself, Godfrey sued Iverson for the injuries caused by his bodyguard. In 2007 a jury awarded Godfrey $260,000. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the verdict in 2009.[104]
On March 2, 2010, Iverson's wife filed for divorce, seeking custody of their five children, as well as child support and alimony payments.[101]
In August 2011, an Ohio man sued Iverson for $2.5 million in damages, claiming he was assaulted by Iverson's security guard in a 2009 bar fight in Detroit. The federal judge dismissed the case, finding no evidence that Iverson or his bodyguard struck the plaintiff, Guy Walker.[105]
On May 14, 2015, Iverson appeared on CBS This Morning in support of a Showtime Network documentary on his life, during which he addressed long-discussed rumors of financial struggles, denying any notion that he was struggling. "That's a myth. That's a rumor... The fact that I'm struggling in any part of my life", he said.[106]

Allen Ezail Iverson (born June 7, 1975) is an American former professional basketball player who played for 14 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played both the shooting guard and point guard positions. Iverson was an eleven-time NBA All-Star, won the All-Star game MVP award in 2001 and 2005, and was the NBA's Most Valuable Player (MVP) in 2001. Iverson is now the captain/coach of 3's Company in the BIG3.
Iverson attended Bethel High School in Hampton, Virginia, and was a dual-sport athlete. He earned the Associated Press High School Player of the Year award in both football and basketball, and won the Division AAA Virginia state championship in both sports.[1] After high school, Iverson attended Georgetown University for two years, where he set the school record for career scoring average (22.9 points per game) and won Big East Defensive Player of the Year awards both years.[2]
Following two successful years at Georgetown, Iverson declared eligibility for the 1996 NBA draft, and was selected by the Philadelphia 76ers with the first overall pick. He was named the NBA Rookie of the Year in the 1996–97 season. Winning the NBA scoring title during the 1998–99, 2000–01, 2001–02, and 2004–05 seasons, Iverson was one of the most prolific scorers in NBA history, despite his relatively small stature (listed at 6 feet, 0 inches). His regular season career scoring average of 26.7 points per game ranks seventh all-time, and his playoff career scoring average of 29.7 points per game is second only to Michael Jordan. Iverson was also the NBA Most Valuable Player of the 2000–01 season and led his team to the 2001 NBA Finals the same season. Iverson represented the United States at the 2004 Summer Olympics, winning the bronze medal. He also played for the Denver Nuggets, Detroit Pistons, and the Memphis Grizzlies, before ending his NBA career with the 76ers during the 2009–10 season.
Iverson was rated the fifth-greatest NBA shooting guard of all time by ESPN in 2008.[3] He officially announced his retirement from professional basketball on October 30, 2013.[4] On April 4, 2016, Iverson was elected into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.[5]

Early life
Allen Iverson was born on June 7, 1975[6] in Hampton, Virginia to a single 15-year-old mother, Ann Iverson, and was given his mother's maiden name after his father Allen Broughton left her.[7]
He attended Bethel High School, where he started as quarterback for the school football team,[8] while also playing running back, kick returner, and defensive back.[9] He also started as point guard for the school basketball team. During his junior year, Allen was able to lead both teams to Virginia state championships, as well as earning The Associated Press High School Player of the Year award in both sports.[10]
On February 14, 1993, Iverson and several of his friends were involved in an altercation with several patrons at a bowling alley in Hampton, Virginia.[11] Allegedly, Iverson's crowd was raucous and had to be asked to quiet down several times, and eventually a shouting duel began with another group of youths. Shortly thereafter, a huge fight erupted, pitting the white crowd against the black crowd. During the fight, Iverson allegedly struck a woman in the head with a chair. He, andthree of his friends ,who are also black, were the only people arrested. Iverson, who was 17 at the time, was convicted as an adult of the felony charge of maiming by mob, a rarely used Virginia statute that was designed to combat lynching.[12] Iverson and his supporters maintained his innocence, claiming that he left the alley as soon as the trouble began. Iverson said of the incident:

For me to be in a bowling alley where everybody in the whole place know who I am and be crackin' people upside the head with chairs and think nothin' gonna happen? That's crazy! And what kind of a man would I be to hit a girl in the head with a damn chair? I rather have 'em say I hit a man with a chair, not no damn woman.[12]

Iverson drew a 15-year prison sentence, with 10 years suspended. After Iverson spent four months at Newport News City Farm, a correctional facility in Newport News, he was granted clemency by Virginia Governor Douglas Wilder, and the Virginia Court of Appeals overturned the conviction in 1995 for insufficient evidence.[12] This incident and its impact on the community is explored in the documentary film No Crossover: The Trial of Allen Iverson. Iverson said of his time in prison:

I had to use the whole jail situation as something positive. Going to jail, someone sees something weak in you, they'll exploit it. I never showed any weakness. I just kept going strong until I came out.[12]

The prison sentence forced him to complete his senior year of high school at Richard Milburn High School, a school for at-risk students, instead of competing in sports at Bethel.[12] However, the three years Iverson spent there were enough to convince Georgetown University head coach John Thompson to come out and meet Iverson, and offer him a full scholarship to join the Georgetown Hoyas basketball team.[12]
College basketball
In his first season at Georgetown in 1994–95, Iverson won the Big East Rookie of the Year award and was named to the All Rookie Tournament First Team.[13] That season, Iverson led the Hoyas to the Sweet 16 round of the NCAA tournament, where they lost to North Carolina.[14]
In his second and final season at Georgetown in 1995–96, Iverson led the team to a Big East championship and all the way to the Elite 8 round of the NCAA tournament, where they lost to Massachusetts.[15] He ended his college career as the Hoyas' all-time leader in career scoring average, at 22.9 points per game.[2] Iverson was named as a First Team All American.
Following the conclusion of his sophomore year, Iverson declared for the 1996 NBA draft. He was the first player under Coach Thompson to leave Georgetown early for the NBA.[12]

Early years (1996–2000)




Iverson was selected first overall in 1996


After two seasons at Georgetown, Iverson was selected first overall by the Philadelphia 76ers in the 1996 NBA draft. Listed at 6 ft 0 in (1.83 m) tall, Iverson became the shortest first overall pick ever, in a league normally dominated by taller players.
Coming to a Philadelphia team that had just finished the previous season with a dismal 18-64 record, Iverson was only able to help the Sixers to a 22–60 record in 1996–97.[16] In a game against the 55-8 Chicago Bulls, Iverson scored 37 points and memorably crossed over Michael Jordan.[17] He broke Wilt Chamberlain's rookie record of three straight games with at least 40 points, doing so in five straight games, including a 50-point effort in Cleveland against the Cavaliers.[18][19] Averaging 23.5 points per game, 7.5 assists per game and 2.1 steals per game for the season, Iverson was named the NBA Rookie of the Year.
Aided by the arrivals of Theo Ratliff, Eric Snow, Aaron McKie, and new coach Larry Brown, Iverson continued to help the 76ers move forward the following season, as they improved nine games to finish 31-51.[20]
The lockout-shortened 1998–1999 season would mark great improvement for the 76ers. Iverson averaged 26.8 points (which led the league, earning his first scoring title) and was named to his first All NBA first team. The Sixers finished the season at 28-22, earning Iverson his first trip to the playoffs.[21] He started all ten playoff games and averaged 28.5 points per game despite being hampered by a number of nagging injuries. Iverson led the Sixers to an upset over the number three seeded Orlando Magic in four games, before losing to the Indiana Pacers in the second round in six games.[22]
Prior to the next season, Iverson signed a six-year, $70 million contract extension.[23] That year, the Sixers would continue to improve under Iverson's leadership, as they finished 49-33, once again qualifying for the playoffs (this time earning the fifth seed, one spot higher than the previous year's sixth seed).[24] In the playoffs, Iverson averaged 26.2 points, 4.8 assists, 4 rebounds and 1.3 steals per game. Philadelphia would advance past the Charlotte Hornets in the opening round, but was eliminated by Indiana in the second round in six games for the second straight year.[25]
That season, Iverson was selected to the Eastern Conference All-Star team for the first time of what would be 11 straight selections. He was the only player other than Shaquille O'Neal to receive a MVP vote that year. In the 2000 off-season, the 76ers actively tried to trade Iverson after his numerous disagreements with then-coach Larry Brown, and had agreed to terms with the Detroit Pistons before Matt Geiger, who was included in the deal, refused to forfeit his $5 million trade kicker.[26] When it became apparent that Iverson would remain a member of the Sixers, Iverson and Brown put their differences aside to make another attempt at a NBA championship.
MVP season and trip to the Finals (2000–01)




Iverson attempting a free throw against the Lakers


During the 2000–01 season, Iverson led his team to a franchise record 10-0 start to the season, and was named starter at the 2001 NBA All-Star Game, where he won the game MVP. The Sixers posted a 56–26 record on the year, the best in the Eastern Conference that season, earning the top seed. He also averaged a then-career high 31.1 points, winning his second NBA scoring title in the process. Iverson won the NBA steals title at 2.5 a game. Iverson was named NBA Most Valuable Player; at 6 feet and 165 pounds, he became the shortest and lightest player to win the MVP award. He had 93 first-place votes out of a possible 124.[27] He was also named to the All NBA First team for his accomplishments. In the playoffs, Iverson and the Sixers defeated the Indiana Pacers in the first round, before meeting Vince Carter-led Toronto Raptors in the Eastern Semifinals. The series went the full seven games. In the next round, the Sixers defeated the Milwaukee Bucks, also in seven games, to advance to the 2001 NBA Finals against the defending champion Los Angeles Lakers, featuring the duo of Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal.
Iverson led the Sixers to their first finals since their 1983 championship. In game one of the 2001 NBA Finals, Iverson scored a playoff high 48 points and beat the heavily favored Lakers 107–101; it was the Lakers' only playoff loss that year. In the game, he notably stepped over Tyronn Lue after hitting a crucial shot.[28] Iverson would go on to score 23, 35, 35, and 37 in games 2–5, all losing efforts though the Sixers were not swept like many predicted. Iverson enjoyed his most successful season as an individual and as a member of the Sixers during the 2000–01 NBA season.
Iverson began using a basketball sleeve during this season during his recovery from bursitis in his right elbow.[29] Other players, including Carmelo Anthony, and Kobe Bryant,[30] adopted the sleeves as well, as did fans who wore the sleeve as a fashion statement.[31] Iverson continued wearing his sleeve long after his elbow had healed.[30] Some believed that the sleeve improved Iverson's shooting ability. Steven Kotler of Psychology Today suggested that such sleeves may act as a placebo to prevent future injuries.[30]
Early playoff exits and Larry Brown's departure (2001–2003)




Iverson in 2003


Fresh off their trip to the NBA Finals, Iverson and the Sixers entered the 2001–2002 season with high expectations, but were plagued by injuries, and only able to muster a 43-39 record to just sneak into the playoffs.[32] Despite playing in only 60 games that season and being hampered by injuries, Iverson averaged 31.4 points per game to earn his second consecutive scoring title. The 76ers lost to the Boston Celtics in the first round of the playoffs 3-2 in the five game series. After the defeat, Brown criticized Iverson for missing team practices. Iverson responded by saying, "We're sitting here, I'm supposed to be the franchise player, and we're in here talking about practice,"[33] and went on a rant that included the word "practice" fourteen times.[34]
The 2002–2003 season started off poorly for the Sixers, who had just traded defensive-standout Dikembe Mutombo to New Jersey, and saw a decrease in both offensive and defensive production from Aaron McKie and Eric Snow, all three of whom were key components to their Finals appearance two years prior. Iverson would once again put up stellar scoring numbers (27.6 points per game) however, and the Sixers regrouped following the All-Star break to make the playoffs with a 48-34 record.[35] They were able to defeat Baron Davis and the New Orleans Hornets in the opening round of the playoffs. Iverson later described Davis as the most difficult opposing point guard to defend in his career.[36] In the six-game second round series, the 76ers were eliminated by the Detroit Pistons.
Head Coach Larry Brown left the 76ers in 2003, following the playoff loss. After his departure from the 76ers, both he and Iverson indicated that the two were on good terms and genuinely fond of one another.[37] Iverson later reunited with Brown when Iverson became the co-captain of the 2004 United States Olympic men's basketball team. In 2005, Iverson said that Brown was without a doubt "the best coach in the world".
Disappointment and frustration (2003–2006)
Randy Ayers became the next coach of the 76ers, but failed to develop any chemistry with his players, and was fired following a 21–31 start to the season. During the latter part of the 2003–04 NBA season, Iverson bristled under the disciplinarian approach of the Sixers' interim head coach Chris Ford. This led to a number of contentious incidents, including Iverson being suspended for missing practice, fined for failing to notify Ford that he would not attend a game because he was sick, and refusing to play in a game because he felt "insulted" that Ford wanted Iverson to come off the bench as he worked his way back from an injury.[38] Iverson missed a then-career-high 34 games in a disastrous season that saw the Sixers miss the postseason for the first time since the 1997 season.
The 2004–2005 season saw Iverson and the Sixers bounce back under the tutelage of new head coach Jim O'Brien, and additions of their first round draft pick Andre Iguodala, and All-Star forward Chris Webber, who was acquired in a mid-season trade. A rejuvenated Iverson won his fourth NBA scoring title with 31 points and averaged 8 assists for the year, and helped the 76ers climb back into the postseason with a 43-39 record.[39] They would go on to lose to the eventual Eastern Conference champion Detroit Pistons, who were led by Larry Brown, in the first round. In the series, Iverson had three double-doubles, including a 37-point, 15 assist performance in Philadelphia's lone win of the series.
Despite O'Brien helping the team back into the postseason, disagreements with players and management led to his firing after just one season. He was replaced by Sixers' legend Maurice Cheeks, in a personnel move Iverson praised, as Cheeks had been an assistant coach with the team when they reached the NBA Finals in 2001.[40] During the 2005–2006 season, Iverson averaged a career high 33.0 points per game. The Sixers, however, missed the playoffs for the second time in three years.
On April 18, 2006, Iverson and Chris Webber arrived late to the Sixers' fan appreciation night and home game finale. Players are expected to report 90 minutes before game time, but both Iverson and Webber arrived around tipoff. Coach Maurice Cheeks notified the media that neither would be playing and general manager Billy King announced that Iverson and Webber would be fined.[41] During the 2006 off-season, trade rumors had Iverson going to Denver, Atlanta, or Boston. None of the deals were completed. Iverson had made it clear that he would like to stay a Sixer.[42]
Iverson and the Sixers began the 2006–07 NBA season at 3-0 before stumbling out to a 5-10 record through 15 games.[43] Following the disappointing start, Iverson reportedly demanded a trade from the Sixers (although he would deny that).[44] As a result, Iverson was told he would not play in any more games. During the following game against the Washington Wizards, which was televised nationally on ESPN, Sixers Chairman Ed Snider confirmed the trade rumors by stating "We're going to trade him. At a certain point, you have to come to grips with the fact that it's not working. He wants out and we're ready to accommodate him."[45]
Iverson ended his 10-year Philadelphia tenure with the highest scoring average in team history (28.1), and is second all-time on the points list (19,583), and the Sixers did not win another playoff series after his departure until 2012.
Denver Nuggets (2006–2008)




Allen Iverson during his tenure with the Denver Nuggets


On December 19, 2006, the Philadelphia 76ers sent Iverson and forward Ivan McFarlin to the Denver Nuggets for Andre Miller, Joe Smith, and two first-round picks in the 2007 NBA draft. At the time of the trade, Iverson was the NBA's number two leading scorer with new teammate Carmelo Anthony being number one.[46]
On December 23, 2006, Iverson played his first game for the Nuggets. He had 22 points and 10 assists in a losing effort to the Sacramento Kings.[47] In Iverson's first year as a Nugget they made the playoffs. They won the first game and lost the next four to the San Antonio Spurs.[48]
Iverson was fined $25,000 by the NBA for criticizing referee Steve Javie following a game between the Nuggets and Iverson's former team, the Philadelphia 76ers, played January 2, 2007. During the course of the game, Iverson committed two technical fouls and was ejected from the game. After the game, Iverson said, "I thought I got fouled on that play, and I said I thought that he was calling the game personal I should have known that I couldn't say anything anyway. It's been something personal with me and him since I got in the league. This was just the perfect game for him to try and make me look bad."[49]
Former referee Tim Donaghy supported the claim that Javie had a longstanding hatred for Iverson in his book, Personal Foul: A First-Person Account of the Scandal that Rocked the NBA, which a Florida business group published through a self-publishing arm of Amazon.com[50] after it was dropped by a division of Random House, who cited liability issues after reviewing the manuscript.[51]
In a December 2009 interview with 60 Minutes, Donaghy said he and fellow referees thought the punishment was too light. Before Iverson's Nuggets played the Utah Jazz on January 6, 2007, Donaghy said he and the two other officials working the game agreed not to give Iverson favorable calls as a way to "teach him a lesson". Iverson attempted 12 free throws, more than any other player on either team. On 12 drives to the basket, he drew five fouls, three of which Donaghy whistled himself, and did not receive a call on one play in which he was obviously fouled by Utah's Mehmet Okur.[52]
Iverson returned to Philadelphia on March 19, 2008 to a sell-out crowd and received a standing ovation in a 115–113 loss.[53]
Detroit Pistons and Memphis Grizzlies (2008–2009)




Iverson, as a member of the Pistons


On November 3, 2008, Iverson was dealt from the Denver Nuggets to the Detroit Pistons for guard Chauncey Billups, forward Antonio McDyess and center Cheikh Samb.[54] Iverson, who had worn a #3 jersey his entire NBA career, switched to number 1 for the Pistons, which Billups previously wore for the team.
Iverson scored at least 24 in four of his first five games with Detroit (They won 3 of the 5),[55] and would score 20 or more and 6 or more assists on a consistent basis, but as the season wore on he would lose playing time to Rodney Stuckey. Some have speculated that Pistons President of Basketball Operations Joe Dumars did not envision a long-term role for Iverson on the team, but traded for him to make Stuckey the point guard of the future and free cap space with Iverson's expiring contract.[56]
On April 3, 2009, it was announced that Iverson would not play the remainder of the 2008–09 season. Dumars cited Iverson's ongoing back injury as the reason for his deactivation, although two days prior Iverson stated publicly that he'd rather retire than be moved to the bench as Pistons coach Michael Curry had decided.[57]
On September 10, 2009, Iverson signed a one-year contract with the Memphis Grizzlies.[58] Iverson stated that "God chose Memphis as the place that I will continue my career", and that "I feel that they are committed to developing a winner."[59]
However, Iverson again expressed his displeasure at being a bench player,[60] and left the team on November 7, 2009 for "personal reasons".[61] On November 16, the Grizzlies announced the team terminated his contract by "mutual agreement".[62] Iverson played three games for the Grizzlies, averaging 12.3 ppg, 1.3 rpg, and 3.7 apg in 22.3 mpg.
Return to the 76ers (2009–2010)




Iverson shoots a jump shot in 2010


On November 25, 2009, analyst Stephen A. Smith published on his blog a statement attributed to Iverson announcing plans for retirement, which also said, "I feel strongly that I can still compete at the highest level."[63]
Less than a week later on November 30, Iverson and his representatives met with a Philadelphia 76ers delegation about returning to his former team,[64] and accepted a contract offer two days later. General manager Ed Stefanski declined to go into the terms of the agreement, but an unnamed source told the Associated Press that Iverson agreed to a one-year non-guaranteed contract at the league minimum salary. Iverson would receive a prorated portion of the $1.3 million minimum salary for players with at least 10 years of experience, and the contract would become guaranteed for the remainder of the 2009–10 season if he remained on the roster on January 8, 2010.[65] Stefanski said the team made the decision to pursue Iverson after starting guard Louis Williams suffered a broken jaw and was expected to miss at least 30 games.[66]
On December 7, 2009, Iverson made his return to Philadelphia, garnering a thunderous ovation from the sold-out crowd, in a loss against his former team, the Denver Nuggets.[67] He finished the game with 11 points, 6 assists, 5 rebounds, a steal, and no turnovers.[68] Iverson's first win in his return to Philadelphia came one week later, in a 20-point effort against the Golden State Warriors, ending the Sixers' 12-game losing streak (which stood at 9 games before Iverson returned).[69] He shot 70 percent from the field in the game.[70]
On January 3, 2010, he returned to Denver to face the Nuggets; Iverson scored 17 points and had seven assists in the 108-105 win.[71] He was voted as a starter for the All-Star Game for the 11th straight season.[72] He scored a season-high 23 points (on 56% shooting from the field) in a 99-91 loss to Kobe Bryant and the defending champion Lakers.[73][74]
On February 22, 2010, Iverson left the 76ers indefinitely, citing the need to attend to his 4-year-old daughter Messiah's health issues, which he revealed years later as Kawasaki Disease.[75][76] On March 2, Ed Stefanski announced Iverson would not return to the 76ers for the rest of the season to deal with the personal matter.[77] His final NBA game was a loss against Derrick Rose and the Chicago Bulls on February 20, 2010.[78]
Beşiktaş (2010–2011)
On October 26, 2010, Yahoo! Sports reported that Iverson agreed in principle to a two-year, $4 million net income contract with Beşiktaş, a Turkish Super League team competing in the second-tier level of pan-European professional basketball, the EuroCup (the competition below the EuroLeague level).[79] The club announced the signing at a press conference in New York City, on October 29, 2010.[80] Wearing jersey #4,[81] Iverson made his debut for Beşiktaş on November 16, 2010, in a EuroCup 91-94 loss to Serbian side Hemofarm. Iverson scored 15 points in 23 minutes.[82]
Iverson returned to the United States in January 2011 for calf surgery.[83][84] He only played ten games for Beşiktaş that season, and did not play professional basketball after that.
Official retirement
In January 2013, Iverson received an offer to play for the Texas Legends of the NBA D-League, but he declined.[85]
On October 30, 2013, Iverson announced his retirement from basketball, citing he'd lost his desire to play.[86] At the 76ers 2013–14 season home opener that night, he received a standing ovation at the beginning of the second quarter. The retirement ceremony was attended by former Georgetown coach John Thompson and Sixers great Julius Erving.[87] Iverson said he would always be a Sixer "until I die", and that while he always thought the day he retired would be a "tough" day, he instead stated it was rather a "happy" day.[86]
In November 2013, the 76ers announced that they would officially retire Iverson's number 3 in a special halftime ceremony on March 1, 2014 when the Sixers hosted the Washington Wizards.[88][89] The ceremony took place in front of 20,000 spectators and 76ers greats such as Julius Erving, Moses Malone, and former team president Pat Croce.[90]
BIG3
In 2017, the creation of the 3-on-3 professional basketball league BIG3 was announced, with Iverson set to be a player and coach on 3's Company.[91] In March, it was announced that Iverson's co-captain would be DerMarr Johnson.[92] 3's Company drafted Andre Owens, Mike Sweetney, and Ruben Patterson during the 2017 BIG3 Draft.[93] On June 25, 3's Company played its first game of the inaugural BIG3 season against the Ball Hogs.[94] In the game, Iverson scored 2 points on 1-for-6 shooting in 9 minutes of play.[95] On only playing 9 minutes, Iverson stated, "I signed up to be a coach, player and captain. Coach part is going to go on throughout the game. Playing part is not going to be what you expect. You're not going to see the Allen Iverson of old out there."[94]
National team career




Iverson after a 2006 game with Barcelona


1995 World University Games
Iverson was a member of the USA World University Games Team in Japan in 1995, that included future NBA stars Ray Allen and Tim Duncan, among others. Iverson led all USA players in scoring, assists, and steals, averaging 16.7 points per game, 6.1 assists per game, and 2.9 steals per game. He helped lead the team to an undefeated record en route to a 141-81 victory over the host country, Japan, for the gold medal.[96]
2003 FIBA Americas championship
Iverson was selected to be part of Team USA for the 2003 FIBA Americas Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Puerto Rico in August of that year. USA had a perfect 10–0 record, and won the gold medal as well as qualifying for a berth in the 2004 Olympics. Iverson started all eight games that he played in, and was second on the team with 14.3 points per game, while also posting 3.8 assists per game, 2.5 rebounds per game, 1.6 steals per game, and shooting 56.2 percent (41–73 FGs) from the field, 53.6 percent (15–28 3pt FGs) from 3-point and 81.0 percent (17–21 FTs) from the foul line.[97]
In the USA's 111–71 victory over Canada on August 25, he accounted for a USA Olympic Qualifying single game record 28 points and made a single game record seven 3-pointers. Playing just 23 minutes, he shot 10-for-13 overall, 7-for-8 from the 3-point line, 1-for-1 from the foul line and added three assists, three steals, and one rebound. All seven of his 3-point field goals were made during the final 7:41 of the third quarter.[98]
He finished the tournament ranked overall tied for 10th in scoring, tied for fourth in steals, fifth in 3-point percentage, tied for seventh in assists, and ninth in field goal percentage (.562). Iverson also missed the USA's final two games because of a sprained right thumb which was suffered in the first half of the August 28 Puerto Rico game. In a game against Puerto Rico, he recorded 9 points on 4-for-6 shooting from the field overall, and added five assists and three rebounds in 26 minutes of action in the USA's 101–74 exhibition game victory on August 17 in New York. He was also named to the 2003 USA Senior National Team on April 29, 2003.

Personal life




Iverson and rap star Nelly at a Reebok photoshoot.


During the 1997 offseason, Iverson and his friends were stopped by a police officer for speeding late at night and was arrested for carrying a concealed weapon and for possession of marijuana. He pleaded no contest and was sentenced to community service.[99]
During the 2000 offseason, Iverson recorded a rap single called "40 Bars". However, after being criticized for its controversial lyrics, he eventually was unable to release it. Going under his moniker, Jewelz, the album was alleged to have made derogatory remarks about homosexuals. After criticism from activist groups and NBA Commissioner David Stern, he agreed to change the lyrics, but ultimately never released the album.[100]
In August 2001, he married his high school sweetheart Tawanna at The Mansion on Main Street in Voorhees, New Jersey.[101] In 2002, Iverson was alleged to have thrown Tawanna out of their home after a domestic dispute and later threatening two men with a gun while looking for her. All charges against him were later dropped after the judge cited lack of evidence with contradictory statements from witnesses.[102]
On February 24, 2004, Iverson urinated in a trash can at Bally's Atlantic City casino and was told by casino management not to return.[103]
On December 9, 2005, after the Sixers defeated the Charlotte Bobcats, Iverson paid a late-night visit to the Trump Taj Mahal. After winning a hand at a three-card-stud poker table, Iverson was overpaid $10,000 in chips by a dealer. When the dealer quickly realized the mistake and requested the chips back, Iverson refused and a heated head-turning argument between him and casino staff began. Atlantic City casino regulations reportedly state that when a casino makes a payout mistake in favor of the gambler, he or she must return the money that they did not legitimately win by playing.[103]
Also in 2005, Iverson's bodyguard Jason Kane was accused of assaulting a man at a Washington, D. C. nightclub after the man, Marlin Godfrey, refused to leave the club's VIP section so Iverson's entourage could enter. Godfrey suffered a concussion, a ruptured eardrum, a burst blood vessel in his eye, a torn rotator cuff, cuts and bruises, and emotional distress. Although Iverson did not touch Godfrey himself, Godfrey sued Iverson for the injuries caused by his bodyguard. In 2007 a jury awarded Godfrey $260,000. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the verdict in 2009.[104]
On March 2, 2010, Iverson's wife filed for divorce, seeking custody of their five children, as well as child support and alimony payments.[101]
In August 2011, an Ohio man sued Iverson for $2.5 million in damages, claiming he was assaulted by Iverson's security guard in a 2009 bar fight in Detroit. The federal judge dismissed the case, finding no evidence that Iverson or his bodyguard struck the plaintiff, Guy Walker.[105]
On May 14, 2015, Iverson appeared on CBS This Morning in support of a Showtime Network documentary on his life, during which he addressed long-discussed rumors of financial struggles, denying any notion that he was struggling. "That's a myth. That's a rumor... The fact that I'm struggling in any part of my life", he said.[106]

Allen Ezail Iverson (born June 7, 1975) is an American former professional basketball player who played for 14 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played both the shooting guard and point guard positions. Iverson was an eleven-time NBA All-Star, won the All-Star game MVP award in 2001 and 2005, and was the NBA's Most Valuable Player (MVP) in 2001. Iverson is now the captain/coach of 3's Company in the BIG3.
Iverson attended Bethel High School in Hampton, Virginia, and was a dual-sport athlete. He earned the Associated Press High School Player of the Year award in both football and basketball, and won the Division AAA Virginia state championship in both sports.[1] After high school, Iverson attended Georgetown University for two years, where he set the school record for career scoring average (22.9 points per game) and won Big East Defensive Player of the Year awards both years.[2]
Following two successful years at Georgetown, Iverson declared eligibility for the 1996 NBA draft, and was selected by the Philadelphia 76ers with the first overall pick. He was named the NBA Rookie of the Year in the 1996–97 season. Winning the NBA scoring title during the 1998–99, 2000–01, 2001–02, and 2004–05 seasons, Iverson was one of the most prolific scorers in NBA history, despite his relatively small stature (listed at 6 feet, 0 inches). His regular season career scoring average of 26.7 points per game ranks seventh all-time, and his playoff career scoring average of 29.7 points per game is second only to Michael Jordan. Iverson was also the NBA Most Valuable Player of the 2000–01 season and led his team to the 2001 NBA Finals the same season. Iverson represented the United States at the 2004 Summer Olympics, winning the bronze medal. He also played for the Denver Nuggets, Detroit Pistons, and the Memphis Grizzlies, before ending his NBA career with the 76ers during the 2009–10 season.
Iverson was rated the fifth-greatest NBA shooting guard of all time by ESPN in 2008.[3] He officially announced his retirement from professional basketball on October 30, 2013.[4] On April 4, 2016, Iverson was elected into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.[5]

Early life
Allen Iverson was born on June 7, 1975[6] in Hampton, Virginia to a single 15-year-old mother, Ann Iverson, and was given his mother's maiden name after his father Allen Broughton left her.[7]
He attended Bethel High School, where he started as quarterback for the school football team,[8] while also playing running back, kick returner, and defensive back.[9] He also started as point guard for the school basketball team. During his junior year, Allen was able to lead both teams to Virginia state championships, as well as earning The Associated Press High School Player of the Year award in both sports.[10]
On February 14, 1993, Iverson and several of his friends were involved in an altercation with several patrons at a bowling alley in Hampton, Virginia.[11] Allegedly, Iverson's crowd was raucous and had to be asked to quiet down several times, and eventually a shouting duel began with another group of youths. Shortly thereafter, a huge fight erupted, pitting the white crowd against the black crowd. During the fight, Iverson allegedly struck a woman in the head with a chair. He, andthree of his friends ,who are also black, were the only people arrested. Iverson, who was 17 at the time, was convicted as an adult of the felony charge of maiming by mob, a rarely used Virginia statute that was designed to combat lynching.[12] Iverson and his supporters maintained his innocence, claiming that he left the alley as soon as the trouble began. Iverson said of the incident:

For me to be in a bowling alley where everybody in the whole place know who I am and be crackin' people upside the head with chairs and think nothin' gonna happen? That's crazy! And what kind of a man would I be to hit a girl in the head with a damn chair? I rather have 'em say I hit a man with a chair, not no damn woman.[12]

Iverson drew a 15-year prison sentence, with 10 years suspended. After Iverson spent four months at Newport News City Farm, a correctional facility in Newport News, he was granted clemency by Virginia Governor Douglas Wilder, and the Virginia Court of Appeals overturned the conviction in 1995 for insufficient evidence.[12] This incident and its impact on the community is explored in the documentary film No Crossover: The Trial of Allen Iverson. Iverson said of his time in prison:

I had to use the whole jail situation as something positive. Going to jail, someone sees something weak in you, they'll exploit it. I never showed any weakness. I just kept going strong until I came out.[12]

The prison sentence forced him to complete his senior year of high school at Richard Milburn High School, a school for at-risk students, instead of competing in sports at Bethel.[12] However, the three years Iverson spent there were enough to convince Georgetown University head coach John Thompson to come out and meet Iverson, and offer him a full scholarship to join the Georgetown Hoyas basketball team.[12]
College basketball
In his first season at Georgetown in 1994–95, Iverson won the Big East Rookie of the Year award and was named to the All Rookie Tournament First Team.[13] That season, Iverson led the Hoyas to the Sweet 16 round of the NCAA tournament, where they lost to North Carolina.[14]
In his second and final season at Georgetown in 1995–96, Iverson led the team to a Big East championship and all the way to the Elite 8 round of the NCAA tournament, where they lost to Massachusetts.[15] He ended his college career as the Hoyas' all-time leader in career scoring average, at 22.9 points per game.[2] Iverson was named as a First Team All American.
Following the conclusion of his sophomore year, Iverson declared for the 1996 NBA draft. He was the first player under Coach Thompson to leave Georgetown early for the NBA.[12]

Early years (1996–2000)




Iverson was selected first overall in 1996


After two seasons at Georgetown, Iverson was selected first overall by the Philadelphia 76ers in the 1996 NBA draft. Listed at 6 ft 0 in (1.83 m) tall, Iverson became the shortest first overall pick ever, in a league normally dominated by taller players.
Coming to a Philadelphia team that had just finished the previous season with a dismal 18-64 record, Iverson was only able to help the Sixers to a 22–60 record in 1996–97.[16] In a game against the 55-8 Chicago Bulls, Iverson scored 37 points and memorably crossed over Michael Jordan.[17] He broke Wilt Chamberlain's rookie record of three straight games with at least 40 points, doing so in five straight games, including a 50-point effort in Cleveland against the Cavaliers.[18][19] Averaging 23.5 points per game, 7.5 assists per game and 2.1 steals per game for the season, Iverson was named the NBA Rookie of the Year.
Aided by the arrivals of Theo Ratliff, Eric Snow, Aaron McKie, and new coach Larry Brown, Iverson continued to help the 76ers move forward the following season, as they improved nine games to finish 31-51.[20]
The lockout-shortened 1998–1999 season would mark great improvement for the 76ers. Iverson averaged 26.8 points (which led the league, earning his first scoring title) and was named to his first All NBA first team. The Sixers finished the season at 28-22, earning Iverson his first trip to the playoffs.[21] He started all ten playoff games and averaged 28.5 points per game despite being hampered by a number of nagging injuries. Iverson led the Sixers to an upset over the number three seeded Orlando Magic in four games, before losing to the Indiana Pacers in the second round in six games.[22]
Prior to the next season, Iverson signed a six-year, $70 million contract extension.[23] That year, the Sixers would continue to improve under Iverson's leadership, as they finished 49-33, once again qualifying for the playoffs (this time earning the fifth seed, one spot higher than the previous year's sixth seed).[24] In the playoffs, Iverson averaged 26.2 points, 4.8 assists, 4 rebounds and 1.3 steals per game. Philadelphia would advance past the Charlotte Hornets in the opening round, but was eliminated by Indiana in the second round in six games for the second straight year.[25]
That season, Iverson was selected to the Eastern Conference All-Star team for the first time of what would be 11 straight selections. He was the only player other than Shaquille O'Neal to receive a MVP vote that year. In the 2000 off-season, the 76ers actively tried to trade Iverson after his numerous disagreements with then-coach Larry Brown, and had agreed to terms with the Detroit Pistons before Matt Geiger, who was included in the deal, refused to forfeit his $5 million trade kicker.[26] When it became apparent that Iverson would remain a member of the Sixers, Iverson and Brown put their differences aside to make another attempt at a NBA championship.
MVP season and trip to the Finals (2000–01)




Iverson attempting a free throw against the Lakers


During the 2000–01 season, Iverson led his team to a franchise record 10-0 start to the season, and was named starter at the 2001 NBA All-Star Game, where he won the game MVP. The Sixers posted a 56–26 record on the year, the best in the Eastern Conference that season, earning the top seed. He also averaged a then-career high 31.1 points, winning his second NBA scoring title in the process. Iverson won the NBA steals title at 2.5 a game. Iverson was named NBA Most Valuable Player; at 6 feet and 165 pounds, he became the shortest and lightest player to win the MVP award. He had 93 first-place votes out of a possible 124.[27] He was also named to the All NBA First team for his accomplishments. In the playoffs, Iverson and the Sixers defeated the Indiana Pacers in the first round, before meeting Vince Carter-led Toronto Raptors in the Eastern Semifinals. The series went the full seven games. In the next round, the Sixers defeated the Milwaukee Bucks, also in seven games, to advance to the 2001 NBA Finals against the defending champion Los Angeles Lakers, featuring the duo of Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal.
Iverson led the Sixers to their first finals since their 1983 championship. In game one of the 2001 NBA Finals, Iverson scored a playoff high 48 points and beat the heavily favored Lakers 107–101; it was the Lakers' only playoff loss that year. In the game, he notably stepped over Tyronn Lue after hitting a crucial shot.[28] Iverson would go on to score 23, 35, 35, and 37 in games 2–5, all losing efforts though the Sixers were not swept like many predicted. Iverson enjoyed his most successful season as an individual and as a member of the Sixers during the 2000–01 NBA season.
Iverson began using a basketball sleeve during this season during his recovery from bursitis in his right elbow.[29] Other players, including Carmelo Anthony, and Kobe Bryant,[30] adopted the sleeves as well, as did fans who wore the sleeve as a fashion statement.[31] Iverson continued wearing his sleeve long after his elbow had healed.[30] Some believed that the sleeve improved Iverson's shooting ability. Steven Kotler of Psychology Today suggested that such sleeves may act as a placebo to prevent future injuries.[30]
Early playoff exits and Larry Brown's departure (2001–2003)




Iverson in 2003


Fresh off their trip to the NBA Finals, Iverson and the Sixers entered the 2001–2002 season with high expectations, but were plagued by injuries, and only able to muster a 43-39 record to just sneak into the playoffs.[32] Despite playing in only 60 games that season and being hampered by injuries, Iverson averaged 31.4 points per game to earn his second consecutive scoring title. The 76ers lost to the Boston Celtics in the first round of the playoffs 3-2 in the five game series. After the defeat, Brown criticized Iverson for missing team practices. Iverson responded by saying, "We're sitting here, I'm supposed to be the franchise player, and we're in here talking about practice,"[33] and went on a rant that included the word "practice" fourteen times.[34]
The 2002–2003 season started off poorly for the Sixers, who had just traded defensive-standout Dikembe Mutombo to New Jersey, and saw a decrease in both offensive and defensive production from Aaron McKie and Eric Snow, all three of whom were key components to their Finals appearance two years prior. Iverson would once again put up stellar scoring numbers (27.6 points per game) however, and the Sixers regrouped following the All-Star break to make the playoffs with a 48-34 record.[35] They were able to defeat Baron Davis and the New Orleans Hornets in the opening round of the playoffs. Iverson later described Davis as the most difficult opposing point guard to defend in his career.[36] In the six-game second round series, the 76ers were eliminated by the Detroit Pistons.
Head Coach Larry Brown left the 76ers in 2003, following the playoff loss. After his departure from the 76ers, both he and Iverson indicated that the two were on good terms and genuinely fond of one another.[37] Iverson later reunited with Brown when Iverson became the co-captain of the 2004 United States Olympic men's basketball team. In 2005, Iverson said that Brown was without a doubt "the best coach in the world".
Disappointment and frustration (2003–2006)
Randy Ayers became the next coach of the 76ers, but failed to develop any chemistry with his players, and was fired following a 21–31 start to the season. During the latter part of the 2003–04 NBA season, Iverson bristled under the disciplinarian approach of the Sixers' interim head coach Chris Ford. This led to a number of contentious incidents, including Iverson being suspended for missing practice, fined for failing to notify Ford that he would not attend a game because he was sick, and refusing to play in a game because he felt "insulted" that Ford wanted Iverson to come off the bench as he worked his way back from an injury.[38] Iverson missed a then-career-high 34 games in a disastrous season that saw the Sixers miss the postseason for the first time since the 1997 season.
The 2004–2005 season saw Iverson and the Sixers bounce back under the tutelage of new head coach Jim O'Brien, and additions of their first round draft pick Andre Iguodala, and All-Star forward Chris Webber, who was acquired in a mid-season trade. A rejuvenated Iverson won his fourth NBA scoring title with 31 points and averaged 8 assists for the year, and helped the 76ers climb back into the postseason with a 43-39 record.[39] They would go on to lose to the eventual Eastern Conference champion Detroit Pistons, who were led by Larry Brown, in the first round. In the series, Iverson had three double-doubles, including a 37-point, 15 assist performance in Philadelphia's lone win of the series.
Despite O'Brien helping the team back into the postseason, disagreements with players and management led to his firing after just one season. He was replaced by Sixers' legend Maurice Cheeks, in a personnel move Iverson praised, as Cheeks had been an assistant coach with the team when they reached the NBA Finals in 2001.[40] During the 2005–2006 season, Iverson averaged a career high 33.0 points per game. The Sixers, however, missed the playoffs for the second time in three years.
On April 18, 2006, Iverson and Chris Webber arrived late to the Sixers' fan appreciation night and home game finale. Players are expected to report 90 minutes before game time, but both Iverson and Webber arrived around tipoff. Coach Maurice Cheeks notified the media that neither would be playing and general manager Billy King announced that Iverson and Webber would be fined.[41] During the 2006 off-season, trade rumors had Iverson going to Denver, Atlanta, or Boston. None of the deals were completed. Iverson had made it clear that he would like to stay a Sixer.[42]
Iverson and the Sixers began the 2006–07 NBA season at 3-0 before stumbling out to a 5-10 record through 15 games.[43] Following the disappointing start, Iverson reportedly demanded a trade from the Sixers (although he would deny that).[44] As a result, Iverson was told he would not play in any more games. During the following game against the Washington Wizards, which was televised nationally on ESPN, Sixers Chairman Ed Snider confirmed the trade rumors by stating "We're going to trade him. At a certain point, you have to come to grips with the fact that it's not working. He wants out and we're ready to accommodate him."[45]
Iverson ended his 10-year Philadelphia tenure with the highest scoring average in team history (28.1), and is second all-time on the points list (19,583), and the Sixers did not win another playoff series after his departure until 2012.
Denver Nuggets (2006–2008)




Allen Iverson during his tenure with the Denver Nuggets


On December 19, 2006, the Philadelphia 76ers sent Iverson and forward Ivan McFarlin to the Denver Nuggets for Andre Miller, Joe Smith, and two first-round picks in the 2007 NBA draft. At the time of the trade, Iverson was the NBA's number two leading scorer with new teammate Carmelo Anthony being number one.[46]
On December 23, 2006, Iverson played his first game for the Nuggets. He had 22 points and 10 assists in a losing effort to the Sacramento Kings.[47] In Iverson's first year as a Nugget they made the playoffs. They won the first game and lost the next four to the San Antonio Spurs.[48]
Iverson was fined $25,000 by the NBA for criticizing referee Steve Javie following a game between the Nuggets and Iverson's former team, the Philadelphia 76ers, played January 2, 2007. During the course of the game, Iverson committed two technical fouls and was ejected from the game. After the game, Iverson said, "I thought I got fouled on that play, and I said I thought that he was calling the game personal I should have known that I couldn't say anything anyway. It's been something personal with me and him since I got in the league. This was just the perfect game for him to try and make me look bad."[49]
Former referee Tim Donaghy supported the claim that Javie had a longstanding hatred for Iverson in his book, Personal Foul: A First-Person Account of the Scandal that Rocked the NBA, which a Florida business group published through a self-publishing arm of Amazon.com[50] after it was dropped by a division of Random House, who cited liability issues after reviewing the manuscript.[51]
In a December 2009 interview with 60 Minutes, Donaghy said he and fellow referees thought the punishment was too light. Before Iverson's Nuggets played the Utah Jazz on January 6, 2007, Donaghy said he and the two other officials working the game agreed not to give Iverson favorable calls as a way to "teach him a lesson". Iverson attempted 12 free throws, more than any other player on either team. On 12 drives to the basket, he drew five fouls, three of which Donaghy whistled himself, and did not receive a call on one play in which he was obviously fouled by Utah's Mehmet Okur.[52]
Iverson returned to Philadelphia on March 19, 2008 to a sell-out crowd and received a standing ovation in a 115–113 loss.[53]
Detroit Pistons and Memphis Grizzlies (2008–2009)




Iverson, as a member of the Pistons


On November 3, 2008, Iverson was dealt from the Denver Nuggets to the Detroit Pistons for guard Chauncey Billups, forward Antonio McDyess and center Cheikh Samb.[54] Iverson, who had worn a #3 jersey his entire NBA career, switched to number 1 for the Pistons, which Billups previously wore for the team.
Iverson scored at least 24 in four of his first five games with Detroit (They won 3 of the 5),[55] and would score 20 or more and 6 or more assists on a consistent basis, but as the season wore on he would lose playing time to Rodney Stuckey. Some have speculated that Pistons President of Basketball Operations Joe Dumars did not envision a long-term role for Iverson on the team, but traded for him to make Stuckey the point guard of the future and free cap space with Iverson's expiring contract.[56]
On April 3, 2009, it was announced that Iverson would not play the remainder of the 2008–09 season. Dumars cited Iverson's ongoing back injury as the reason for his deactivation, although two days prior Iverson stated publicly that he'd rather retire than be moved to the bench as Pistons coach Michael Curry had decided.[57]
On September 10, 2009, Iverson signed a one-year contract with the Memphis Grizzlies.[58] Iverson stated that "God chose Memphis as the place that I will continue my career", and that "I feel that they are committed to developing a winner."[59]
However, Iverson again expressed his displeasure at being a bench player,[60] and left the team on November 7, 2009 for "personal reasons".[61] On November 16, the Grizzlies announced the team terminated his contract by "mutual agreement".[62] Iverson played three games for the Grizzlies, averaging 12.3 ppg, 1.3 rpg, and 3.7 apg in 22.3 mpg.
Return to the 76ers (2009–2010)




Iverson shoots a jump shot in 2010


On November 25, 2009, analyst Stephen A. Smith published on his blog a statement attributed to Iverson announcing plans for retirement, which also said, "I feel strongly that I can still compete at the highest level."[63]
Less than a week later on November 30, Iverson and his representatives met with a Philadelphia 76ers delegation about returning to his former team,[64] and accepted a contract offer two days later. General manager Ed Stefanski declined to go into the terms of the agreement, but an unnamed source told the Associated Press that Iverson agreed to a one-year non-guaranteed contract at the league minimum salary. Iverson would receive a prorated portion of the $1.3 million minimum salary for players with at least 10 years of experience, and the contract would become guaranteed for the remainder of the 2009–10 season if he remained on the roster on January 8, 2010.[65] Stefanski said the team made the decision to pursue Iverson after starting guard Louis Williams suffered a broken jaw and was expected to miss at least 30 games.[66]
On December 7, 2009, Iverson made his return to Philadelphia, garnering a thunderous ovation from the sold-out crowd, in a loss against his former team, the Denver Nuggets.[67] He finished the game with 11 points, 6 assists, 5 rebounds, a steal, and no turnovers.[68] Iverson's first win in his return to Philadelphia came one week later, in a 20-point effort against the Golden State Warriors, ending the Sixers' 12-game losing streak (which stood at 9 games before Iverson returned).[69] He shot 70 percent from the field in the game.[70]
On January 3, 2010, he returned to Denver to face the Nuggets; Iverson scored 17 points and had seven assists in the 108-105 win.[71] He was voted as a starter for the All-Star Game for the 11th straight season.[72] He scored a season-high 23 points (on 56% shooting from the field) in a 99-91 loss to Kobe Bryant and the defending champion Lakers.[73][74]
On February 22, 2010, Iverson left the 76ers indefinitely, citing the need to attend to his 4-year-old daughter Messiah's health issues, which he revealed years later as Kawasaki Disease.[75][76] On March 2, Ed Stefanski announced Iverson would not return to the 76ers for the rest of the season to deal with the personal matter.[77] His final NBA game was a loss against Derrick Rose and the Chicago Bulls on February 20, 2010.[78]
Beşiktaş (2010–2011)
On October 26, 2010, Yahoo! Sports reported that Iverson agreed in principle to a two-year, $4 million net income contract with Beşiktaş, a Turkish Super League team competing in the second-tier level of pan-European professional basketball, the EuroCup (the competition below the EuroLeague level).[79] The club announced the signing at a press conference in New York City, on October 29, 2010.[80] Wearing jersey #4,[81] Iverson made his debut for Beşiktaş on November 16, 2010, in a EuroCup 91-94 loss to Serbian side Hemofarm. Iverson scored 15 points in 23 minutes.[82]
Iverson returned to the United States in January 2011 for calf surgery.[83][84] He only played ten games for Beşiktaş that season, and did not play professional basketball after that.
Official retirement
In January 2013, Iverson received an offer to play for the Texas Legends of the NBA D-League, but he declined.[85]
On October 30, 2013, Iverson announced his retirement from basketball, citing he'd lost his desire to play.[86] At the 76ers 2013–14 season home opener that night, he received a standing ovation at the beginning of the second quarter. The retirement ceremony was attended by former Georgetown coach John Thompson and Sixers great Julius Erving.[87] Iverson said he would always be a Sixer "until I die", and that while he always thought the day he retired would be a "tough" day, he instead stated it was rather a "happy" day.[86]
In November 2013, the 76ers announced that they would officially retire Iverson's number 3 in a special halftime ceremony on March 1, 2014 when the Sixers hosted the Washington Wizards.[88][89] The ceremony took place in front of 20,000 spectators and 76ers greats such as Julius Erving, Moses Malone, and former team president Pat Croce.[90]
BIG3
In 2017, the creation of the 3-on-3 professional basketball league BIG3 was announced, with Iverson set to be a player and coach on 3's Company.[91] In March, it was announced that Iverson's co-captain would be DerMarr Johnson.[92] 3's Company drafted Andre Owens, Mike Sweetney, and Ruben Patterson during the 2017 BIG3 Draft.[93] On June 25, 3's Company played its first game of the inaugural BIG3 season against the Ball Hogs.[94] In the game, Iverson scored 2 points on 1-for-6 shooting in 9 minutes of play.[95] On only playing 9 minutes, Iverson stated, "I signed up to be a coach, player and captain. Coach part is going to go on throughout the game. Playing part is not going to be what you expect. You're not going to see the Allen Iverson of old out there."[94]
National team career




Iverson after a 2006 game with Barcelona


1995 World University Games
Iverson was a member of the USA World University Games Team in Japan in 1995, that included future NBA stars Ray Allen and Tim Duncan, among others. Iverson led all USA players in scoring, assists, and steals, averaging 16.7 points per game, 6.1 assists per game, and 2.9 steals per game. He helped lead the team to an undefeated record en route to a 141-81 victory over the host country, Japan, for the gold medal.[96]
2003 FIBA Americas championship
Iverson was selected to be part of Team USA for the 2003 FIBA Americas Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Puerto Rico in August of that year. USA had a perfect 10–0 record, and won the gold medal as well as qualifying for a berth in the 2004 Olympics. Iverson started all eight games that he played in, and was second on the team with 14.3 points per game, while also posting 3.8 assists per game, 2.5 rebounds per game, 1.6 steals per game, and shooting 56.2 percent (41–73 FGs) from the field, 53.6 percent (15–28 3pt FGs) from 3-point and 81.0 percent (17–21 FTs) from the foul line.[97]
In the USA's 111–71 victory over Canada on August 25, he accounted for a USA Olympic Qualifying single game record 28 points and made a single game record seven 3-pointers. Playing just 23 minutes, he shot 10-for-13 overall, 7-for-8 from the 3-point line, 1-for-1 from the foul line and added three assists, three steals, and one rebound. All seven of his 3-point field goals were made during the final 7:41 of the third quarter.[98]
He finished the tournament ranked overall tied for 10th in scoring, tied for fourth in steals, fifth in 3-point percentage, tied for seventh in assists, and ninth in field goal percentage (.562). Iverson also missed the USA's final two games because of a sprained right thumb which was suffered in the first half of the August 28 Puerto Rico game. In a game against Puerto Rico, he recorded 9 points on 4-for-6 shooting from the field overall, and added five assists and three rebounds in 26 minutes of action in the USA's 101–74 exhibition game victory on August 17 in New York. He was also named to the 2003 USA Senior National Team on April 29, 2003.

Personal life




Iverson and rap star Nelly at a Reebok photoshoot.


During the 1997 offseason, Iverson and his friends were stopped by a police officer for speeding late at night and was arrested for carrying a concealed weapon and for possession of marijuana. He pleaded no contest and was sentenced to community service.[99]
During the 2000 offseason, Iverson recorded a rap single called "40 Bars". However, after being criticized for its controversial lyrics, he eventually was unable to release it. Going under his moniker, Jewelz, the album was alleged to have made derogatory remarks about homosexuals. After criticism from activist groups and NBA Commissioner David Stern, he agreed to change the lyrics, but ultimately never released the album.[100]
In August 2001, he married his high school sweetheart Tawanna at The Mansion on Main Street in Voorhees, New Jersey.[101] In 2002, Iverson was alleged to have thrown Tawanna out of their home after a domestic dispute and later threatening two men with a gun while looking for her. All charges against him were later dropped after the judge cited lack of evidence with contradictory statements from witnesses.[102]
On February 24, 2004, Iverson urinated in a trash can at Bally's Atlantic City casino and was told by casino management not to return.[103]
On December 9, 2005, after the Sixers defeated the Charlotte Bobcats, Iverson paid a late-night visit to the Trump Taj Mahal. After winning a hand at a three-card-stud poker table, Iverson was overpaid $10,000 in chips by a dealer. When the dealer quickly realized the mistake and requested the chips back, Iverson refused and a heated head-turning argument between him and casino staff began. Atlantic City casino regulations reportedly state that when a casino makes a payout mistake in favor of the gambler, he or she must return the money that they did not legitimately win by playing.[103]
Also in 2005, Iverson's bodyguard Jason Kane was accused of assaulting a man at a Washington, D. C. nightclub after the man, Marlin Godfrey, refused to leave the club's VIP section so Iverson's entourage could enter. Godfrey suffered a concussion, a ruptured eardrum, a burst blood vessel in his eye, a torn rotator cuff, cuts and bruises, and emotional distress. Although Iverson did not touch Godfrey himself, Godfrey sued Iverson for the injuries caused by his bodyguard. In 2007 a jury awarded Godfrey $260,000. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the verdict in 2009.[104]
On March 2, 2010, Iverson's wife filed for divorce, seeking custody of their five children, as well as child support and alimony payments.[101]
In August 2011, an Ohio man sued Iverson for $2.5 million in damages, claiming he was assaulted by Iverson's security guard in a 2009 bar fight in Detroit. The federal judge dismissed the case, finding no evidence that Iverson or his bodyguard struck the plaintiff, Guy Walker.[105]
On May 14, 2015, Iverson appeared on CBS This Morning in support of a Showtime Network documentary on his life, during which he addressed long-discussed rumors of financial struggles, denying any notion that he was struggling. "That's a myth. That's a rumor... The fact that I'm struggling in any part of my life", he said.[106]

Allen Ezail Iverson (born June 7, 1975) is an American former professional basketball player who played for 14 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played both the shooting guard and point guard positions. Iverson was an eleven-time NBA All-Star, won the All-Star game MVP award in 2001 and 2005, and was the NBA's Most Valuable Player (MVP) in 2001. Iverson is now the captain/coach of 3's Company in the BIG3.
Iverson attended Bethel High School in Hampton, Virginia, and was a dual-sport athlete. He earned the Associated Press High School Player of the Year award in both football and basketball, and won the Division AAA Virginia state championship in both sports.[1] After high school, Iverson attended Georgetown University for two years, where he set the school record for career scoring average (22.9 points per game) and won Big East Defensive Player of the Year awards both years.[2]
Following two successful years at Georgetown, Iverson declared eligibility for the 1996 NBA draft, and was selected by the Philadelphia 76ers with the first overall pick. He was named the NBA Rookie of the Year in the 1996–97 season. Winning the NBA scoring title during the 1998–99, 2000–01, 2001–02, and 2004–05 seasons, Iverson was one of the most prolific scorers in NBA history, despite his relatively small stature (listed at 6 feet, 0 inches). His regular season career scoring average of 26.7 points per game ranks seventh all-time, and his playoff career scoring average of 29.7 points per game is second only to Michael Jordan. Iverson was also the NBA Most Valuable Player of the 2000–01 season and led his team to the 2001 NBA Finals the same season. Iverson represented the United States at the 2004 Summer Olympics, winning the bronze medal. He also played for the Denver Nuggets, Detroit Pistons, and the Memphis Grizzlies, before ending his NBA career with the 76ers during the 2009–10 season.
Iverson was rated the fifth-greatest NBA shooting guard of all time by ESPN in 2008.[3] He officially announced his retirement from professional basketball on October 30, 2013.[4] On April 4, 2016, Iverson was elected into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.[5]

Early life
Allen Iverson was born on June 7, 1975[6] in Hampton, Virginia to a single 15-year-old mother, Ann Iverson, and was given his mother's maiden name after his father Allen Broughton left her.[7]
He attended Bethel High School, where he started as quarterback for the school football team,[8] while also playing running back, kick returner, and defensive back.[9] He also started as point guard for the school basketball team. During his junior year, Allen was able to lead both teams to Virginia state championships, as well as earning The Associated Press High School Player of the Year award in both sports.[10]
On February 14, 1993, Iverson and several of his friends were involved in an altercation with several patrons at a bowling alley in Hampton, Virginia.[11] Allegedly, Iverson's crowd was raucous and had to be asked to quiet down several times, and eventually a shouting duel began with another group of youths. Shortly thereafter, a huge fight erupted, pitting the white crowd against the black crowd. During the fight, Iverson allegedly struck a woman in the head with a chair. He, andthree of his friends ,who are also black, were the only people arrested. Iverson, who was 17 at the time, was convicted as an adult of the felony charge of maiming by mob, a rarely used Virginia statute that was designed to combat lynching.[12] Iverson and his supporters maintained his innocence, claiming that he left the alley as soon as the trouble began. Iverson said of the incident:

For me to be in a bowling alley where everybody in the whole place know who I am and be crackin' people upside the head with chairs and think nothin' gonna happen? That's crazy! And what kind of a man would I be to hit a girl in the head with a damn chair? I rather have 'em say I hit a man with a chair, not no damn woman.[12]

Iverson drew a 15-year prison sentence, with 10 years suspended. After Iverson spent four months at Newport News City Farm, a correctional facility in Newport News, he was granted clemency by Virginia Governor Douglas Wilder, and the Virginia Court of Appeals overturned the conviction in 1995 for insufficient evidence.[12] This incident and its impact on the community is explored in the documentary film No Crossover: The Trial of Allen Iverson. Iverson said of his time in prison:

I had to use the whole jail situation as something positive. Going to jail, someone sees something weak in you, they'll exploit it. I never showed any weakness. I just kept going strong until I came out.[12]

The prison sentence forced him to complete his senior year of high school at Richard Milburn High School, a school for at-risk students, instead of competing in sports at Bethel.[12] However, the three years Iverson spent there were enough to convince Georgetown University head coach John Thompson to come out and meet Iverson, and offer him a full scholarship to join the Georgetown Hoyas basketball team.[12]
College basketball
In his first season at Georgetown in 1994–95, Iverson won the Big East Rookie of the Year award and was named to the All Rookie Tournament First Team.[13] That season, Iverson led the Hoyas to the Sweet 16 round of the NCAA tournament, where they lost to North Carolina.[14]
In his second and final season at Georgetown in 1995–96, Iverson led the team to a Big East championship and all the way to the Elite 8 round of the NCAA tournament, where they lost to Massachusetts.[15] He ended his college career as the Hoyas' all-time leader in career scoring average, at 22.9 points per game.[2] Iverson was named as a First Team All American.
Following the conclusion of his sophomore year, Iverson declared for the 1996 NBA draft. He was the first player under Coach Thompson to leave Georgetown early for the NBA.[12]

Professional career (1996–2011)

Early years (1996–2000)




Iverson was selected first overall in 1996


After two seasons at Georgetown, Iverson was selected first overall by the Philadelphia 76ers in the 1996 NBA draft. Listed at 6 ft 0 in (1.83 m) tall, Iverson became the shortest first overall pick ever, in a league normally dominated by taller players.
Coming to a Philadelphia team that had just finished the previous season with a dismal 18-64 record, Iverson was only able to help the Sixers to a 22–60 record in 1996–97.[16] In a game against the 55-8 Chicago Bulls, Iverson scored 37 points and memorably crossed over Michael Jordan.[17] He broke Wilt Chamberlain's rookie record of three straight games with at least 40 points, doing so in five straight games, including a 50-point effort in Cleveland against the Cavaliers.[18][19] Averaging 23.5 points per game, 7.5 assists per game and 2.1 steals per game for the season, Iverson was named the NBA Rookie of the Year.
Aided by the arrivals of Theo Ratliff, Eric Snow, Aaron McKie, and new coach Larry Brown, Iverson continued to help the 76ers move forward the following season, as they improved nine games to finish 31-51.[20]
The lockout-shortened 1998–1999 season would mark great improvement for the 76ers. Iverson averaged 26.8 points (which led the league, earning his first scoring title) and was named to his first All NBA first team. The Sixers finished the season at 28-22, earning Iverson his first trip to the playoffs.[21] He started all ten playoff games and averaged 28.5 points per game despite being hampered by a number of nagging injuries. Iverson led the Sixers to an upset over the number three seeded Orlando Magic in four games, before losing to the Indiana Pacers in the second round in six games.[22]
Prior to the next season, Iverson signed a six-year, $70 million contract extension.[23] That year, the Sixers would continue to improve under Iverson's leadership, as they finished 49-33, once again qualifying for the playoffs (this time earning the fifth seed, one spot higher than the previous year's sixth seed).[24] In the playoffs, Iverson averaged 26.2 points, 4.8 assists, 4 rebounds and 1.3 steals per game. Philadelphia would advance past the Charlotte Hornets in the opening round, but was eliminated by Indiana in the second round in six games for the second straight year.[25]
That season, Iverson was selected to the Eastern Conference All-Star team for the first time of what would be 11 straight selections. He was the only player other than Shaquille O'Neal to receive a MVP vote that year. In the 2000 off-season, the 76ers actively tried to trade Iverson after his numerous disagreements with then-coach Larry Brown, and had agreed to terms with the Detroit Pistons before Matt Geiger, who was included in the deal, refused to forfeit his $5 million trade kicker.[26] When it became apparent that Iverson would remain a member of the Sixers, Iverson and Brown put their differences aside to make another attempt at a NBA championship.
MVP season and trip to the Finals (2000–01)




Iverson attempting a free throw against the Lakers


During the 2000–01 season, Iverson led his team to a franchise record 10-0 start to the season, and was named starter at the 2001 NBA All-Star Game, where he won the game MVP. The Sixers posted a 56–26 record on the year, the best in the Eastern Conference that season, earning the top seed. He also averaged a then-career high 31.1 points, winning his second NBA scoring title in the process. Iverson won the NBA steals title at 2.5 a game. Iverson was named NBA Most Valuable Player; at 6 feet and 165 pounds, he became the shortest and lightest player to win the MVP award. He had 93 first-place votes out of a possible 124.[27] He was also named to the All NBA First team for his accomplishments. In the playoffs, Iverson and the Sixers defeated the Indiana Pacers in the first round, before meeting Vince Carter-led Toronto Raptors in the Eastern Semifinals. The series went the full seven games. In the next round, the Sixers defeated the Milwaukee Bucks, also in seven games, to advance to the 2001 NBA Finals against the defending champion Los Angeles Lakers, featuring the duo of Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal.
Iverson led the Sixers to their first finals since their 1983 championship. In game one of the 2001 NBA Finals, Iverson scored a playoff high 48 points and beat the heavily favored Lakers 107–101; it was the Lakers' only playoff loss that year. In the game, he notably stepped over Tyronn Lue after hitting a crucial shot.[28] Iverson would go on to score 23, 35, 35, and 37 in games 2–5, all losing efforts though the Sixers were not swept like many predicted. Iverson enjoyed his most successful season as an individual and as a member of the Sixers during the 2000–01 NBA season.
Iverson began using a basketball sleeve during this season during his recovery from bursitis in his right elbow.[29] Other players, including Carmelo Anthony, and Kobe Bryant,[30] adopted the sleeves as well, as did fans who wore the sleeve as a fashion statement.[31] Iverson continued wearing his sleeve long after his elbow had healed.[30] Some believed that the sleeve improved Iverson's shooting ability. Steven Kotler of Psychology Today suggested that such sleeves may act as a placebo to prevent future injuries.[30]
Early playoff exits and Larry Brown's departure (2001–2003)




Iverson in 2003


Fresh off their trip to the NBA Finals, Iverson and the Sixers entered the 2001–2002 season with high expectations, but were plagued by injuries, and only able to muster a 43-39 record to just sneak into the playoffs.[32] Despite playing in only 60 games that season and being hampered by injuries, Iverson averaged 31.4 points per game to earn his second consecutive scoring title. The 76ers lost to the Boston Celtics in the first round of the playoffs 3-2 in the five game series. After the defeat, Brown criticized Iverson for missing team practices. Iverson responded by saying, "We're sitting here, I'm supposed to be the franchise player, and we're in here talking about practice,"[33] and went on a rant that included the word "practice" fourteen times.[34]
The 2002–2003 season started off poorly for the Sixers, who had just traded defensive-standout Dikembe Mutombo to New Jersey, and saw a decrease in both offensive and defensive production from Aaron McKie and Eric Snow, all three of whom were key components to their Finals appearance two years prior. Iverson would once again put up stellar scoring numbers (27.6 points per game) however, and the Sixers regrouped following the All-Star break to make the playoffs with a 48-34 record.[35] They were able to defeat Baron Davis and the New Orleans Hornets in the opening round of the playoffs. Iverson later described Davis as the most difficult opposing point guard to defend in his career.[36] In the six-game second round series, the 76ers were eliminated by the Detroit Pistons.
Head Coach Larry Brown left the 76ers in 2003, following the playoff loss. After his departure from the 76ers, both he and Iverson indicated that the two were on good terms and genuinely fond of one another.[37] Iverson later reunited with Brown when Iverson became the co-captain of the 2004 United States Olympic men's basketball team. In 2005, Iverson said that Brown was without a doubt "the best coach in the world".
Disappointment and frustration (2003–2006)
Randy Ayers became the next coach of the 76ers, but failed to develop any chemistry with his players, and was fired following a 21–31 start to the season. During the latter part of the 2003–04 NBA season, Iverson bristled under the disciplinarian approach of the Sixers' interim head coach Chris Ford. This led to a number of contentious incidents, including Iverson being suspended for missing practice, fined for failing to notify Ford that he would not attend a game because he was sick, and refusing to play in a game because he felt "insulted" that Ford wanted Iverson to come off the bench as he worked his way back from an injury.[38] Iverson missed a then-career-high 34 games in a disastrous season that saw the Sixers miss the postseason for the first time since the 1997 season.
The 2004–2005 season saw Iverson and the Sixers bounce back under the tutelage of new head coach Jim O'Brien, and additions of their first round draft pick Andre Iguodala, and All-Star forward Chris Webber, who was acquired in a mid-season trade. A rejuvenated Iverson won his fourth NBA scoring title with 31 points and averaged 8 assists for the year, and helped the 76ers climb back into the postseason with a 43-39 record.[39] They would go on to lose to the eventual Eastern Conference champion Detroit Pistons, who were led by Larry Brown, in the first round. In the series, Iverson had three double-doubles, including a 37-point, 15 assist performance in Philadelphia's lone win of the series.
Despite O'Brien helping the team back into the postseason, disagreements with players and management led to his firing after just one season. He was replaced by Sixers' legend Maurice Cheeks, in a personnel move Iverson praised, as Cheeks had been an assistant coach with the team when they reached the NBA Finals in 2001.[40] During the 2005–2006 season, Iverson averaged a career high 33.0 points per game. The Sixers, however, missed the playoffs for the second time in three years.
On April 18, 2006, Iverson and Chris Webber arrived late to the Sixers' fan appreciation night and home game finale. Players are expected to report 90 minutes before game time, but both Iverson and Webber arrived around tipoff. Coach Maurice Cheeks notified the media that neither would be playing and general manager Billy King announced that Iverson and Webber would be fined.[41] During the 2006 off-season, trade rumors had Iverson going to Denver, Atlanta, or Boston. None of the deals were completed. Iverson had made it clear that he would like to stay a Sixer.[42]
Iverson and the Sixers began the 2006–07 NBA season at 3-0 before stumbling out to a 5-10 record through 15 games.[43] Following the disappointing start, Iverson reportedly demanded a trade from the Sixers (although he would deny that).[44] As a result, Iverson was told he would not play in any more games. During the following game against the Washington Wizards, which was televised nationally on ESPN, Sixers Chairman Ed Snider confirmed the trade rumors by stating "We're going to trade him. At a certain point, you have to come to grips with the fact that it's not working. He wants out and we're ready to accommodate him."[45]
Iverson ended his 10-year Philadelphia tenure with the highest scoring average in team history (28.1), and is second all-time on the points list (19,583), and the Sixers did not win another playoff series after his departure until 2012.
Denver Nuggets (2006–2008)




Allen Iverson during his tenure with the Denver Nuggets


On December 19, 2006, the Philadelphia 76ers sent Iverson and forward Ivan McFarlin to the Denver Nuggets for Andre Miller, Joe Smith, and two first-round picks in the 2007 NBA draft. At the time of the trade, Iverson was the NBA's number two leading scorer with new teammate Carmelo Anthony being number one.[46]
On December 23, 2006, Iverson played his first game for the Nuggets. He had 22 points and 10 assists in a losing effort to the Sacramento Kings.[47] In Iverson's first year as a Nugget they made the playoffs. They won the first game and lost the next four to the San Antonio Spurs.[48]
Iverson was fined $25,000 by the NBA for criticizing referee Steve Javie following a game between the Nuggets and Iverson's former team, the Philadelphia 76ers, played January 2, 2007. During the course of the game, Iverson committed two technical fouls and was ejected from the game. After the game, Iverson said, "I thought I got fouled on that play, and I said I thought that he was calling the game personal I should have known that I couldn't say anything anyway. It's been something personal with me and him since I got in the league. This was just the perfect game for him to try and make me look bad."[49]
Former referee Tim Donaghy supported the claim that Javie had a longstanding hatred for Iverson in his book, Personal Foul: A First-Person Account of the Scandal that Rocked the NBA, which a Florida business group published through a self-publishing arm of Amazon.com[50] after it was dropped by a division of Random House, who cited liability issues after reviewing the manuscript.[51]
In a December 2009 interview with 60 Minutes, Donaghy said he and fellow referees thought the punishment was too light. Before Iverson's Nuggets played the Utah Jazz on January 6, 2007, Donaghy said he and the two other officials working the game agreed not to give Iverson favorable calls as a way to "teach him a lesson". Iverson attempted 12 free throws, more than any other player on either team. On 12 drives to the basket, he drew five fouls, three of which Donaghy whistled himself, and did not receive a call on one play in which he was obviously fouled by Utah's Mehmet Okur.[52]
Iverson returned to Philadelphia on March 19, 2008 to a sell-out crowd and received a standing ovation in a 115–113 loss.[53]
Detroit Pistons and Memphis Grizzlies (2008–2009)




Iverson, as a member of the Pistons


On November 3, 2008, Iverson was dealt from the Denver Nuggets to the Detroit Pistons for guard Chauncey Billups, forward Antonio McDyess and center Cheikh Samb.[54] Iverson, who had worn a #3 jersey his entire NBA career, switched to number 1 for the Pistons, which Billups previously wore for the team.
Iverson scored at least 24 in four of his first five games with Detroit (They won 3 of the 5),[55] and would score 20 or more and 6 or more assists on a consistent basis, but as the season wore on he would lose playing time to Rodney Stuckey. Some have speculated that Pistons President of Basketball Operations Joe Dumars did not envision a long-term role for Iverson on the team, but traded for him to make Stuckey the point guard of the future and free cap space with Iverson's expiring contract.[56]
On April 3, 2009, it was announced that Iverson would not play the remainder of the 2008–09 season. Dumars cited Iverson's ongoing back injury as the reason for his deactivation, although two days prior Iverson stated publicly that he'd rather retire than be moved to the bench as Pistons coach Michael Curry had decided.[57]
On September 10, 2009, Iverson signed a one-year contract with the Memphis Grizzlies.[58] Iverson stated that "God chose Memphis as the place that I will continue my career", and that "I feel that they are committed to developing a winner."[59]
However, Iverson again expressed his displeasure at being a bench player,[60] and left the team on November 7, 2009 for "personal reasons".[61] On November 16, the Grizzlies announced the team terminated his contract by "mutual agreement".[62] Iverson played three games for the Grizzlies, averaging 12.3 ppg, 1.3 rpg, and 3.7 apg in 22.3 mpg.
Return to the 76ers (2009–2010)




Iverson shoots a jump shot in 2010


On November 25, 2009, analyst Stephen A. Smith published on his blog a statement attributed to Iverson announcing plans for retirement, which also said, "I feel strongly that I can still compete at the highest level."[63]
Less than a week later on November 30, Iverson and his representatives met with a Philadelphia 76ers delegation about returning to his former team,[64] and accepted a contract offer two days later. General manager Ed Stefanski declined to go into the terms of the agreement, but an unnamed source told the Associated Press that Iverson agreed to a one-year non-guaranteed contract at the league minimum salary. Iverson would receive a prorated portion of the $1.3 million minimum salary for players with at least 10 years of experience, and the contract would become guaranteed for the remainder of the 2009–10 season if he remained on the roster on January 8, 2010.[65] Stefanski said the team made the decision to pursue Iverson after starting guard Louis Williams suffered a broken jaw and was expected to miss at least 30 games.[66]
On December 7, 2009, Iverson made his return to Philadelphia, garnering a thunderous ovation from the sold-out crowd, in a loss against his former team, the Denver Nuggets.[67] He finished the game with 11 points, 6 assists, 5 rebounds, a steal, and no turnovers.[68] Iverson's first win in his return to Philadelphia came one week later, in a 20-point effort against the Golden State Warriors, ending the Sixers' 12-game losing streak (which stood at 9 games before Iverson returned).[69] He shot 70 percent from the field in the game.[70]
On January 3, 2010, he returned to Denver to face the Nuggets; Iverson scored 17 points and had seven assists in the 108-105 win.[71] He was voted as a starter for the All-Star Game for the 11th straight season.[72] He scored a season-high 23 points (on 56% shooting from the field) in a 99-91 loss to Kobe Bryant and the defending champion Lakers.[73][74]
On February 22, 2010, Iverson left the 76ers indefinitely, citing the need to attend to his 4-year-old daughter Messiah's health issues, which he revealed years later as Kawasaki Disease.[75][76] On March 2, Ed Stefanski announced Iverson would not return to the 76ers for the rest of the season to deal with the personal matter.[77] His final NBA game was a loss against Derrick Rose and the Chicago Bulls on February 20, 2010.[78]
Beşiktaş (2010–2011)
On October 26, 2010, Yahoo! Sports reported that Iverson agreed in principle to a two-year, $4 million net income contract with Beşiktaş, a Turkish Super League team competing in the second-tier level of pan-European professional basketball, the EuroCup (the competition below the EuroLeague level).[79] The club announced the signing at a press conference in New York City, on October 29, 2010.[80] Wearing jersey #4,[81] Iverson made his debut for Beşiktaş on November 16, 2010, in a EuroCup 91-94 loss to Serbian side Hemofarm. Iverson scored 15 points in 23 minutes.[82]
Iverson returned to the United States in January 2011 for calf surgery.[83][84] He only played ten games for Beşiktaş that season, and did not play professional basketball after that.
Official retirement
In January 2013, Iverson received an offer to play for the Texas Legends of the NBA D-League, but he declined.[85]
On October 30, 2013, Iverson announced his retirement from basketball, citing he'd lost his desire to play.[86] At the 76ers 2013–14 season home opener that night, he received a standing ovation at the beginning of the second quarter. The retirement ceremony was attended by former Georgetown coach John Thompson and Sixers great Julius Erving.[87] Iverson said he would always be a Sixer "until I die", and that while he always thought the day he retired would be a "tough" day, he instead stated it was rather a "happy" day.[86]
In November 2013, the 76ers announced that they would officially retire Iverson's number 3 in a special halftime ceremony on March 1, 2014 when the Sixers hosted the Washington Wizards.[88][89] The ceremony took place in front of 20,000 spectators and 76ers greats such as Julius Erving, Moses Malone, and former team president Pat Croce.[90]
BIG3
In 2017, the creation of the 3-on-3 professional basketball league BIG3 was announced, with Iverson set to be a player and coach on 3's Company.[91] In March, it was announced that Iverson's co-captain would be DerMarr Johnson.[92] 3's Company drafted Andre Owens, Mike Sweetney, and Ruben Patterson during the 2017 BIG3 Draft.[93] On June 25, 3's Company played its first game of the inaugural BIG3 season against the Ball Hogs.[94] In the game, Iverson scored 2 points on 1-for-6 shooting in 9 minutes of play.[95] On only playing 9 minutes, Iverson stated, "I signed up to be a coach, player and captain. Coach part is going to go on throughout the game. Playing part is not going to be what you expect. You're not going to see the Allen Iverson of old out there."[94]
National team career

1995 World University Games
Iverson was a member of the USA World University Games Team in Japan in 1995, that included future NBA stars Ray Allen and Tim Duncan, among others. Iverson led all USA players in scoring, assists, and steals, averaging 16.7 points per game, 6.1 assists per game, and 2.9 steals per game. He helped lead the team to an undefeated record en route to a 141-81 victory over the host country, Japan, for the gold medal.[96]
2003 FIBA Americas championship
Iverson was selected to be part of Team USA for the 2003 FIBA Americas Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Puerto Rico in August of that year. USA had a perfect 10–0 record, and won the gold medal as well as qualifying for a berth in the 2004 Olympics. Iverson started all eight games that he played in, and was second on the team with 14.3 points per game, while also posting 3.8 assists per game, 2.5 rebounds per game, 1.6 steals per game, and shooting 56.2 percent (41–73 FGs) from the field, 53.6 percent (15–28 3pt FGs) from 3-point and 81.0 percent (17–21 FTs) from the foul line.[97]
In the USA's 111–71 victory over Canada on August 25, he accounted for a USA Olympic Qualifying single game record 28 points and made a single game record seven 3-pointers. Playing just 23 minutes, he shot 10-for-13 overall, 7-for-8 from the 3-point line, 1-for-1 from the foul line and added three assists, three steals, and one rebound. All seven of his 3-point field goals were made during the final 7:41 of the third quarter.[98]
He finished the tournament ranked overall tied for 10th in scoring, tied for fourth in steals, fifth in 3-point percentage, tied for seventh in assists, and ninth in field goal percentage (.562). Iverson also missed the USA's final two games because of a sprained right thumb which was suffered in the first half of the August 28 Puerto Rico game. In a game against Puerto Rico, he recorded 9 points on 4-for-6 shooting from the field overall, and added five assists and three rebounds in 26 minutes of action in the USA's 101–74 exhibition game victory on August 17 in New York. He was also named to the 2003 USA Senior National Team on April 29, 2003.

Personal life




Iverson and rap star Nelly at a Reebok photoshoot.


During the 1997 offseason, Iverson and his friends were stopped by a police officer for speeding late at night and was arrested for carrying a concealed weapon and for possession of marijuana. He pleaded no contest and was sentenced to community service.[99]
During the 2000 offseason, Iverson recorded a rap single called "40 Bars". However, after being criticized for its controversial lyrics, he eventually was unable to release it. Going under his moniker, Jewelz, the album was alleged to have made derogatory remarks about homosexuals. After criticism from activist groups and NBA Commissioner David Stern, he agreed to change the lyrics, but ultimately never released the album.[100]
In August 2001, he married his high school sweetheart Tawanna at The Mansion on Main Street in Voorhees, New Jersey.[101] In 2002, Iverson was alleged to have thrown Tawanna out of their home after a domestic dispute and later threatening two men with a gun while looking for her. All charges against him were later dropped after the judge cited lack of evidence with contradictory statements from witnesses.[102]
On February 24, 2004, Iverson urinated in a trash can at Bally's Atlantic City casino and was told by casino management not to return.[103]
On December 9, 2005, after the Sixers defeated the Charlotte Bobcats, Iverson paid a late-night visit to the Trump Taj Mahal. After winning a hand at a three-card-stud poker table, Iverson was overpaid $10,000 in chips by a dealer. When the dealer quickly realized the mistake and requested the chips back, Iverson refused and a heated head-turning argument between him and casino staff began. Atlantic City casino regulations reportedly state that when a casino makes a payout mistake in favor of the gambler, he or she must return the money that they did not legitimately win by playing.[103]
Also in 2005, Iverson's bodyguard Jason Kane was accused of assaulting a man at a Washington, D. C. nightclub after the man, Marlin Godfrey, refused to leave the club's VIP section so Iverson's entourage could enter. Godfrey suffered a concussion, a ruptured eardrum, a burst blood vessel in his eye, a torn rotator cuff, cuts and bruises, and emotional distress. Although Iverson did not touch Godfrey himself, Godfrey sued Iverson for the injuries caused by his bodyguard. In 2007 a jury awarded Godfrey $260,000. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the verdict in 2009.[104]
On March 2, 2010, Iverson's wife filed for divorce, seeking custody of their five children, as well as child support and alimony payments.[101]
In August 2011, an Ohio man sued Iverson for $2.5 million in damages, claiming he was assaulted by Iverson's security guard in a 2009 bar fight in Detroit. The federal judge dismissed the case, finding no evidence that Iverson or his bodyguard struck the plaintiff, Guy Walker.[105]
On May 14, 2015, Iverson appeared on CBS This Morning in support of a Showtime Network documentary on his life, during which he addressed long-discussed rumors of financial struggles, denying any notion that he was struggling. "That's a myth. That's a rumor... The fact that I'm struggling in any part of my life", he said.[106]

Allen Ezail Iverson (born June 7, 1975) is an American former professional basketball player who played for 14 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played both the shooting guard and point guard positions. Iverson was an eleven-time NBA All-Star, won the All-Star game MVP award in 2001 and 2005, and was the NBA's Most Valuable Player (MVP) in 2001. Iverson is now the captain/coach of 3's Company in the BIG3.
Iverson attended Bethel High School in Hampton, Virginia, and was a dual-sport athlete. He earned the Associated Press High School Player of the Year award in both football and basketball, and won the Division AAA Virginia state championship in both sports.[1] After high school, Iverson attended Georgetown University for two years, where he set the school record for career scoring average (22.9 points per game) and won Big East Defensive Player of the Year awards both years.[2]
Following two successful years at Georgetown, Iverson declared eligibility for the 1996 NBA draft, and was selected by the Philadelphia 76ers with the first overall pick. He was named the NBA Rookie of the Year in the 1996–97 season. Winning the NBA scoring title during the 1998–99, 2000–01, 2001–02, and 2004–05 seasons, Iverson was one of the most prolific scorers in NBA history, despite his relatively small stature (listed at 6 feet, 0 inches). His regular season career scoring average of 26.7 points per game ranks seventh all-time, and his playoff career scoring average of 29.7 points per game is second only to Michael Jordan. Iverson was also the NBA Most Valuable Player of the 2000–01 season and led his team to the 2001 NBA Finals the same season. Iverson represented the United States at the 2004 Summer Olympics, winning the bronze medal. He also played for the Denver Nuggets, Detroit Pistons, and the Memphis Grizzlies, before ending his NBA career with the 76ers during the 2009–10 season.
Iverson was rated the fifth-greatest NBA shooting guard of all time by ESPN in 2008.[3] He officially announced his retirement from professional basketball on October 30, 2013.[4] On April 4, 2016, Iverson was elected into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.[5]

Early life
Allen Iverson was born on June 7, 1975[6] in Hampton, Virginia to a single 15-year-old mother, Ann Iverson, and was given his mother's maiden name after his father Allen Broughton left her.[7]
He attended Bethel High School, where he started as quarterback for the school football team,[8] while also playing running back, kick returner, and defensive back.[9] He also started as point guard for the school basketball team. During his junior year, Allen was able to lead both teams to Virginia state championships, as well as earning The Associated Press High School Player of the Year award in both sports.[10]
On February 14, 1993, Iverson and several of his friends were involved in an altercation with several patrons at a bowling alley in Hampton, Virginia.[11] Allegedly, Iverson's crowd was raucous and had to be asked to quiet down several times, and eventually a shouting duel began with another group of youths. Shortly thereafter, a huge fight erupted, pitting the white crowd against the black crowd. During the fight, Iverson allegedly struck a woman in the head with a chair. He, andthree of his friends ,who are also black, were the only people arrested. Iverson, who was 17 at the time, was convicted as an adult of the felony charge of maiming by mob, a rarely used Virginia statute that was designed to combat lynching.[12] Iverson and his supporters maintained his innocence, claiming that he left the alley as soon as the trouble began. Iverson said of the incident:

For me to be in a bowling alley where everybody in the whole place know who I am and be crackin' people upside the head with chairs and think nothin' gonna happen? That's crazy! And what kind of a man would I be to hit a girl in the head with a damn chair? I rather have 'em say I hit a man with a chair, not no damn woman.[12]

Iverson drew a 15-year prison sentence, with 10 years suspended. After Iverson spent four months at Newport News City Farm, a correctional facility in Newport News, he was granted clemency by Virginia Governor Douglas Wilder, and the Virginia Court of Appeals overturned the conviction in 1995 for insufficient evidence.[12] This incident and its impact on the community is explored in the documentary film No Crossover: The Trial of Allen Iverson. Iverson said of his time in prison:

I had to use the whole jail situation as something positive. Going to jail, someone sees something weak in you, they'll exploit it. I never showed any weakness. I just kept going strong until I came out.[12]

The prison sentence forced him to complete his senior year of high school at Richard Milburn High School, a school for at-risk students, instead of competing in sports at Bethel.[12] However, the three years Iverson spent there were enough to convince Georgetown University head coach John Thompson to come out and meet Iverson, and offer him a full scholarship to join the Georgetown Hoyas basketball team.[12]
College basketball
In his first season at Georgetown in 1994–95, Iverson won the Big East Rookie of the Year award and was named to the All Rookie Tournament First Team.[13] That season, Iverson led the Hoyas to the Sweet 16 round of the NCAA tournament, where they lost to North Carolina.[14]
In his second and final season at Georgetown in 1995–96, Iverson led the team to a Big East championship and all the way to the Elite 8 round of the NCAA tournament, where they lost to Massachusetts.[15] He ended his college career as the Hoyas' all-time leader in career scoring average, at 22.9 points per game.[2] Iverson was named as a First Team All American.
Following the conclusion of his sophomore year, Iverson declared for the 1996 NBA draft. He was the first player under Coach Thompson to leave Georgetown early for the NBA.[12]

Iverson was selected first overall in 1996


After two seasons at Georgetown, Iverson was selected first overall by the Philadelphia 76ers in the 1996 NBA draft. Listed at 6 ft 0 in (1.83 m) tall, Iverson became the shortest first overall pick ever, in a league normally dominated by taller players.
Coming to a Philadelphia team that had just finished the previous season with a dismal 18-64 record, Iverson was only able to help the Sixers to a 22–60 record in 1996–97.[16] In a game against the 55-8 Chicago Bulls, Iverson scored 37 points and memorably crossed over Michael Jordan.[17] He broke Wilt Chamberlain's rookie record of three straight games with at least 40 points, doing so in five straight games, including a 50-point effort in Cleveland against the Cavaliers.[18][19] Averaging 23.5 points per game, 7.5 assists per game and 2.1 steals per game for the season, Iverson was named the NBA Rookie of the Year.
Aided by the arrivals of Theo Ratliff, Eric Snow, Aaron McKie, and new coach Larry Brown, Iverson continued to help the 76ers move forward the following season, as they improved nine games to finish 31-51.[20]
The lockout-shortened 1998–1999 season would mark great improvement for the 76ers. Iverson averaged 26.8 points (which led the league, earning his first scoring title) and was named to his first All NBA first team. The Sixers finished the season at 28-22, earning Iverson his first trip to the playoffs.[21] He started all ten playoff games and averaged 28.5 points per game despite being hampered by a number of nagging injuries. Iverson led the Sixers to an upset over the number three seeded Orlando Magic in four games, before losing to the Indiana Pacers in the second round in six games.[22]
Prior to the next season, Iverson signed a six-year, $70 million contract extension.[23] That year, the Sixers would continue to improve under Iverson's leadership, as they finished 49-33, once again qualifying for the playoffs (this time earning the fifth seed, one spot higher than the previous year's sixth seed).[24] In the playoffs, Iverson averaged 26.2 points, 4.8 assists, 4 rebounds and 1.3 steals per game. Philadelphia would advance past the Charlotte Hornets in the opening round, but was eliminated by Indiana in the second round in six games for the second straight year.[25]
That season, Iverson was selected to the Eastern Conference All-Star team for the first time of what would be 11 straight selections. He was the only player other than Shaquille O'Neal to receive a MVP vote that year. In the 2000 off-season, the 76ers actively tried to trade Iverson after his numerous disagreements with then-coach Larry Brown, and had agreed to terms with the Detroit Pistons before Matt Geiger, who was included in the deal, refused to forfeit his $5 million trade kicker.[26] When it became apparent that Iverson would remain a member of the Sixers, Iverson and Brown put their differences aside to make another attempt at a NBA championship.
MVP season and trip to the Finals (2000–01)




Iverson attempting a free throw against the Lakers


During the 2000–01 season, Iverson led his team to a franchise record 10-0 start to the season, and was named starter at the 2001 NBA All-Star Game, where he won the game MVP. The Sixers posted a 56–26 record on the year, the best in the Eastern Conference that season, earning the top seed. He also averaged a then-career high 31.1 points, winning his second NBA scoring title in the process. Iverson won the NBA steals title at 2.5 a game. Iverson was named NBA Most Valuable Player; at 6 feet and 165 pounds, he became the shortest and lightest player to win the MVP award. He had 93 first-place votes out of a possible 124.[27] He was also named to the All NBA First team for his accomplishments. In the playoffs, Iverson and the Sixers defeated the Indiana Pacers in the first round, before meeting Vince Carter-led Toronto Raptors in the Eastern Semifinals. The series went the full seven games. In the next round, the Sixers defeated the Milwaukee Bucks, also in seven games, to advance to the 2001 NBA Finals against the defending champion Los Angeles Lakers, featuring the duo of Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal.
Iverson led the Sixers to their first finals since their 1983 championship. In game one of the 2001 NBA Finals, Iverson scored a playoff high 48 points and beat the heavily favored Lakers 107–101; it was the Lakers' only playoff loss that year. In the game, he notably stepped over Tyronn Lue after hitting a crucial shot.[28] Iverson would go on to score 23, 35, 35, and 37 in games 2–5, all losing efforts though the Sixers were not swept like many predicted. Iverson enjoyed his most successful season as an individual and as a member of the Sixers during the 2000–01 NBA season.
Iverson began using a basketball sleeve during this season during his recovery from bursitis in his right elbow.[29] Other players, including Carmelo Anthony, and Kobe Bryant,[30] adopted the sleeves as well, as did fans who wore the sleeve as a fashion statement.[31] Iverson continued wearing his sleeve long after his elbow had healed.[30] Some believed that the sleeve improved Iverson's shooting ability. Steven Kotler of Psychology Today suggested that such sleeves may act as a placebo to prevent future injuries.[30]
Early playoff exits and Larry Brown's departure (2001–2003)




Iverson in 2003


Fresh off their trip to the NBA Finals, Iverson and the Sixers entered the 2001–2002 season with high expectations, but were plagued by injuries, and only able to muster a 43-39 record to just sneak into the playoffs.[32] Despite playing in only 60 games that season and being hampered by injuries, Iverson averaged 31.4 points per game to earn his second consecutive scoring title. The 76ers lost to the Boston Celtics in the first round of the playoffs 3-2 in the five game series. After the defeat, Brown criticized Iverson for missing team practices. Iverson responded by saying, "We're sitting here, I'm supposed to be the franchise player, and we're in here talking about practice,"[33] and went on a rant that included the word "practice" fourteen times.[34]
The 2002–2003 season started off poorly for the Sixers, who had just traded defensive-standout Dikembe Mutombo to New Jersey, and saw a decrease in both offensive and defensive production from Aaron McKie and Eric Snow, all three of whom were key components to their Finals appearance two years prior. Iverson would once again put up stellar scoring numbers (27.6 points per game) however, and the Sixers regrouped following the All-Star break to make the playoffs with a 48-34 record.[35] They were able to defeat Baron Davis and the New Orleans Hornets in the opening round of the playoffs. Iverson later described Davis as the most difficult opposing point guard to defend in his career.[36] In the six-game second round series, the 76ers were eliminated by the Detroit Pistons.
Head Coach Larry Brown left the 76ers in 2003, following the playoff loss. After his departure from the 76ers, both he and Iverson indicated that the two were on good terms and genuinely fond of one another.[37] Iverson later reunited with Brown when Iverson became the co-captain of the 2004 United States Olympic men's basketball team. In 2005, Iverson said that Brown was without a doubt "the best coach in the world".
Disappointment and frustration (2003–2006)
Randy Ayers became the next coach of the 76ers, but failed to develop any chemistry with his players, and was fired following a 21–31 start to the season. During the latter part of the 2003–04 NBA season, Iverson bristled under the disciplinarian approach of the Sixers' interim head coach Chris Ford. This led to a number of contentious incidents, including Iverson being suspended for missing practice, fined for failing to notify Ford that he would not attend a game because he was sick, and refusing to play in a game because he felt "insulted" that Ford wanted Iverson to come off the bench as he worked his way back from an injury.[38] Iverson missed a then-career-high 34 games in a disastrous season that saw the Sixers miss the postseason for the first time since the 1997 season.
The 2004–2005 season saw Iverson and the Sixers bounce back under the tutelage of new head coach Jim O'Brien, and additions of their first round draft pick Andre Iguodala, and All-Star forward Chris Webber, who was acquired in a mid-season trade. A rejuvenated Iverson won his fourth NBA scoring title with 31 points and averaged 8 assists for the year, and helped the 76ers climb back into the postseason with a 43-39 record.[39] They would go on to lose to the eventual Eastern Conference champion Detroit Pistons, who were led by Larry Brown, in the first round. In the series, Iverson had three double-doubles, including a 37-point, 15 assist performance in Philadelphia's lone win of the series.
Despite O'Brien helping the team back into the postseason, disagreements with players and management led to his firing after just one season. He was replaced by Sixers' legend Maurice Cheeks, in a personnel move Iverson praised, as Cheeks had been an assistant coach with the team when they reached the NBA Finals in 2001.[40] During the 2005–2006 season, Iverson averaged a career high 33.0 points per game. The Sixers, however, missed the playoffs for the second time in three years.
On April 18, 2006, Iverson and Chris Webber arrived late to the Sixers' fan appreciation night and home game finale. Players are expected to report 90 minutes before game time, but both Iverson and Webber arrived around tipoff. Coach Maurice Cheeks notified the media that neither would be playing and general manager Billy King announced that Iverson and Webber would be fined.[41] During the 2006 off-season, trade rumors had Iverson going to Denver, Atlanta, or Boston. None of the deals were completed. Iverson had made it clear that he would like to stay a Sixer.[42]
Iverson and the Sixers began the 2006–07 NBA season at 3-0 before stumbling out to a 5-10 record through 15 games.[43] Following the disappointing start, Iverson reportedly demanded a trade from the Sixers (although he would deny that).[44] As a result, Iverson was told he would not play in any more games. During the following game against the Washington Wizards, which was televised nationally on ESPN, Sixers Chairman Ed Snider confirmed the trade rumors by stating "We're going to trade him. At a certain point, you have to come to grips with the fact that it's not working. He wants out and we're ready to accommodate him."[45]
Iverson ended his 10-year Philadelphia tenure with the highest scoring average in team history (28.1), and is second all-time on the points list (19,583), and the Sixers did not win another playoff series after his departure until 2012.
Denver Nuggets (2006–2008)




Allen Iverson during his tenure with the Denver Nuggets


On December 19, 2006, the Philadelphia 76ers sent Iverson and forward Ivan McFarlin to the Denver Nuggets for Andre Miller, Joe Smith, and two first-round picks in the 2007 NBA draft. At the time of the trade, Iverson was the NBA's number two leading scorer with new teammate Carmelo Anthony being number one.[46]
On December 23, 2006, Iverson played his first game for the Nuggets. He had 22 points and 10 assists in a losing effort to the Sacramento Kings.[47] In Iverson's first year as a Nugget they made the playoffs. They won the first game and lost the next four to the San Antonio Spurs.[48]
Iverson was fined $25,000 by the NBA for criticizing referee Steve Javie following a game between the Nuggets and Iverson's former team, the Philadelphia 76ers, played January 2, 2007. During the course of the game, Iverson committed two technical fouls and was ejected from the game. After the game, Iverson said, "I thought I got fouled on that play, and I said I thought that he was calling the game personal I should have known that I couldn't say anything anyway. It's been something personal with me and him since I got in the league. This was just the perfect game for him to try and make me look bad."[49]
Former referee Tim Donaghy supported the claim that Javie had a longstanding hatred for Iverson in his book, Personal Foul: A First-Person Account of the Scandal that Rocked the NBA, which a Florida business group published through a self-publishing arm of Amazon.com[50] after it was dropped by a division of Random House, who cited liability issues after reviewing the manuscript.[51]
In a December 2009 interview with 60 Minutes, Donaghy said he and fellow referees thought the punishment was too light. Before Iverson's Nuggets played the Utah Jazz on January 6, 2007, Donaghy said he and the two other officials working the game agreed not to give Iverson favorable calls as a way to "teach him a lesson". Iverson attempted 12 free throws, more than any other player on either team. On 12 drives to the basket, he drew five fouls, three of which Donaghy whistled himself, and did not receive a call on one play in which he was obviously fouled by Utah's Mehmet Okur.[52]
Iverson returned to Philadelphia on March 19, 2008 to a sell-out crowd and received a standing ovation in a 115–113 loss.[53]
Detroit Pistons and Memphis Grizzlies (2008–2009)




Iverson, as a member of the Pistons


On November 3, 2008, Iverson was dealt from the Denver Nuggets to the Detroit Pistons for guard Chauncey Billups, forward Antonio McDyess and center Cheikh Samb.[54] Iverson, who had worn a #3 jersey his entire NBA career, switched to number 1 for the Pistons, which Billups previously wore for the team.
Iverson scored at least 24 in four of his first five games with Detroit (They won 3 of the 5),[55] and would score 20 or more and 6 or more assists on a consistent basis, but as the season wore on he would lose playing time to Rodney Stuckey. Some have speculated that Pistons President of Basketball Operations Joe Dumars did not envision a long-term role for Iverson on the team, but traded for him to make Stuckey the point guard of the future and free cap space with Iverson's expiring contract.[56]
On April 3, 2009, it was announced that Iverson would not play the remainder of the 2008–09 season. Dumars cited Iverson's ongoing back injury as the reason for his deactivation, although two days prior Iverson stated publicly that he'd rather retire than be moved to the bench as Pistons coach Michael Curry had decided.[57]
On September 10, 2009, Iverson signed a one-year contract with the Memphis Grizzlies.[58] Iverson stated that "God chose Memphis as the place that I will continue my career", and that "I feel that they are committed to developing a winner."[59]
However, Iverson again expressed his displeasure at being a bench player,[60] and left the team on November 7, 2009 for "personal reasons".[61] On November 16, the Grizzlies announced the team terminated his contract by "mutual agreement".[62] Iverson played three games for the Grizzlies, averaging 12.3 ppg, 1.3 rpg, and 3.7 apg in 22.3 mpg.
Return to the 76ers (2009–2010)




Iverson shoots a jump shot in 2010


On November 25, 2009, analyst Stephen A. Smith published on his blog a statement attributed to Iverson announcing plans for retirement, which also said, "I feel strongly that I can still compete at the highest level."[63]
Less than a week later on November 30, Iverson and his representatives met with a Philadelphia 76ers delegation about returning to his former team,[64] and accepted a contract offer two days later. General manager Ed Stefanski declined to go into the terms of the agreement, but an unnamed source told the Associated Press that Iverson agreed to a one-year non-guaranteed contract at the league minimum salary. Iverson would receive a prorated portion of the $1.3 million minimum salary for players with at least 10 years of experience, and the contract would become guaranteed for the remainder of the 2009–10 season if he remained on the roster on January 8, 2010.[65] Stefanski said the team made the decision to pursue Iverson after starting guard Louis Williams suffered a broken jaw and was expected to miss at least 30 games.[66]
On December 7, 2009, Iverson made his return to Philadelphia, garnering a thunderous ovation from the sold-out crowd, in a loss against his former team, the Denver Nuggets.[67] He finished the game with 11 points, 6 assists, 5 rebounds, a steal, and no turnovers.[68] Iverson's first win in his return to Philadelphia came one week later, in a 20-point effort against the Golden State Warriors, ending the Sixers' 12-game losing streak (which stood at 9 games before Iverson returned).[69] He shot 70 percent from the field in the game.[70]
On January 3, 2010, he returned to Denver to face the Nuggets; Iverson scored 17 points and had seven assists in the 108-105 win.[71] He was voted as a starter for the All-Star Game for the 11th straight season.[72] He scored a season-high 23 points (on 56% shooting from the field) in a 99-91 loss to Kobe Bryant and the defending champion Lakers.[73][74]
On February 22, 2010, Iverson left the 76ers indefinitely, citing the need to attend to his 4-year-old daughter Messiah's health issues, which he revealed years later as Kawasaki Disease.[75][76] On March 2, Ed Stefanski announced Iverson would not return to the 76ers for the rest of the season to deal with the personal matter.[77] His final NBA game was a loss against Derrick Rose and the Chicago Bulls on February 20, 2010.[78]
Beşiktaş (2010–2011)
On October 26, 2010, Yahoo! Sports reported that Iverson agreed in principle to a two-year, $4 million net income contract with Beşiktaş, a Turkish Super League team competing in the second-tier level of pan-European professional basketball, the EuroCup (the competition below the EuroLeague level).[79] The club announced the signing at a press conference in New York City, on October 29, 2010.[80] Wearing jersey #4,[81] Iverson made his debut for Beşiktaş on November 16, 2010, in a EuroCup 91-94 loss to Serbian side Hemofarm. Iverson scored 15 points in 23 minutes.[82]
Iverson returned to the United States in January 2011 for calf surgery.[83][84] He only played ten games for Beşiktaş that season, and did not play professional basketball after that.
Official retirement
In January 2013, Iverson received an offer to play for the Texas Legends of the NBA D-League, but he declined.[85]
On October 30, 2013, Iverson announced his retirement from basketball, citing he'd lost his desire to play.[86] At the 76ers 2013–14 season home opener that night, he received a standing ovation at the beginning of the second quarter. The retirement ceremony was attended by former Georgetown coach John Thompson and Sixers great Julius Erving.[87] Iverson said he would always be a Sixer "until I die", and that while he always thought the day he retired would be a "tough" day, he instead stated it was rather a "happy" day.[86]
In November 2013, the 76ers announced that they would officially retire Iverson's number 3 in a special halftime ceremony on March 1, 2014 when the Sixers hosted the Washington Wizards.[88][89] The ceremony took place in front of 20,000 spectators and 76ers greats such as Julius Erving, Moses Malone, and former team president Pat Croce.[90]
BIG3
In 2017, the creation of the 3-on-3 professional basketball league BIG3 was announced, with Iverson set to be a player and coach on 3's Company.[91] In March, it was announced that Iverson's co-captain would be DerMarr Johnson.[92] 3's Company drafted Andre Owens, Mike Sweetney, and Ruben Patterson during the 2017 BIG3 Draft.[93] On June 25, 3's Company played its first game of the inaugural BIG3 season against the Ball Hogs.[94] In the game, Iverson scored 2 points on 1-for-6 shooting in 9 minutes of play.[95] On only playing 9 minutes, Iverson stated, "I signed up to be a coach, player and captain. Coach part is going to go on throughout the game. Playing part is not going to be what you expect. You're not going to see the Allen Iverson of old out there."[94]
National team career




Iverson after a 2006 game with Barcelona


1995 World University Games
Iverson was a member of the USA World University Games Team in Japan in 1995, that included future NBA stars Ray Allen and Tim Duncan, among others. Iverson led all USA players in scoring, assists, and steals, averaging 16.7 points per game, 6.1 assists per game, and 2.9 steals per game. He helped lead the team to an undefeated record en route to a 141-81 victory over the host country, Japan, for the gold medal.[96]
2003 FIBA Americas championship
Iverson was selected to be part of Team USA for the 2003 FIBA Americas Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Puerto Rico in August of that year. USA had a perfect 10–0 record, and won the gold medal as well as qualifying for a berth in the 2004 Olympics. Iverson started all eight games that he played in, and was second on the team with 14.3 points per game, while also posting 3.8 assists per game, 2.5 rebounds per game, 1.6 steals per game, and shooting 56.2 percent (41–73 FGs) from the field, 53.6 percent (15–28 3pt FGs) from 3-point and 81.0 percent (17–21 FTs) from the foul line.[97]
In the USA's 111–71 victory over Canada on August 25, he accounted for a USA Olympic Qualifying single game record 28 points and made a single game record seven 3-pointers. Playing just 23 minutes, he shot 10-for-13 overall, 7-for-8 from the 3-point line, 1-for-1 from the foul line and added three assists, three steals, and one rebound. All seven of his 3-point field goals were made during the final 7:41 of the third quarter.[98]
He finished the tournament ranked overall tied for 10th in scoring, tied for fourth in steals, fifth in 3-point percentage, tied for seventh in assists, and ninth in field goal percentage (.562). Iverson also missed the USA's final two games because of a sprained right thumb which was suffered in the first half of the August 28 Puerto Rico game. In a game against Puerto Rico, he recorded 9 points on 4-for-6 shooting from the field overall, and added five assists and three rebounds in 26 minutes of action in the USA's 101–74 exhibition game victory on August 17 in New York. He was also named to the 2003 USA Senior National Team on April 29, 2003.

Personal life




Iverson and rap star Nelly at a Reebok photoshoot.


During the 1997 offseason, Iverson and his friends were stopped by a police officer for speeding late at night and was arrested for carrying a concealed weapon and for possession of marijuana. He pleaded no contest and was sentenced to community service.[99]
During the 2000 offseason, Iverson recorded a rap single called "40 Bars". However, after being criticized for its controversial lyrics, he eventually was unable to release it. Going under his moniker, Jewelz, the album was alleged to have made derogatory remarks about homosexuals. After criticism from activist groups and NBA Commissioner David Stern, he agreed to change the lyrics, but ultimately never released the album.[100]
In August 2001, he married his high school sweetheart Tawanna at The Mansion on Main Street in Voorhees, New Jersey.[101] In 2002, Iverson was alleged to have thrown Tawanna out of their home after a domestic dispute and later threatening two men with a gun while looking for her. All charges against him were later dropped after the judge cited lack of evidence with contradictory statements from witnesses.[102]
On February 24, 2004, Iverson urinated in a trash can at Bally's Atlantic City casino and was told by casino management not to return.[103]
On December 9, 2005, after the Sixers defeated the Charlotte Bobcats, Iverson paid a late-night visit to the Trump Taj Mahal. After winning a hand at a three-card-stud poker table, Iverson was overpaid $10,000 in chips by a dealer. When the dealer quickly realized the mistake and requested the chips back, Iverson refused and a heated head-turning argument between him and casino staff began. Atlantic City casino regulations reportedly state that when a casino makes a payout mistake in favor of the gambler, he or she must return the money that they did not legitimately win by playing.[103]
Also in 2005, Iverson's bodyguard Jason Kane was accused of assaulting a man at a Washington, D. C. nightclub after the man, Marlin Godfrey, refused to leave the club's VIP section so Iverson's entourage could enter. Godfrey suffered a concussion, a ruptured eardrum, a burst blood vessel in his eye, a torn rotator cuff, cuts and bruises, and emotional distress. Although Iverson did not touch Godfrey himself, Godfrey sued Iverson for the injuries caused by his bodyguard. In 2007 a jury awarded Godfrey $260,000. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the verdict in 2009.[104]
On March 2, 2010, Iverson's wife filed for divorce, seeking custody of their five children, as well as child support and alimony payments.[101]
In August 2011, an Ohio man sued Iverson for $2.5 million in damages, claiming he was assaulted by Iverson's security guard in a 2009 bar fight in Detroit. The federal judge dismissed the case, finding no evidence that Iverson or his bodyguard struck the plaintiff, Guy Walker.[105]
On May 14, 2015, Iverson appeared on CBS This Morning in support of a Showtime Network documentary on his life, during which he addressed long-discussed rumors of financial struggles, denying any notion that he was struggling. "That's a myth. That's a rumor... The fact that I'm struggling in any part of my life", he said.[106]

Excerpted from Not a Game: The Incredible Rise and Unthinkable Fall of Allen Iverson by Kent Babb. Published by Atria Books. Book can be purchased online at Amazon.

There he went, house to house, hoping he would find the little shit. It was Sunday evening, the sun setting in coastal Virginia, and Mike Bailey’s patience was eroding by the second. He should have known better. No doubt about it now.
Nope, Coach, he’s not here.
Sorry, Coach, you just missed him.
Bailey was the basketball coach at Bethel High School in Hampton, Virginia, a city on a peninsula that juts into the Atlantic Ocean, and after two decades he was familiar with the maze of teenage psychology. Now he was seething, played like a fool by a kid. These were the kinds of things that made him distrust Iverson, Bailey thought to himself, practicing what he would say when he finally found him. This was why the kid’s word wasn’t worth a damn.
Three days earlier, Iverson had asked to go home. Just one weekend, Coach. He wanted to see his mother and his friends. Bailey had gotten to know Iverson’s delicate family situation, and he knew the kid had a chance to do something amazing. Two years earlier, the coach first watched the eighth-grade point guard on the junior varsity team. He was so fast, driving to the basket with such ease. The kid was a blur, and the other boys could not move fast enough to get in front of him or put a hand in his face, and damn, there he went again. Iverson would have a chance at a college scholarship, Bailey just knew it, a rare opportunity to lift himself and his family out of here. But there was so much work to be done, a total construction job, and the first time he had met Iverson they argued about school absences. Ten of them, the policy went, led to sports ineligibility. Bailey told Iverson he had missed seventy-six days of classes. Nah, Coach, the kid corrected proudly, it was only sixty-nine.
After Iverson’s freshman year, Bailey had fallen for Iverson and his future enough that he and Janet, Bailey’s wife, had gone all-in: paying for Iverson to attend summer school, allowing him to live with them, and walking the high-wire act of Iverson enrolled in a session in which one absence meant failure and sports ineligibility – a high-powered train coming off the tracks. Now, with Bailey kicking himself for allowing himself to become so enchanted, the kid was nowhere to be found.
He searched, one house and then the next, his eyes scanning the sidewalks and playgrounds and alleyways.
Yeah, Coach, we just saw him.
Bailey turned his car toward home, and the next morning he walked into the school and saw Iverson sitting in class. Later that day, he noticed Iverson walking alone.
“Come here,” the coach demanded.
Iverson walked over, and Bailey pulled him into a dimly lit room, grabbing the kid by the throat.
“If you mess this thing up,” Bailey said, “I’ll kill you.”

She moved into Hampton’s Aberdeen district when she was still pregnant, fifteen years old, and a live wire. Look at her go, running through the neighborhood, which decades earlier had been part of resettlement legislation for some of the Virginia Peninsula’s black residents, and now it was a kind of community within a community. The neighbors appreciated the quiet, but here she came, bursting from her grandmother’s doorway yet again.
Her voice carried down the streets and through the windows, that round belly pulling up her basketball jersey. Ann Iverson kept running in the months after she celebrated her fifteenth birthday by going all the way with Allen Broughton, the boy she had met three years earlier in Hartford, Connecticut, the boy who seemed to never keep his distance from trouble, the boy Ann just could not resist. They had talked about it: first love, first kiss, first fuck – it all went together, didn’t it, and so when she felt she was old enough, he would tap on her grandmother’s back window at midnight of her birthday, and then they would go down to the basement.
Broughton had played basketball and earned the respect of men much older than him. Ann loved him, would fight for him, would do anything – and then he was just gone, not coming around anymore, even after the basketball trainer told Ann that her physical revealed she was two months pregnant. That would not stop her, though, from slamming doors and playing ball and bothering the neighbors. Then Ann’s mama died, and her grandmother, Ethel Mitchell, moved the family to the Virginia coast, quieter environs, the old woman hoped, for a granddaughter known around the streets as “Juicy.”
She went into labor in early June, and when her son came out she noticed the length of his arms. He was going to be a basketball player, she thought almost immediately, or at least that was what she would tell people she thought. She named him Allen after his daddy and her first love, but she would call him Bubba Chuck, combining two uncles’ names.
Ann found stimulation even in Aberdeen, and other times she brought the party to Miss Ethel’s house, the old woman trying to keep young Allen asleep or at least shielded from the ruckus in the other room. Bubba Chuck grew, and like his mother he liked to go fast, jumping on a ten-speed at four and five years old, roughhousing with his uncles Greg and Stevie in the backyard as Miss Ethel screamed for them to stop, for God’s sake, y’all gonna break that boy in two!
“They would sling the hell out of his little ass up against the house or something,” said Butch Harper, who lived next door. “He would take the hardest damn hit, and he’d pop right back up.”
Ann worked evenings at the shipyard, taking on daytime jobs as a typist and a forklift driver. Miss Ethel was looking after the kids, Ann and her siblings included, and it was up to Ann to keep the lights on. She worked most times, and even when she was off, she was not home – ­another party to attend, even if the fun came back to Aberdeen or, later, their home in Newport News, a few miles northeast on the Peninsula. Often there was a man with her, Michael Freeman, who did mysterious things to make ends meet. Before they disappeared for the night or a few days, they put a ball in Bubba Chuck’s hand and watched him go, and when he was nine Ann called Harper, her old neighbor, and begged him to waive the rule that kids had to live in Hampton to play in Hampton, where Harper oversaw the Deen Ball Sports league. Ann was so excited about it, telling the other mamas and daddies at work about how her son was so good, he was going to play in the NBA, just wait.
One of those people in earshot heard the commotion one day, the enthusiasm common but the details intriguing. Gary Moore was a coach for Harper, working with football players, and he liked what he was hearing. He wanted to take a look at this little dynamo, and so he put nine-year-old Bubba on the field with eleven- and twelve-year-olds, pushing the ball between his arms, and – hot damn, look at him go! “He was kicking so much ass, man, it was ridiculous,” Harper would recall more than two decades later.
Moore vowed to Ann that he would do more than coach her son. He would look after him, protect him, shield him from the sharks that would forever circle him. He would see to it that he would be challenged and disciplined and sheltered. The way Moore looked at it, a kid with Bubba Chuck’s gifts needed to be nurtured and strengthened, mentally and physically, built from the ground up like a house meant to stand for all time. My word, Moore told Ann, just picture what that finished product would look like, and she smiled and hooted and shook her head, thanking God for giving her this baby, this gift who would use those long arms to lift them all up and carry them toward a much better place.

They rolled the balls out at the Aberdeen gym, and off Iverson went during warm-ups, toward the basket, draining long-range shots from the wing, flying past the kids trying to guard him. Then it was time for practice to start, and Bob Barefield announced they were going to spend the next hour working on drills. A few workouts to teach proper mechanics and footwork, and when Barefield started the lesson, there went Bubba Chuck walking out the door.
Basketball was fun, not work, and practice to him felt a hell of a lot like work. So no thanks, he told the coach, and if this was what it meant to play for the youth league, then they could keep the damn youth league. Barefield was stunned, but he tried to be patient as he monitored a kid who needed constant stimulation. Barefield talked Iverson into taking a leap of faith with him, and the kid obliged. But Iverson saw himself not only as an athlete but as a multitalented youngster with more than just his speed and jump shot to offer the world. He liked football better anyway, and besides, he was going to be an artist or a rapper. He met Rahsaan Langford, a kid from the east side of town. Everyone called him Ra. He could freestyle with the best of them, turning everyday thoughts and dusty old memories into a stream of rhymes, spitting them on stoops and street corners and playgrounds, the words lightning fast like Bubba Chuck was with the basketball. Maybe for the first time in Iverson’s young life, he was jealous. Ra was talented, the same as his new friend, and together they were going to make it out of Newport Bad Newz, they came to call it.
Langford was quiet around strangers, but when he felt comfortable, he would brighten the room or the corner, keeping Iverson and the rest of their group laughing. And like Iverson, Langford and several other friends never wanted to go home. That was where Ann’s parties were, where drinking and drug use packed the hours, and Iverson would develop a habit that would later come to haunt him: Rather than spend the nighttime hours sleeping, he would stay awake, finding fulfillment or entertainment in other ways. Sometimes Ann would ask Bubba Chuck to run an errand for the group, and off he would go, once knocking on the door of a drug house and walking in as a police surveillance unit watched from out front. One of the officers, a former athlete at Bethel, called up Dennis Kozlowski, the high school’s football coach and athletic director, tipping him off that Iverson had entered a house filled with unsavory characters and had left with his hands full. The cops cut him a break, maybe the first time but hardly the last time an authority figure would look the other way, and Iverson walked home and delivered the package.
He spent his hours dreaming of a different kind of life and putting his imagination on paper – sometimes using whatever else was available when there was no paper within reach. Iverson once used the inside of his bedroom door as a canvas, sketching an image from above as Michael Jordan, his idol, glided through the air, the Chicago Bulls’ star flying toward the basket and his jersey flapping like a flag in the wind. Other times he would grab a ball, the noise in the other rooms too much, and dribble it up the sidewalks. Occasionally there were other boys on the playground, even in the wee hours, and other nights he would stand there alone, taking shot after shot by himself.
Other times he and Ra and Eric “E” Jackson and Marlon Moore, the young men Iverson would later identify as his all-important “Day-one friends,” would sit on a stoop or take a long walk. They were in it together, calling themselves “Cru Thik,” born and raised on the hard streets of coastal Virginia, but by God they would not die here, young and unfulfilled and, worst of all, poor. They passed the hours and made a pact: If any of them ever made it big, whether it was through rap or sports or something else, the group would never dissolve.
If one made it out, then they all would.

Iverson was in ninth grade when Kozlowski’s wide receivers coach entered his boss’s office and closed the door. Iverson’s school absences had already become a problem, basketball coach Bailey arguing with Iverson over the precise number of the dozens of times he had missed school. Now, even when he did make it to campus, he rarely arrived before eleven in the morning. Even early in the school year, he had missed the assistant coach’s early morning history class nine times; one more, the coach told Kozlowski, and he would have no choice but to fail Iverson, making him ineligible to play for the Bruins. Hold on, Kozlowski told his assistant, he would get to the bottom of it.
He called Iverson into his office, getting quickly to the point: “Allen,” the coach asked, “why the hell can’t you get to school on time?”
The kid seemed to not even realize he had missed class so often, but he explained anyway. Ann and Freeman, the man she met at the shipyard and who had begun attracting attention for selling drugs, now had two younger daughters, Brandy and Iiesha, and after Ann moved out of Miss Ethel’s house, there was often no one around to look after them. Kozlowski had heard things were occasionally bad at home; the lights occasionally shut off and, for a while, a broken pipe pushed so much raw sewage up through the floor that Iverson wore boots while moving from one room to the next. What his coaches had not realized was that Iverson making it to school at any hour was, many times, a small miracle. He collected enough pennies to call a taxi, then asked friends for a lift home to his house on Jordan Avenue, and other times he called a coach at four thirty in the morning and asked for a ride.
Even at age fifteen, he had grown used to waking up and being unable to find or awaken his mother, and if Brandy was to make it to school, it was up to him to get her there. But then if Iverson went to classes, who would watch Iiesha, who was born with a condition that afflicted her with seizures? Most mornings, Iverson saw Brandy onto the school bus and then sat with his baby sister until Ann came home, and only then would he wander to school himself.
Christ, Kozlowski thought, and depending on perspective this was either giving a young and talented kid a second chance because of unusual challenges or just another time Iverson was insulated from responsibility because of his skills on a football field and basketball court. Nevertheless, Kozlowski instructed one of Bethel’s security workers, a former high-jumper on Kozlowski’s track team, to take Kozlowski’s car – the Buick Reliant wagon, the coach pointed out, with “KOZ” as the license plate – and each morning stop at Iverson’s house, gathering the three children. He would then drop Brandy off at her school and bring Iverson and Iiesha to the high school, where the baby would spend the hours in the care of Bethel’s home economics class.
Iverson felt at home when the games began, the fields and courts the one place no one worried about him, and sometimes spent nights with friends, an attempt to find peace after the sun went down. One of Iverson’s mentors, a twenty-year-old former athlete named Tony Clark, allowed Iverson to stay with him some nights, imparting advice and wisdom into Iverson’s young mind. But then Clark’s girlfriend came over one night and stabbed Clark in the neck, Iverson running over and seeing his friend’s blood running in the street. Iverson watched as another boy took a bullet as they sat together on a porch, and it was said that in one summer, eight of his friends were shot to death.
Many times Moore offered a spare room and a ride from here to there. Iverson came to trust Moore, who years earlier had played football for Kozlowski. He was already in his late thirties, older even than Ann Iverson, and Moore projected himself as wise and thoughtful, a fatherly aura that Iverson was immediately drawn to, and Moore was among those who believed greatness was in his protégé’s destiny.

No matter the attempts at stability, Iverson moved around so often that he held precious the smallest reminders of comfort and peace. Before the family moved out of its house in Newport News, Iverson stared at the drawing he had done of Jordan, dreaming of someday controlling his own destiny, a gift that a professional athlete must surely take for granted. When they left the house, they gathered their meager belongings. packing them into trash bags and preparing for the next step – whatever it might look like. Iverson took a screwdriver to the hinge plate, pulling the door off its frame.
Iverson’s biological father, Allen Broughton, was serving a prison term, the first of several – including one sentence in 1996 for stabbing an ex-girlfriend – and the first time Iverson met him, it was with guards watching. The boy asked his dad if there was any way he could help him get a new pair of sneakers, and Broughton told Iverson that there was no way, sending the boy home shattered. But Ann came up with an alternative plan: She used that month’s rent money to buy her young son the shoes before a summer-league trip to Lawrence, Kansas, where one of the men who would stop to watch Iverson was a college coach named Larry Brown.
Ann maintained a relationship with Freeman, who attempted to be a father figure, but he also would spend most of the next two decades in prison, the investigations finally turning up enough evidence to convict him on drug charges. Iverson looked to Moore and his coaches as the stable men in his life, and when he and Bailey concluded their conversation about school absences, the basketball coach asked him a question whose answer was both revealing and heartbreaking, considering what Bailey had come to know about his young star: “What do you expect of me?” Bailey asked.
Iverson thought about it before answering: “Will you always be there for me?”

During summers, Ann Iverson trusted her son with Boo Williams, a former power forward at St. John’s who now ran his own Amateur Athletic Union team. Alonzo Mourning had come and gone through Williams’s system, moving on to Georgetown University and future stardom, and Iverson was his next project, a kid with so much talent and speed, and…
My God, Allen, do you ever shut up?
Fourteen hours. That was how long he talked, from Hampton to Memphis, teammate and future University of Maryland star Joe Smith going to sleep to pass the time in some way other than listening to Iverson’s impressions and jokes and continual wisdom, but when he woke up, Iverson was still jabbering. He was going out to Tennessee, where the new arena was a damn pyramid – had they seen it? – and Iverson was going to help them christen that place. Watch how many points he scored, how easy it would be for him to get to the basket, how many shots in a row he would make, and anyway, did anybody want to bet? Just a buck or two, chump change, come on. Coaches learned early on that Iverson was an incentive-based organism: Ask him to do something, and he was just as likely to do it as tell you to go fuck yourself. But add five dollars to the equation or a pay-per-view movie in the hotel room or pizza instead of some bullshit boxed chicken, and now you had a damn machine, eager, ready to please.
He bet on free throws and bowling and late-night Monopoly marathons, Iverson always the banker to see to it nobody would steal, always the one with the fat stack of phony money when the night was finished. But he had won, goddammit, and that was what mattered. Could he not dunk at age thirteen, flying through the air and going above the rim on a regulation goal? “We don’t play that YMCA shit,” Harper said much later. Had Iverson not scored thirty points three games in a row at the AAU nationals in Winston-Salem, North Carolina – not just in each game but by halftime, propelling him to the top of the national recruiting rankings? “What he did will never be done,” Williams would recall, “and I’ve been in this thirty-two years.”
Iverson was going to show them in Memphis, too, he kept telling them, the teammates and coaches in that little van feeling trapped inside a cloud of Iverson’s nonstop chatter. Damn, did the kid not sleep? Did his batteries never run low? Fuck nah, he replied, did Michael’s? Did Mike’s batteries ever run low? He hoped not, because he was ready to play Mike now, leave him in the dust.
Whatever, Williams told him. Michael Evans was a solid player: Not just the best point guard in eastern Virginia but one of the best in America. Keep practicing, Allen, and maybe in a year or two you’ll…
“I wasn’t talking about no Michael Evans,” Iverson crowed.
“Who are you talking about, then?”
“Shit, I’m talking about Michael Jordan!”
They rolled their eyes, and when they finally rolled into Memphis and that pyramid, Iverson and the Boo Williams under-sixteen team tore through the competition – well, most of it – and finished second. Iverson was named most valuable player, and that was great and all, but that meant it was time to go home: another fourteen hours of Iverson Radio, all the hits from today and yesterday, and commercials for tomorrow. That was some bullshit, he said early in the drive, talking about the second-place trophy, threatening to throw the damn thing out the window as they plowed down Interstate 40.
“Allen,” somebody said, “will you shut up if we stop somewhere for dinner?”
He smiled, something in it for him now, and for a long time he did not say another word.

Bailey took his hand off Iverson’s throat in that darkened back room, the kid’s eyes finally returning to their normal size. Bailey came to understand his star player’s challenges, or at least he tried to understand them, but he also made it clear he, Bailey, would not be played. More than that, he would not allow Iverson’s questionable support system – and the destructive lessons and twisted sense of normalcy he had come to accept throughout his upbringing – to derail such a promising future.
Iverson saw toughness as strength, writing off those who took it easy on him as soft and a mark to take advantage of. The easier you took it on him, the harder he made life on you. So Bailey began taking inventory of all things Iverson, collecting intel from friendly teachers and monitoring Iverson’s grades as they were posted. At the end of his freshman year, he took a D and would need to attend summer school. Iverson’s mother, though, could not afford the tuition, and so Bailey made Iverson a deal: Live with Bailey and Janet, his wife, for those three weeks, sharpening his focus and completing his requirements, and the Baileys would pay for the summer session. Iverson liked an incentive, didn’t he, so here it was, like it or not.
Iverson agreed, and the first four days had come and gone without incident. Then by Thursday evening, Iverson’s mind began to wander. No matter the actions and intentions of those surrounding him, those who had known him and believed in him since the beginning would always be dear. And no one was more precious than Ann, no matter her own bad behavior, because she had always seen greatness in her son. Iverson wanted to spend the weekend at home, but Bailey balked at the idea.
“Allen,” he had said, “we had a deal.”
The kid smiled, though, showing a kind of charm that would later make him into an international icon and charismatic pitchman. Beneath the toughness was a sweetness inside, one that prevented those who cared deeply for him from ever writing him off, and Iverson kept chirping at his coach. He reminded Bailey that one of his coaching principles was trust – trusting teammates to do their jobs, developing on-court trust that assignments would be completed, trusting coaches to put players in the best possible positions.
“Why don’t you trust me?” Iverson had asked.
The words ate at him, but Bailey held on, tired fingers gradually popping free of the ledge. Iverson was relentless. He caught his basketball coach walking around a corner. “Coach,” the kid said. “Trust.” He saw him in the kitchen and in hallways. “Trust,” he said, again and again, and fine, Bailey said, agreeing to allow Iverson to spend the weekend with his family – but only if he was back by Sunday.
Then, of course, Sunday had come and gone, Iverson nowhere to be found and Bailey making his way through Hampton and having no luck. Then there he was, and Bailey snapped. “I’ll kill you,” he said, reaching deep into Iverson’s soul. For the next ten days, Iverson had perfect attendance at summer school. If Bailey spoke with Ann, she would align herself with the coach and not her son. No matter how she carried on, Ann rarely questioned the motives of those who made her son’s future a priority. And she had taught her son pride: While Iverson lived with the Baileys, they noticed him rise early and ask to borrow an iron. He worked the shirt’s creases and edges, draping it over his shoulders and turning to reveal a hole in the back. There was nothing he could do about the hole, he figured, but he refused to attend school with a wrinkled shirt. “Whatever he had,” Mike Bailey recalled, “he valued tremendously.”
Iverson and his coaches still clashed occasionally, a look into the future, and Bailey threw him off the varsity team three times before the storms passed and Bailey sent him back into the lineup. Kozlowski required that all players wear a suit on game day, and when he learned that Iverson owned no suit, Kozlowski spent five hundred dollars for his quarterback to be outfitted in a two-piece; by the next year, one of Ann’s houseguests had stolen the suit from Iverson’s closet, and Koz­lowski bought him a replacement on the promise that Iverson would attend the Newport News Daily Press’s Athlete of the Year banquet on time. Iverson, with Moore as his chauffeur, arrived at seven fifteen for the six o’clock banquet.
The day before Virginia’s Group AAA state championship football game during Iverson’s junior year at Bethel, he organized something of a walkout. Kozlowski had called for a practice, and it was cold and snowy, and Iverson did not feel like practicing in such weather. Iverson, the Bruins’ starting quarterback, approached Kozlowski. “Coach,” he said, “everybody’s sick. We shouldn’t be out here.”
It was a note Iverson would play many times throughout his NBA career, someone he cared about having come down with a mysterious and sudden illness. Then, a day or so later, it was gone and Iverson would return to practice, pulling on his green and gold. But this time Kozlowski swatted away his star player’s excuse, moving forward with the walk-through, a half-speed tune-up scheduled to last an hour. Punt team! Kozlowski called, and Iverson took his place as the return man. The kick went up, and the coverage team ran toward him, positioning their feet to close down the avenues the quick Iverson usually tried to exploit. But as they approached Iverson, he just stood there. One more time! called Kozlowski, growing annoyed now. The punt went up, then downward, then into Iverson’s arms, and he stood there again, refusing to return it. Kozlowski threatened to bench Iverson, going so far as to have the backup quarterback warm up and take a few snaps, but Iverson and Kozlowski both knew the old coach was not going to gamble away his chance to win a state championship to underscore a life lesson for his junior quarterback. In sports, the game results prevail, and years later, Kozlowski would show little regret for allowing Iverson to play, because in a wall near the bar in his home’s trophy room was a plaque from the Bruins’ 27–0 win against Lynchburg’s E. C. Glass High School.
Iverson, naturally, scored one of Bethel’s touchdowns on a punt return. When a local reporter pushed a microphone into his face afterward, Iverson tugged at his stocking cap and smiled. “I’m gonna go get one in basketball now,” he said.

Tawanna Turner asked Kim Woodard if she could come over that night and meet the boy who played football with Kim’s boyfriend, Tim Johnson. Was he the one on TV always running his mouth? Who did he think he was? Tawanna was hesitant to say it out loud, but she wanted to know.
In fact, she did not say much of anything out loud. Tawanna was quiet, and he was brash. She kept to herself, and he always seemed to have his crew close by. He was an athlete at Bethel High, and she was the manager for the girls’ basketball team at Hampton’s Kecoughtan High, fetching water and towels for the players, some of whom were Tawanna’s friends. She was, as Iverson would later tease her for, a water girl. They could not have been more different. But they were both juniors. They were both sixteen. And opposites attract, don’t they, and besides, here they were because they were friends with some of the same people, Kim and Tim, wasn’t that funny?
Kecoughtan had a half day of school, and Kim set it all up. Tim asked Iverson to come over and meet the girl with the hoop earrings and the quiet way. What the hell, Iverson thought; beats going home for the night. They talked for a while, Iverson quiet now and Tawanna chattering, talking about how her daddy called her by her first two initials, “TD,” like a touchdown, and insisting she had dated only one athlete before, and maybe she wanted to someday be a fashion designer or maybe an artist, leave this rat-hole town, and eventually Kim and Tim disappeared into the other room. Tawanna and Iverson talked for a little while longer, and then Iverson’s hands started working, and then their pants were off, and anyway, it happened fast. When it was over, Iverson smiled at Tawanna, who smiled back. Would she come see him play sometime? Would she cheer for him even when Kecoughtan played Bethel? Could he call her his little water girl?
Iverson told Moore about her, the light-skinned girl from the other school. Moore listened as the puppy love unfolded, giving Iverson shit about it, but no, Gary, this was for real. Moore nodded and rolled his eyes, but then Iverson asked her to his junior prom, and when he stopped at Moore’s house before picking her up, he was a wreck. Was his bow tie straight? How about these shoes, are they okay? How was his hair and his breath and his tuxedo, and no shit, was Moore sure these shoes worked? Moore put his fingers on the bow tie, adjusting it. He looked Iverson in the eyes, telling the kid that everything was working just fine. This, he told him, was a match made in heaven.
•••
His boys sat behind the bench at Bethel games, Langford and “E” and Marlon following him across town when the Bethel gymnasium could no longer accommodate the crowds. Kozlowski worked out an arrangement with Hampton University, which allowed the Bruins to play their home games at its 7,200-seat Convocation Center, though even before games against rival Hampton High, there were two thousand spectators turned away because entry would cause a fire hazard.
“Coach, we’ve got a problem,” a police officer said to Kozlowski before a packed game, shortly before tip-off. Ann, in all her glory, and Iverson’s two sisters were outside, raising hell because they could not get in. Kozlowski kicked three fans out so Ann and the girls could enter, and they soon took their place behind the Bruins’ bench, too, the Bethel star’s mother telling anyone within earshot that her baby was gonna get rich and buy her a red Jaguar one day. Iverson had emerged as a full-fledged star, named by the talent scout Bob Gibbons as the nation’s top basketball prospect, sure to make his college choice among heavyweights Duke or Kentucky or Kansas or Maryland. But then again he loved football, too, and as a quarterback and defensive back, the recruiting analyst Tom Lemming suggested he and a New Orleans quarterback named Peyton Manning were the top two high school players in America.
The town spilled into the Convocation Center, most everyone trying to catch a glimpse of Virginia’s newest favorite son. Moore, a Hampton University employee, pushed his way through the crowds, and Tawanna came to watch her new boyfriend, too – marveling then at how Iverson was more than just a talented player; he insisted on doing things his way. Iverson bickered with Bailey sometimes, usually if the coach tried to compel Iverson to pass the ball more often. “Coach, stop telling me how to play all the time!” Iverson shot toward Bailey during the game against Hampton High, and in exchange Bailey benched his star. The next game, Iverson refused to take a shot – nothing but passes. If Tony Rutland found him wide open near the wing, Iverson held the ball a moment and then passed it back. If he had a clear path through the lane, nope – he popped it to the outside, and the Bruins eventually trailed by twenty points. “Looking back,” Bailey said, “probably today coaching somebody like Allen, I wouldn’t say ‘pass the ball.’ ”
In February 1992, Iverson and the Bruins were about to make good on Iverson’s vow to win the Virginia basketball championship. Bailey, despite his occasional frustration, believed that Iverson had learned from his past mistakes; that the risk of him messing up his future was now mostly behind him. Nonetheless, the coach stayed on him, pushing Iverson and checking in on him. But now that Iverson was a junior, Bailey saw a talented youngster not just finding his way out but pushing through so many barriers that had been placed in front of him.
On a Thursday night, the evening before a game, Iverson was bored. Like usual, he did not feel like sleeping. A little before midnight he asked a few friends what they were in the mood for. One of them suggested they go bowling.

Synopsis
About this title




“While Ann Iverson makes direct references to contemporary political events, she mutes their potential polarizing effect by considering them within a non-politicized context: her life. Consequently, no matter one's position on our nation's response to September 11, to the war on terror, or the president, one can appreciate these poems.”—Rachel LintulaAnn Iverson’s second collection of poetry conveys the emotional journey of a son’s first and second deployment to Baghdad, as well as the spiritual and physical adjustment to a move from the inner city to a country-like suburb. In spare, distinctive imagery, Iverson ponders the personal, familial, and social transitions brought about by life change. She thoughtfully considers the tension within relationships that change often engenders and by doing so, personalizes a national tragedy and the subsequent war in Iraq.In “Even Though” she juxtaposes the surreal war and its reality with her common life experience: “I cleared my throat and raised my voice, / though the city did not respond. / And the soldiers stay away too long, / for years and years and years / Even though we call to them. / Even though they hear.” Ann Iverson received her MALS and MFA from Hamline University in Minnesota. Her writing has been featured on The Writer’s Almanac with Garrison Keillor and has appeared in The Oklahoma Review and MARGIE: The American Journal of Poetry. Her first collection, Come Now to the Window, was published by the Laurel Poetry Collective. She currently is the director of arts and sciences at Dunwoody College of Technology in Minneapolis. She and her husband live in East Bethel, Minnesota.

Book Description Holy Cow Press, United States, 2007. Paperback. Book Condition: New. Language: English . Brand New Book. While Ann Iverson makes direct references to contemporary political events, she mutes their potential polarizing effect by considering them within a non-politicized context: her life. Consequently, no matter one s position on our nation s response to September 11, to the war on terror, or the president, one can appreciate these poems. --Rachel Lintula Ann Iverson s second collection of poetry conveys the emotional journey of a son s first and second deployment to Baghdad, as well as the spiritual and physical adjustment to a move from the inner city to a country-like suburb. In spare, distinctive imagery, Iverson ponders the personal, familial, and social transitions brought about by life change. She thoughtfully considers the tension within relationships that change often engenders and by doing so, personalizes a national tragedy and the subsequent war in Iraq. In Even Though she juxtaposes the surreal war and its reality with her common life experience: I cleared my throat and raised my voice, / though the city did not respond. / And the soldiers stay away too long, / for years and years and years / Even though we call to them. / Even though they hear. Ann Iverson received her MALS and MFA from Hamline University in Minnesota. Her writing has been featured on The Writer s Almanac with Garrison Keillor and has appeared in The Oklahoma Review and MARGIE: The American Journal of Poetry. Her first collection, Come Now to the Window, was published by the Laurel Poetry Collective. She currently is the director of arts and sciences at Dunwoody College of Technology in Minneapolis. She and her husband live in East Bethel, Minnesota.  Bookseller Inventory # AAC9780977945849

The Amazon.com Textbooks Store




	
Are you tired of paying a small fortune for your textbooks every year? Wouldn’t you rather buy cheap college textbooks and have more money to buy that great pair of skinny jeans, eat out more often instead of heating up a frozen pizza, or just have a little more spending money? When you come to Amazon.com, you can save money by buying cheap new and used textbooks and by renting textbooks for college. You can also trade your used textbooks for an Amazon Gift Card, whether you bought your books from us or not. By being a smart shopper and saving money on textbooks at Amazon.com, you’ll have more cash for the things in life that can’t be learned from a textbook.

Don’t worry about selection, we’ve got your textbook needs covered for any subject from biology, chemistry, and nursing to accounting, arts, and engineering. Once you’re finished with your textbooks you can trade them in at Amazon.com and get up to 80% of their value in an Amazon Gift Card.   

Shop the Amazon Textbooks Store and save up to 90% on textbook rentals, up to 90% on used textbooks, and up to 50% on new textbooks. You can also enjoy Free Two-Day Shipping on millions of items, including cheap college textbooks, when you join Prime Student.

Learn about eTextbook features that help you study smarter, not harder.












We know there are things you would rather be doing than studying, so we built X-Ray for Textbooks to help you save time. With X-Ray for Textbooks, get everything you need with a single tap, including definitions, related pages in your eTextbook, and even relevant content from other sources like Wikipedia and YouTube. X-Ray for Textbooks is available on Fire tablets and the free Kindle Reading App for iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac on select eTextbooks. To access X-Ray for Textbooks, bring up the control bar within an eTextbook by tapping at the top or bottom of your screen.  You can find the X-Ray for Textbooks button at the top of the control screen.

Just carrying around a yellow highlighter? How about pink, blue, orange, and yellow? Multi-color highlights are available on Fire tablets, iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac. Tap a word and hold–the digital highlighting tool will pop up and you can adjust the highlighted text and highlight color. You can categorize and save all your highlights in Notebook and even turn them into flashcards with the click of a button; go to Notebook and click on the Flashcards button to create flashcards from your highlights. We store all your highlights at kindle.amazon.com so you can reference them even after you return the eTextbook.














Studying for exams? Notebook for eTextbooks displays all of your notes, colored highlights, saved images and bookmarks in one place. With Notebook you can mark and filter your most important concepts to study when it's test time–you can even export them to email and Evernote on Fire tablets. It's like a digital scrapbook for your studies. Notebook is available on Fire HD tablets and the free Kindle Reading App for iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac. On iOS and Android devices, tap the top or bottom of the screen from within the eTextbook to bring up the controls to access Notebook. On PC/Mac, the Notebook icon is on the left side of the Kindle Reading app.














Just finished a chapter and need to review key terms and definitions? Flashcards allow you to quickly brush up on all the terms, concepts, and definitions in each chapter with a simple, easy to use interface. Flashcards are available on iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac from within the eTextbook. Click on the flashcards icon to make your own flashcards. Or, you can auto-generate Flashcards from your notes and highlights and X-Ray terms if your eTextbook includes X-Ray for eTextbooks.














Have a tablet and a laptop? With eTextbooks, you can read your content on all your devices with the free Kindle Reading App. eTextbooks are currently supported on Fire tablets, iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac. eTextbooks give you access to your content however you want, whenever you need it. Kindle's Whispersync technology also synchronizes the furthest page you read, your bookmarks, and annotations across your devices so you can pick up where you left off.














You can save money and space in your bag with eTextbooks. Read across your devices and save time studying the concepts you need to learn with interactive features such as Keyword Search and X-Ray for Textbooks. Quickly create and manage your notes and highlights and access them anytime in the Amazon cloud.














Carry less around campus this semester. Take your entire library with you wherever you go, without having to lug around all of your physical textbooks. You can also access all of your eTextbooks, notes, and bookmarks wherever you go, whether it's on your Fire tablet, iPad, iPhone, Android device, PC, or Mac with the free Kindle Reading App.














With the swipe of a finger, quickly and efficiently navigate through pages and chapters of eTextbooks. Swift navigation is available on Android and iOS tablets. Tap the top or bottom of your tablet screen from inside the eTextbook to access swift navigation. On iPads, you have the option of swiping through all the pages from a grid like the one shown above.
