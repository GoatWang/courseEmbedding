The article is called Geltech Solutions Inc Bullish Signal Reger Michael Lloyd increased Stake and is was published by Octafinance.com at http://www.octafinance.com/geltech-solutions-inc-bullish-signal-reger-michael-lloyd-increased-stake/103120/.CaptchaSubmitReger Michael Lloyd increased Position in GelTech Solutions, Inc. (OTCMKTS:GLTC)
Reger Michael Lloyd has filled a SC 13D/A form regarding Geltech Solutions, Inc  0.207 0.00 0.00%. Filing Link: 000155335015000721.  Per Reger Michael Lloyd’s filing, the filler reported increased stake in the company by 10.41% to 36,355,532 shares. Reger Michael Lloyd now owns 54.9% of the Materials-company. This form was required due to trading activity on July 13, 2015.
Company Profile
GelTech Solutions, Inc., is in the business of creating product solutions to environmental challenges and bringing those products to market. The Company markets three products: FireIce, a water enhancing powder that can be utilized both as a fire suppressant and as a medium-term fire retardant to protect wildlands, structures and firefighters; (2) Soil2O Dust Control, its application which is used for dust and (3) Emergency Manhole FireIce Delivery System, or EMFIDS, a system designed to deliver FireIce into a manhole in the event of a fire. Other products being marketed include FireIce Home Defense Unit, and Soil2O. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, the Company developed and began marketing two new products, (1) GT-W14, an industrial absorbent powder used to contain and clean up industrial liquid spills; and (2) Soil2O Soil Cap, a dust suppressant technology designed to stabilize stockpile dust and reduce soil erosion.

Form 13D is SEC filing that must be submitted within 10 days, by anyone who acquires beneficial ownership of more than 5% of any publicly traded securities. A filer must promptly update its 13D filing in case of acquisition or disposition of 1% or more of the securities that are the subject of the filing. These filings may be a precursor to hostile takeovers, company breakups, and other “change of control” events.
