Exclusive Interview With The Chairman And CEO: Ryder Systems, Inc. (R) - Gregory T. SwientonHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreYahooSearchSearchSkip to NavigationSkip to Main ContentSkip to Related Content0Exclusive Interview With The Chairman And CEO: Ryder Systems, Inc. (R) - Gregory T. SwientonWall Street TranscriptJanuary 24, 2012ReblogShareTweetShare67 WALL STREET, New York - January 24, 2012 - The Wall Street Transcript has just published its Equipment Rental & Leasing Services Report offering a timely review of the sector to serious investors and industry executives. This special feature contains expert industry commentary through in-depth interviews with public company CEOs, Equity Analysts and Money Managers. The full issue is available by calling (212) 952-7433 or via The Wall Street Transcript Online.Topics covered: Cost Structure Variabilization - Consolidation Potential in Fragmented Industry - Commercial Rental Pricing Gains - Growth in Equipment Leasing Adoption RatesCompanies include: Ashtead Group (AHT.L); Caterpillar (CAT); Ford (F); H&E Equipment Services (HEES); Hertz (HTZ); and many more.In the following brief excerpt from the Equipment Rental & Leasing Services Report, expert analysts discuss the outlook for the sector and for investors.Gregory T. Swienton is Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Ryder System, Inc., a Fortune 500 transportation and supply chain management solutions company. Mr. Swienton joined Ryder in June 1999 as President and Chief Operating Officer, a position he held until becoming President and CEO in November 2000. A Member of Ryder's board of directors since June 1999, Mr. Swienton was named its Chairman in May 2002. Before joining Ryder, he was Senior Vice President-Growth Initiatives at Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation and also had served as the company's Senior Vice President of the coal and agricultural commodities business unit. He earned his MBA with an emphasis in finance from The University of Chicago and a BBA degree in marketing from Loyola University Chicago.TWST: Would you start with a history and overview of Ryder System, Inc.?Mr. Swienton: Jim Ryder founded the company in 1933, so next year we'll be celebrating 80 years in business. But even though we've been around a while, we still make basically the same promise to our customers - that they can rely on us to handle their transportation and logistics functions more efficiently, more cost effectively, and more consistently than what they could achieve by doing it themselves. So outsourcing to us allows our customers to focus on improving and growing their core business. We have some of the very same offerings that we've had since Jim Ryder created them, like the concept of a full-service lease. But over time, we've also infused our services with quality processes, innovations and quite a bit of technology, and we have many newer services for customers that, of course, are relevant in today's global sourcing and production environment.We report externally in two segments. Fleet Management Solutions is the largest and the oldest business segment, and it includes commercial truck rental, leasing, maintenance and some other auxiliary services, as well as all of our used-vehicle sales. We're one of the largest used-vehicle retail providers in the country. We do that through more than 50 used truck sale centers in North America. The other segment is Supply Chain Solutions, which includes Dedicated Contract Carriage as one of its largest service offerings. We've previously reported Dedicated Contract Carriage separately, but from a practical standpoint, this offering has been managed as a fully integrated component of our supply chain solutions for a number of years now. It's a turnkey solution that includes not just the equipment, but also the drivers and the routing and the scheduling, and it's connected to fully engineered supply chain solutions, such as planning and execution and just-in-time deliveries of components into large-scale assembly plants in industries such as high-tech automotive and others.TWST: Art Garcia, Ryder's CFO, recently told CFO Magazine: "In a recessionary environment, we're a cash flow story, and in a growth environment, we become an earnings story. What impact has the recent economic downturn had on Ryder as you look at the various industries and sectors the company deals with? Did it call for you to change the company's strategies or goals over the past 12 to 24 months?Mr. Swienton: This is a good point, and I think it's important to investors. In fact, the quote he used wasn't created by him or by us, that's actually a reflection of what some analysts have written about us. We thought that captured very well exactly the kind of investment we are. I think what we've tried to do over time is improve our business model. In fact, it is somewhat countercyclical, so that it does increase cash flow during downturns and it provides us the option to make a lot of progress when businesses are uncertain about making long-term commitments for our contractual product lines.TWST: In the 1990s, Ryder sold its consumer rental division that was well known. How big is your fleet today, and what's the makeup of the product lines?Mr. Swienton: It's about 40,000 commercial rental vehicles today. That's trucks, tractors and trailers, and those are the ones you see on the street that are white with the red-and-black logo. They're distinguished from the leased vehicles, which have our customers' logos on them. By far, the largest part of our fleet is the full-service lease offering, and that has probably now over 120,000 units, but those are not as easy to spot as a Ryder unit, because they have our customers' logos painted on the side of the trucks or trailers. And the only way you'll recognize it's a Ryder-leased, -maintained product is through a little sticker on the cab door or the driver door that will have a Ryder logo and a registration number.The Wall Street Transcript is a unique service for investors and industry researchers - providing fresh commentary and insight through verbatim interviews with CEOs and research analysts.

 Ryder's Swienton is Distinguished Speaker for 2010 - WorldCity, Inc.           HomeHR Americas 2017  Ryder’s Swienton is Distinguished Speaker for 2010By WorldCity Staff | November 22, 2010 | 0 His grandfather came to America from Poland and could not read or write until the day he died. His father was a union worker in Chicago. And today, Gregory T.  Swienton leads a Fortune 500 company, Ryder System Inc., with revenues topping $5 billion a year and 23,000 employees worldwide.Ryder CEO Greg Swienton, the first in his family to attend college, oversees a company with 23,000 employees. Swienton – the first person in his family to attend college — shared both personal and professional details  on Nov. 19 at WorldCity’s 2010 annual Global Connections Distinguished Speaker Program.The Chicago-born executive heads up an award-winning transport and logistics company founded in Miami Beach in 1933 and still based in South Florida. It focuses mainly on managing vehicle fleets, warehouses and distribution for large companies, mainly in North America, Europe and Asia.Ryder is known for its technology, even earning its first-ever patent recently for software;  for solid employee relations, often appearing in lists of best places to work for women and Hispanics; and for environmental efforts, recently becoming the first transport company to win a top “green” award.Swienton spent more than two years in a seminary during college and emphasizes values of community service, character and “getting things done the right way” for all employees. Those ethical values nurtured long-term “give continued performance and credibility in the organization,” he said.The Distinguished Speaker program is a departure from the normal panel discussion held during the nine other events at Global Connections each year. The Distinguished Speaker program was initiated in 2009 with Citrix CEO Mark Templeton.Here are some of Swienton’s answers to participant questions:On the future of the U.S. economy:  Ryder’s chief executive and chairman sees slow, multi-year growth ahead. The big constraint: uncertainty. “Until you have certainty on tax and regulation policy, you will not have large companies creating jobs,” he said.On tips for being a CEO: Build a strong staff. That means looking for and cultivating people who are honest, with high integrity, speak openly and who put politics aside. He referenced the book, “Speed of Trust” by Stephen Covey as helpful to build a strong team.Swienton sees no clear path to becoming a CEO, but generally advises:  “Do the very best in the job you’re in, and your career will take care of itself.”On free trade and the NAFTA trucking dispute: “There’s nothing better than trade and free trade,” Swienton said. Yet achieving it often means careful negotiation.For example, the North American Free Trade Agreement called for Mexican trucks to cross freely into the United States. But U.S. groups have resisted, “I think driven by the Teamsters, and their argument is safety,” Swienton said.The solution :  Involve the Teamsters and negotiate an accord that all “trucks have the same standards” to operate in the United States, he responded to FedEx’s Don Johnson.On factories moving nearshore:  As fuel costs rise, Swienton sees more factories moving back from Asia to Mexico to supply products for the U.S. market. That’s welcome news for Ryder, because “one of the jewels of our operation is Mexico and cross-border” business.On labor unions: “If you have management-employee relations that are truly bad, that’s when you tend to have unions… I think they are a bit of an anachronism,” Swienton responded to Hogan Group’s Steve Smith.Ryder has unions mainly in cities with long histories of unions, including New York, Boston, Chicago and Los Angeles. He sees unions as often politicized: “The fact that you have unions for government jobs is a way to take a lot of dues and use them for political purposes. And I find that inappropriate.” On trends in logistics: Look for miniaturization of goods.For example, newspapers used to be a key customer for transport companies, but newspapers are getting smaller or moving to the Internet. Books too are moving to e-readers. Over time, that means fewer trucks and cargo-hauling equipment needed, he responded to LanCargo’s Matias Lagos.On attracting more corporate headquarters to South Florida:  A South Florida headquarters helps in creating a “better-than-average” board of directors, because many senior executives or retired ones have homes in the area, Swienton said.  Wall Street also gives “disproportionate attention” to South Florida companies, because analysts and like to visit the sunny area during cold New   York winters, he said.But luring top managers to live in South  Florida presents a key challenge:  education for their children. Schools lag other areas, and executives invariably ask if they will have to send their kids to private school. “That’s one of the biggest deals,” he responded to Luis Casas of Florida International University’s School of Business   Administration.On appearing on the TV show Undercover Boss: Swienton said he’s been approached to do the show, but figures it would not work well with him. He’s very visible in the company, speaking and answering questions on live Web casts, sending out CDs for truckers to listen to while driving and visiting offices.“One of my objectives is not to be unknown and also to be approachable,” Swienton responded to Medtronic’s Cristina Palacios. “I would need a very serious disguise.”Global Connections is one of six event series organized by WorldCity to bring together executives of multinational companies to discuss international business topics. The Global Connections series is sponsored by FIU’s School of Business  Administration and real estate company Waterford at Blue Lagoon.The next Global Connections meeting is set for Jan. 28 to discuss the 2011 global economic outlook.Posted in Global ConnectionsLeave a Comment Cancel Reply CommentName (required)  Email (will not be published) (required)  Website    Upcoming Events Cyber Security Forum July 28 @ 8:00 am - 9:30 am 5th Annual HR Americas Conference September 28 @ 8:00 am - September 29 @ 5:00 pm View All Events Recent PostsThe new power of videoJune 23, 201710 Takeaways on Brazil’s Dramatic Political and Economic LandscapeMay 19, 2017Luxury Lifestyle Trends: Characteristics in Latin American WealthApril 21, 201710 facts on the state of social media from Discovery, Starbucks, and Western UnionApril 4, 2017The big, uncertain picture: 2017 Global Economic OutlookFebruary 1, 2017

Hi, we’re Co-op Cycles

We’re bikes born from a love of adventure, cooperatively designed with REI members and built for riders who seek the fun and freedom that comes from exploring the world on two wheels.



























Mountain

When fat tires and dirt trails combine, it’s magic, plain and simple. These low-maintenance fun machines have proven technologies and upgradability that’ll let you dial in a ride all your own.




Explore mountain bikes





























All-road

Road bikes for the adventurous, who know the ride shouldn’t end just because the pavement does. These are built strong and light, providing true versatility from pavement to gravel and beyond.




Explore all-road bikes





























Adventure

Made for loaded tours in ever-changing terrain, these are the bikes from which great stories come. Each model is purpose-built, fully rackable and ready to roll wherever you want to take it.




Explore adventure bikes





























City

Ditch the car and start living, people. Commuting, errands, beer runs and nights out are all made better when done on two wheels. Being part of the solution has never been so much fun.




Explore city bikes





























Kids

When you're a kid, your bike is your freedom. Start 'em out right with sturdy and reliable bikes that will take them from training wheels to singletrack in no time.




Explore kids' bikes

Adventure ready

Our bikes are adventure ready and built for versatility. Our members told us that their adventures don’t always fit into exact categories, so we made it easy to accessorize and upgrade.

























Built with great parts

We consciously choose high-quality components over just the latest-and-greatest tech. Meaning, spec-for-spec, our bikes are some of the best values around, and they’ll keep you riding happy for years.

























Cooperatively designed

We start our design process by talking with our riders. They tell us what matters most to them, and we use their feedback to build nothing but great bikes worth riding.
