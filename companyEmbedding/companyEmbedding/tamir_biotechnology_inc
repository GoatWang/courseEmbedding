Tamir Biotechnology, Inc. Key Developments

Tamir Biotechnology Announces Results from Pre-Clinical Investigational Study at Institute of Antiviral Research
Feb 22 16
Tamir Biotechnology announced results from a pre-clinical investigational study at the Institute of Antiviral Research at Utah State University. The study evaluated the anti-viral activity of ranpirnase in an established cell model of Zika virus infection. Overall, the study revealed that ranpirnase was active in blocking Zika virus relative to a control. In previous cell based studies, ranpirnase exhibited no cytotoxic effects at therapeutically effective dose levels. The clinical work with the Zika virus builds on years of work with other virally-caused pathologies such as Ebola. Results from a recent NIH-sponsored study on the Ebola virus gave 100% survival in ranpirnase-treated animals administered with therapeutic levels of the drug post-infection. The virus was undetectable in the serum of ranpirnase-treated mice at eight days post-infection. The company's clinical program is led by their phase II investigation of a topical formulation of ranpirnase in the treatment of HPV genital warts. This study is expected to begin enrollment in South America in February 2016. There are an estimated 14 million new and recurrent HPV infections per year in the US alone and the global HPV market is estimated to be over USD 2 billion in 2020. Ranpirnase for injection has been safely administered to over 1,000 subjects in previous oncology clinical trials.

Company Overview
 
TamirBio is a clinical stage antiviral therapeutics company engaged in the discovery and development of a new class of prophylactic and therapeutic drugs for the treatment of viruses and other pathological conditions. TamirBio’s first target is the human papilloma virus (HPV), the worldwide leading cause of genital warts.
Throughout 2013 and the first half of 2014, TamirBio operations were successfully restructured, including privatization of the company, to support the antiviral focus, along with attracting a strong team of experienced biotechnology professionals. The company has since successfully advanced its clinical pipeline, including completion of a randomized, controlled, double-blinded phase II study in patients with genital warts. In addition, the organization’s pre-clinical activities have documented broad-spectrum activity against all viral families along with securing independent, third party validation of antiviral properties for its leading licensing candidates.
 

Management
TamirBio is managed by senior executives with extensive experience in developing therapies to market.

Technology
Ranpirnase, a ribonuclease (RNase), is a member of the superfamily of enzymes which catalyze the degradation of RNA, and mediate several essential biological activities, namely, regulation of cell proliferation, maturation, differentiation, and cell death. Therefore, they are ideal candidates for the development of therapeutics for life-threatening diseases (including Ebola and autoimmune diseases), that require anti-proliferative and apoptotic properties.

RNases are a superfamily of enzymes which catalyze the degradation of RNA. Ranpirnase overcomes the known challenges of targeting RNA for therapeutic purposes.
 

Strong Antiviral Effect
Ranpirnase anti-viral activity was greater than 98% of all compounds seen by 3rd party testing lab.


Safety Profile
Over 1,000 patients dosed in FDA studies for cancer. Drug is known to be safe and should accelerate approval pathway.


Ready Formulation
TamirBio topical anti-viral application uses a well-understood, proprietary transdermal delivery system.


Physical Properties
A highly stable, heat-resistant single-chain protein of 104 amino acids. Molecular weight of 12 kDa.


Secure Manufacturing
TamirBio owns large quantity of Rana pipiens eggs and previous oncologic activity means manufacturing understood.


Mechanism Of Action
The compound is derived from frog eggs and preferentially enters infected cells. By degrading RNA, ranpirnase halts protein synthesis, thus blocking viral replication. Ranpirnase is shown to target tRNA and premiRNA, and has a mechanism similar to Dicer cytoplasmic RNase III. In addition to blocking protein synthesis machinery, the compound has been shown to up-regulate genes involved in key cell functions, including transcription regulation, cell cycle, apotosis, as well as the immune and stress response.

Pipeline | Tamir Biotechnology, Inc.

































                    Pipeline
                




 

HPV
TamirBio initial clinical target is the treatment of genital warts caused by HPV. Worldwide, there are 14 million new and recurrent genital wart infections caused by HPV (the most common sexually transmitted disease). Today’s therapeutic options all have shortcomings including high rates of recurrence, the need for continued application, or invasiveness. TamirBio asserts that clinicians and patients will adopt a topically applied option that demands only 1-2 applications with a high safety profile.

$1.4 Billion
TamirBio estimates the total HPV market opportunity at $1.4B.

4th largest threat 
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has named HPV the 4th largest health threat the U.S. will face in 2014

70%
While several types of HPV have been linked with cervical cancer, HPV types 16 and 18 are thought to account for roughly 70% of all cervical cancer cases

80%
Persistent HPV infection in the anal region is thought to be responsible for up to 80% of anal cancers.

360K
According to the CDC, the number of people who contract genital warts in the US every year.

TamirBio is currently enrolling a phase I OUS study of topical ranpiranse for anogential warts. Results are expected in Q1 2015.

Additional Clinical Pursuits
Beyond HPV, TamirBio has documented considerable anti-viral activity for the following licensing opportunities:



Ebola (EBV)
TamirBio ranpirnase is actively being considered as a standalone or adjuvant therapy in an effort to battle the recent worldwide EBV outbreaks.



Orthomyxoviruses (Influenza)
Reported to be between 500,000 and 1 million deaths/year from influenza.



Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV)
Expanding disease outbreak, with a total of just under 1,000 cases confirmed by World Health Organization.



Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)
Cost-effective treatment of HCV remains a worldwide challenge, despite the recent approval of new, efficacious HCV therapies.



Cytomegalovirus (CMV)
CMV disease is a common condition post-renal transplant, despite prophylaxis.



RSV
The CDC reported the highest number of RSV in the United States in the past 15 years due to an increasing number of individuals not vaccinated.



Rhabodviruses (Rabies)
55,000 deaths/year confirmed by World Health Organization.



Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)
Laboratory evaluation has demonstrated that ranpirnase is effective in inhibiting infection of epithelial cells by Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). This approach will serve important in using topical ranpirnase to prevent the spread of HIV.

AAD: Frog Enzyme Clears Genital Warts






 TamirBio


 April 1, 2015


 News
