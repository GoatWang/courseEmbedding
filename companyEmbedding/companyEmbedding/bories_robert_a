My New Orleans / January 2012 / Robert Bories

Robert Bories















 
 Robert Bories "i will provide for future generations in the community." 



Robert Bories
Chief Financial Officer, Gulf South Holding, Inc

Education: Isidore Newman High School; Bachelors in Business Administration and Accounting, Vanderbilt University.

Family: Wife, Bridget; son, Robert Jr., 24; daughters, Carrie, 21, Evelyn, 17.

Mentors: Jack R. Aron; William B. Burkenroad Jr.; and my father, Alan V. Bories.

	Robert Bories is a fourth-generation New Orleans business owner, continuing a long line of entrepreneurs. In 1898, his great-grandfather, Jacob Aron, started J. Aron and Company, a green coffee importing company that became one of the largest coffee importers in the United States. The business added a sugar refinery and moved into oil and gas exploration in the late 1950s. Bories joined the company in 1980 to help with accounting and finances.

	Bories served as President of J. Aron and Company until its liquidation.  In 1997 Bories joined Gulf South Operators, Inc.  He currently serves as CFO, and partner in Gulf South Holding, Inc., the parent company.

	Bories also continues the family tradition of giving back to the community. He sits on the Greater New Orleans Foundation board, the board of WYES public television and the Touro Infirmary Foundation.

	Every morning before work, Bories swims, runs or bicycles in Uptown New Orleans.
	 
Why is it important to give back to the community? Every generation uses what prior generations have built up for them. You need to provide for future generations. My dad taught me that. That’s community building...and making it better.
	 
Any advice for the next generation? It’s so important for young people to get involved in community activities. If you can work with a specific organization and get on their board, you get so much business experience. It’s a great way to network and meet people.
	 
How did the coffee business change from when your family started it? Years ago, every town had three or four roasters. Now you have these big guys like Maxwell and Folgers. Coffee is now going into another cycle, like the beer industry. We’re getting all these mico-roasters and micro-brewers.

iBERIABANK is proud to present a series of profiles featuring entrepreneurs, volunteer activists and artists whose work is making a difference. As iBERIABANK continues to make significant investments in our community, this special feature focuses on a few individuals who are doing the same.

	While we can not include everyone who is inspiring change and worthy of recognition, we are proud to highlight a select few who give tirelessly to our community with their time, energy and passion.





What do you do in your free time? We have a cottage in Pass Christian on the Mississippi Sound that we visit. It’s just about one of my favorite things to do.
	 
Any other hobbies? I’m fascinated with astronomy. I have the Google Sky smartphone app. I can hold up my smartphone at the sky and it will tell me where constellations and planets are. I like looking for planets; you can always predict where they are going to be.

The Frigorifico at Pto Bories, Balmaceda glacier in the distance
Robert Runyard





Puerto Bories is located about 3 km to the northwest of Puerto Natales, in the Ultima Esperanza province of Chile's XII region. It was founded as a company town for the Sociedad Explotadora Tierra del Fuego (SETF) in about 1913, although the site had been previously used for other smaller scale operations, including a tallow-production activity and a small sawmill.  The SETF operation, locally known as the "frigorifico" (freezer plant) consisted of a processing center for the large sheep stations (estancias) in the surrounding parts of Chile and Argentina, and the products included mutton, fat (tallow), wool, hides, and the "tripas" (offal) from sheep production.  The SETF operation contained its own power generation, which at first was fired by coal and wood, and later by natural gas that was (and is) available in the region. The coal and gas fired steam boilers powered an electrical generation system as well as the extensive refrigeration works necessary to freeze the meat products that were held for periods of time awaiting ships that would transport these products to markets, primarily in the United Kingdom.  Although the SETF was locally incorporated (in Chile) the bulk of the management and technology, and capital, was British or from the British Commonwealth.  
A small residential community was established surrounding the industrial plant and included housing for the managers and senior technical personnel, who were mostly though not exclusively British. There were also tennis courts and a swimming pool, and even a radio station.  Later, a hotel, the "Hotel Cisne de Cuello Negro," was added, and it is still in operation. The name of the hotel derives from the Black Necked Swan which is commonly seen in the waters near Bories and elsewhere in southern Chile. 
Today the "frigorifico" at Puerto Bories is a national monument and museum.  Guided tours are available for a nominal fee and these allow visitors to view the largest and best preserved operation of its type in all of Patagonia. The nearby residential area, or "Villa Frigorifico Bories," is privately owned. But with the white chimneys and picket fences, the houses here recall the style and times of a small British outpost. Part or or all of this text stems from the original article at: Robert Runyard, resident of Pto Bories

“Wonderfully Drinkable” Gambero Rosso
When Gambero Rosso’s annual wine guide drops, the Italian wine world stops, as winemakers scan the influential Italian magazine’s list to check their fortunes. Badia di Morrona Chianti I Sodi del Paretaio is a perennial Gambero favorite, having earned multiple “Due Bicchieri” (“Two Glasses”) honors in addition to praise as a “sincere, wonderfully drinkable wine.” The Wine Access clients who have stocked their cellars with past vintages of this “especially good value” with “exceptional breadth on the nose” couldn’t agree more, and they’ll be first to claim this gem from the excellent 2015 vintage by the case. 
The land of Badia di Morrona in the picturesque hills between Florence and Pisa was first worked by 11th century Benedictine monks. Today it is owned by Count Gaslini Alberti, who has invested a fortune in the winery over the past 50 years, outfitting winemaker Corrado Dal Piaz with a refurbished facility, enlarged cellars, and new casks and barrels.
Dal Piaz is notoriously hard on the Badia’s 282 acres of grapes, which soak up the sun on south- and south-eastern exposed slopes strewn with chunks of white limestone. He tightened spacing in the vines, orchestrating a Darwinian competition that leads to tiny berries of high skin-to-juice ratio. The result is Sangiovese of great richness and phenolic complexity.
2015’s long growing season allowed temperamental Sangiovese to reach rare, almost perfectly uniform maturity. The vines stretched deep underground, sucking up the mineral imprint of the poor soil, putting out a dark, crushed-red-fruit Sangiovese, infused with garrigue and bracketed by perfectly ripe tannins.
If you’re looking for vibrancy in your top-class Chianti, you’ll be hard-pressed to find anything quite like this luscious 2015. At $13.99 (and as Gambero Rosso would advise), this is one to be opened — and a case to be bought — without hesitation.








Tasting Notes



WineAccess Travel Log
The 2015 Badia di Morrona Chianti I Sodi del Paretaio is bright ruby to the edge, with a fabulous nose of wild berry, blue flower, and tangy spices. Juicy and high-toned on the attack, with sneaky weight and supple texture. This is textbook Chianti.

                                The 2014 Teeter-Totter Cabernet boasts the fingerprints of a master craftsman. Bold and dark ruby/purple in the glass, bursting with classic Cabernet notes of blackcurrant, mocha, anise, and subtle toasty notes framed by new wood cedar. Full bodied, boasting silky black fruit, alluring earthy notes and purple florals, a rich and lingering finish is braced by fine-grained tannins. Enjoy now for its opulent, youthful, black-fruited purity, or cellar for at least a decade.

Wine Growing Regions




Across the wine world, different regions are known for both producing different grapes and different styles of wine.
The distinction between Old World wine regions and New World wine regions is particularly important: as a sweeping generalization, Old World regions are known for producing wines that are more austere and terroir driven, while New World regions are known for producing wines with greater intensity. For example, Cabernet Sauvignon grapes grown in France will likely produce wines marked by earthiness and subtle fruit flavors, while Cabernet Sauvignon grapes grown in California will likely produce wines that are more fruit-forward.
But different wine regions are also often associated with the production of different grapes. For example, within France, Bordeaux is associated with red wines made primarily from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Cabernet Franc grapes, while Burgundy is associated with red wines made from the Pinot Noir grape. Use this page to find top-rated wines from wine regions throughout the world and learn about each region’s wine-making profile.
