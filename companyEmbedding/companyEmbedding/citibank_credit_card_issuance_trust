The customer service is right on point. They are always able to answer any questions that I may have unlike other companies out there. I have never had a problem with them. If I am late with a payment they work with me and give me a call to see what is going on and see if they can help. When I first applied for my card they walked me through all of the necessary steps to get it activated and told me about what the company could do for me. I even received a sign on bonus for opening a account with them. I was able to get 0% APR until the next year and they also had low transfer rates. Now that I have been with the company for a long time there is no way I would switch. I have also talked to some of my family and friends joining Citi and switching from the credit cards that they had. They are glad that they did and it is the only ones that they use now. They have also used Citi for loans and also personal banking.  Thank you, Citi!

Hi Marty,

It is a rule in the credit card industry that you cannot transfer balances between credit cards issued from the same bank. The reason you are not able to transfer your balance to the Citi Simplicity is because the AT&T Access More Credit Card is issued by Citibank as well. But 20% APR is very high, so I would certainly recommend transferring your balance to a low interest credit card to avoid paying a fortune in interest. Two cards to consider that aren't issued by Citibank would be the Chase Slate, which offers 15 months with 0% APR and no balance transfer fee, or the Discover It, which has 18 months with 0% APR.

The best card I have is Capital Visa, even though I had very  bad credit .First they gave me $300.00 limits so I build it up to $500.00. Then they sent me a Visa Credit application, I sent it for the heck of it I received the card from them I was shock.They gave me $10,000.00 limits on this visa card plus if I spent $2,000.00 in my first 2 month i will get 20,000 mile which i already got. I really feel that Capital One Is the best card. I use it for everything now just to get my mile to travel.

If you have less than perfect credit, but can pay your credit card bill on time every time, get yourself a credit card from Capital One. I have a friend with excellent credit and has been a Citi card holder since 1989. Never missed a payment. His Interest rate is 19.99%. Do yourself favor contact Capital One.

Your friend should ask to speak to an acct mgr; I've been with Citi for 22 years and have a very high credit score- my record with them is perfect and without pulling a report  they reduced my interest rate at the time to very low interest; the 19.99 makes no sense unless something negative has happened.

I have been with Citi '99 and have always had excellent customer service with them.  I have called them quite a few times with various requests and have always gotten quickly through to a person.  I have even received 2 calls over the years from them asking about questionable purchases.  Both were fraudulent purchases.  They denied the charges, I never saw a charge on my statement, and they issued new cards.  Awesome company to deal with.

	Citibank Credit Card Review

	Citibank credit cards are issued through Citi Bank, a subsidiary of CitiGroup, which is a multinational umbrella organization encompassing dozens of major corporations within the global financial services industry. Citi operates in more than 100 different countries and boasts approximately 200 million customers.

	Citi Bank was originally founded in 1812 as a New York banking company. In the late 1990s Citi merged with Travelers Group to form the current CitiGroup brand. In addition to its credit card business CitiGroup also operates stock brokerage firms, insurance companies, investment banking services, wealth management services, and other ventures that offer financial services and related products.

	Citibank credit cards include student credit cards, travel rewards cards, and Citi credit cards that have “thank you” points programs that earn valuable rewards as you shop and make purchases. The Citi Platinum Select lineup of credit cards, for example, provide zero introductory APR offers and the Citi PremierPass card is a generous rewards credit card offering bonus points for selected purchases.

Credit Card Securitization: Structure





                            Citibank Credit Card Master Trust I (CCIMT) was launched in May 1991, and issued in the public markets from May 1991 through December 1999. In September 2000, Citibank Credit Card Issuance Trust (CCCIT) became the current issuance vehicle out of the Master Trust, built to incorporate several structural features described below. CCIMT owns the receivables supporting both CCIMT and CCCIT issuance.

CCIMT's securitizations are backed by credit card receivables originated and serviced by Citibank, N.A. (rated Moody's A2/ S&P A/ Fitch A). Citibank became seller of receivables to, and servicer of, the Master Trust as a result of its merger with Citibank (South Dakota), N.A. on July 1, 2011. The eligibility criteria for the receivables that can be sold to the Master Trust include the following: the receivables must be from accounts owned by Citibank or an affiliate; the cardholders must not have been in a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy proceeding; the receivables must be denominated in U.S. dollars.
                              
CCCIT securities are issued in the form of notes, governed by New York law. CCCIT issues three classes of securities: Class A (rated Aaa/AAA/AAA), Class B (rated A2/AA/A), and Class C (rated Baa2/A/BBB). Classes B and C are subordinated to Class A and are part of the credit enhancement structure. The issuance of CCCIT Class B and C securities is independent of the issuance of Class A securities, however, Class A and Class B securities cannot be issued if the required enhancement for that Class (Classes B and C for A; Class C for B) is insufficient.                              
Following are the salient features of CCCIT securities. Please see the applicable Prospectus for a full description of the securities' mechanics. 
Classes issued by CCCIT are grouped together for the allocation of finance charge receivable cash flows. Thus, there is a single set of monthly cash flows that generates excess spread for all the notes, rather than for individual securities. This is commonly referred to as a "socialized" trust structure. Please refer to the applicable Prospectus for the allocation order of finance charge receivables. 
On an ongoing (monthly) basis, the Master Trust purchases credit card receivables to ensure that the face amount of securities remains outstanding until maturity, even though cardholders may pay any amount from the minimum up to the full amount owed.
Principal cash flows are shared across all Classes of notes. If any one Class is set to repay principal but its pro-rata share of principal cash flows (from the underlying credit card receivables) is insufficient, that Class can utilize principal from all other Classes that are not likewise needed to repay principal.
Credit enhancement, along with excess spread and an early amortization feature, support the ratings of each Class of security. For example, credit enhancement levels for CCCIT Class A term notes consist of 5.98291% of Class B notes and 7.97721% of Class C notes (expressed as a percentage of Class A notes). In addition, all CCCIT notes have the benefit of the Series 2009 Credit Card Participation Certificate, issued by CCIMT on May 1, 2009. The principal amount of the Series 2009 Certificate will generally be equal to 7.66865% of all outstanding CCCIT notes. The total credit enhancement levels for each class of notes are established by Moody's, Standard and Poor's, and Fitch, and are shown in the structure slide at the top of this page.

Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas is the trustee for CCIMT and is the indenture trustee for CCCIT. Its principal corporate trust office is located at 60 Wall Street, Attention: Corporate Trust & Agency Services - Structured Finance Services, New York, New York 10005.

The customer service is right on point. They are always able to answer any questions that I may have unlike other companies out there. I have never had a problem with them. If I am late with a payment they work with me and give me a call to see what is going on and see if they can help. When I first applied for my card they walked me through all of the necessary steps to get it activated and told me about what the company could do for me. I even received a sign on bonus for opening a account with them. I was able to get 0% APR until the next year and they also had low transfer rates. Now that I have been with the company for a long time there is no way I would switch. I have also talked to some of my family and friends joining Citi and switching from the credit cards that they had. They are glad that they did and it is the only ones that they use now. They have also used Citi for loans and also personal banking.  Thank you, Citi!

Hi Marty,

It is a rule in the credit card industry that you cannot transfer balances between credit cards issued from the same bank. The reason you are not able to transfer your balance to the Citi Simplicity is because the AT&T Access More Credit Card is issued by Citibank as well. But 20% APR is very high, so I would certainly recommend transferring your balance to a low interest credit card to avoid paying a fortune in interest. Two cards to consider that aren't issued by Citibank would be the Chase Slate, which offers 15 months with 0% APR and no balance transfer fee, or the Discover It, which has 18 months with 0% APR.

The best card I have is Capital Visa, even though I had very  bad credit .First they gave me $300.00 limits so I build it up to $500.00. Then they sent me a Visa Credit application, I sent it for the heck of it I received the card from them I was shock.They gave me $10,000.00 limits on this visa card plus if I spent $2,000.00 in my first 2 month i will get 20,000 mile which i already got. I really feel that Capital One Is the best card. I use it for everything now just to get my mile to travel.

If you have less than perfect credit, but can pay your credit card bill on time every time, get yourself a credit card from Capital One. I have a friend with excellent credit and has been a Citi card holder since 1989. Never missed a payment. His Interest rate is 19.99%. Do yourself favor contact Capital One.

Your friend should ask to speak to an acct mgr; I've been with Citi for 22 years and have a very high credit score- my record with them is perfect and without pulling a report  they reduced my interest rate at the time to very low interest; the 19.99 makes no sense unless something negative has happened.

I have been with Citi '99 and have always had excellent customer service with them.  I have called them quite a few times with various requests and have always gotten quickly through to a person.  I have even received 2 calls over the years from them asking about questionable purchases.  Both were fraudulent purchases.  They denied the charges, I never saw a charge on my statement, and they issued new cards.  Awesome company to deal with.

	Citibank Credit Card Review

	Citibank credit cards are issued through Citi Bank, a subsidiary of CitiGroup, which is a multinational umbrella organization encompassing dozens of major corporations within the global financial services industry. Citi operates in more than 100 different countries and boasts approximately 200 million customers.

	Citi Bank was originally founded in 1812 as a New York banking company. In the late 1990s Citi merged with Travelers Group to form the current CitiGroup brand. In addition to its credit card business CitiGroup also operates stock brokerage firms, insurance companies, investment banking services, wealth management services, and other ventures that offer financial services and related products.

	Citibank credit cards include student credit cards, travel rewards cards, and Citi credit cards that have “thank you” points programs that earn valuable rewards as you shop and make purchases. The Citi Platinum Select lineup of credit cards, for example, provide zero introductory APR offers and the Citi PremierPass card is a generous rewards credit card offering bonus points for selected purchases.

The customer service is right on point. They are always able to answer any questions that I may have unlike other companies out there. I have never had a problem with them. If I am late with a payment they work with me and give me a call to see what is going on and see if they can help. When I first applied for my card they walked me through all of the necessary steps to get it activated and told me about what the company could do for me. I even received a sign on bonus for opening a account with them. I was able to get 0% APR until the next year and they also had low transfer rates. Now that I have been with the company for a long time there is no way I would switch. I have also talked to some of my family and friends joining Citi and switching from the credit cards that they had. They are glad that they did and it is the only ones that they use now. They have also used Citi for loans and also personal banking.  Thank you, Citi!

Hi Marty,

It is a rule in the credit card industry that you cannot transfer balances between credit cards issued from the same bank. The reason you are not able to transfer your balance to the Citi Simplicity is because the AT&T Access More Credit Card is issued by Citibank as well. But 20% APR is very high, so I would certainly recommend transferring your balance to a low interest credit card to avoid paying a fortune in interest. Two cards to consider that aren't issued by Citibank would be the Chase Slate, which offers 15 months with 0% APR and no balance transfer fee, or the Discover It, which has 18 months with 0% APR.

The best card I have is Capital Visa, even though I had very  bad credit .First they gave me $300.00 limits so I build it up to $500.00. Then they sent me a Visa Credit application, I sent it for the heck of it I received the card from them I was shock.They gave me $10,000.00 limits on this visa card plus if I spent $2,000.00 in my first 2 month i will get 20,000 mile which i already got. I really feel that Capital One Is the best card. I use it for everything now just to get my mile to travel.

If you have less than perfect credit, but can pay your credit card bill on time every time, get yourself a credit card from Capital One. I have a friend with excellent credit and has been a Citi card holder since 1989. Never missed a payment. His Interest rate is 19.99%. Do yourself favor contact Capital One.

Your friend should ask to speak to an acct mgr; I've been with Citi for 22 years and have a very high credit score- my record with them is perfect and without pulling a report  they reduced my interest rate at the time to very low interest; the 19.99 makes no sense unless something negative has happened.

I have been with Citi '99 and have always had excellent customer service with them.  I have called them quite a few times with various requests and have always gotten quickly through to a person.  I have even received 2 calls over the years from them asking about questionable purchases.  Both were fraudulent purchases.  They denied the charges, I never saw a charge on my statement, and they issued new cards.  Awesome company to deal with.

	Citibank Credit Card Review

	Citibank credit cards are issued through Citi Bank, a subsidiary of CitiGroup, which is a multinational umbrella organization encompassing dozens of major corporations within the global financial services industry. Citi operates in more than 100 different countries and boasts approximately 200 million customers.

	Citi Bank was originally founded in 1812 as a New York banking company. In the late 1990s Citi merged with Travelers Group to form the current CitiGroup brand. In addition to its credit card business CitiGroup also operates stock brokerage firms, insurance companies, investment banking services, wealth management services, and other ventures that offer financial services and related products.

	Citibank credit cards include student credit cards, travel rewards cards, and Citi credit cards that have “thank you” points programs that earn valuable rewards as you shop and make purchases. The Citi Platinum Select lineup of credit cards, for example, provide zero introductory APR offers and the Citi PremierPass card is a generous rewards credit card offering bonus points for selected purchases.
