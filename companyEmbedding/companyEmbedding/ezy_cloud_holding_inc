	EZY CLOUD HOLDING, INC. FORMERLY ACROBOO, INC.






	Notes to Financial Statements




	June 30, 2016




	(Unaudited)







	NOTE 1 - GENERAL BACKGROUND INFORMATION






	Ezy Cloud Holding Inc., which may also be referred to as Ezy Cloud, the Company, we, our and us, was organized on June 14, 2010 (Date of Inception) under the laws of the State of Nevada, as AcroBoo, Inc.  We were incorporated as a subsidiary of Jagged Peak, Inc., a Nevada corporation.





	Ezy Cloud (formerly AcroBoo, Inc.) is an e-commerce and supply chain solutions and services provider. Ezy Cloud is built on an OMS software platform that empowers multi-national corporations to successfully sell online and through other sales channels at multiple distribution points.  Ezy Cloud will offer products through different websites that include, but is not limited to: sunglasses, camping equipment, coffee products, home tools and lighting products.  While managing our own online stores, we were often approached by companies who needed help establishing an online presence.  We plan to leverage our knowledge and infrastructure to offer services to assist other retailers expand their sales channel to the Web.  Our services have evolved to include online retailing, e-channel development, e-marketing and brand protection solutions.  Management views these as important abilities in running an on-line business and they are part of Ezy Clouds operation to sell products and protect its brands.  Ezy Cloud on occasion plans to sell these services to clients desiring to run an on-line business but does not have their own in-house expertise.  This is only expected to be a small portion of the business in the beginning years as Ezy Cloud builds up the number of products it sells on-line.





	Beginning in the quarter ended March 31, 2013, Ezy Cloud ceased providing services to customers and other activities that generate revenue. Ezy Cloud also ended its employment agreement with its sole paid employee. Significant costs after this period consisted primarily of audit and legal costs.





	Ezy Cloud plans to search for new solutions that harness the power of the Internet to help companies drive revenue and expand their business.  The Company takes possession of inventory and generates most of its revenues based on product sales or a percentage of the customers sales.  Management expects a small percent of its revenues will be generated from licensing its software products.






	NOTE 2  GOING CONCERN






	These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As of June 30, 2016, the Company had an accumulated deficit since inception of $689,299.





	The Company has not generated significant revenues to date, and its ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon the successful completion of additional financing arrangements and its ability to achieve and maintain profitable operations.





	Beginning in the quarter ended March 31, 2013, Ezy Cloud ceased providing services to customers and other activities that generate revenue.






	- 7 -













	Management plans to raise equity capital to finance the operating and capital requirements of the Company.  Amounts raised will be used for further development of the Companys products, to provide financing for marketing and promotion and for other working capital purposes.  While the Company is putting forth its best efforts to achieve the above plans, there is no assurance that any such activity will generate funds that will be available for operations.





	These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty.






	NOTE 3  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES






	The relevant accounting policies are listed below.






	Basis of Accounting






	The basis is United States generally accepted accounting principles.






	Cash and Cash Equivalents






	The Company considers all short-term investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash and cash equivalents.






	Use of Estimates






	In preparing financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.






	Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss






	Accumulated other comprehensive loss is equal to net loss.






	Advertising






	Advertising costs are expensed when incurred.  The Company incurred $0 of sales and marketing expenses, including advertising, for the six month periods ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015.






	Income Taxes






	The Company maintains deferred tax assets that reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. These deferred tax assets consist of net operating loss carryforwards. The net deferred tax asset has been fully offset by a valuation allowance because of the Companys history of losses. Utilization of operating losses and credits may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to ownership






	- 8 -













	Change provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended and similar state provisions. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization.





	The income tax provision for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015 are as follows:

	The Company provided a valuation allowance equal to the deferred income tax assets for the period ended June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 because it was not known whether future taxable income will be sufficient to utilize the loss carry forwards. The potential tax benefits arising from these loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2026.





	The Company did not identify any material uncertain tax positions. The Company did not recognize any interest or penalties for unrecognized tax benefits.





	The federal income tax returns of the Company are subject to examination by the IRS generally for three years after they file.






	- 9 -














	Year end






	The Companys fiscal year-end is December 31.






	Net Loss per Share






	Basic loss per share includes no dilution and is computed by dividing loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Dilutive loss per share reflects the potential dilution of securities that could share in the losses of the Company. Because the Company does not have any potentially dilutive securities, the accompanying presentation is only of basic loss per share.





	Fair Value of Financial Instruments





	Fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of June 30, 2016. The respective carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair values. These financial instruments include cash. Fair values were assumed to approximate carrying values for cash because they are short term in nature and their carrying amounts approximate fair values.





	Recent Accounting Pronouncements





	The Companys management has evaluated all the recently issued accounting pronouncements through the filing date of these financial statements and does not believe that any of these pronouncements will have a material impact on the Companys financial position and results of operations.

	For the six months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, general and administrative expenses were $3,555 and $2,000. Costs incurred in the six months ended June 30, 2015 were primarily costs related to the listing of the company shares on the over the counter market.





	In all financial statement periods since inception our auditor issued an opinion that our financial condition raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.









	Going Concern






	The financial statements included with this quarterly report have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.  





	Beginning in the quarter ended March 31, 2013, Ezy Cloud ceased providing services to customers and other activities that generate revenue. As of June 30, 2016, we have accumulated operating losses of approximately $689,299 since inception.





	Our ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon the successful completion of additional financing arrangements and our ability to achieve and maintain profitable operations.  Management plans to raise equity capital to finance our operating and capital requirements.  Amounts raised will be used for further development of our products, to provide financing for marketing and promotion, to secure additional property and equipment, and for other working capital purposes.  While we are putting forth our best efforts to achieve the above plans, there is no assurance that any such activity will generate funds that will be available for operations.





	These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.  Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might arise from this uncertainty.






	Summary of any product research and development that we will perform for the term of our plan of operation






	Our future success depends in part upon our ability to respond to changing customer requirements, develop and introduce new or enhanced products, and keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards. We focus our development efforts on several areas, including, but not limited to, enhancing operability of our products across distributed and changing heterogeneous hardware platforms, operating systems and relational databases, and adding functionality to existing products.  These development efforts will continue to focus on deploying applications within a multi-tiered ERP and supply chain environment, including the Internet.


















	- 16 -











	Expected purchase or sale of plant and significant equipment






	We do not anticipate the purchase or sale of any plant or significant equipment; as such items are not required by us at this time.









	Significant changes in the number of employees






	As of June 30, 2016, we did not have any paid employees.  We are dependent upon our officers and director for our future business development.  As our operations expand, we anticipate our need to hire additional employees, consultants and professionals; however, the exact number is not quantifiable at this time.






	Liquidity and Capital Resources






	As of June 30, 2016, Ezy Cloud had cash of approximately $0.





	Since our inception on June 14, 2010, Ezy Clouds operations utilized approximately $673,964 of cash. Prior to the share purchase by Mr. Lim Kor Kiat on December 22, 2015, the companys operations were funded primarily by the capital contributed by a previously related party, Jagged Peak.  





	On December 22, 2015, Mr. Lim Kor Kiat purchased an aggregate of 1,818,025 shares of our common stock (76.48% of the outstanding shares) from four former shareholders of the Company for an aggregate purchase price of $335,000.  Of this purchase price, approximately $27,401 was contributed to Ezy Cloud to pay legal, accounting and general and administrative costs. This amount is not expected to be repaid and was recorded by Ezy Cloud as a capital contribution.





	Cash contributed was approximately $673,964 as of June 30, 2016.  During the six months ended June 30, 2016, $49,735 was contributed to fund operating expenses by Lim Kor Kiat. This amount is not expected to be repaid and was recorded by Ezy Cloud as a capital contribution.





	A critical component of our operating plan impacting our continued existence is our ability to obtain additional capital through additional equity and/or debt financing.





	We have limited financial resources available, which has had an adverse impact on our liquidity, activities and operations.  These limitations have adversely affected our ability to obtain certain projects and pursue additional business.  Without realization of additional capital, it would be unlikely for us to continue as a going concern. In order for us to remain a Going Concern we will need to find additional capital.  Additional working capital may be sought through additional debt or equity private placements, additional notes payable to banks or related parties (officers, directors or stockholders), or from other funding sources at market rates of interest, or a combination of these.  The ability to raise necessary financing will depend on many factors, including the nature and prospects of any business to be acquired and the economic and market conditions prevailing at the time financing is sought. No assurances can be given that any necessary financing can be obtained on terms favorable to us, or at all.





	As a result of our current cash status, no officer or director received compensation through the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. We have no employment agreements in place with our officers.






	- 17 -













	Future funding could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities and/or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Any future acquisitions of other businesses, technologies, services or product(s) might require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which might not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all, and such financing, if available, might be dilutive.






	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements






	We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.






	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates






	Revenue Recognition:  We recognize revenue from product sales once all of the following criteria for revenue recognition have been met: pervasive evidence that an agreement exists; the services have been rendered; the fee is fixed and determinable and not subject to refund or adjustment; and collection of the amount due is reasonable assured.






	New Accounting Standards






	Management has evaluated recently issued accounting pronouncements through June 30, 2016 and concluded that they will not have a material effect on the financial statements as of June 30, 2016.

	CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.







	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures






	Our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in rules and forms adopted by the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.





	Management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Based on such evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.  Our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of the material weaknesses described below under Managements report on internal control over financial reporting, which are in the process of being remediated as described below under Management Plan to Remediate Material Weaknesses.






	Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting






	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.  Internal control over financial reporting, as defined in rules promulgated under the Exchange Act, is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and affected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:





	·


	pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;


	·


	provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and our Board of Directors; and


	·


	provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.






	- 20 -













	Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met and may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures.  Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper override.  Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process, and it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. Further, over time control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.





	Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2016.  In making its assessment, management used the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  Based on its assessment, management has concluded that we had certain control deficiencies described below that constituted material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting.  As a result, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of June 30, 2016.





	A material weakness is defined under SEC rules as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the companys internal controls.  As a result of managements review of the investigation issues and results, and other internal reviews and evaluations that were completed after the end of quarter related to the preparation of managements report on internal controls over financial reporting required for this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, management concluded that we had material weaknesses in our control environment and financial reporting process consisting of the following:





	1) lack of a functioning audit committee due to a lack of a majority of independent members and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures;





	We do not believe the material weaknesses described above caused any meaningful or significant misreporting of our financial condition and results of operations for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2016.  However, management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures, which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods.






	Management Plan to Remediate Material Weaknesses






	Management is pursuing the implementation of corrective measures to address the material weaknesses described above.  In an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses and enhance our internal controls, we have initiated, or plan to initiate, the following series of measures:





	We plan to appoint one or more outside directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to an audit committee resulting in a fully functioning audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures such as reviewing and approving estimates and assumptions made by management when funds are available to us.  






	- 21 -













	We believe the remediation measures described above will remediate the material weaknesses we have identified and strengthen our internal control over financial reporting.  We are committed to continuing to improve our internal control processes and will continue to diligently and vigorously review our financial reporting controls and procedures. As we continue to evaluate and work to improve our internal control over financial reporting, we may determine to take additional measures to address control deficiencies or determine to modify, or in appropriate circumstances not to complete, certain of the remediation measures described above.






	Changes in internal controls over financial reporting






	There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2016 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  This discussion is intended to further the reader's understanding of the Company's financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the Company's financial statements and related notes included elsewhere herein. This discussion also contains forward-looking statements. The Company's actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of the risks and uncertainties set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and in the Company's other SEC filings. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. The Company is not party to any transactions that would be considered "off balance sheet" pursuant to disclosure requirements under Item 303(c) of Regulation S-K.  Overview  Ezy Cloud is an e-commerce and supply chain solutions and services provider.  Critical Accounting Policies  The relevant accounting policies are listed below.  Basis of Accounting  The basis is United States generally accepted accounting principles.  Cash and Cash Equivalents  The Company considers all short-term investments with a maturity of six months or less at the date of purchase to be cash and cash equivalents.  Use of Estimates  In preparing financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Advertising  Advertising costs are expensed when incurred. The Company incurred $0 of sales and marketing expenses, including advertising, for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015.  Comprehensive Loss  Net loss is equal to comprehensive loss.  Income Taxes  The Company maintains deferred tax assets that reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. These deferred tax assets consist of net operating loss carryforwards. The net deferred tax asset has been fully offset by a valuation allowance because of the Company's history of losses. Utilization of operating losses and credits may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to ownership change provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended and similar state provisions. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization.  The income tax provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 are as follows:   For the For the Nine Months Nine Months Ended Ended September 30, September 30, 2016 2015 Current Tax Provision: Federal: Taxable income $ - $ - Total current tax provision $ - $ - Deferred Tax Provision: Federal: Loss carryforwards $ 643,619 $ 601,905 Loss for the period $ 77,647 $ 21,216 Net loss carryforward 721,266 623,121 Less valuation allowance (721,266) (623,121) Total net deferred tax Assets $ - $ -  The Company had the following deferred income tax assets as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:   September30, 2016 December 31, 2015 Net deferred tax assets $ $ 721,266 643,619 Less: Valuation allowance (721,266) (643,619) Total net deferred tax assets $ $ - -  The Company provided a valuation allowance equal to the deferred income tax assets for the period ended September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 because it was not known whether future taxable income will be sufficient to utilize the loss carry forwards. The potential tax benefits arising from these loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2026.The Company did not identify any material uncertain tax positions. The Company did not recognize any interest or penalties for unrecognized tax benefits.  The federal income tax returns of the Company are subject to examination by the IRS generally for three years after they file.  Year end  The Company's fiscal year-end is December 31.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  The Company's management has evaluated all the recently issued accounting pronouncements through the filing date of these financial statements and does not believe that any of these pronouncements will have a material impact on the Company's financial position and results of operations.  Results of Operations  Capitalization  The following table sets forth, as of September 30, 2016, the capitalization of Ezy Cloud on an actual basis. This table should be read in conjunction with the more detailed financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein.  September 30, 2016 Actual: Common stock, $0.001 par value; 75,000,000 shares authorized; $ 2,377,232 shares issued and outstanding at September 30, 2016 2,377 Additional paid-in capital 698,642 Deficit accumulated (721,266) Total stockholders' deficit $ (20,247)  Results of Operations for the nine months ended September30, 2015 and September 30, 2016  Beginning in the quarter ended March 31, 2013, Ezy Cloud ceased providing services to customers and other activities that generate revenue. Ezy Cloud also ended its employment agreement with its sole paid employee. Significant costs after this period consisted primarily of audit and legal costs. We plan to help our customers to place orders through customer services call centers and provide information on product and order status and return services.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2016 we earned $0 revenue.  Costs of revenue during these same periods were $0.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2016 accounting and audit expenses were $9,931 and $15,005. These costs were primarily the cost to prepare and audit the quarterly and annual reports required by the Securities and Exchange Commission.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2016, legal expenses were $10,345 and $52,653.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2016, general and administrative expenses were $940 and $9,989. Costs incurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were primarily costs related to the listing of the company shares on the over the counter market.  Results of Operations for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2016  For the three months ended September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2016 we earned $0 revenue.  Costs of revenue during these same periods were $0.  For the three months ended September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2016 accounting and audit expenses were $4,731 and $7,880. These costs were primarily the cost to prepare and audit the quarterly and annual reports required by the Securities and Exchange Commission.  For the three months ended September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2016, legal expenses were $4,165 and $17,653.  For the three months ended September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2016, general and administrative expenses were $120 and $6,434. Costs incurred in the three months ended September 30, 2016 were primarily costs related to the listing of the company shares on the over the counter market.  In all financial statement periods since inception our auditor issued an opinion that our financial condition raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.  Going Concern  The financial statements included with this quarterly report have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.  Beginning in the quarter ended March 31, 2013, Ezy Cloud ceased providing services to customers and other activities that generate revenue. As of September 30, 2016, we have accumulated operating losses of approximately $721,266 since inception.  Our ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon the successful completion of additional financing arrangements and our ability to achieve and maintain profitable operations. Management plans to raise equity capital to finance our operating and capital requirements. Amounts raised will be used for further development of our products, to provide financing for marketing and promotion, to secure additional property and equipment, and for other working capital purposes. While we are putting forth our best efforts to achieve the above plans, there is no assurance that any such activity will generate funds that will be available for operations.  These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might arise from this uncertainty.  Summary of any product research and development that we will perform for the term of our plan of operation  Our future success depends in part upon our ability to respond to changing customer requirements, develop and introduce new or enhanced products, and keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards. We focus our development efforts on several areas, including, but not limited to, enhancing operability of our products across distributed and changing heterogeneous hardware platforms, operating systems and relational databases, and adding functionality to existing products. These development efforts will continue to focus on deploying applications within a multi-tiered ERP and supply chain environment, including the Internet.  Expected purchase or sale of plant and significant equipment  We do not anticipate the purchase or sale of any plant or significant equipment; as such items are not required by us at this time.  Significant changes in the number of employees  As of September 30, 2016, we did not have any paid employees. We are dependent upon our officers and director for our future business development. As our operations expand, we anticipate our need to hire additional employees, consultants and professionals; however, the exact number is not quantifiable at this time.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  As of September 30, 2016, Ezy Cloud had cash of approximately $0.  Since our inception on June 14, 2010, Ezy Cloud's operations utilized approximately $673,964 of cash. Prior to the share purchase by Mr. Lim Kor Kiat on December 22, 2015, the company's operations were funded primarily by the capital contributed by a previously related party, Jagged Peak.  On December 22, 2015, Mr. Lim Kor Kiat purchased an aggregate of 1,818,025 shares of our common stock (76.48% of the outstanding shares) from four former shareholders of the Company for an aggregate purchase price of $335,000. Of this purchase price, approximately $27,401 was contributed to Ezy Cloud to pay legal, accounting and general and administrative costs. This amount is not expected to be repaid and was recorded by Ezy Cloud as a capital contribution.  Cash contributed was approximately $698,642 as of September 30, 2016. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, $74,413 was contributed to fund operating expenses by Lim Kor Kiat. This amount is not expected to be repaid and was recorded by Ezy Cloud as a capital contribution.  A critical component of our operating plan impacting our continued existence is our ability to obtain additional capital through additional equity and/or debt financing.  We have limited financial resources available, which has had an adverse impact on our liquidity, activities and operations. These limitations have adversely affected our ability to obtain certain projects and pursue additional business.  As a result of our current cash status, no officer or director received compensation through the period ended September 30, 2016. We have no employment agreements in place with our officers.  Future funding could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities and/or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  Revenue Recognition: We recognize revenue from product sales once all of the following criteria for revenue recognition have been met: pervasive evidence that an agreement exists; the services have been rendered; the fee is fixed and determinable and not subject to refund or adjustment; and collection of the amount due is reasonable assured.  New Accounting Standards  Management has evaluated recently issued accounting pronouncements through September 30, 2016 and concluded that they will not have a material effect on the financial statements as of September 30, 2016.

	BUSINESS.








	Overview of Current Operations








	Corporate History






	Ezy Cloud Holding Inc., which may also be referred to as Ezy Cloud, the Company, we, our and us, was organized on June 14, 2010 (Date of Inception) under the laws of the State of Nevada, as AcroBoo, Inc.  We were incorporated as a subsidiary of Jagged Peak, Inc., a Nevada corporation.





	On December 22, 2015, Lim Kor Kiat purchased 1,818,025 shares of common stock, constituting 76.48% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock, from three principal shareholders of the Company.  





	On January 15, 2016, the Company changed its corporate name from AcroBoo, Inc. to Ezy Cloud Holding Inc. The name change was effected through a parent/subsidiary short-form merger of Ezycloud Holding Inc., our wholly-owned Nevada subsidiary formed solely for the purpose of the name change, with and into us (the Merger). We were the surviving entity. To effectuate the Merger, we filed Articles of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada, along with a Plan and Agreement of Merger, and the Merger became effective on January 15, 2016.  Our board of directors approved the Merger.  In accordance with Section 92A.180 of the Nevada Revised Statutes, stockholder approval of the Merger was not required. On the effective date of the Merger, our name was changed to "Ezy Cloud Holding Inc."





	In connection with the name change, effective as of January 15, 2016, the trading symbol for the Companys common stock, which is quoted on the OTC market, changed from ARBJ to EZCL.





	On January 15, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted a resolution to change the Company's fiscal year end from September 30 to December 31, effective immediately as of the date of such resolution.






	Current Operations






	Beginning in the quarter ended March 31, 2013, EzyCloud ceased providing services to customers and other activities that generate revenue. EzyCloud also ended its employment agreement with its sole paid employee. Significant costs after this period consisted primarily of audit and legal costs. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, we did not conduct business operations except to evaluate potential lines of business.

	Ezy Cloud Holding Inc. Business Plan






	We are an online e-commerce and supply chain solutions and services provider. We intend to build a software platform to empower corporations to successfully sell online and through other sales channels at multiple distribution points.  We may also acquire or merge with an existing online business to consumer retail business, but we have no agreement for such an acquisition and there is no assurance such a transaction will occur.  We may offer products through different websites that include, but is not limited to: sunglasses, camping equipment, coffee products, home tools and lighting products. We plan to leverage our knowledge and infrastructure to offer services to assist other retailers to expand their sales channel to the Web.  Our services may evolve to include online retailing, e-channel development, e-marketing, and brand protection solutions.  Management views these as important abilities in running an on-line business and they may be part of our operation to sell products.  On occasion, we plan to sell these services to clients desiring to run an on-line business but do not have their own in-house expertise. .





	We plan to search for new solutions that harness the power of the Internet to help companies drive revenue and expand our business.  We will generate most of our revenues based on a percentage of the customers sales.  Management expects a small percent of our revenues will be generated from other marketing services.






	Sales and Marketing






	We plan to market our products and services through online direct and indirect sales channels. We will conduct our principal sales and marketing activities from corporate headquarters. We plan to develop a network of agents who will assist in selling our products globally. We intend to utilize these and future relationships with software and service organizations to enhance our sales and marketing position.  These independent distributors and resellers will distribute our product lines domestically and in foreign countries. These vendors will typically sell their own consulting and systems integration services in conjunction with licensing our products.





	We maysupport our sales activities by conducting a variety of marketing programs including online marketing, public relations, direct marketing, advertising, trade shows, product seminars, user group conferences and ongoing customer communication and industry analysts programs. 






	Customer Service and Support






	We may provide the following services and support to our customers:







	Training Support

	.  

	We may offer our customers a professional implementation program that facilitates rapid implementation of our software products.  We may help customers define the nature of their project and subsequently proceed through the implementation process.  We may provide training for all users and managers involved.  We may first establish measurable financial and logistical performance indicators and then evaluate them for conformance during and after implementation.  Additional services beyond implementation can include post-implementation reviews and benchmarks to further enhance the benefits to customers.







	General Training Services


	.  We may offer our customers post-delivery professional services consisting primarily of implementation and training services, for which we may charge on a daily basis.  Customers that purchase implementation services may receive assistance in integrating our solutions with existing software applications and databases.







	Maintenance and Support Services


	.  We may provide our customers with ongoing product support services.  Typically, we expect to enter into support or maintenance contracts with customers for an initial one year term, with a renewal for additional periods thereafter. Under these contracts, we may provide telephone consulting, product updates and releases of new versions of products previously purchased by the customer, as well as error reporting and correction services. We may also provide ongoing support and maintenance services through telephone, electronic mail and web-based support, using a call logging and tracking system for quality assurance.

	Competition






	Our competitors are diverse and offer a variety of solutions directed at various aspects of the supply chain, as well as the enterprise application market as a whole. Our existing competitors include:





	·


	Retailers such as Amazon, eBay and GSI and SureSource   





	To the extent such vendors develop or acquire systems with functionality comparable to our products, their significant installed customer base, long-standing customer relationships and ability to offer broad solutions could provide a competitive advantage over our products.





	We also expect to face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the market for collaborative e-commerce and supply chain management software and new products and technologies are introduced. In addition, current and potential competitors have made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties, thereby increasing the ability of their products to address the needs of our prospective customers.  Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among current and new competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share.  Increased competition could result in fewer customer orders, reduced gross margins and loss of market share.





	The principal competitive factors in the target markets in which we compete include product functionality and quality, domain expertise, integration technologies, product suite integration, breadth of products and related services such as customer support, training and implementation services.





	Many of our competitors and potential competitors have a broader worldwide presence, longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources, greater name recognition, and a larger installed base of customers than we have.  Some competitors have become more aggressive with their prices, payment terms and issuance of contractual implementation terms or guarantees.  In order to be successful in the future, we must continue to develop innovative software solutions and respond promptly and effectively to technological change and competitors innovations.  We may also have to lower prices or offer other favorable terms.  Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products.

	MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES.






	During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, our common stock was quoted on the OTC under the symbol EZCL with a high and low bid of $0.34 per share but minimal trading of our common stock. There can be no assurance that a public trading market will develop at that time or be sustained in the future.  Without an active public trading market, you may not be able to liquidate your shares without considerable delay, if at all.  If a market does develop, the price for our securities may be highly volatile and may bear no relationship to our actual financial condition or results of operations.  The many risks associated with an investment in our company, may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock.  Also, because of the relatively low price of our common stock, many brokerage firms may not effect transactions in the common stock.   






	Holders






	As of March 28, 2016 there were 84 holders of record for our common stock.  There were a total of 2,377,232 shares of common stock outstanding.  






	Dividends






	We have not declared any cash dividends, nor do we intend to do so. We are not subject to any legal restrictions respecting the payment of dividends, except that they may not be paid to render us insolvent. Dividend policy will be based on our cash resources and needs and it is anticipated that all available cash will be needed for our operations in the foreseeable future.






	Section 15(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934






	Our shares are covered by section 15(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, that imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker/dealers who sell such securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouses). For transactions covered by the Rule, the broker/dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase and have received the purchasers written agreement to the transaction prior to the sale. Consequently, the Rule may affect the ability of broker/dealers to sell our securities and also may affect your ability to sell your shares in the secondary market.





	Section 15(g) also imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker/dealers who sell penny securities. These rules require a one page summary of certain essential items. The items include the risk of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and secondary marketing; terms important in understanding of the function of the penny stock market, such as bid and offer quotes, a dealers spread and broker/dealer compensation; the broker/dealer compensation, the broker/dealers duties to its customers, including the disclosures required by any other penny stock disclosure rules; the customers rights and remedies in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions, and FINRAs toll free telephone number and the central number of the North American Administrators Association, for information on the disciplinary history of broker/dealers and their associated persons.  






	Securities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans






	We have no equity compensation plans and accordingly we have no shares authorized for issuance under an equity compensation plan.






	Status of our Public Offering






	On November 9, 2010, we filed a Registration Statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Form S-1.  The Registration was declared effective by the SEC on April 7, 2011. Jagged Peak (the former parent corporation) shareholders received one (1) share of our common stock for every ten (10) shares of Jagged Peak owned on May 10, 2011 the record date for a total of 1,627,232 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding.

	MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.






	This discussion is intended to further the readers understanding of the Companys financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the Companys financial statements and related notes included elsewhere herein. This discussion also contains forward-looking statements. The Companys actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of the risks and uncertainties set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report and in the Companys other SEC filings. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. The Company is not party to any transactions that would be considered off balance sheet pursuant to disclosure requirements under Item 303(c) of Regulation S-K.






	Overview






	Ezy Cloud is an e-commerce and supply chain solutions and services provider.






	Critical Accounting Policies






	The relevant accounting policies are listed below.






	Basis of Accounting






	The basis is United States generally accepted accounting principles.






	Cash and Cash Equivalents






	The Company considers all short-term investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash and cash equivalents.






	Use of Estimates






	In preparing financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.






	Advertising






	Advertising costs are expensed when incurred.  The Company incurred $0 of sales and marketing expenses, including advertising, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.






	Comprehensive Loss






	Net loss is equal to comprehensive loss.






	Income Taxes






	The Company maintains deferred tax assets that reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. These deferred tax assets consist of net operating loss carry forwards. The net deferred tax asset has been fully offset by a valuation allowance because of the Companys history of losses. Utilization of operating losses and credits may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to ownership change provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended and similar state provisions. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization.

	The Company provided a valuation allowance equal to the deferred income tax assets for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 because it was not known whether future taxable income will be sufficient to utilize the loss carry forwards. The potential tax benefits arising from these loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2025.





	The Company did not identify any material uncertain tax positions. The Company did not recognize any interest or penalties for unrecognized tax benefits.





	The federal income tax returns of the Company are subject to examination by the IRS generally for three years after they file.






	Year end






	The Companys fiscal year-end is December 31, 2016.






	- 8 -














	Recent Accounting Pronouncements






	The Companys management has evaluated all the recently issued accounting pronouncements through the filing date of these financial statements and does not believe that any of these pronouncements will have a material impact on the Companys financial position and results of operations.






	Revenue Recognition








	 


	In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09,

	Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Topic 

	606 (ASU 2014-09), to supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five-step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, it is possible more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing U.S. GAAP, including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. ASU 2014-09 is effective for us in our first quarter of fiscal 2018 using either of two methods: (i) retrospective to each prior reporting period presented with the option to elect certain practical expedients as defined within ASU 2014-09 (full retrospective method); or (ii) retrospective with the cumulative effect of initially applying ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of initial application and providing certain additional disclosures as defined per ASU 2014-09(modified retrospective method). We are currently assessing the materiality of the impact to our consolidated financial statements, and have not yet selected a transition approach.






	Disclosure of Going Concern Uncertainties

	In August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entitys Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (ASU 2014-15), to provide guidance on managements responsibility in evaluating whether there is substantial doubt about a companys ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. ASU 2014-15 is effective for us in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 with early adoption permitted. We do not believe the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2014-15 on the Companys financial statements will be material.






	Financial instrument






	In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (ASU 2016-01). The standard addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is not permitted. Accordingly, the standard is effective for us on September 1, 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.






	Statement of Cash Flows






	In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): The amendments in this Update apply to all entities, including both business entities and not-for-profit entities that are required to present a statement of cash flows under Topic 230. The amendments in this Update provide guidance on the following eight specific cash flow issues. The amendments are an improvement to GAAP because they provide guidance for each of the eight issues, thereby reducing the current and potential future diversity in practice described above. ASU 2016-15 is effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company is still evaluating the effect that this guidance will have on the Companys consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

	Results of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015






	Beginning in the quarter ended March 31, 2013, Ezy Cloud ceased providing services to customers and other activities that generate revenue. Ezy Cloud also ended its employment agreement with its sole paid employee. Significant costs after this period consisted primarily of audit and legal costs. We plan to help our customers to place orders through customer services call centers and provide information on product and order status and return services.





	For the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 we earned $0 revenue.





	Costs of revenue during these same periods were $0.





	For the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 accounting and audit expenses were $17,380 and $14,581. These costs were primarily the cost to prepare and audit the quarterly and annual reports required by the Securities and Exchange Commission.





	For the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, legal expenses were $93,646 and $17,832. These costs were primarily the cost to review the quarterly and annual reports required by the Securities and Exchange Commission.





	For the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, general and administrative expenses were $13,956 and $15,234. Costs incurred were primarily stock transfer agent maintenance expenses.





	For our December 31, 2016 and 2015 year-end financial statements, our auditor issued an opinion that our financial condition raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.






	Going Concern






	The financial statements included with this annual report have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.  





	Beginning in the quarter ended March 31, 2013, Ezy Cloud ceased providing services to customers and other activities that generate revenue. As of December 31, 2016, we have accumulated operating losses of approximately $ 768,601 since inception.





	Our ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon the successful completion of additional financing arrangements and our ability to achieve and maintain profitable operations.  Management plans to raise equity capital to finance our operating and capital requirements.  Amounts raised will be used for further development of our products, to provide financing for marketing and promotion, to secure additional property and equipment, and for other working capital purposes.  While we are putting forth our best efforts to achieve the above plans, there is no assurance that any such activity will generate funds that will be available for operations.





	These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.  Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might arise from this uncertainty.






	- 10 -














	Summary of any product research and development that we will perform for the term of our plan of operation






	Our future success depends in part upon our ability to respond to changing customer requirements, develop and introduce new or enhanced products, and keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards. We focus our development efforts on several areas, including, but not limited to, enhancing operability of our products across distributed and changing heterogeneous hardware platforms, operating systems and relational databases, and adding functionality to existing products.  These development efforts will continue to focus on deploying applications within a multi-tiered ERP and supply chain environment, including the Internet.






	Expected purchase or sale of plant and significant equipment






	We do not anticipate the purchase or sale of any plant or significant equipment; as such items are not required by us at this time.






	Significant changes in the number of employees






	As of December 31, 2016, we did not have any paid employees.  We are dependent upon our officers and director for our future business development.  As our operations expand, we anticipate our need to hire additional employees, consultants and professionals; however, the exact number is not quantifiable at this time.









	Liquidity and Capital Resources






	As of December 31 2016, we had cash of approximately $0.





	Since our inception on June 14, 2010, our operations utilized approximately $760,137 of cash. This was funded primarily by the capital contributed by a previously related party, Jagged Peak.





	On December 22, 2015, Mr. Lim Kor Kiat purchased an aggregate of 1,818,025 shares of our common stock (76.48% of the outstanding shares) from four former shareholders of the Company for an aggregate purchase price of $335,000.  Of this purchase price, approximately $27,401 was contributed to Ezy Cloud to pay legal, accounting and general and administrative costs. This amount is not expected to be repaid and was recorded by Ezy Cloud as a capital contribution.





	Cash contributed was approximately $760,137 as of December 31, 2016.





	A critical component of our operating plan impacting our continued existence is our ability to obtain additional capital through additional equity and/or debt financing.





	We have limited financial resources available, which has had an adverse impact on our liquidity, activities and operations.  These limitations have adversely affected our ability to obtain certain projects and pursue additional business.  Without realization of additional capital, it would be unlikely for us to continue as a going concern. In order for us to remain a Going Concern we will need to find additional capital.  Additional working capital may be sought through additional debt or equity private placements, additional notes payable to banks or related parties (officers, directors or stockholders), or from other funding sources at market rates of interest, or a combination of these.  The ability to raise necessary financing will depend on many factors, including the nature and prospects of any business to be acquired and the economic and market conditions prevailing at the time financing is sought. No assurances can be given that any necessary financing can be obtained on terms favorable to us, or at all.





	As a result of our current cash status, no officer or director received compensation through the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. We have no employment agreements in place with our officers.





	Future funding could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities and/or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Any future acquisitions of other businesses, technologies, services or product(s) might require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which might not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all, and such financing, if available, might be dilutive.






	- 11 -














	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements






	We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.






	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates






	Revenue Recognition:  We recognize revenue from product sales once all of the following criteria for revenue recognition have been met: pervasive evidence that an agreement exists; the services have been rendered; the fee is fixed and determinable and not subject to refund or adjustment; and collection of the amount due is reasonable assured.






	New Accounting Standards






	Management has evaluated recently issued accounting pronouncements through December 31, 2016 and concluded that they will not have a material effect on the financial statements as of December 31, 2016.

	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM



	To the Board of Directors and

	Stockholders of Ezy Cloud Holding Inc.


	We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Ezy Cloud Holding Inc as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2016. Ezy Cloud Holding Inc.s management is responsible for these financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.


	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.


	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Ezy Cloud Holding Inc. as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2016, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.


	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company's present financial situation raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans regarding this situation are also discussed in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	EZY CLOUD HOLDING, INC. FORMERLY ACROBOO, INC.








	Notes to Financial Statements




	December 31, 2016




	(Audited)







	NOTE 1 - GENERAL BACKGROUND INFORMATION






	Ezy Cloud Holding Inc., which may also be referred to as Ezy Cloud, the Company, we, our and us, was organized on June 14, 2010 (Date of Inception) under the laws of the State of Nevada, as AcroBoo, Inc.  We were incorporated as a subsidiary of Jagged Peak, Inc., a Nevada corporation.





	Ezy Cloud (formerly AcroBoo, Inc.) is an e-commerce and supply chain solutions and services provider. Ezy Cloud is built on an OMS software platform that empowers multi-national corporations to successfully sell online and through other sales channels at multiple distribution points.  Ezy Cloud will offer products through different websites that include, but is not limited to: sunglasses, camping equipment, coffee products, home tools and lighting products.  While managing our own online stores, we were often approached by companies who needed help establishing an online presence.  We plan to leverage our knowledge and infrastructure to offer services to assist other retailers expand their sales channel to the Web.  Our services have evolved to include online retailing, e-channel development, e-marketing and brand protection solutions.  Management views these as important abilities in running an on-line business and they are part of Ezy Clouds operation to sell products and protect its brands.  Ezy Cloud on occasion plans to sell these services to clients desiring to run an on-line business but does not have their own in-house expertise.  This is only expected to be a small portion of the business in the beginning years as Ezy Cloud builds up the number of products it sells on-line.





	Beginning in the quarter ended March 31, 2013, Ezy Cloud ceased providing services to customers and other activities that generate revenue. Ezy Cloud also ended its employment agreement with its sole paid employee. Significant costs after this period consisted primarily of audit and legal costs.





	Ezy Cloud plans to search for new solutions that harness the power of the Internet to help companies drive revenue and expand their business.  The Company takes possession of inventory and generates most of its revenues based on product sales or a percentage of the customers sales.  Management expects a small percent of its revenues will be generated from licensing its software products.






	NOTE 2  GOING CONCERN






	These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As of December 31, 2016, the Company has an accumulated deficit since inception of $ 768,601.





	The Company has not generated significant revenues to date, and its ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon the successful completion of additional financing arrangements and its ability to achieve and maintain profitable operations.





	Beginning in the quarter ended March 31, 2013, Ezy Cloud ceased providing services to customers and other activities that generate revenue.





	Management plans to raise equity capital to finance the operating and capital requirements of the Company.  Amounts raised will be used for further development of the Companys products, to provide financing for marketing and promotion and for other working capital purposes.  While the Company is putting forth its best efforts to achieve the above plans, there is no assurance that any such activity will generate funds that will be available for operations.





	These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty.






	- 19 -














	NOTE 3  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES






	The relevant accounting policies are listed below.






	Basis of Accounting






	The basis is United States generally accepted accounting principles.






	Cash and Cash Equivalents






	The Company considers all short-term investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash and cash equivalents.






	Use of Estimates






	In preparing financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.






	Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss






	Accumulated other comprehensive loss is equal to net loss.






	Advertising






	Advertising costs are expensed when incurred.  The Company incurred $0 of sales and marketing expenses, including advertising, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.






	Income Taxes






	The Company maintains deferred tax assets that reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. These deferred tax assets consist of net operating loss carryforwards. The net deferred tax asset has been fully offset by a valuation allowance because of the Companys history of losses. Utilization of operating losses and credits may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to ownership change provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended and similar state provisions. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization.

	The Company provided a valuation allowance equal to the deferred income tax assets for the period ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 because it was not known whether future taxable income will be sufficient to utilize the loss carry forwards. The potential tax benefits arising from these loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2025.





	The Company did not identify any material uncertain tax positions. The Company did not recognize any interest or penalties for unrecognized tax benefits.





	The federal income tax returns of the company are subject to examination by the IRS generally for three years after they file.






	Year end






	The Companys fiscal year-end is December 31, 2016.

	Net Loss per Share






	Basic loss per share includes no dilution and is computed by dividing loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Dilutive loss per share reflects the potential dilution of securities that could share in the losses of the Company. Because the Company does not have any potentially dilutive securities, the accompanying presentation is only of basic loss per share.






	Fair Value of Financial Instruments






	Fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of December 31, 2016. The respective carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair values. These financial instruments include cash. Fair values were assumed to approximate carrying values for cash because they are short term in nature and their carrying amounts approximate fair values.






	Recent Accounting Pronouncements






	The Companys management has evaluated all the recently issued accounting pronouncements through the filing date of these financial statements and does not believe that any of these pronouncements will have a material impact on the Companys financial position and results of operations.






	Revenue Recognition






	In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09,

	Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Topic 

	606 (ASU 2014-09), to supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five-step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, it is possible more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing U.S. GAAP, including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. ASU 2014-09 is effective for us in our first quarter of fiscal 2018 using either of two methods: (i) retrospective to each prior reporting period presented with the option to elect certain practical expedients as defined within ASU 2014-09 (full retrospective method); or (ii) retrospective with the cumulative effect of initially applying ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of initial application and providing certain additional disclosures as defined per ASU 2014-09(modified retrospective method). We are currently assessing the materiality of the impact to our consolidated financial statements, and have not yet selected a transition approach.






	Disclosure of Going Concern Uncertainties

	In August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entitys Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (ASU 2014-15), to provide guidance on managements responsibility in evaluating whether there is substantial doubt about a companys ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. ASU 2014-15 is effective for us in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 with early adoption permitted. We do not believe the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2014-15 on the Companys financial statements will be material.






	Financial instrument






	In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (ASU 2016-01). The standard addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is not permitted. Accordingly, the standard is effective for us on September 1, 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.






	- 22 -














	Statement of Cash Flows






	In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): The amendments in this Update apply to all entities, including both business entities and not-for-profit entities that are required to present a statement of cash flows under Topic 230. The amendments in this Update provide guidance on the following eight specific cash flow issues. The amendments are an improvement to GAAP because they provide guidance for each of the eight issues, thereby reducing the current and potential future diversity in practice described above. ASU 2016-15 is effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company is still evaluating the effect that this guidance will have on the Companys consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

	CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.







	Previous independent registered public accounting firm






	On December 31, 2015, the Company terminated Paula S. Morelli, CPA P.C., 21 Martha Street, Freeport, New York 11520 (Morelli) as its auditor.   The reports of Morelli on the financial statements as of and for the year ended September 30, 2014 did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, and such reports were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principle, except that the reports contained an explanatory paragraph which noted that there was substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.





	During the years ended September 30, 2014 and 2013 and during the subsequent interim period through June 30, 2015,  we have not had (a) any disagreements with Morelli on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to Morellis satisfaction, would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreements in its reports on our consolidated financial statements for such years or in connection with its reports in any subsequent interim period through the date of dismissal; or (b) reportable events, as described under Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.





	On January 7, 2016, we delivered a copy of this report to Morelli and Morelli issued its response agreeing with the foregoing, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 16.2.






	New independent registered public accounting firm



	 


	On December 31, 2015, we engaged Kenne Ruan, CPA, P.C. (Kenne Ruan), independent registered public accounting firm, as our principal independent accountant with the approval of our board of directors. We have not consulted with Kenne Ruan on any accounting issues prior to engaging it as our new auditor.





	During the two most recent fiscal years and through the date of engagement, we have not consulted with Kenne Ruan regarding either:












	 




	 






	1.




	The application of accounting principles to any specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on our financial statements, and neither a written report was provided to us nor oral advice was provided that Morelli concluded was an important factor considered by us in reaching a decision as to the accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or






	  




	  






	2.




	Any matter that was either subject of disagreement or event, as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv)(A) of Regulation S-K and the related instruction to Item 304 of Regulation S-K, or a reportable event, as that term is explained in Item 304(a)(1)(iv)(A) of Regulation S-K.

	CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.







	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures






	Our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in rules and forms adopted by the


	SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.





	Management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Based on such evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.  Our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of the material weaknesses described below under Managements report on internal control over financial reporting, which are in the process of being remediated as described below under Management Plan to Remediate Material Weaknesses.






	- 25 -














	Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting






	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.  Internal control over financial reporting, as defined in rules promulgated under the Exchange Act, is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and affected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:





	·


	pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;


	·


	provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and our Board of Directors; and


	·


	provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements  





	Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met and may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures.  Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper override.  Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process, and it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. Further, over time control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.





	Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016.  In making its assessment, management used the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  Based on its assessment, management has concluded that we had certain control deficiencies described below that constituted material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting.  As a result, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2016.





	A material weakness is defined under SEC rules as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the companys internal controls.  As a result of managements review of the investigation issues and results, and other internal reviews and evaluations that were completed after the end of quarter related to the preparation of managements report on internal controls over financial reporting required for this annual report on Form 10-K, management concluded that we had material weaknesses in our control environment and financial reporting process consisting of the following:





	1) lack of a functioning audit committee due to a lack of a majority of independent members and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures;





	We do not believe the material weaknesses described above caused any meaningful or significant misreporting of our financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.  However, management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures, which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods.






	Management Plan to Remediate Material Weaknesses






	Management is pursuing the implementation of corrective measures to address the material weaknesses described above.  In an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses and enhance our internal controls, we have initiated, or plan to initiate, the following series of measures:






	- 26 -













	We plan to appoint one or more outside directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to an audit committee resulting in a fully functioning audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures such as reviewing and approving estimates and assumptions made by management when funds are available to us.  





	We believe the remediation measures described above will remediate the material weaknesses we have identified and strengthen our internal control over financial reporting.  We are committed to continuing to improve our internal control processes and will continue to diligently and vigorously review our financial reporting controls and procedures. As we continue to evaluate and work to improve our internal control over financial reporting, we may determine to take additional measures to address control deficiencies or determine to modify, or in appropriate circumstances not to complete, certain of the remediation measures described above.






	Changes in internal controls over financial reporting






	There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2016 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

	Mr. Furlong resigned as a director effective January 20, 2016.


	 





	All compensation received by our officers and directors has been disclosed.





	There are no stock option, retirement, pension, or profit sharing plans for the benefit of our officers and directors.






	Long-Term Incentive Plan Awards






	We do not have any long-term incentive plans that provide compensation intended to serve as incentive for performance at this time.






	Indemnification






	Under our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the corporation, we may indemnify an officer or director who is made a party to any proceeding, including a law suit, because of his position, if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in our best interest. We may advance expenses incurred in defending a proceeding. To the extent that the officer or director is successful on the merits in a proceeding as to which he is to be indemnified, we must indemnify him against all expenses incurred, including attorneys fees. With respect to a derivative action, indemnity may be made only for expenses actually and reasonably incurred in defending the proceeding, and if the officer or director is judged liable, only by a court order. The indemnification is intended to be to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of the State of Nevada.





	Regarding indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933, which may be permitted to directors or officers under Nevada law, we are informed that, in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, indemnification is against policy, as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.






	Term of Office






	Our directors are appointed for a one-year term to hold office until the next annual meeting of our shareholders or until removed from office in accordance with our bylaws.  Our officers are appointed by our board of directors and hold office until removed by the board.

	We currently do not have employment agreements with our officers.  Our officers have agreed to take no salary until we can generate enough revenues to support salaries on a regular basis.  Our officers will not be compensated for services previously provided. They will receive no accrued remuneration.






	Equity Incentive Plan






	We have not adopted an equity incentive plan and no stock options or similar instruments have been granted to our officers.






	Audit Committee Financial Expert






	We do not have an audit committee financial expert nor do we have an audit committee established at this time.






	Code of Ethics and Audit Financial Expert






	We do not currently have a Code of Ethics.  We do not have an audit committee, nominating committee, or audit committee financial expert.  






	Potential Conflicts of Interest






	We are not aware of any current or potential conflicts of interest with any of our officer/directors.

	SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS.






	The following table lists, the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by (i) each person or entity known to our Company to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of the outstanding common stock; (ii) each officer and director of our Company; and (iii) all officers and directors as a group, following the Distribution.  Information relating to beneficial ownership of common stock by our principal shareholders and management is based upon information furnished by each person using beneficial ownership concepts under the rules of the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Under these rules, a person is deemed to be a beneficial owner of a security if that person has or shares voting power, which includes the power to vote or direct the voting of the security, or investment power, which includes the power to vote or direct the voting of the security.  The person is also deemed to be a beneficial owner of any security of which that person has a right to acquire beneficial ownership within 60-days.  Under the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules, more than one person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the same securities, and a person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of securities as to which he or she may not have any pecuniary beneficial interest.  Except as noted below, each person has sole voting and investment power.






	- 32 -













	The Company believes that all persons named in the table have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of common stock shown as being owned by them.  Percentage of Class is based on 2,377,232 shares that were issued and outstanding as of March 27, 2017.

	We believe that all persons named have full voting and investment power with respect to the shares indicated, unless otherwise noted in the table. Under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, a person (or group of persons) is deemed to be a beneficial owner of a security if he or she, directly or indirectly, has or shares the power to vote or to direct the voting of such security, or the power to dispose of or to direct the disposition of such security.  Accordingly, more than one person can be a beneficial owner of the same security.  A person is also deemed to be a beneficial owner of any security, which that person has the right to acquire within 60 days, such as options or warrants to purchase our common stock.
