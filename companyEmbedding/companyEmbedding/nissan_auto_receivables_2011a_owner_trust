                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Issuing Entity: Depositor: Servicer/Sponsor and Administrator: Owner of the Certificates: Indenture Trustee: Owner Trustee: Statistical Cut-off Date: Nissan Auto Receivables 2010-A Owner Trust. The issuing entity was established by a trust agreement dated as of August 13, 2010, as amended and restated by an amended and restated trust agreement dated as of the closing date, and will be the entity that issues the notes and the certificates. Nissan Auto Receivables Corporation II. Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation. Nissan Auto Receivables Corporation II. U.S. Bank National Association. Wilmington Trust Company. The statistical cut-off date for the receivables in the statistical pool used in preparing the statistical information presented in this prospectus supplement is July 31, 2010, which we refer to as the statistical cut-off date. Cut-off Date: Close of business on August 31, Closing Date: September 22, Statistical Information: Issuing Entity Property: The statistical information in this prospectus supplement is based on the receivables in a statistical pool as of the statistical cut-off date. The receivables sold to the issuing entity on the closing date will be selected from the statistical pool. The characteristics of the receivables sold to the issuing entity on the closing date may vary somewhat from the characteristics of the receivables in the statistical pool described in this prospectus supplement, although the sponsor and the depositor do not expect the variance to be material. The primary assets of the issuing entity will consist of a pool of motor vehicle retail installment contracts, referred to herein as the receivables, collections on the receivables and security interests in the vehicles financed by the receivables, together with the amounts on deposit in various accounts. The receivables will be sold by the sponsor to the depositor and then transferred by the depositor to the issuing entity in exchange for the notes and the certificates. The principal balance of the receivables as of the statistical cut-off date was $1,433,452, As of the statistical cut-off date, the receivables had the following characteristics: Number of Receivables... 85,638 Average Principal Balance... $16, Weighted Average Annual Percentage Rate % Approximate Weighted Average Original Payments to Maturity payments Approximate Weighted Average Remaining Payments to Maturity payments S-411 You should refer to The Issuing Entity Property of the Issuing Entity in this prospectus supplement and The Issuing Entities Property of the Issuing Entities in the accompanying prospectus and The Receivables in this prospectus supplement and in the accompanying prospectus for more information on the property of the issuing entity. Offered Notes: Certificates: The offered notes will consist of the Class A-1 notes, the Class A-2 notes, the Class A-3 notes and the Class A-4 notes, as described on the cover page of this prospectus supplement. The issuing entity will also issue at least $57,771, initial principal amount of certificates. The issuing entity is not offering the certificates to the public. The certificates will initially be issued to the depositor. The certificates will represent fractional undivided interests in the issuing entity and will not bear interest. The issuing entity will not make any distributions on the certificates until all interest on and principal of the notes have been paid in full. Terms of the Notes: Distribution Dates: Interest on and principal of each class of notes will generally be payable on the 15th day of each month, unless the 15th day is not a business day, in which case such payment will be made on the following business day. The first payment will be made on October 15, Denominations: The notes will be issued in minimum denominations of $25,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof in book-entry form. Per annum interest rates: Each class of notes will have a fixed rate of interest (which we refer to in this prospectus supplement as fixed rate notes ), as follows: Class Interest Rates A % A % A % A % Interest Periods and Payments: Interest on the notes will accrue in the following manner, except that on the first distribution date, interest on all of the notes will accrue from and including the closing date: Class From (including) To (excluding) Day Count Convention A-1... Prior Distribution Date Current Distribution Date Actual/360 A th of prior month 15 th of current month 30/360 A th of prior month 15 th of current month 30/360 A th of prior month 15 th of current month 30/360 Interest payments on each class of notes will be paid on a pro rata basis. S-512 Principal: Principal of the notes will be payable on each distribution date (other than after the occurrence of an event of default under the indenture and an acceleration of the notes (unless and until the acceleration has been rescinded)) to the Class A-1 notes, until the principal amount thereof is reduced to zero, then to the Class A-2 notes, until the amount thereof is reduced to zero, then to the Class A-3 notes, until the amount thereof is reduced to zero and then to the Class A-4 notes, until the amount thereof is reduced to zero, in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (a) the sum of the aggregate outstanding principal balance of (i) the notes and (ii) the certificates as of the preceding distribution date (after giving effect to any principal payments made on the notes on such distribution date) (or, in the case of the first distribution date, as of the closing date) over (b) the adjusted pool balance as of the end of the related collection period. At any time the adjusted pool balance shall equal the pool balance minus the yield supplement overcollateralization amount, which represents the aggregate present value (as described below) of the receivables for the related collection period. No distributions will be paid on the certificates until the principal amount of each class of notes has been reduced to zero. Principal payments on the notes as described above will be made from all available amounts after the servicing fee has been paid, certain advances have been reimbursed, and after payment of interest on the notes. Interest and Principal Payments after an Event of Default On each distribution date after the occurrence of an event of default under the indenture and an acceleration of the notes (unless and until the acceleration has been rescinded), available amounts (after the servicing fee has been paid and certain advances have been reimbursed to the servicer) will be applied to pay: (a) first, interest on the Class A-1 notes, the Class A-2 notes, the Class A-3 notes and the Class A-4 notes, on a pro rata basis, based on the amount of the noteholders interest distributable amount due to such class, until the accrued interest on such classes has been paid in full, (b) second, principal of the Class A-1 notes, until the outstanding principal balance of the Class A-1 notes has been paid in full, and (c) third, principal of the Class A-2 notes, the Class A-3 notes and the Class A-4 notes, on a pro rata basis, based on the respective outstanding principal balances of those classes of notes, until the outstanding principal balances of those classes of notes have been paid in full. Final Scheduled Distribution Dates The issuing entity must pay the outstanding principal balance of each class of notes by its final scheduled distribution date as follows: Class Final Scheduled Distribution Date A-1... October 17, 2011 A-2... March 15, 2013 A-3... July 15, 2014 A-4... September 15, 2016 You should refer to The Notes Payments of Principal and Distributions on the Notes Calculation of Available Amounts in this prospectus supplement for more detailed information regarding payments of principal. Servicing/Administration: Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation will service the receivables. In addition, Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation will perform the administrative obligations S-613 required to be performed by the issuing entity or the owner trustee under the indenture and the trust agreement. On each distribution date, Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation will be paid a fee for performing its servicing and administrative obligations in an amount equal to one-twelfth of 1.00% of the principal balance of the receivables as of the last day of the preceding collection period, or in the case of the first distribution date, as of the cut-off date. As additional compensation, the servicer will be entitled to retain all supplemental servicing fees, if any. The servicing fee, together with any portion of the servicing fee that remains unpaid from prior distribution dates, will be payable on each distribution date from available amounts on deposit in the collection account, and will be paid to the servicer prior to the payment of principal of and interest on the notes. You should refer to Description of the Transfer and Servicing Agreements Compensation for Servicer and Administrator in this prospectus supplement for more detailed information regarding the servicing fees to be paid to Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation. Optional Purchase: The notes will be paid in full on any distribution date on which the servicer exercises its option to purchase the receivables. The servicer may purchase the receivables when the outstanding aggregate principal balance of the receivables, as of the last day of the related collection period, declines to 5% or less of the original aggregate principal balance of the receivables on the cut-off date. You should refer to Description of the Transfer and Servicing Agreements Optional Purchase in this prospectus supplement for more detailed information regarding the optional purchase of the notes. Enhancement: The enhancement of the offered notes will be the subordination of the certificates, the reserve account and the yield supplement overcollateralization amount. The enhancement is intended to protect you against losses and delays in payments on your notes by absorbing losses on the receivables and other shortfalls in cash flows. Subordination of the Certificates: The certificates have an initial principal balance of at least $57,771, and represent approximately 4.25% of the initial principal amount of all the notes and the certificates. The certificates will not receive any distributions until all interest on and principal of the notes have been paid in full. The certificates will not receive any interest payments. Reserve Account: On each distribution date, the issuing entity will use funds in the reserve account for distribution to the noteholders to cover any shortfalls in interest and principal required to be paid on the notes. The reserve account will be pledged to the indenture trustee to secure the notes, but will not be an asset of the issuing entity. If the principal amount of a class of notes is not paid in full on the related final scheduled distribution date, the indenture trustee will withdraw amounts from the reserve account (if available) to pay that class in full. The sale and servicing agreement sets forth the specified reserve account balance, which is the amount that is required to be on deposit in the reserve account. On the closing date, the depositor will make a deposit of at least $3,398, into the reserve account, which is approximately 0.25% of the initial outstanding S-714 principal balance of all of the notes and the certificates. Thereafter, on any distribution date while the notes are outstanding, the reserve account will generally be required to have a balance of not less than 0.25% of the adjusted pool balance as of the cut-off date. On each distribution date, after making required payments to the servicer and on the notes, and prior to making payments on the certificates, the issuing entity will make a deposit into the reserve account to fund and maintain the specified reserve account balance. On each distribution date, after all appropriate deposits to and withdrawals from the reserve account, any amounts on deposit in the reserve account in excess of the specified reserve account balance will be released to the depositor. Funds in the reserve account on each distribution date will be available to cover shortfalls in payments on the notes as described in Subordination; Reserve Account; YSOC Amount Reserve Account in this prospectus supplement. You should refer to Subordination; Reserve Account; YSOC Amount Reserve Account in this prospectus supplement for more detailed information regarding the reserve account. The Yield Supplement Overcollateralization Amount: The yield supplement overcollateralization amount with respect to any collection period and the related distribution date is the aggregate amount by which the principal balance as of the last day of such collection period of each receivable (other than a receivable that is a non-collectible or defaulted receivable or a receivable that has been purchased by the servicer or repurchased by the depositor due to certain breaches), exceeds the present value of each scheduled payment of each such receivable assuming the discount rate of that receivable is the greater of 2.50% or the receivable s contract rate and that the scheduled payments (assumed to be equal monthly payments that amortize the receivable principal balance to zero, using its contract rate, over the remaining term of the contract) are made on the last day of each month and each month has 30 days. On the closing date, the yield supplement overcollateralization amount will equal approximately 0.54% of the pool balance as of the cut-off date. You should refer to Subordination; Reserve Account; YSOC Amount YSOC Amount in this prospectus supplement for more detailed information regarding the yield supplement overcollateralization amount. Events of Default: The notes are subject to specified events of default under the indenture, as described under Description of the Indenture Events of Default and Remedies Upon an Event of Default in the accompanying prospectus. Among these events are the failure to pay interest on the notes for five days after it is due or the failure to pay principal on a class of notes on the related final scheduled distribution date. If an event of default under the indenture occurs and continues, the indenture trustee or the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding principal amount of the notes may declare the notes to be immediately due and payable. That declaration, under some circumstances, may be rescinded by the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding principal amount of the notes. After an event of default under the indenture and the acceleration of the notes, funds on deposit in the collection account and any of the issuing entity s other accounts with respect to the affected notes will be applied to pay interest on and S-815 principal of the notes in the order and amounts described under Distributions on the Notes Priority of Payments in this prospectus supplement. After an event of default under the indenture, the indenture trustee may, under certain circumstances: 1. institute proceedings in its own name for the collection of all amounts then payable on the notes; 2. take any other appropriate action to protect and enforce the rights and remedies of the indenture trustee and the noteholders; or 3. sell or otherwise liquidate the assets of the issuing entity, if the event of default under the indenture relates to a failure by the issuing entity to pay interest on the notes when due or principal of the notes on their respective final scheduled distribution dates. For more information regarding the events constituting an event of default under the indenture and the remedies available following an event of default, you should refer to The Notes Events of Default; Rights Upon Event of Default in this prospectus supplement and Description of the Indenture Events of Default and Remedies Upon an Event of Default in the accompanying prospectus. Tax Status: On the closing date, and subject to certain assumptions and qualifications, Winston & Strawn LLP, special tax counsel to the issuing entity, will render an opinion to the effect that the notes will be classified as debt for federal income tax purposes and that the issuing entity will not be characterized as an association or a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation. The depositor will agree, and the noteholders and beneficial owners will agree by accepting the notes or a beneficial interest therein, to treat the notes as debt for federal income tax purposes. You should refer to Material Federal Income Tax Consequences in this prospectus supplement and Material Federal Income Tax Consequences in the accompanying prospectus. ERISA Considerations: The notes are eligible for purchase by employee benefit plans and individual retirement accounts, subject to those considerations and conditions discussed under ERISA Considerations in this prospectus supplement and in the accompanying prospectus. You should refer to ERISA Considerations in this prospectus supplement and in the accompanying prospectus. If you are a benefit plan fiduciary considering purchase of the notes you are, among other things, encouraged to consult with your counsel in determining whether all required conditions have been satisfied. Eligibility for Purchase by Money Market Funds: The Class A-1 notes will be eligible for purchase by money market funds under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. A money market fund is encouraged to consult its legal advisors regarding the eligibility of such notes under Rule 2a-7 and whether an investment in the Class A-1 notes satisfies that fund s investment policies and objectives. Each class of notes will have the following CUSIP number: S-916 Class CUSIP Number A B AA1 A B AB9 A B AC7 A B AD5 Ratings: The sponsor expects that the notes will receive credit ratings from two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations hired by the sponsor to assign ratings on the notes, or rating agencies. The ratings of the notes will address the likelihood of payment of principal and interest on the notes according to their terms. Each rating agency rating the notes will monitor the ratings using its normal surveillance procedures. Any rating agency may change or withdraw an assigned rating at any time. Any rating action taken by one rating agency may not necessarily be taken by the other rating agency. No transaction party will be responsible for monitoring any changes to the ratings on the notes. S-1017 RISK FACTORS You should consider the following risk factors (and the factors set forth under Risk Factors in the accompanying prospectus) in deciding whether to purchase the notes of any class. Payment priorities increase risk of loss or delay in payment to certain notes Based on the priorities described under The Notes Payments of Interest and The Notes Payments of Principal in this prospectus supplement, classes of notes that receive payments, particularly principal payments, before other classes will be repaid more rapidly than the other classes. In addition, because principal of each class of notes will be paid sequentially (so long as no event of default has occurred), classes of notes that have higher (i.e. 2 being higher than 1) sequential numerical class designations will be outstanding longer and therefore will be exposed to the risk of losses on the receivables during periods after other classes have been receiving most or all amounts payable on their notes, and after which a disproportionate amount of credit enhancement may have been applied and not replenished. Because of the priority of payment on the notes, the yields of the Class A-2 notes, the Class A-3 notes and the Class A-4 notes will be relatively more sensitive to losses on the receivables and the timing of those losses than the Class A-1 notes. Accordingly, the Class A-2 notes will be relatively more sensitive to losses on the receivables and the timing of those losses than the Class A-1 notes; the Class A-3 notes will be relatively more sensitive to losses on the receivables and the timing of those losses than the Class A-1 notes and the Class A-2 notes; and the Class A- 4 notes will be relatively more sensitive to losses on the receivables and the timing of those losses than the Class A-1 notes, the Class A-2 notes and the Class A-3 notes. If the actual rate and amount of losses exceed your expectations, and if amounts in the reserve account are insufficient to cover the resulting shortfalls, the yield to maturity on your notes may be lower than anticipated, and you could suffer a loss. Classes of notes that receive payments earlier than expected are exposed to greater reinvestment risk, and classes of notes that receive principal later than expected are exposed to greater risk of loss. In either case, the yields on your notes could be materially and adversely affected. Credit scores and historical loss experience may not accurately predict the likelihood of losses on the automobile loans Information regarding credit scores for the automobile loans obtained at the time of origination of the related receivables is presented in The Receivables Characteristics of the Receivables General in this prospectus supplement. A credit score purports only to be a measurement of the relative degree of risk a borrower represents to a lender, i.e., that a borrower with a higher score is statistically expected to be less likely to default in payment than a borrower with a lower score. Neither the depositor, the sponsor nor any other party makes any representations or warranties as to any obligor s current credit score or the actual performance of any receivable or that a particular credit score should be relied upon as a basis for an expectation that a receivable will be paid in accordance with its terms. Recently, the United States has experienced a period of economic slowdown that may adversely affect the performance and market value of your notes. Rising unemployment and the continued lack of availability of credit may lead to increased default rates. This period may be accompanied by decreased consumer demand for automobiles and declining values of automobiles securing outstanding automobile loan contracts, which weakens collateral coverage and increases the S-1118 amount of a loss in the event of default. Significant increases in the inventory of used automobiles during periods of economic slowdown may also depress the prices at which repossessed automobiles may be sold or delay the timing of these sales. While certain economic factors have improved recently, other factors, such as unemployment, have not yet improved. If the economic downturn worsens or continues for a prolonged period of time, delinquencies and losses with respect to automobile loans generally could increase again. See Prepayments, Delinquencies, Repossessions and Net Credit Losses Delinquency, Repossession and Credit Loss Information and Static Pool Information in this prospectus supplement for delinquency and loss information regarding certain automobile loans originated and serviced by Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation. Geographic concentration of the states of origination of the receivables may increase the risk of loss on your investment As of the statistical cut-off date, Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation s records indicate that the addresses of the originating dealers of the receivables were most highly concentrated in the following states: Percentage of Aggregate Statistical Cut-off Date Principal Balance Texas % California % Florida % New York % Illinois % No other state, based on the addresses of originating dealers, accounted for more than 5.00% of the total principal balance of the receivables as of the statistical cutoff date. Economic conditions or other factors affecting these states in particular could adversely affect the delinquency, credit loss, repossession or prepayment experience of the issuing entity. Prepaid simple interest contracts may affect the weighted average life of the notes If an obligor on a simple interest contract makes a payment on the contract ahead of schedule, the weighted average life of the notes could be affected. This is because the additional payment will be treated as a principal prepayment and applied to reduce the principal balance of the related contract and the obligor will generally not be required to make any scheduled payments during the period for which it has paid ahead. During this prepaid period, interest will continue to accrue on the principal balance of the contract, as reduced by the application of the additional payment, but the obligor s contract would not be considered delinquent. While the servicer may be required to make interest advances during this period, no principal advances will be made. Furthermore, when the obligor resumes his required payments, the payments so paid may be insufficient to cover the interest that has accrued since the last payment by the obligor. This situation will continue until the regularly scheduled payments are once again sufficient to cover all accrued interest and to reduce the principal balance of the contract. The payment by the issuing entity of the prepaid principal amount of the notes will generally shorten the weighted average life of the notes. However, depending on the length of time during which a prepaid simple interest contract is not amortizing as described above, the weighted average life of the notes may be extended. In addition, to the extent the servicer makes advances on a prepaid S-1219 simple interest contract that subsequently goes into default, the loss on this contract may be larger than would have been the case had advances not been made because liquidation proceeds for the contract will be applied first to reimburse the servicer for its advances. Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation s portfolio of retail installment contracts has historically included simple interest contracts that have been paid ahead by one or more scheduled monthly payments. There can be no assurance as to the number of contracts in the issuing entity that may become prepaid simple interest contracts as described above or the number or the principal amount of the scheduled payments that may be paid ahead. Risk of loss or delay in payment may result from delays in the transfer of servicing due to the servicing fee structure You may suffer losses due to receivables with low annual percentage rates Because the servicing fee is structured as a percentage of the principal balance of the receivables, the amount of the servicing fee payable to the servicer may be considered insufficient by potential replacement servicers if servicing is required to be transferred at a time when much of the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the receivables has been repaid. Due to the reduction in the servicing fee as described in the foregoing, it may be difficult to find a replacement servicer. Consequently, the time it takes to effect the transfer of servicing to a replacement servicer under those circumstances may result in delays and/or reductions in the interest and principal payments on your notes. The receivables may include receivables that have annual percentage rates that are less than the interest rates on the notes. If that is the case, interest paid on the higher coupon receivables and collections related to the yield supplement overcollateralization amount will compensate for the lower coupon receivables. Excessive prepayments on the higher coupon receivables may adversely impact your notes by reducing the amount of interest available in the future to make payments on your notes. A reduction, withdrawal or qualification of the ratings on your notes, or the issuance of unsolicited ratings on your notes, could adversely affect the market value of your notes and/or limit your ability to resell your notes The ratings on the notes are not recommendations to purchase, hold or sell the notes and do not address market value or investor suitability. The ratings reflect the rating agency s assessment of the creditworthiness of the receivables, the credit enhancement on the notes and the likelihood of repayment of the notes. There can be no assurance that the receivables and/or the notes will perform as expected or that the ratings will not be reduced, withdrawn or qualified in the future as a result of a change of circumstances, deterioration in the performance of the receivables, errors in analysis or otherwise. None of the depositor, the sponsor or any of their affiliates will have any obligation to replace or supplement any credit enhancement or to take any other action to maintain any ratings on the notes. If the ratings on your notes are reduced, withdrawn or qualified, it could adversely affect the market value of your notes and/or limit your ability to resell your notes. The sponsor has hired two rating agencies and will pay them a fee to assign ratings on the notes. The sponsor has not hired any other nationally recognized statistical rating organization, or NRSRO, to assign ratings on the notes and is not aware that any other NRSRO has assigned ratings on the notes. However, under newly effective SEC rules, information provided to a hired rating agency S-1320 for the purpose of assigning or monitoring the ratings on the notes is required to be made available to each NRSRO in order to make it possible for such non-hired NRSROs to assign unsolicited ratings on the notes. An unsolicited rating could be assigned at any time, including prior to the closing date, and none of the depositor, the sponsor, the underwriters or any of their affiliates will have any obligation to inform you of any unsolicited ratings assigned after the date of this prospectus supplement. NRSROs, including the hired rating agencies, have different methodologies, criteria, models and requirements. If any non-hired NRSRO assigns an unsolicited rating on the notes, there can be no assurance that such rating will not be lower than the ratings provided by the hired rating agencies, which could adversely affect the market value of your notes and/or limit your ability to resell your notes. In addition, if the sponsor fails to make available to the non-hired NRSROs any information provided to any hired rating agency for the purpose of assigning or monitoring the ratings on the notes, a hired rating agency could withdraw its ratings on the notes, which could adversely affect the market value of your notes and/or limit your ability to resell your notes. Potential investors in the notes are urged to make their own evaluation of the creditworthiness of the receivables and the credit enhancement on the notes, and not to rely solely on the ratings on the notes. Lack of liquidity in the secondary market may adversely affect your notes The secondary market for asset-backed securities could be experiencing and may in the future experience significant reduced liquidity. This period of illiquidity may continue and may adversely affect the market value of your notes. See Risk Factors You may have difficulty selling your notes and/or obtaining your desired price due to the absence of a secondary market in this prospectus supplement. The rate of depreciation of certain financed vehicles could exceed the amortization of the outstanding principal amount of the loan on those financed vehicles, which may result in losses There can be no assurance that the value of any financed vehicle will be greater than the outstanding principal amount of the related receivable. New vehicles normally experience an immediate decline in value after purchase because they are no longer considered new. As a result, it is highly likely that the principal amount of the related receivable will exceed the value of the related vehicle during the earlier years of a receivable s term. Defaults during these earlier years are likely to result in losses because the proceeds of repossession are less likely to pay the full amount of interest and principal owed on the receivable. The frequency and amount of losses may be greater for receivables with longer terms, because these receivables tend to have a somewhat greater frequency of delinquencies and defaults and because the slower rate of amortization of the principal balance of a longer term receivable may result in a longer period during which the value of the financed vehicle is less than the remaining principal balance of the receivable. The frequency and amount of losses may also be greater for obligors with little or no equity in their vehicles because the principal balances for such obligors are likely to be greater for similar loan terms and vehicles than for obligors with a more significant amount of equity in the vehicle. Additionally, although the frequency of delinquencies and defaults tends to be greater for receivables secured by used vehicles, the amount of any loss tends to be greater for receivables secured by new vehicles because of the higher rate of depreciation described above and the recent decline in used car prices (especially light-duty truck and sport utility vehicles prices). S-1421 You may have difficulty selling your notes and/or obtaining your desired price due to the absence of a secondary market The issuing entity will not list the notes on any securities exchange. Therefore, in order to sell your notes, you must first locate a willing purchaser. The absence of a secondary market for the notes could limit your ability to resell them. Currently, no secondary market exists for the notes. We cannot assure you that a secondary market will develop. The underwriters intend to make a secondary market for the notes by offering to buy the notes from investors that wish to sell. However, the underwriters are not obligated to offer to buy the notes and may stop making offers at any time. In addition, the underwriters offered prices, if any, may not reflect prices that other potential purchasers would be willing to pay were they given the opportunity. There have been times in the past where there have been very few buyers of asset-backed securities and, thus, there has been a lack of liquidity. There may be similar lack of liquidity at times in the future. The amounts received upon disposition of the financed vehicles may be adversely affected by discount pricing incentives, marketing incentive programs and other factors As a result of the foregoing restrictions and circumstances, you may not be able to sell your notes when you want to do so or you may not be able to obtain the price that you wish to receive. Discount pricing incentives or other marketing incentive programs on new cars by Nissan North America, Inc. or by its competitors that effectively reduce the prices of new cars may have the effect of reducing demand by consumers for used cars. Additionally, the pricing of used vehicles is affected by the supply and demand for those vehicles, which, in turn, is affected by consumer tastes, economic factors (including the price of gasoline), the introduction and pricing of new car models and other factors. The reduced demand for used cars resulting from discount pricing incentives or other marketing incentive programs introduced by Nissan North America, Inc. or any of its competitors or other factors may reduce the prices consumers will be willing to pay for used cars, including vehicles that secure the receivables. As a result, the proceeds received by the issuing entity upon any foreclosures of financed vehicles may be reduced and may not be sufficient to pay the underlying receivables. S-1522 THE ISSUING ENTITY General The Nissan Auto Receivables 2010-A Owner Trust (the Issuing Entity ) is a Delaware statutory trust governed in accordance with the amended and restated trust agreement dated as of the Closing Date (the Trust Agreement ), between Nissan Auto Receivables Corporation II, as depositor (the Depositor ), and Wilmington Trust Company, as owner trustee (the Owner Trustee ). The Issuing Entity will not engage in any activity other than as duly authorized in accordance with the terms of the Basic Documents. On the Closing Date, the authorized purposes of the Issuing Entity will be limited to: 1. acquiring, holding and managing the Receivables and the other assets of the Issuing Entity and proceeds therefrom; 2. issuing the Notes and the Certificates; 3. making payments on the Notes and the Certificates; 4. entering into and performing its obligations under each Basic Document to which it is a party; 5. subject to compliance with the Basic Documents, engaging in such other activities as may be required in connection with conservation of the Issuing Entity s property and the making of distributions to the holders of the Notes and Certificates; and 6. engaging in other activities that are necessary, suitable or convenient to accomplish the foregoing or are incidental to or connected with those activities. The term Basic Documents refers to the Indenture, together with the Trust Agreement, the Purchase Agreement, the Certificate of Trust, the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the Administration Agreement and the Securities Account Control Agreement. The Issuing Entity will initially be capitalized through (a) the issuance of the Notes and at least $57,771, aggregate principal amount of the certificates (the Certificates ), and (b) the YSOC Amount, in the initial amount of $7,321, The Issuing Entity will exchange the Notes and the Certificates for the Receivables and certain other assets from the Depositor pursuant to the Sale and Servicing Agreement among the Issuing Entity, the Servicer and the Depositor (the Sale and Servicing Agreement ). The Notes that will be received by the Depositor in exchange for the Receivables are being offered hereby. The Certificates will initially be issued to the Depositor. Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation ( NMAC ) will be appointed to act as the servicer of the Receivables (in that capacity, the Servicer ). The Servicer will service the Receivables pursuant to the Sale and Servicing Agreement and will be compensated for those services as described under Description of the Transfer and Servicing Agreements Compensation for Servicer and Administrator in this Prospectus Supplement and Description of the Transfer and Servicing Agreements Servicing Compensation in the accompanying Prospectus. Pursuant to agreements between NMAC and the Dealers, each Dealer will repurchase from NMAC those contracts that do not meet specified representations and warranties made by the Dealer. These Dealer repurchase obligations are referred to in this Prospectus Supplement as Dealer Recourse. Those representations and warranties relate primarily to the origination of the contracts and the perfection of the security interests in the related financed vehicles, and do not relate to the creditworthiness of the related Obligors or the collectability of those contracts. The sales by the Dealers of installment contracts to NMAC do not generally provide for recourse against the Dealers for unpaid amounts in the event of a default by an Obligor, other than in connection with the breach of the aforementioned representations and warranties. Notes owned by the Issuing Entity, the Depositor, the Servicer and their respective affiliates will be entitled to all benefits afforded to the Notes except that they generally will not be deemed outstanding for the purpose of making requests, demands, authorizations, directions, notices, consents or other actions under the Basic Documents unless the Issuing Entity, the Depositor, the Servicer or any of their respective affiliates, either individually or collectively constitute all the owners of all the Notes outstanding.

Depositor, Certificates in an aggregate principal amount equal to
the Original Certificate Balance and evidencing the entire

unless there shall appear on such Certificate a certificate of
authentication substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit
A , executed by the Owner Trustee or the Owner Trustee’s
authenticating agent, by manual or facsimile signature of a Trust

Certificates in authorized denominations of a like aggregate amount
dated the date of authentication by the Owner Trustee or any
authenticating agent. At the option of a Holder, Certificates may
be exchanged for other Certificates of authorized denominations of
a like aggregate amount upon surrender of the Certificates to be
exchanged at the office or agency maintained pursuant to
Section 3.07. The preceding provisions of this Section
notwithstanding, the Owner Trustee shall not make and the
Certificate Registrar shall not register transfer or exchanges of
Certificates for a period of 15 days preceding the due date

     (c) Every
Certificate presented or surrendered for registration of transfer
or exchange shall be accompanied by a written instrument of

Certificate shall be made unless the Owner Trustee shall have
received:

representation from the transferee of such Certificate
substantially in the form of Exhibit B to the effect
that:


     (i) such
transferee is not a Non-U.S. Person; and


     (ii) such
transferee is not a Benefit Plan;


     (2) a
representation from the transferor of such Certificate
substantially in the form of Exhibit C ; and

opinion of counsel to the Owner Trustee that the transfer of such
Certificate is being made pursuant to an effective registration
under the Securities Act or is exempt from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act.


     Notwithstanding
anything else to the contrary herein, any purported transfer of a
Certificate to or on behalf of a Benefit Plan or utilizing the
assets of a Benefit Plan shall be void and of no effect.


     To the extent
permitted under applicable law (including, but not limited to,
ERISA), the Owner Trustee shall be under no liability to any Person
for any registration of transfer of any Certificate that is in fact
not permitted by this Section 3.03(c) or for making any
payments due on such Certificate to the Certificateholder thereof
or taking any other action with respect to such Holder under the
provisions of this Trust Agreement or the Sale and Servicing
Agreement so long as the transfer was registered by the Certificate
Registrar or the Owner Trustee in accordance with the foregoing
requirements.


     (d) No
service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or
exchange of Certificates, but the Owner Trustee or the Certificate
Registrar may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax
or governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any
transfer or exchange of Certificates.


     SECTION 3.04
Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Certificates . If
(a) any mutilated Certificate shall be surrendered to the
Certificate Registrar, or if the Certificate Registrar shall
receive evidence to its satisfaction of the destruction, loss or
theft of any Certificate and (b) there shall be delivered to
the Certificate Registrar and the Owner Trustee such security or
indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless,
then in the absence of notice that such Certificate shall have been
acquired by a protected purchaser, the Owner Trustee on behalf of
the Trust shall execute and the Owner Trustee, or the Owner
Trustee’s authenticating agent, shall authenticate and
deliver, in exchange for or in lieu of any such mutilated,
destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate, a new Certificate of like
tenor and denomination. In connection with the issuance of any new
Certificate under this Section, the Owner Trustee or the
Certificate Registrar may require the payment of a sum sufficient
to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed
in connection therewith. Any duplicate Certificate issued pursuant
to this Section shall constitute conclusive evidence of

Restated Trust Agreement)

ownership in
the Trust, as if originally issued, whether or not the lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate shall be found at any time.


     SECTION 3.05
Persons Deemed Certificateholders . Prior to due
presentation of a Certificate for registration of transfer, the
Owner Trustee or the Certificate Registrar may treat the Person in
whose name any Certificate shall be registered in the Certificate
Register as the owner of such Certificate for the purpose of
receiving distributions pursuant to Section 5.02 and for all
other purposes whatsoever, and neither the Owner Trustee nor the
Certificate Registrar shall be bound by any notice to the
contrary.


     SECTION 3.06
Access to List of Certificateholders’ Names and
Addresses . The Certificate Registrar shall furnish or cause to
be furnished to the Owner Trustee, the Servicer or the Depositor,
as the case may be, within 15 days after its receipt of a
request therefor from the Owner Trustee, the Servicer or the
Depositor in writing, a list, in such form as the Owner Trustee,
the Servicer or the Depositor may reasonably require, of the names
and addresses of the Certificateholders as of the most recent
Record Date. If three or more Certificateholders or one or more
Holders of Certificates evidencing, in the aggregate, not less than
25% of the Certificate Balance apply in writing to the Owner
Trustee, and such application states that the applicants desire to
communicate with other Certificateholders with respect to their
rights under this Agreement or under the Certificates and such
application is accompanied by a copy of the communication that such
applicants propose to transmit, then the Owner Trustee shall,
within five Business Days after the receipt of such application,
afford such applicants access during normal business hours to the
current list of Certificateholders. Each Holder, by receiving and
holding a Certificate, shall be deemed to have agreed not to hold
any of the Depositor, the Servicer, the Certificate Registrar or
the Owner Trustee accountable by reason of the disclosure of its
name and address, regardless of the source from which such
information was derived.


     SECTION 3.07
Maintenance of Office or Agency . The Owner Trustee shall
maintain an office or offices or agency or agencies where
Certificates may be surrendered for registration of transfer or
exchange and where notices and demands to or upon the Owner Trustee

served. The Owner Trustee initially designates Wilmington Trust
Company, in such capacity, Rodney Square North, 1100 North Market
Street, Wilmington, Delaware 19890, as its principal corporate
trust office for such purposes. The Owner Trustee shall give prompt
written notice to the Depositor and to the Certificateholders of
any change in the location of the Certificate Register or any such
office or agency.


     SECTION 3.08
Appointment of Paying Agent . Except during any period when
the Indenture Trustee is authorized and directed to do so under the
Indenture (i.e. prior to the termination of the Indenture), the
Paying Agent shall make distributions to Certificateholders from
the Collection Account pursuant to Section 5.02 and shall
report the amounts of such distributions to the Owner Trustee. Any
Paying Agent shall have the revocable power to withdraw funds from
the Collection Account for the purpose of making the distributions
referred to above. The Owner Trustee may revoke such power and
remove the Paying Agent if the Owner Trustee determines in its sole
discretion that the Paying Agent shall have failed to perform its
obligations under this Agreement in any material respect. The
Paying Agent shall



(Nissan 2011-A Amended &
Restated Trust Agreement)

12



 


initially be
Wilmington Trust Company, and any co-paying agent chosen by the
Owner Trustee, and acceptable to the Owner Trustee. The Paying
Agent shall be permitted to resign as Paying Agent upon
30 days’ written notice to the Indenture Trustee and, if
the Paying Agent is not the Owner Trustee, to the Owner Trustee. In
the event that Wilmington Trust Company shall no longer be the
Paying Agent, the Owner Trustee shall appoint a successor to act as
Paying Agent (which shall be a bank or trust company). The Owner
Trustee shall cause such successor Paying Agent or any additional
Paying Agent appointed by the Owner Trustee to execute and deliver
to the Owner Trustee an instrument in which such successor Paying
Agent or additional Paying Agent shall agree with the Owner Trustee
that as Paying Agent, such successor Paying Agent or additional
Paying Agent will hold all sums, if any, held by it for payment to
the Certificateholders in trust for the benefit of the
Certificateholders entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid
to such Certificateholders. The Paying Agent shall return all
unclaimed funds to the Owner Trustee and upon removal of a Paying
Agent such Paying Agent shall also return all funds in its
possession to the Owner Trustee. The provisions of
Sections 7.01, 7.03, 7.04, 8.01 and 8.02 shall apply to the
Owner Trustee also in its role as Paying Agent, for so long as the
Owner Trustee shall act as Paying Agent and, to the extent
applicable, to any other Paying Agent appointed hereunder. Any
reference in this Agreement to the Paying Agent shall include any
co-paying agent unless the context requires otherwise.


     SECTION 3.09
Ownership by the Depositor of Certificates . Notwithstanding
Section 3.03, the Depositor shall on the Closing Date receive in
accordance with Section 3.02, and shall thereafter retain
beneficial and record ownership of, Certificates representing 100%
of the Certificate Balance. Any attempted transfer of any
Certificate that would reduce such interest of the Depositor below
100% of the Certificate Balance shall be void. The Owner Trustee
shall cause one Certificate issued to the Depositor (representing
100% of the Certificate Balance) to bear a legend stating
“THIS CERTIFICATE IS NON-TRANSFERABLE.”

ARTICLE V



Application of Trust Funds;
Certain Duties


     SECTION 5.01
Establishment of Accounts .


     (a) On or
prior to the Distribution Date on which the Notes of all Classes
have been paid in full (or substantially all of the Trust Estate is
otherwise released from the lien of the Indenture), the Owner
Trustee, for the benefit of the Certificateholders, shall establish
and maintain, or shall cause to be established and maintained, in
the name of the Trust (or in such other name as shall be specified
in the Sale and Servicing Agreement), the trust collection account
(the “Trust Collection Account”). The Trust Collection
Account shall be established and maintained as an Eligible Deposit
Account, and, subject to provisions of the Sale and Servicing
Agreement, bearing a designation clearly indicating that, subject
to Section 5.01(b), the funds deposited therein are held by
the Trust for the benefit of the Certificateholders, in each case
in accordance with Section 5.01 of the Sale and Servicing
Agreement.


     Subject to
Section 5.01(b), the Owner Trustee shall possess all right,
title and interest in all funds on deposit from time to time in the
Trust Collection Account and in all proceeds thereof (other than
any net investment earnings on Eligible Investments held therein).
Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the Trust Collection
Account shall be under the sole dominion and control of the Owner
Trustee for the benefit of the Certificateholders. If, at any time,
the Trust Collection Account ceases to be an Eligible Deposit
Account, the Owner Trustee (or the Administrator on behalf of the
Owner Trustee, if the Trust Collection Account is not then held by
the Owner Trustee or an affiliate thereof) shall within 10 Business
Days establish a new equivalent Eligible Deposit Account and shall
transfer any cash and/or any investments to such new
account.


     (b) Concurrently
with the execution and delivery of the Indenture, the Servicer will
establish and maintain, or shall cause to be established and
maintained, at the direction of the Depositor, the Collection
Account in the name of and under the control of the Indenture
Trustee for the benefit of the Securityholders in accordance with
Section 5.01 of the Sale and Servicing Agreement. The
Indenture Trustee will be obligated to transfer back to the Owner
Trustee, for the benefit of the Certificateholders, all funds or
investments held in the Collection Account on the Distribution Date
on which the Notes of all Classes have been paid in full or the
Indenture is otherwise terminated (excluding any amounts to be
retained for distribution in respect of Notes that are not promptly
delivered for payment on such Distribution Date), and to take all
necessary or appropriate actions to transfer all right, title and
interest of the Indenture Trustee in such funds or investments and
all proceeds thereof to the Owner Trustee for the benefit of the
Certificateholders, which amounts the Owner Trustee shall deposit
into the Trust Collection Account.



(Nissan 2011-A Amended &
Restated Trust Agreement)

     SECTION 5.02
Application of Amounts in Trust Accounts .


     (a) For so
long as any Notes are outstanding, on each Distribution Date, the
Indenture Trustee will distribute to Certificateholders, on a pro
rata basis, the amounts distributable thereto pursuant to
Section 5.06 of the Sale and Servicing Agreement and
Section 3.01 of the Indenture. From and after the date on
which the Notes of all Classes have been paid in full, on each
Distribution Date, the Owner Trustee shall distribute to the
Certificateholders amounts on deposit in the Trust Collection
Account that are distributable to the Certificateholders in
accordance with the instructions of the Servicer pursuant to
Section 5.06 of the Sale and Servicing Agreement. Upon the
release from the Lien of the Indenture of amounts on deposit in the
Collection Account or any other portion of the Owner Trust Estate,
the Owner Trustee will cause such property to be properly deposited
into the Trust Collection Account under the control of the Owner
Trustee pursuant to Section 5.01(a) or distributed to the
Certificateholders in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement, as the case may be.


     (b) On each
Distribution Date, the Owner Trustee shall send to each
Certificateholder the statement provided to the Owner Trustee by
the Servicer pursuant to Section 5.08 of the Sale and
Servicing Agreement with respect to such Distribution
Date.


     (c) In the
event that any withholding tax is imposed on the Trust’s
payment (or allocations of income) to a Certificateholder, such tax
shall reduce the amount otherwise distributable to the
Certificateholder in accordance with this Section. The Owner
Trustee is hereby authorized and directed to retain from amounts
otherwise distributable to the Certificateholders sufficient funds
for the payment of any tax that is legally owed by the Trust (but
such authorization shall not prevent the Owner Trustee from
contesting any such tax in appropriate proceedings, and withholding
payment of such tax, if permitted by law, pending the outcome of
such proceedings). The amount of any withholding tax imposed with
respect to a Certificateholder shall be treated as cash distributed
to such Certificateholder at the time it is withheld by the Trust
and remitted to the appropriate taxing authority. If there is a
possibility that withholding tax is payable with respect to any
distribution (such as any distribution to a Non-U.S. Person), the
Owner Trustee may in its sole discretion withhold such amounts in
accordance with this paragraph (c). In the event that a
Certificateholder wishes to apply for a refund of any such
withholding tax, the Owner Trustee shall reasonably cooperate with
such Certificateholder in making such claim so long as such
Certificateholder agrees to reimburse the Owner Trustee for any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred.


     (d) The Trust
may, from time to time, at its option, and as directed by the
Certificateholders pursuant to Section 6.03 of this Agreement
and as provided in Section 5.10 of the Sale and Servicing
Agreement, enter into a Currency Swap Agreement with a Currency
Swap Counterparty to swap amounts payable to Certificateholders
from U.S. dollars to Japanese yen; provided, that (1) at the
time the Trust enters into the Currency Swap Agreement, the Rating
Agencies have confirmed the then-existing ratings of the Notes, and
(2) any payments to the Currency Swap Counterparty (including
termination payments) are payable only from amounts that are
otherwise payable to the Certificateholders. If the
Certificateholders notify the Administrator with respect to the
Trust’s election to enter into such a Currency Swap
Agreement, the Administrator will prepare all necessary and
appropriate documentation and take all of the



(Nissan 2011-A Amended &
Restated Trust Agreement)

16



 


necessary and
appropriate actions to cause the Issuer to enter into such a
Currency Swap Agreement on behalf of the Trust. Any payments
received by the Issuer from the Currency Swap Counterparty under
such a Currency Swap Agreement shall not be deposited in the
Collection Account and shall be paid by the Indenture Trustee
directly to or to the order of the Certificateholders on the
related Distribution Date.


     SECTION 5.03
Method of Payment . Subject to Section 9.01(c),
distributions required to be made to Certificateholders on any
Distribution Date shall be made to each Certificateholder of record
on the related Record Date either by check mailed to such
Certificateholder at the address of such holder appearing in the
Certificate Register or by wire transfer, in immediately available
funds, to the account of any Certificateholder at a bank or other
entity having appropriate facilities therefor, if such
Certificateholder shall have provided to the Certificate Registrar
appropriate written instructions at least five Business Days prior
to such Distribution Date.


     SECTION 5.04
Accounting and Reports to the Noteholders, the
Certificateholders, the Internal Revenue Service and Others .
The Administrator on behalf of the Trust shall (a) maintain (or
cause to be maintained) the books of the Trust on a fiscal year
basis or a calendar basis on the accrual method of accounting,
(b) deliver to each Certificateholder, as may be required by
the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations, such information as
may be required (excluding Schedule K-1) to enable each
Certificateholder to prepare its federal and state income tax
returns, (c) file any tax and information returns, and fulfill
any other reporting requirements, relating to the Trust, as may be
required by the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations (including
Treasury Regulation Section 1.6049-7), (d) for any
period during which the beneficial ownership interests in the Trust
are held by more than one Person, make such elections as may from
time to time be required or appropriate under any applicable state
or federal statute or rule or regulation thereunder so as to
maintain the Trust’s characterization as a partnership for
federal income tax purposes, (e) cause such tax returns to be
signed in the manner required by law, and (f) collect or cause
to be collected any withholding tax as described in and in
accordance with Section 5.02(c) with respect to income or
distributions to Certificateholders. The Administrator on behalf of
the Trust shall elect under Section 1278 of the Code to
include in income currently any market discount that accrues with
respect to the Receivables. The Administrator on behalf of the
Trust shall not make the election provided under Section 754
of the Code. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated
herein, the Owner Trustee shall be exclusively responsible for the
mailing of the Schedule K-1’s necessary to enable each
Certificateholder to prepare its federal and state income
returns.


     SECTION 5.05
Signature on Returns; Tax Matter Partner .


     (a) The
Administrator on behalf of the Trust shall sign on behalf of the
Trust the tax returns of the Trust, unless applicable law requires
a Certificateholder to sign such documents, in which case such
documents shall be signed by the Administrator, pursuant to the
power-of-attorney granted thereto pursuant to
Section 2.04.


     (b) For any
period during which the beneficial ownership interests of the Trust
are held by more than one Person, the Certificateholder holding
Certificates evidencing the largest

17



 


portion of the
Original Certificate Balance shall be designated the “tax
matters partner” of the Trust pursuant to
Section 6231(a)(7)(A) of the Code and applicable Treasury
Regulations, but hereby delegates its powers and duties as such to
the Administrator pursuant to the power-of-attorney granted thereto
pursuant to Section 2.04.


     SECTION 5.06
Duties of Depositor on Behalf of Trust . On behalf of the
Trust, the Depositor shall prepare and, after execution by the
Trust and the Indenture Trustee, file with the Securities and
Exchange Commission and any applicable state agencies documents
required to be filed on a periodic basis with the Securities and
Exchange Commission and any applicable state agencies (including
any summaries thereof required by rules and regulations prescribed
thereby), and transmit such summaries to the Noteholders pursuant
to Section 7.03 of the Indenture.

Documents and in the interest of the Certificateholders.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Owner Trustee shall be deemed to

hereunder with respect to such trusts but only upon the terms
of

Restated Trust Agreement)

this Agreement.
The Owner Trustee, upon receipt of all resolutions, certificates,
statements, opinions, reports, documents, orders or other
instruments furnished to the Owner Trustee that shall be
specifically required to be furnished pursuant to any provision of
this Agreement, shall examine them to determine whether they
conform on their face to the requirements of this
Agreement.


     (b) No
provision of this Agreement shall be construed to relieve the Owner
Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own
negligent failure to act, its own bad faith or its own willful
misfeasance; provided , however , that:


     (i) the duties and
obligations of the Owner Trustee shall be determined solely by the
express provisions of this Agreement, the Owner Trustee shall not
be liable except for the performance of such duties and obligations
as are specifically set forth in this Agreement, no implied
covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement against
the Owner Trustee, the permissive right of the Owner Trustee to do
things enumerated in this Agreement shall not be construed as a
duty and, in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Owner
Trustee, the Owner Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth
of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed
therein, upon any certificates or opinions furnished to the Owner
Trustee and conforming on their face to the requirements of this
Agreement;


     (ii) the Owner

Trustee shall not be personally liable with respect to any action
taken, suffered or omitted to be taken in good faith in accordance

smaller percentage of the Certificate Balance as may be required by
any other provision of this Agreement or the other Basic
Documents), the Servicer, the Administrator or the Indenture

     (c) The Owner
Trustee shall not be required to expend or risk its own funds or
otherwise incur financial liability in the performance of any of
its duties under this Agreement, or in the exercise of any of its
rights or powers, if there shall be reasonable grounds for
believing that the repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity
against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to
it.


     (d) All
information obtained by the Owner Trustee regarding the Obligors
and the Receivables contained in the Trust, whether upon the
exercise of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise, shall be
maintained by the Owner Trustee in confidence and shall not be
disclosed to any other Person, unless such disclosure is required
by any applicable law or regulation or pursuant to subpoena or is
required to be made to regulators, auditors or other governmental
authorities.



(Nissan 2011-A Amended &
Restated Trust Agreement)

     (e) Pursuant
to Section 3.02 of the Sale and Servicing Agreement, in the
event that the Owner Trustee discovers that a representation or
warranty made by the Seller pursuant to Section 3.01 or 6.01
of the Sale and Servicing Agreement with respect to a Receivable
was incorrect as of the time specified with respect to such
representation and warranty and such incorrectness materially and
adversely affects the interests of any Securityholder in such
Receivable, the Owner Trustee shall give prompt written notice to
the Servicer, the Depositor and the Indenture Trustee of such
incorrectness. Pursuant to Section 4.06 of the Sale and
Servicing Agreement, if the Owner Trustee discovers that any
covenant of the Servicer set forth in the second sentence of
Section 4.01 or Section 4.02, 4.04 or 4.05 of the Sale
and Servicing Agreement has been breached by the Servicer, the
Owner Trustee shall give prompt written notice to the Servicer, the
Depositor and the Indenture Trustee of such breach.


     SECTION 6.04 No
Duties Except as Specified in this Agreement or in Instructions
. The Owner Trustee shall not have any duty or obligation to
manage, make any payment with respect to, register, record, sell,
dispose of, or otherwise deal with the Owner Trust Estate, or to
otherwise take or refrain from taking any action under, or in
connection with, any Basic Document to which the Owner Trustee is a
party or otherwise contemplated hereby, except as expressly
provided by the terms of this Agreement, any Basic Document to
which the Trust is a party or in any document or written
instruction received by the Owner Trustee pursuant to
Section 6.03. No implied duties or obligations shall be read
into this Agreement or any Basic Document against the Owner
Trustee. The Owner Trustee shall have no responsibility for filing
any financing or continuation statement in any public office at any

Trustee shall not be required to execute, deliver or certify on
behalf of the Trust or any other Person any filings, certificates,
affidavits or other instruments required under the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002, to the extent permitted by applicable law. The Owner
Trustee nevertheless agrees that it will, at its own cost and
expense, promptly take all action as may be necessary to discharge
any liens on any part of the Owner Trust Estate that result from
actions by, or claims against, the Owner Trustee that are not
related to the ownership or the administration of the Owner Trust
Estate.


     SECTION 6.05 No
Action Except Under Specified Documents or Instructions . The
Owner Trustee shall not manage, control, use, sell, dispose of or
otherwise deal with any part of the Owner Trust Estate except

(ii) in accordance with the Basic Documents and (iii) in
accordance with any document or instruction delivered to the Owner
Trustee pursuant to Section 6.03.

(a) that is inconsistent with the purposes of the Trust set
forth in Section 2.03 or (b) that, to the actual
knowledge of a Trust Officer of the Owner Trustee, (x) would
result in the Trust’s becoming taxable as a corporation for
federal income tax purposes or (y) affect the treatment of the
Notes as indebtedness for federal or state income purpose. The
Certificateholders shall not have the authority to and, by
acceptance of an ownership interest in any Certificate shall
thereby be
