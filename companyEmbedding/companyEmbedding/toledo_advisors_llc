NOTE

 



$65,000.00


Lakewood, NJ



April 18, 2016
 

1. Principal and
Interest

 

FOR VALUE RECEIVED, Toledo Advisors,
LLC, a Nevada Limited Liability Company (the “Company”)
hereby absolutely and unconditionally promises to pay to PositiveID
Corp. (the “Lender”), or order, the principal amount of
Sixty Five Thousand Dollars ($65,000.00) no later than October 18,
2016, unless the Lender does not meet the “current
information requirements” required under Rule 144 of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, in which case the Company may
declare the offsetting note issued by the Lender on the same date
herewith to be in Default (as defined in that note) and cross
cancel its payment obligations under this Note as well as the
Lenders payment obligations under the offsetting note. This Full
Recourse Note shall bear simple interest at the rate of
10%.

 

2. Repayments and Prepayments;
Security .

 

a. All principal under this Note
shall be due and payable no later than October 18, 2016, unless the
Lender does not meet the “current information
requirements” required under Rule 144 of the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended, in which case the Company may declare the
offsetting note issued by the Lender on the same date herewith to
be in Default (as defined in that note) and cross cancel its
payment obligations under this Note as well as the Lenders payment
obligations under the offsetting note.

 

b. The Company may pay this Note at
any time. This note may not be assigned by the Lender, except by
operation of law.

 

c. This Note shall initially be
secured by the pledge of the $71,500.00 10% convertible promissory
note issued to the Company by the Lender on even date herewith (the
“Lender Note”). The Company may exchange this
collateral for other collateral with an appraised value of at least
$65,000.00, by providing 3 days prior written notice to the
Lender . If the Lender does not object to the substitution
of collateral in that 3 day period, such substitution of collateral
shall be deemed to have been accepted by the Lender .
Notwithstanding the foregoing, an exchange of collateral for
$65,000.00 in cash shall not require the approval of the
Lender. Any collateral exchange shall not constitute a
waiver of any defaults under a Lender note. All collateral
shall be retained by New Venture Attorneys, P.C., which shall act
as the escrow agent for the collateral for the benefit of the
Lender. The Company may not effect any conversions under the Lender
Note until it has made full cash payment for the portion of the
Lender Note being converted.
