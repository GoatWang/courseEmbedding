Search results are sorted by a combination of factors to give you a set of choices in response to your search criteria. These factors are similar to those you might use to determine which business to select from a local Yellow Pages directory, including proximity to where you are searching, expertise in the specific services or products you need, and comprehensive business information to help evaluate a business's suitability for you. “Preferred” listings, or those with featured website buttons, indicate YP advertisers who directly provide information about their businesses to help consumers make more informed buying decisions. YP advertisers receive higher placement in the default ordering of search results and may appear in sponsored listings on the top, side, or bottom of the search results

Joseph M Ruggio's Experience
Title: 
               Company: Albert Einstein College of Medicine
Job Details
               We are developing a computational approach to model proteins for which a limited number of experimental restraints are available. We utilize our recently developed fragment library of supersecondary structure elements (Smotifs) that was shown to have saturated almost 10 years ago. We hypothesize that all protein folds should be possible to build from this library. We are developing algorithms that take advantage of NMR checial shift information to identify a subset of Smotifs that form a protein and setting up optimization approaches that will rapidly assemble overlapping Smotifs into compact folds.

Learning the truth about the history of your family and friends can be shocking, so please be cautious when using this tool.
TruthFinder does not provide consumer reports and is not a consumer reporting agency. We provide a lot of sensitive information that can be used to satisfy your curiosity, protect your family, and find the truth about the people in your life. You may not use our service or the information it provides to make decisions about consumer credit, employers, insurance, tenant screening, or any other purposes that would require FCRA compliance.
