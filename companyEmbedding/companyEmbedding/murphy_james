Murphy James Reviews






brtz
February 28, 2011


Hideous Scammer
								
				
From: Fellow Craigslist user
Scammer Name: "Murphy James
Scammer's Email: mtycx3@hotmail.com
Here is a new one from: "Murphy James"
Tactic Used: Hit and run. Once follow up email fails this scammer simply goes quiet.
I have posted an item 4 times over the last year. 4 times I have gotten the exact same initial and follow-up e-mail no matter what my response is. When I refuse to use his method of payment "while I will love to send your fund via alertpay"... he disappears.
