Crafted to be Cozy
You can spot one instantly from the curb, with its broad proportions and wide front porch rooted to the ground by tapered square pillars on masonry piers. The low gable roof features exposed beams, rafters, and brackets; the facade is a mix of stone or brick, and wood clapboards or shingles. Dormers often offer headroom in what is typically a one-and-a-half to two-story design. Inside, built-in cabinets or bookcases and chunky woodwork, usually stained rather than painted, divide rooms and flank fireplaces, adding warmth and function.
This is the Craftsman bungalow, first designed by architects and brothers Charles and Henry Greene at the turn of the 20th century, when the two had had it with the excessive, factory-made ornamentation of the Victorian period. What had been fussy became bold; what had been formal became comfortable. The Craftsman style held true to its name, celebrating solid handmade construction that peeked out from rooflines and anchored interior rooms. The houses spoke to a growing middle class wanting unpretentious family homes. Ultimately, the style blew across the country, landing everywhere—even via mail-order plans touting central heat, electricity, and indoor plumbing.
With its signature look, the Craftsman bungalow became the iconic American house. Its flowing floor plan, sensible detail, and livable space have kept it a popular choice.

Season 5, Episode 8


                                    Nelson & Sarah need to renovate their basement suite to attract a good tenant, stay on top of their expenses & fund the rest of their own renovations
                                  

Two years ago Nelson & Sarah bought this 1970s duplex in the heart of Little Portugal from Nelson's Dad. He'd rented it to tenants for years and it was in original condition when they took possession. They fixed up the main floor to express their own clean contemporary style. The basement apartment, however, is still stuck in the 70s with at least 10 different patterns of tile - it's a tile kaleidoscope! It desperately needs to be updated to attract the sort of tenant they want downstairs. They need Income Property's help.

Rosalina and Arun bought a stunning 1897 grand detached Victorian home. In the past it has been a rooming house and a hair salon with residential units. Their initial intention was to live on the second & third floors and continue to rent out the main floor and basement separately and use the income to bring the house back to its original splendour.  Fast-forward 5 years and major basement apartment issues later (flood, mould, asbestos, etc.), and Arun and Rosalina are exhausted financially and emotionally. Now with Arun's 3 kids moving in they need to maximize their living space and take over the main floor in addition to the upper two floors for everyone's sanity. They have lost their vision with the basement apartment due to all the setbacks. They need Income Property's help.
