      bring national retail brands into these venues. He is a graduate of the 
      McIntire School of Commerce at the University of Virginia and served on 
      the Advisory Board of the McIntire School for fifteen years, from 1981

      “We welcome the addition of Bill McCarten to Cracker Barrel’s board of 
      directors as part of our ongoing board succession process and our focus 
      on shareholder value,” said Michael A. Woodhouse, chairman and chief 
      executive officer. “His wisdom and in-depth knowledge gained as the CEO 
      of a company that successfully combined both restaurants and retail 
      shops under the same roof will add a valuable perspective to our board.”
