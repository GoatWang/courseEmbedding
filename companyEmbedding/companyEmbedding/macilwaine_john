Braintree, the Chicago-based mobile payments company, has hired Lending Club's former chief technology officer.In his role at Braintree, John MacIlwaine will lead all aspects of product development, the company’s general manager, Juan Benitez, wrote in a blog post announcing the move Tuesday.Braintree, which sold to PayPal for $800 million in 2013, operates as a separate service within PayPal. In PayPal's quarterly earnings call last week, officials said Braintree's technology is increasingly used in other PayPal products. MacIlwaine said in mid-December he planned to leave peer-to-peer lending company Lending Club to pursue another opportunity, effective Jan. 19, according to a company SEC filing.

Lending Club’s CEO and founder Renaud Laplanche resigned last year last year after internal reviews. Board members said Laplanche had failed to disclose his interests in a fund the company was considering investing in, and that staff members had altered application dates on $3 million of loans before their sale, Bloomberg reported.According to Benitez’s post, MacIlwaine has had a “lengthy and impactful history” in payments and financial services, with roles at Visa, GreenDot and SunGard. He was also CTO for the full-service brokerage arm of Morgan Stanley.MacIlwaine will be based out of San Francisco, a spokeswoman for Braintree said. MacIlwaine was not immediately available to comment.mgraham@chicagotribune.comTwitter @megancgraham

Braintree hires former Lending Club exec John MacIlwaine as CTO

Ken Yeung@thekenyeung January 31, 2017 4:16 PM



 





Braintree has hired a new chief technology officer in a move designed to ease the workload of Juan Benitez, who split his time between that position and general manager of the company. The new C-suite executive is John MacIlwaine, who joined the mobile payment provider from Lending Club. He has been tasked with leading product development for Braintree, including work in engineering, product management, design, and production engineering.

Nearly five years ago, Benitez joined Braintree as the CTO before being elevated to general manager two years later. Because of the company’s pursuit of “rapid growth,” it often required employees to assume multiple roles, including Benitez. But now, after claiming to have 25 times growth in payment transactions from Q2 2013 to Q2 2016, the time appears to be right to bring on someone dedicated to the CTO role.
This is where MacIlwaine comes in. “I’m excited to be joining the team of a leading payments company whose longstanding commitment to putting customers first has enabled them to maintain an innovative culture while scaling globally to meet customer growth and demand,” he said in a statement.
Prior to joining Braintree, MacIlwaine was the CTO at Lending Club, overseeing all software development and related technological work around the peer-to-peer loan provider. According to his LinkedIn profile, he managed a team that grew from 15 to more than 400 people in three years while also scaling the platform to handle over 20 times the volume within two years. MacIlwaine was also the CTO when Lending Club went public in 2014. He left the company in December.
Benitez cited MacIlwaine’s more than two decades of experience as a chief information and technology officer in the financial services industry as being a good fit for Braintree, as he should be able to drive “innovation at scale for multiple teams.”

Braintree Hires John MacIlwaine as New CTO

Former Lending Club CTO John MacIlwaine will join Braintree as the company’s new Chief Technology Officer. MacIlwaine takes the reins from current Braintree General Manager Juan Benitez, who had been serving in both capacities since 2014.
“As this global role will have a significant impact on our products, team, and strategy,” Benitez wrote in a blog post at Braintree, “John’s 20+ years of experience as a CIO/CTO in the financial services industry driving innovation at scale for multiple teams is a perfect fit for Braintree.” In his new position, Macilwaine will lead product development including engineering, product management design, and production engineering.
Braintree specializes in payment solutions for e-commerce companies ranging from small businesses to large corporations. The company’s platform enables merchants and businesses to accept payments directly, manage an online marketplace, or explore new sales channel opportunities. Braintree prides itself in being “developer-bred” and “technology-led” and emphasizes the ease of integration and wide payment optionality (including PayPal and Venmo) of its technology.
“The two-sided platform that only Braintree and PayPal together can deliver is unmatched and has always stood out to me,” MacIlwaine said. “I’m thrilled to leverage this unique value proposition to continue helping merchants around the world grow and succeed.”
MacIlwaine comes to Braintree from fellow Finovate alum, Lending Club, where he was CTO for more than four years. Before Lending Club, MacIlwaine held executive positions at Green Dot, Visa, Sungard, Envestnet, and Morgan Stanley. He has a BSE in Computer Engineering from the University of Michigan, where he is a member of the Entrepreneurship Advisory Board at the School of Information.
Founded in 2007 and headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, Braintree presented tools, tips, and other developer resources for building better e-commerce experiences for customers at FinDEVr New York 2016. The company is also a veteran of Finovate, having demonstrated its payment solution, Venmo Touch at FinovateSpring 2013. Braintree unveiled an expansion of its commerce infrastructure APIs last December, and promoted William Ready to COO in October. The company was acquired by PayPal in the fall of 2013 for $800 million in cash.
