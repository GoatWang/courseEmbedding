Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/21/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Until an 80 mg capsule is approved, patients on Ingrezza's recommended dose will pay up. Neurocrine Biosciences (NBIX) has priced its drug Ingrezza, the first approved for adults with the neurological disorder tardive dyskinesia, above even Wall Street's presumably elevated expectations--at about $64,000 a year. That estimated 2018 price of $64,000 a year slightly exceeds the range previously expected by Wall Street analysts, at about $20,000 to $60,000 a year.
