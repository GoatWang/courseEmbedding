					Full Description



MGC Diagnostics Corporation, incorporated on March 10, 1987, is a medical technology company, which offers cardiorespiratory health solutions. The Company designs, markets and sells non-invasive cardiorespiratory diagnostic products. The Company's product portfolio provides solutions for disease detection, integrated care and wellness across the cardiorespiratory healthcare spectrum. The Company sells its products internationally through distributors and in the United States through a direct sales force targeting specialists located in hospitals, university-based medical centers, medical clinics, physician offices, pharmaceutical companies, medical device manufacturers and clinical research organizations (CROs). The Company's cardiorespiratory diagnostic products measure flow and respiratory pressures and, in most cases analyze the inhaled and exhaled gases, such as oxygen and carbon dioxide. The Company's products include pulmonary function (PFT) and gas exchange (GX) testing products.The Company's pulmonary function products are divided into four product categories: Spirometry, Complete Pulmonary Function, Body Plethysmography and Specialty Products. Its Spirometry is a method of assessing pulmonary function. In this procedure, the patient breathes into a spirometer, an instrument that measures and records the volume of exhaled or expired air and the airflow rate for a specific time period. Spirometry provides measurement, lung capacity and mechanical properties of airflow. It markets the Medical Graphics CPF S/D USB and the Medisoft Micro 5000 and Micro 6000 spirometers. Its pulmonary function testing equipment measures and analyzes breathing to evaluate the condition of the heart, lungs and metabolism. The technique is used to diagnose and manage various pulmonary conditions. It markets Medical Graphics Ultima PF Series, Medisoft SpiroAir and Medisoft HypAir as pulmonary function systems. These pulmonary function systems are available as a desktop or cart-mounted configuration, perform spirometry, non-invasive measurement of an individual's total lung capacity, respiratory mechanics and diffusing capacity, and the oxygen transfer across the lungs into and out of the bloodstream.The Company's body plethysmographs consist of an airtight, transparent patient cabin, an adjustable support arm, pressure transducers for measuring mouth and cabin pressure and a computer. Many devices also incorporate diffusing capacity and lung volume by nitrogen washout, which enhances the scope of use. It markets the Medical Graphics Platinum Elite and the Medisoft BodyBox Series. The Medical Graphics Platinum Elite is available in two primary configurations: The Platinum Elite DL body plethysmograph performs spirometry, measures the total volume of air in the lung and resistance to airflow in the airways of the person's lungs, and The Platinum Elite DX body plethysmograph performs all the same tests as a Platinum Elite DL, and also performs the nitrogen washout test. The Medisoft BodyBox Series is available in three primary configurations: BodyBox Standard, XL and Pediatric Models. The Company's Specialty diagnostic pulmonary function testing products include the measurement of exhaled biomarkers and complex cardiorespiratory neuro-mechanics. It markets the Medisoft FeNO, FeNO+ and HypAir Muscle Study Systems using licensed technologies.The Company's cardiopulmonary exercise (CPX or CPET) testing products measure functional capacity, fitness or conditioning levels, evaluate prognostic criteria for surgical procedures, as well as help physicians diagnose heart and lung diseases. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing provides objective and quantitative assessment of the cardiovascular and respiratory responses to varying external workloads. These products operate by measuring the volume of air and concentrations of oxygen and carbon dioxide as they enter and leave the lungs while an individual exercises on a machine, such as a bike or treadmill. These tests may be augmented by various types of monitoring, including electrocardiogram (ECG), blood pressure and pulse oximetry. The Company sells Medical Graphics Ultima Series in various configurations, including the Ultima CPX metabolic stress testing system, which is an exercise testing system that measures an individual's fitness level, while exercising and measures an individual's ability to perform work; the Ultima CardiO2 gas exchange analysis system, which adds an integrated 12-lead electrocardiogram stress option to the Ultima CPX; the CCM Express indirect calorimeter, which is a self-contained metabolic assessment system that measures the nutritional requirements of a patient at rest and during mechanical ventilation in the critical care unit, and The Face Tent Fan, which is an option for the above systems and offered where open-circuit indirect calorimetry is a desired testing methodology.The Company sells its MediSoft Ergocard Series in various configurations, including the Ergocard Clinical, which is an exercise testing system that measures an individual's fitness level, while exercising and measures an individual's ability to perform work or activities of daily living; the Ergocard Professional gas exchange analysis system configuration, which adds an integrated 12-lead electrocardiogram stress option to the Ergocard Clinical, and the Ergocard ECG, which is a personal computer electrocardiograph that measures resting and exercise ECG and provides automated arrhythmia detection.The Company offers various models of exercise devices that provide healthcare professionals and patients a tool for managing diagnosis in clinical rehabilitation. Ergometers and treadmills can be used and controlled by the Company's cardiopulmonary exercise testing products. The Company manufactures and sells three models of treadmills: the Clinical 870A, Sport 870S and Athlete 870C.Both the Company's subsidiaries, Medical Graphics Corporation and Medisoft SA, are engaged in selling HL7 interface technology software, installation and support for data communication interfaces to achieve interoperability between the Company's products and the electronic medical records systems used in hospital and clinical settings. Electronic medical record systems are designed to facilitate transmission of patient and test results between the patient care management systems and equipment.The Company competes with Vyaire, nSpire Health, Cosmed, Ganshorn, ndd Medical Technologies and Morgan Scientific.

SAINT PAUL, Minn., May 20, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- The Board of Directors of MGC Diagnostics Corporation (NASDAQ:   MGCD), announced today that Gregg O. Lehman, Ph.D., has resigned as the Company's Chief Executive Officer, President and member of the Board of Directors, effective May 31, 2014 and has accepted the CEO position with Employee Benefit Solutions, Inc. ("EBS"), a privately-held provider of healthcare cost containment and wellness programs for small and mid-sized employers, which was recently acquired by Pharos Capital in Nashville, TN.
The Board implemented its Executive Succession Plan and announced the promotion of three of its key executives effective June, 1, 2014: 

Todd M. Austin, was named Chief Executive Officer. Austin joined MGC Diagnostics in February 2012 and is currently the Company's Executive Vice President – Global Marketing, Engineering and Corporate Strategy. He is a globally recognized clinical and medical device industry expert and leader with extensive experience, spanning more than 20 years, in product development and marketing, strategic planning, business development, P&L responsibility and clinical consulting. In recent years Austin has provided clinical, strategic and tactical consulting services to senior management for a number of domestic and international healthcare companies, including MGC Diagnostics Corporation. 
From 2006 to 2010 Austin was Director of Marketing for CareFusion, a leading, global health care industry company, where his responsibilities included overall marketing operations for respiratory diagnostic products supporting global sales in excess of $200 million annually, while coordinating product launch planning for more than 10 global markets.

Margolies has built a career of more than 20 years in the respiratory diagnostics industry. Prior to MGC Diagnostics, Margolies was with Cardinal Health, where he served as Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing of the company's Nuclear Pharmacy team.  Prior to Cardinal Health, Margolies worked with CardioNet as Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing generating substantial growth in CardioNet's Cardiac Telemetry business. Before CardioNet, Margolies served for four years in a number of positions of increasing responsibility with VIASYS Healthcare, where he ultimately became Division President for the Respiratory Diagnostics group leading the company's Worldwide Respiratory Diagnostics team. In his role with VIASYS he was responsible for the growth in the Respiratory Diagnostics space that was a component of the $1.6 billion acquisition of VIASYS by Cardinal Health (now CareFusion). From 1993-2004, Margolies held Sales and Marketing leadership roles with Covidien Health / Mallinckrodt Imaging. Margolies holds a bachelor's degree in Business Administration/Marketing from Ramapo College of New Jersey.
Wesley W. Winnekins, was named Chief Operating Officer of the Company.  He is currently Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and will assume the additional responsibilities for Global Operations including manufacturing, regulatory, information technology and human resources and administration.

MGC Diagnostics Board Chairman Mark Sheffert, said, "Today, we implemented our Executive Succession Plan. We are pleased that the bench strength we have developed over the past few years will move the Company forward to the next level of its development. Todd Austin is widely recognized as a quality medical device executive with a broad skill set and a proven track record of success, both in the U.S. and in international markets. Having worked closely for the past for two years with the outgoing CEO, Todd is the natural successor as CEO of MGC Diagnostics."  
"We are also pleased that our head of global sales, Matt Margolies has accepted the additional responsibilities as President of MGC Diagnostics and that our Chief Financial Officer, Wes Winnekins, will assume the additional duties as the Company's Chief Operating Officer," continued Sheffert. "These three executives comprise a strong operating team that has been very instrumental in MGC Diagnostics turnaround and growth in the past two years. They thoroughly understand MGCD's business, and the challenges in our industry, and the Board has total confidence that they will successfully lead the Company in the continuing execution of its strategic plan."
"On behalf of the Board, I want to express our thanks and appreciation to Gregg Lehman for his leadership over the past three years, which has resulted in a significant increase in shareholder value during his tenure. Gregg's accomplishments include rebranding the Company from Angeion to MGCD, instituting a vigorous process of new product development, and establishing a focused sales and marketing approach. His dedication to building a competitive company as well as the next generation of company leaders is a great legacy. We wish Gregg the very best in his new position," concluded, Mr. Sheffert.
