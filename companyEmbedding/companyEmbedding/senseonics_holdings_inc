Senseonics Holdings, Inc. Key Developments

Senseonics Holdings, Inc. Announces Collaboration with Typezero Technologies, Inc and Roche Diabetes Care, Inc. to Develop Insulin Delivery
Jul 24 17
Senseonics Holdings, Inc. announced a collaboration with TypeZero Technologies, Inc. and Roche Diabetes Care, Inc. to develop a long-term automated insulin delivery system. The collaboration is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded International Diabetes Closed Loop (IDCL) Trial, which was designed to test automated insulin delivery systems. This phase of the IDCL Trial will integrate Senseonics EversenseÂ® CGM System, a long-term, implantable continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system with TypeZero inControl AP algorithms and Roche Accu-ChekÂ® Insight Insulin Pump. The inControl software will automatically adjust and regulate insulin delivery based on the combination of data received from the CGM system and the insulin pump. The collaboration is the first of its kind to incorporate a CGM sensor that lasts up to 90 days with an easy and discreet insulin pump and smart algorithms for closed loop applications. The trial will include three clinical centers in Europe the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands, the University of Padova in Italy and University Hospital of Montpellier in France.


Senseonics Holdings, Inc. and TypeZero Technologies, Inc. Sign Development Agreement for Artificial Pancreas and Decision Support Systems
May 11 17

Combined with insulin data, the continuous glucose readings from the Eversense sensor will equip TypeZero’s artificial pancreas algorithms to automatically adjust and regulate insulin delivery via a user’s insulin pump. The integration will also enable TypeZero’s decision support system to recommend optimal basal and bolus doses for insulin pen users.

January 05, 2017


Senseonics Holdings, Inc. Reports Preliminary Results for Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2016 and Issues 2017 Guidance
GERMANTOWN, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
      Senseonics Holdings, Inc. (NYSE-MKT: SENS), a medical technology company
      focused on the development and commercialization of Eversense®, a
      long-term, implantable continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system for
      people with diabetes, today announced preliminary financial results for
      fourth quarter and full year 2016 and issued 2017 guidance.
    
      Based on preliminary and unaudited financial results, Senseonics expects
      revenue to be approximately $0.3 million for fourth quarter 2016 and
      $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. As of December 31,
      2016, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $20.3
      million and outstanding indebtedness was $20.0 million.
    
      "We achieved many significant milestones in 2016 including the receipt
      of the CE Mark and launch of Eversense in Europe, as well as the
      completion of the U.S. pivotal trial and submission of our PMA to the
      FDA,” said Tim Goodnow, President and Chief Executive Officer of
      Senseonics. “We anticipate continuing this rapid pace of submissions and
      commercialization efforts, and we are aiming to deliver important
      milestones throughout 2017.”
    2017 Financial Guidance
      Management projects revenue for full year 2017 to be in the range of
      $6.0 to $7.0 million.

Eversense CGM System

2017-03-23T15:14:31+00:00		



Eversense CGM SystemA new way to continuously monitor glucose levels around-the-clock, without the need for weekly sensor insertions or having to carry another receiving device
The Eversense System continually measures interstitial fluid glucose levels in adults with diabetes for the operating life of the sensor. The system is indicated for use as an adjunctive device to complement, not replace, information obtained from standard home blood glucose monitoring devices.

How It WorksBased on innovative fluorescence technology embedded within a tiny sensor, the Eversense CGM System measures glucose from interstitial fluid below the skin surface.
The sensor wirelessly sends glucose data to the smart transmitter worn on the upper arm over the sensor insertion site. The smart transmitter calculates the current glucose value along with the direction it’s headed, how fast, and whether glucose values are expected to exceed pre-set low and high targets. Data and alerts are simultaneously sent to the smartphone app that provides real-time tracking, intuitive displays to help identify patterns, and information to help stay in range.
