Richard M. Rompala


Born
1947
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania[1]


Spouse(s)
Jean Rompala[1]


Children
2[1]


Richard M. Rompala (born 1947) is an American executive currently on the board of directors of the Olin Corporation. He was chairman of Valspar from February 1998 until his retirement in July 2005. He had previously served as both CEO and president of Valspar. Rompala's leadership is credited with significantly expanding Valspar's international business operations, where it had previously been a primarily North American business.
Early life and education[edit]
Richard Rompala was born in 1947[1][2] to a working-class family on Pittsburgh's strongly Eastern European South Side.[1] Rompala's steelworker father eventually moved the family to Ambridge, Pennsylvania.[3]
In 1964, Rompala went to Columbia University, earning bachelor's degrees in chemistry and chemical engineering in 1969. He went on to Harvard Business School where he earned an MBA in 1975.[3][4]
Management work[edit]
Rompala got his first management position at the Olin Corporation, running their flexible urethanes division.[4] He left this position in 1979 to work for Victor Posner and eventually served as a senior vice president of operations at Mueller Brass.[3] In 1985, he went to work for PPG Industries starting as a vice president of corporate development. He was eventually promoted to group vice president of chemicals and then to group vice president of resins and coatings.[4] In 1993, PPG's chairman and CEO, Vincent Sarni was on the verge of retirement, and outside speculation suggested that Rompala was a serious contender to take his place.[5] This, however, did not happen, and Rompala left PPG.[6]
In May 1994, Rompala was elected president of Valspar.[4][7] On October 30, 1995, he assumed the position of CEO at Valspar, succeeding C. Angus Wurtele in that position.[8] He went on to replace Wurtele as chairman in February 1998, with Wurtele staying on Valspar's board of directors.[2] Rompala's contributions at Valspar enabled them to increase their overseas revenues from 3% in the mid-1990s to nearly 30% by 2004. Rompala accomplished this by opening joint ventures in China, Hong Kong, Brazil, South Africa and Mexico.[9]
In 1998, Rompala went to work on the Olin Corporation's board of directors, where he currently serves as the lead director and chair of the compensation committee.[10] Rompala retired from Valspar as chairman in July 2005.[11]

Rompala (born 1947) is an American executive currently on the board of directors of the Olin Corporation. He was chairman of Valspar from February 1998 until his retirement in July 2005. He had previously served as both CEO and president of Valspar. Rompala's leadership is credited with significantly expanding Valspar's international business operations, where it had previously been a primarily North American business.Early life and educationRichard Rompala was born in 1947[1][2] to a working-class family on Pittsburgh's strongly Eastern European South Side.[1] Rompala's steelworker father eventually moved the family to Ambridge, Pennsylvania.[3]In 1964, Rompala went to Columbia University, earning bachelor's degrees in chemistry and chemical engineering in 1969. He went on to Harvard Business School where he earned an MBA in 1975.[3][4]Management workRompala got his first management position at the Olin Corporation, running their flexible urethanes division.[4] He left this position in 1979 to work for Victor Posner and eventually served as a senior vice president of operations at Mueller Brass.[3] In 1985, he went to work for PPG Industries starting as a vice president of corporate development. He was eventually promoted to group vice president of chemicals and then to group vice president of resins and coatings.[4] In 1993, PPG's chairman and CEO, Vincent Sarni was on the verge of retirement, and outside speculation suggested that Rompala was a serious contender to take his place.[5] This, however, did not happen, and Rompala left PPG.[6]In May 1994, Rompala was elected president of Valspar.[4][7] On October 30, 1995, he assumed the position of CEO at Valspar, succeeding C. Angus Wurtele in that position.[8] He went on to replace Wurtele as chairman in February 1998, with Wurtele staying on Valspar's board of directors.[2] Rompala's contributions at Valspar enabled them to increase their overseas revenues from 3% in the mid-1990s to nearly 30% by 2004. Rompala accomplished this by opening joint ventures in China, Hong Kong, Brazil, South Africa and Mexico.[9]In 1998, Rompala went to work on the Olin Corporation's board of directors, where he currently serves as the lead director and chair of the compensation committee.[10] Rompala retired from Valspar as chairman in July 2005.[11]References^ a b c d e Cotter, Wes (August 31, 1992).

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/22/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.
