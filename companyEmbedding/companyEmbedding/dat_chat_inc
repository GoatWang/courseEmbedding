Our Mission


A complete Personal Privacy Platform where you are always in control, even after you hit Send or Submit
Mobile messaging, email and file storage are the first personal cyber-security sectors that DatChat is addressing with its unique proprietary technology. The DatChat's technology allows you to change the rights to your messages and personal information any time after you hit send or submit
Starting with messaging, DatChat is the first privacy platform to always allow the option to erase or change how long your messages stay on another person’s device. You are always in full control of your personal privacy with DatChat.   When sending someone a message, you can wipe it from your phone and theirs at any time.
Unique to DatChat are features such as: Screenshot Protection, "Nuke" which allows the complete eradication of a conversation on everyone’s device, multi-layered encryption and the DatChat Messaging Rights Control Platform.












The Opportunity of Privacy
The Cyber-Security industry is growing exponentially, and it is expected to reach $170 Billion in just a few years. While most of the focus seems to be on protecting our information where it is stored, DatChat is focused on Protecting Our Privacy after we have already shared our personal and financial information.
One of the biggest threats to our privacy comes from what happens after we have Hit Send, Submit or even Delete.  DatChat’s unique technology is focused on always providing privacy, control and security when you really need it the most.
The Company that puts us back in control of our personal privacy can truly change the face of communications and financial security. This protects all of us, and creates a tremendous investing opportunity. Our Patent Pending technology allows us to stay in control of our information even after
we hit Send or Submit.





Disruption





While you are probably familiar with many of the messaging and email platforms, did you know that they all share the same major privacy flaw that creates substantial risk to our personal privacy and security?
They do not allow us to control our messages or information after we Hit Send!  DatChat is ready right now, to totally disrupt the entire Cyber-Security and Messaging Industry by allowing full control of our personal and financial information both before, and especially after we hit send or submit.







Over 10,000 hours of Development


We have spent over two years developing privacy technology that is there for you when you need it the most…After You Hit Send. First we are rolling out the platform for iPhone and iMessage. This is happening now. Our goal is to work as a stand alone platform and integrate into existing messaging platforms including email.

















 Become a DatChat Ambassador Investor!
As a Special Limited Time Offer for our early investors you will get twice the amount of shares.  When you invest, you will automatically be enrolled in the DatChat Ambassador Program which entitles you to receive an equal number of stock option shares.






Unique Opportunity
For the last 80 years, private companies could only raise capital from accredited investors, the wealthiest 2% of Americans. Recently the JOBS Act was signed, Title IV (Regulation A+) of the JOBS Act went into effect, allowing private early-stage companies to raise money from everyone.
The Reg A+  offering is often referred to as a mini-IPO.  We are conducting a Reg. A+ Tier 2 offering that allows us to raise up to $50 million dollars under Title IV of the Jobs Act.  The company has had to submit Form 1-A registration statement to the SEC for qualification, and is subject to ongoing reporting requirements. Like an IPO, Reg. A+ allows companies to offer shares to the general public and not just accredited investors. The shares you purchase are immediately freely tradable.





New Communication Platform
Until Now, no messaging platform allowed you to change the rights to your messages After You HIT SEND.
Messaging Rights Management Platform: Patent pending technology allows a sender to set a message to last forever, or automatically self-destruct after a certain number of views. At any time a sender can wipe texts off a recipient’s phone or give them more time to view the message.
"Nuke" a Conversation: Users can even opt to Nuke messages, which erases both sides of the conversation on both the sender and recipient’s devices.
Encryption: All DatChat messages are encrypted with AES256 for the message, and RSA for the key to ensure your messages are only seen by you and your intended recipients. Each message is individually encrypted for the recipient and cannot be forwarded or saved. Additionally, all messages are sent and received via a SSL connection and can never be viewed by DatChat under any circumstance.
Screenshot Protection: DatChat’s Patent Pending protection mode makes it nearly impossible to screenshot a secret picture or message. Also, the sender receives notifications when someone attempts to screenshot protected or regular self destructing messages.








Nuke & Self Destructing Messages
The sender decides how many times pictures or messages can be viewed before they self-destruct. Also, the sender can dictate how many views are left or erase the content at any time. Users can even opt to Nuke messages, which erase both sides of the conversation on both the sender and recipient’s devices.



Hide in Plain Sight
Senders can hide pictures and information on the camera roll, hidden and encrypted behind other pictures. Only the cover photo can be seen in plain sight.



Screenshot Protection
DatChat features a protection mode which makes it nearly impossible to screenshot a secret message. Also, the sender receives notifications when someone attempts to screenshot protected or regular self-destructing messages.





Without a Trace
Messages vanish without a trace when they reach a view limit or are manually destructed, and are deleted forever. DatChat Inc. employees can never access messages.



Powerful Privacy
Every message sent is double encrypted and can only be viewed by the sender and the intended recipient.



Fast, Safe & Easy
It is easy to send and control messages. Camraflage is DatChat’s patent-pending technology that hides a message behind a decoy cover photo. Camraflage messages can be sent via encrypted messages using the direct messaging built into DatChat, iMessage or email.







Patent Pending

Only messenger that allows you to change how many views or time remains after sending.
Erasing both sides of a conversation on your recipients phone
Screenshots can be prevented with our anti-screenshot technology
Encrypted Text and Pictures can be added to videos that can only be viewed and decrypted by the intended recipients
Video Scrambling Technology that renders our self-destructing videos useless.






Why Reg. A+ is Perfect for DatChat?
Don’t you think it is Better to have thousands of investors that will use and help spread the word and Protect their privacy at the same time





Experienced Management Team
Team Story
Each person on the DatChat Team understands two things: First, nothing is more important than protecting our personal privacy. Second, the technology to protect our privacy has to be easy to use and always guarding us. We have assembled a team of developers, marketers and advisors to help ensure our technology and solutions put us back in control of our privacy.
The inspiration for DatChat came when Darin and Pete were asked by a friend to recover deleted messages their phone.  They were all shocked at how much data they recovered including: deleted text messages, voice mails, pictures, notes, bookmarks, visited websites and much more.  Having worked together since 2005 on personal privacy and social marketing projects, they knew the time was right to create DatChat.
Darin Myman, CEO
As a successful entrepreneur Darin Myman has developed patented privacy technology for email, developed expertise in viral and traditional marketing, run successful public relations campaigns and taken several companies from private to public.  Notably, he was a founder of BigString, Inc., the self-destructing email platform which serviced millions of customers.  Mr. Myman was also a co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of LiveInsurance.com, the first online insurance broker that pioneered the electronic storefront for large national insurance agencies. Prior to co-founding LiveInsurance.com, he served as a Vice President of the online brokerage services unit of Westminster Securities Corporation.
Peter Shelus, Founder and Chief Technology Officer
Mr. Shelus has over 10 years of Self-Destructing Messaging, Social Marketing and Mobile Video development experience. As a lead engineer of the first self-destructing email, mobile and social messaging platform  “BigString”, Mr. Shelus has been a pioneer and thought leader ahead of his time in secure messaging having developed patented technology that became a cornerstone of self-destructing messaging. Mr. Shelus graduated from Rutgers University with honors and a degree in Computer Science.
Darin Myman, CEO & Peter Shelus have been ahead of their time in developing patent pending technology for ephemeral messaging and digital privacy since 2004.

Unfortunately, that process can be incredibly complicated. Phone systems from different eras have different requirements, and then they get updated over time. It can be hard to even diagnose the problem properly, much less identify the right piece of equipment.
That’s where we come in. Call, live chat or email one of our experts today, and we’ll help you determine what is needed, and figure out what is compatible with the wide range of Avaya and Cisco solutions. We have 25 years of experience with this, so we get it right the first time, so you can install and stop worrying about it.





What We Sell

VDN sells new and used parts and pieces, and we stand behind our products regardless of their age.
When you order your own equipment, it takes lots of time and effort, and it’s often confusing. We make it simple and right for you. Working with VDN means getting the exact parts and pieces you need, at the right place and right time.
Rather than struggle with figuring out what you need and then try to find it yourself, talk to VDN, where you get the products you need and the experts who understand them. With VDN, you can buy with confidence that you’re getting the right part at the right price.

No piece of equipment gets shipped out of our office before being fully tested and proven to be fully operational as if it were just out of the box. We sell a number of refurbished parts, many of which are no longer in production. They’re not brand new, but they’ll work like they are. No complicated installs or calibrations, our equipment comes to you ready to plug-and-play.
Finally, our warranty takes the concern out of buying refurbished. Our warranty covers you if there are any problems with our parts. We’ve been in business for a long time because we care about our customers and we know what we’re doing. Get the support of a company backed by two decades of customer satisfaction.
