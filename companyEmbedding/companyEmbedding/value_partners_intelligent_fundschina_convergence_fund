Risk Disclosure 


China Convergence Fund (The “Fund”) primarily invests in A and B shares listed on the stock exchanges of Shanghai and Shenzhen as well as in H shares listed in Hong Kong.
The Fund invests in China and therefore is subject to emerging market risks. Generally, investments in emerging markets are more volatile than investments in developed markets due to additional risks relating to political, social, economic and regulatory uncertainty.
The Fund is also subject to concentration risk due to its concentration in China-related companies. Adverse development in such region may affect the value of the underlying securities in which the Fund invests.
The Fund may directly invest in A Shares and other eligible securities through the qualified foreign institutional investors (“QFII”) quota. Investors will be subject to certain risks including repatriation risk, custodial risk, regulatory risk. In addition, the QFII policy and rules are subject to change. All these may adversely impact the Fund.
The Fund may also invest in derivatives which can involve material risks, e.g. counterparty default risk, insolvency or liquidity risk, and may expose the Fund to significant losses.
You should not make investment decision on the basis of this material alone. Please read the explanatory memorandum for details and risk factors.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
Single inverse ETFs are trading tools that allow investors to either seek profit or seek to apply a hedge for an existing portfolio position that they anticipate will experience negative returns, in the short term.

The fund allows investors a tactical trading alternative to selling out of an existing position and creating a taxable event.
Since it does not employ leverage, compounding is less magnified compared to leveraged inverse ETFs.

Inverse ETFs are designed to move in the opposite direction of their benchmarks on a daily basis, and should not be expected to track their underlying indexes over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand the consequences of seeking daily inverse investment results and intend to actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The CSI 300 Index (CSIN0301) is a modified free-float market capitalization weighted index comprised of the largest and most liquid stocks in the Chinese A-share market. Index constituent stocks must have been listed for more than three months (unless the stock’s average daily A-share market capitalization since its initial listing ranks among the top 30 of all A-shares) and must not be experiencing obvious abnormal fluctuations or market manipulations. One cannot invest directly in an Index.

If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate.

Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

China A Shares ETFs | Direxion



























 






























China A-shares, which trade on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges, account for roughly two-thirds of the market capitalization of Chinese stocks. Since most foreign investors cannot purchase China A-shares, investors in most existing China ETFs lack exposure to the majority of Chinese companies.  Direxion Daily CSI 300 China A Share Bull 2x Shares and Bear 1x Shares offer liquid, transparent ways to trade A-shares in either direction.

China A Shares ETFs | Direxion



























 






























China A-shares, which trade on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges, account for roughly two-thirds of the market capitalization of Chinese stocks. Since most foreign investors cannot purchase China A-shares, investors in most existing China ETFs lack exposure to the majority of Chinese companies.  Direxion Daily CSI 300 China A Share Bull 2x Shares and Bear 1x Shares offer liquid, transparent ways to trade A-shares in either direction.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95% for CHAU and 0.80% for CHAD. The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2017, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% for CHAU, and 0.80% for CHAD, other than the following: taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions, expenses incurred in connection with any merger or reorganization and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus or summary prospectus. Index performance does not include any fees or expenses, are unmanaged and cannot be invested in directly.
