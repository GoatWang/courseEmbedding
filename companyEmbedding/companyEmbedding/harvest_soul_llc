Harvest Soul Announces Launch of Probiotic Juice Line

Press Release Feb. 25, 2016 at 1:11 pm









        More 











ATLANTA (February 25, 2016) – Harvest Soul, LLC announces the release of a Probiotic line of organic, high fiber juices enhanced with GanedenBC30®. The latest addition to Harvest Soul’s growing lineup of Chewable and Blended juice products, the Probiotic line includes PRO Tropical, PRO Greens, PRO Beet and PRO Berry varieties.
Available online (http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_pg_2?srs=13254666011&rh=i%3Aspecialty-aps&page=2&ie=UTF8&qid=1456418090) now and at various retail locations throughout the Southeast beginning this Spring, the Probiotic Juice retails for $5.99 per 12 ounce bottle and contains up to 2 billion CFUs of GanedenBC30, a highly effective and proven probiotic that keeps good and bad bacteria in proper balance for a healthy digestive function and immune system. The USDA organic, non-GMO Probiotic Juices combine powerful probiotics with healthy juices from nutritious leafy greens and anti-oxidant rich fruits and veggies.


“When we decided to create a probiotic juice to meet the growing consumer demand for all-things probiotic, we knew we wanted to partner with the industry’s leader,” said Kevin Quirk, Harvest Soul president and chief executive officer. “GanedenBC30 is science-backed with a proven track record for supporting gut and immune health; consumers can trust it to deliver.”
The probiotic market is projected to reach $36.7 billion in 2018, a 35% increase over $27.1 billion in 2013, according to BCC Research. Research also shows that most consumers prefer to consume probiotics in food and beverages, rather than supplements. “Harvest Soul Organic Juices and Ganeden is a great partnership. Our highly effective probiotic GanedenBC30 doesn’t alter the taste when mixed with the fresh-tasting blended juices, making an already good-for-you product even better,” says Andrew Lefkowitz, president and CEO of Ganeden.
The Atlanta-based, family owned and operated Harvest Soul brand is committed to providing delicious juices that retain the healthy fiber typically juiced away in traditional processes. Made from whole fruits and vegetables and never from concentrates, Harvest Soul juices do not add sweeteners and are also gluten free. All Harvest Soul juices are USDA Organic and Non-GMO Project verified, ensuring premium quality.
Harvest Soul will be showcasing their Probiotic Juices at the Natural Products Expo West trade show in Anaheim March 10-12at booth H113.

Harvest Soul Organic Juice Expands Production into New 28,000 sq. ft. Facility

Press Release Mar. 2, 2017 at 11:51 am









        More 











Atlanta, GA (March 2, 2017) – Harvest Soul Organic Juice has announced the opening of its new 28,000 sq. ft. production facility in the Atlanta area, increasing its annual capacity to over 2 million gallons. With the increased space to prep and produce its high fiber organic blended fruit and vegetable juices, the Company has greatly increased its ability to satisfy its growing demand.
Given its expanded distribution into major retailers like Sprouts Farmers Markets, and other regional retailers, the Company began looking for larger production facilities last year. With 15,000 sq. ft. of cooler space, and room for high tech equipment like juicers, fillers, bottlers and cappers, the new facility will allow Harvest Soul to expand even further into new markets and continue to enhance their product portfolio. Located south of Atlanta and close to its high pressure processing facility and major distributing partner, KeHE, the new facility will also improve manufacturing efficiencies and speed to market for the 3-year old company.

“By owning and managing our own production, we’re able to more closely control our supply chain, quality and cost of goods which is imperative in producing organic foods and beverages of the highest standards. Also, given the uniqueness of our product, there was no one else that could produce it,” said Kevin Quirk, CEO of Harvest Soul. “However, it really became apparent last fall, when we had many thousands of pounds of produce delivered at once to fill our first Sprouts Farmers Markets PO, that we needed more room, and fast!” continued Quirk.
The new facility, formerly a produce distribution center, will add about 30 part-time jobs to the Fairburn area, south of Atlanta. The official grand opening of the facility is slated for April 21, 2017.
Harvest Soul Organic Juice is committed to providing delicious juices that retain the healthy fiber typically juiced away in traditional processes. Made from whole fruits and vegetables, some with nuts, seeds and berries, Harvest Soul never uses concentrates or add sweeteners or flavors. All Harvest Soul juices are USDA Organic and Non-GMO Project verified, ensuring premium quality. Sold in select natural/organic retailers and also through Amazon, Harvest Soul offers three lines: Chewable, Probiotic and Blended. The Company will also be showcasing their organic blended juices at the Natural Products Expo West trade show in Anaheim March 9-11 booth #H213.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Harvest Soul Announces the Launch of Probiotic Juice Line
USDA Organic, High Fiber Juice Company Partners with Ganeden Probiotics

ATLANTA (February 25, 2016) Harvest Soul, LLC announces the release of a Probiotic line of organic, high fiber juices enhanced with GanedenBC30®. The latest addition to Harvest Soul’s growing lineup of Chewable and Blended juice products, the Probiotic line includes PRO Tropical, PRO Greens, PRO Beet and PRO Berry varieties.
Available online now and at various retail locations throughout the Southeast beginning this Spring, the Probiotic Juice retails for $5.99 per 12 ounce bottle and contains up to 2 billion CFUs of GanedenBC30, a highly effective and proven probiotic that keeps good and bad bacteria in proper balance for a healthy digestive function and immune system. The USDA organic, non-GMO Probiotic Juices combine powerful probiotics with healthy juices from nutritious leafy greens and anti-oxidant rich fruits and veggies.
“When we decided to create a probiotic juice to meet the growing consumer demand for all-things probiotic, we knew we wanted to partner with the industry’s leader,” said Kevin Quirk, Harvest Soul president and chief executive officer. “GanedenBC30 is science-backed with a proven track record for supporting gut and immune health; consumers can trust it to deliver.”
The probiotic market is projected to reach $36.7 billion in 2018, a 35% increase over $27.1 billion in 2013, according to BCC Research. Research also shows that most consumers prefer to consume probiotics in food and beverages, rather than supplements. “Harvest Soul Organic Juices and Ganeden is a great partnership. Our highly effective probiotic GanedenBC30 doesn’t alter the taste when mixed with the fresh-tasting blended juices, making an already good-for-you product even better,” says Andrew Lefkowitz, president and CEO of Ganeden.
The Atlanta-based, family owned and operated Harvest Soul brand is committed to providing delicious juices that retain the healthy fiber typically juiced away in traditional processes. Made from whole fruits and vegetables and never from concentrates, Harvest Soul juices do not add sweeteners and are also gluten free. All Harvest Soul juices are USDA Organic and Non-GMO Project verified, ensuring premium quality.
Harvest Soul will be showcasing their Probiotic Juices at the Natural Products Expo West trade show in Anaheim March 10-12 at booth H113.
