The office market in the Greater Boston area centers around both stable and established companies and the emergence of a large number of small to mid-size firms in four industry groups: financial services, health care, high technology and knowledge creation, including research and development, consulting and education.
Economic growth in this tenth largest metropolitan area reflects the diverse mix of companies, the presence of leading universities and medical research institutions, the availability of local venture and growth capital, and the vitality of the cities of Boston, Cambridge and Waltham as business, cultural and residential centers.

This market, which encompasses Northern Virginia, suburban Maryland and the District of Columbia, is the nation’s fifth largest metropolitan area and the second largest office market after New York. The economy of the region is driven mainly by the presence, stability and procurement dollars of the Federal Government. It is home to the United States’ wealthiest counties, highest concentration of scientists and engineers, the second largest concentration of technology firms, and benefits from a very highly educated work force.
Business services and government consulting industries, particularly knowledge-based companies such as information technology and data communications firms, have been the driving engines of recent growth. Fairfax County, Virginia, has become the technology center of the region, and is the beneficiary of more Federal procurement money than any other county in the U.S. Montgomery County, in suburban Maryland, is home to many specialized biotech research companies, reflecting close proximity to the National Institutes of Health and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Major law firms, corporate lobbying offices and non-profit associations are the primary tenant-demand drivers in the District of Columbia.

Overview

Overview
Boston Properties, a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust (REIT), is one of the largest owners, managers and developers of Class A office properties in the United States, with a significant presence in five markets: Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Washington, DC. The Company was founded in 1970 by Mortimer B. Zuckerman and Edward H. Linde in Boston, where it maintains its headquarters. Boston Properties became a public company in June 1997 and is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “BXP.”
Boston Properties is a fully integrated real estate investment trust that develops, redevelops, acquires, manages, operates and owns a diverse portfolio of primarily Class A office space totaling 47.7 million square feet and consisting of 164 office properties (including six properties under construction), five retail properties, four residential properties (including two properties under construction) and one hotel. Boston Properties is well-known for its in-house building management expertise and responsiveness to tenants’ needs. The Company holds a superior track record in developing premium Central Business District (CBD) office buildings, suburban office centers and build-to-suit projects for the U.S. government and a diverse array of creditworthy tenants.
What is a REIT?
A REIT is a company that owns, and in most cases, operates income-producing real estate such as apartments, shopping centers, offices, hotels and warehouses. Some REITs also engage in financing real estate. The shares of many REITs are freely traded, usually on a major stock exchange.
To qualify as a REIT, a company must distribute at least 90 percent of its taxable income to its shareholders annually. A company that qualifies as a REIT is permitted to deduct dividends paid to its shareholders from its corporate taxable income. As a result, most REITs distribute at least 100 percent of their taxable income to their shareholders and therefore owe no federal corporate tax. Taxes are paid by shareholders on the dividends received and any capital gains. Most states honor this federal treatment and also do not require REITs to pay state income tax. Like other businesses, but unlike partnerships, a REIT cannot pass any tax losses through to its investors.

2011
Outperformance Awards under the Second Amendment and Restatement of
the Boston Properties, Inc. 1997 Stock Option and Incentive Plan
(the “Plan”)

On
January 20, 2011, the Compensation Committee (the
“Committee”) of the Board of Directors (the
“Board”) of Boston Properties, Inc. (the
“Company”), the general partner of Boston Properties
Limited, approved outperformance awards under the Plan to officers
and key employees of the Company. These awards (the “2011 OPP
Awards”) are part of a broad-based, long-term incentive
compensation program, generally referred to as an
“outperformance plan,” designed to provide the
Company’s management team at several levels within the
organization with the potential to earn equity awards subject to
the Company creating shareholder value in a pay-for-performance
structure. In 2008, the Committee implemented a similar program
whereby recipients of 2008 outperformance awards would share in an
outperformance pool if the Company’s total return to
shareholders (“TRS”), including both share appreciation
and dividends, exceeds absolute and relative hurdles over the
period from February 5, 2008 to February 5, 2011.
Recipients of 2008 outperformance awards are not expected to earn
any rewards under the 2008 program.

2011 OPP
Awards utilize TRS over a three-year measurement period as the
performance metric and include two years of time-based vesting
after the end of the performance measurement period (subject to
acceleration in certain events) as a retention tool. Recipients of
2011 OPP Awards will share in an outperformance pool if the
Company’s TRS, including both share appreciation and
dividends, exceeds absolute and relative hurdles over a three-year
measurement period from February 1, 2011 to January 31,
2014, based on the average closing price of a share of the
Company’s common stock (a “REIT Share”) for the
five trading days prior to and including February 1, 2011. The
aggregate reward that recipients of all 2011 OPP Awards can earn,
as measured by the outperformance pool, is subject to a maximum cap
of $40 million. The Company expects that under the Financial
Accounting Standards Board’s Accounting Standards
Codification (“ASC”) 718 “Compensation –
Stock Compensation” the 2011 OPP Awards will have an
aggregate value of approximately $7.4 million, which amount will be
amortized into earnings over the five-year plan period under the
graded vesting method.

The
outperformance pool will consist of (i) two percent
(2%) of the excess total return above a cumulative absolute
TRS hurdle of 27% over the full three-year measurement period
(equivalent to 9% per annum) (the “Absolute TRS
Component”) and (ii) two percent (2%) of the excess
or deficient excess total return above or below a relative TRS
hurdle equal to the total return of the SNL Equity REIT Index over
the three-year measurement period (the “Relative TRS
Component”). In the event that the Relative TRS Component is
potentially positive because the Company’s TRS is greater
than the total return of the SNL Equity REIT Index, but the Company
achieves a cumulative absolute TRS below 27% over the three-year
measurement period (equivalent to 9% per annum), the actual
contribution to the outperformance pool from the Relative TRS
Component will be subject to a sliding scale factor as follows:
(i) 100% of the potential Relative TRS Component will be
earned if the Company’s TRS is equal to or greater than a
cumulative 27% over three years, (ii) 0% will be earned if the
Company’s TRS is 0% or less, and (iii) a percentage from
0% to 100% calculated by linear interpolation will be earned if the
Company’s cumulative TRS over three years is between 0% and
27%. For example, if the Company achieves a cumulative absolute TRS
of 18% over the full three-year measurement period (equivalent to a
6% absolute annual TRS), the

potential
Relative TRS Component would be prorated by 66.67%. The potential
Relative TRS Component before application of the sliding scale
factor will be capped at $40 million. In the event that the
Relative TRS Component is negative because the Company’s TRS
is less than the total return of the SNL Equity REIT Index, any
outperformance reward potentially earned under the Absolute TRS
Component will be reduced dollar for dollar, provided that the
potential Absolute TRS Component before reduction for any negative
Relative TRS Component will be capped at $40 million. The algebraic
sum of the Absolute TRS Component and the Relative TRS Component
determined as described above will never exceed $40
million.

Each
employee’s 2011 OPP Award will be designated as a specified
percentage of the aggregate outperformance pool. Assuming the
applicable absolute and/or relative TRS thresholds are achieved at
the end of the measurement period, the algebraic sum of the
Absolute TRS Component and the Relative TRS Component will be
calculated and then allocated among the 2011 OPP Award recipients
in accordance with each individual’s percentage. Rewards

Boston Properties, Inc., a self-administered and self-managed American real estate investment trust (REIT), is one of the largest owners, managers and developers of Class A office properties in the United States, with a significant presence in five markets: Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Washington, DC. The Company was founded in 1970 by Mortimer B. Zuckerman and Edward H. Linde in Boston, Massachusetts, where it maintains its headquarters. Boston Properties became a public company in June 1997 and is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “BXP.”[3]
Boston Properties is a fully integrated real estate investment trust that develops, redevelops, acquires, manages, operates and owns a diverse portfolio of primarily Class A office space totaling 47.7 million square feet and consisting of 164 office properties (including six properties under construction), five retail properties, four residential properties (including two properties under construction) and one hotel. Boston Properties is well-known for its in-house building management expertise and responsiveness to tenants’ needs. The Company holds a superior track record in developing premium Central Business District (CBD) office buildings, suburban office centers and build-to-suit projects for the U.S. government and a diverse array of creditworthy tenants.[3]
The company specializes in high-performance workspace and acquired several high-value properties in these markets, including the General Motors Building in New York City for US$2.8 billion, the highest paid for an American office building.[4][5] It also owns one hotel property and is a member of REBNY.[6]
In 2005, it constructed 901 New York Avenue NW in Washington, D.C.[7] in the Mount Vernon Square neighborhood seven blocks northeast of the White House.
In October 2010, Boston Properties bought the John Hancock Tower and Garage from a partnership between Normandy Real Estate Partners & Five Mile Capital Partners for $930 million.[8]

Boston Properties, Inc., a self-administered and self-managed American real estate investment trust (REIT), is one of the largest owners, managers and developers of Class A office properties in the United States, with a significant presence in five markets: Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Washington, DC. The Company was founded in 1970 by Mortimer B. Zuckerman and Edward H. Linde in Boston, Massachusetts, where it maintains its headquarters. Boston Properties became a public company in June 1997 and is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “BXP.”[3]
Boston Properties is a fully integrated real estate investment trust that develops, redevelops, acquires, manages, operates and owns a diverse portfolio of primarily Class A office space totaling 47.7 million square feet and consisting of 164 office properties (including six properties under construction), five retail properties, four residential properties (including two properties under construction) and one hotel. Boston Properties is well-known for its in-house building management expertise and responsiveness to tenants’ needs. The Company holds a superior track record in developing premium Central Business District (CBD) office buildings, suburban office centers and build-to-suit projects for the U.S. government and a diverse array of creditworthy tenants.[3]
The company specializes in high-performance workspace and acquired several high-value properties in these markets, including the General Motors Building in New York City for US$2.8 billion, the highest paid for an American office building.[4][5] It also owns one hotel property and is a member of REBNY.[6]
In 2005, it constructed 901 New York Avenue NW in Washington, D.C.[7] in the Mount Vernon Square neighborhood seven blocks northeast of the White House.
In October 2010, Boston Properties bought the John Hancock Tower and Garage from a partnership between Normandy Real Estate Partners & Five Mile Capital Partners for $930 million.[8]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
