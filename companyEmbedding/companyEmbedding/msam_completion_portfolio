Product Description
The Moloney Securities Growth Composite, managed by Ron Medley, 
			is available to individual and institutional investors and can be 
			customized to meet the needs of each client's investment policy.
Investment Process
The investment research process is focused on finding companies that 
			create return on invested capital above their cost of capital which 
			can further translate into an increased share price for 
			stockholders. This is achieved through both bottom up fundamental 
			analysis and top down macro theme development. Key in the process
			is finding companies that are making strategic decisions and have catalysts driving their 
			performance which have yet to hit the company�s financials. Thus, equity investments 
			are sought in companies that display fundamental growth characteristics and trade at a price discount to their modeled 
			intrinsic value. Upon completion of due diligence, companies are compared and selected for investment when they are:


Trading at a discount to their modeled intrinsic 
				fair value


In an environment where that value can be 
				realized by the market in the next 1-3 years


Generally, investments are sold when one of the 
			following conditions is met:


The company has reached its modeled fair value 
				and therefore has no further investment upside


Company specific and/or industry, macroeconomic 
				factors no longer support the intrinsic value framework


Another investment opportunity offering more 
				value is identified


Client Customization
The investment process can be further customized to meet the 
			needs of each individual client's investment policy.  This is 
			accomplished by narrowing the investment style to meet each client's 
			investment preferences, such as: limiting investment to specific 
			asset classes, company size or bond rating (example: 100% equity, 
			mid-cap only), accommodating social investing concerns, & using tax 
			efficient strategies. 
Portfolio Composition



			 
 
Disclosures: 
1. Moloney Securities Asset Management (MSAM) is an investment 
			advisory firm and is affiliated with Moloney Securities Co., Inc., a dually registered, broker/dealer and registered investment 
			advisor.  
2. The MSAM Growth Composite contains discretionary, fee paying, 
			accounts, managed by Ron Medley, that follow a growth investment 
			strategy. Investments can include both equity & income producing 
			securities. Equity investments can be held across the spectrum of 
			company size but are normally concentrated in mid cap domestic 
			companies. The investment research process is focused on finding 
			growth at a reasonable price in companies that can create return on 
			invested capital for shareholders. Thus, equity investments are 
			sought in companies that display fundamental growth characteristics 
			and trade at a price discount to their modeled intrinsic value. 
			Income producing securities can be used from time to time and are 
			generally considered to lessen the volatility of an all stock 
			portfolio. Account asset allocations are adjusted individually in 
			accordance with each client's risk tolerance & investment 
			preferences.  Portfolio construction methods are used to follow 
			the same Growth Composite methodology across portfolios while 
			allowing for customization of individual client accounts per their 
			unique risk tolerance and investment preferences.
3. Returns are presented both gross and net of management fees and include the 
			reinvestment of all income.  Gross of fees includes trading 
			costs and net of fees includes management fees.  There are no 
			performance fees.  The effect of withholding tax on the growth 
			composite is not considered nor is it reflected in the benchmark 
			price indices.  The firm has a policy of checking for 
			significant cash flows and revaluing portfolios for performance 
			purposes when a cash flow greater than 10% happens.
4. The S&P 500, the S&P 1500, and the S&P 
			400 are provided for comparison to the Growth Composite. The S&P 500 
			for its characteristic of representing the broad market; and the S&P 
			1500 for its ability to represent a comparison to companies from 
			large to small: the S&P 1500 is made up of the S&P 500 (large 
			companies), the S&P 400 (mid-size companies) and the S&P 600 (small 
			companies); and the S&P 400 for its characteristic of representing 
			the target investment in the composite. None of the S&P indices 
			reflect the deduction of a management fee if an investor invested in 
			them. Nor do any of the S&P indices reflect the reinvestment of all 
			income. 
5. To receive a complete list, description and presentation of 
			all MSAM composites, policies regarding valuing portfolios, 
			calculating performance  and/or additional presentation 
			information, contact Ron Medley at 1-800-628-6002, x3003 or write 
			Attn: Ron Medley, MSAM, 13537 Barrett Pkwy. Dr., Ste. 330,

The Fund
A tactically managed asset allocation fund with the ability to invest across all asset classes managed by the same Eaton Vance investment team as Multi-Strategy Absolute Return Fund. Fund managers are responsible for top-down asset allocation decisions,  utilizing other Eaton Vance-sponsored portfolios and mutual funds for security selection and subsector allocation.



The Approach
Using quantitative tools to support valuation analysis, managers build a forward-looking risk and return framework for all asset classes considered for inclusion in the Fund. Using these risk/return projections, allocations believed to optimize risk-adju sted returns are implemented.



The Features
Designed as a core portfolio holding, the Fund tactically allocates across asset classes in search of opportunities with a focus on managing risk. Its flexibility provides the Fund the freedom to seek out any investment believed to offer the most attract ive risk-adjusted return potential in any given market environment.







 

 OverviewA steeper efficient frontier would indicate a “risk-on” environment, as each step out on the risk spectrum would meaningfully increase expected return. A flatter frontier indicates “risk off,” as the opposite would be true.1

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance is for the stated time period only; due to market vola tility, the Fund’s current performance may be lower or higher than quoted. Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage change in net asset value (NAV) with all distributions reinvested. Returns for other classes of share s offered by the Fund are different. Performance less than or equal to one year is cumulative. Max Sales Charge: 4.75%.

Portfolio profile subject to change due to active management. Percentages may not total 100% due to rounding. Fund primarily invests in one or more affiliated investment companies (Portfolios) and may also invest directly. Unless otherwise noted, referen ces to investments are to the aggregate holdings of the Fund, including its pro rata share of each Portfolio or Fund in which it invests.


About Risk: 
While the Fund has a targeted annual performance volatility range, its actual, or realized, volatility for longer or shorter periods may be materially higher or lower than the target range depending on market conditions. An imbalance in supply and demand  in the income market may result in valuation uncertainties and greater volatility, less liquidity, widening credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in the market. Investments in foreign instruments or currencies can involve greater risk and vola tility than U.S. investments because of adverse market, economic, political, regulatory, geopolitical or other conditions. Fund performance is sensitive to stock market volatility. Derivative instruments can be used to take both long and short positions,  be highly volatile, result in economic leverage (which can increase both the risk and return potential of the Fund), and involve risks in addition to the risks of the underlying instrument on which the derivative is based, such as counterparty, correlat ion and liquidity risk. If a counterparty is unable to honor its commitments, the value of Fund shares may decline and/or the Fund could experience delays in the return of collateral or other assets held by the counterparty. The effectiveness of the Fund 's option strategy is dependent upon a general imbalance of natural buyers over natural sellers of index options. This imbalance could decrease or be eliminated, which could have an adverse effect on the Fund. The secondary market for loans is a private,  unregulated inter-dealer or inter-bank resale market. Purchases and sales of loans are generally subject to contractual restrictions that must be satisfied before a loan can be bought or sold. These restrictions may impede the Fund’s ability to bu y or sell loans and may negatively impact the transaction price. It may take longer than seven days for transactions in loans to settle. It is unclear whether U.S. federal securities law protections are available to an investment in a loan. In certain ci rcumstances, loans may not be deemed to be securities, and in the event of fraud or misrepresentation by a borrower, lenders may not have the protection of the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws. There can be no assurance that the liqui dation of collateral securing  a loan will satisfy the issuer’s obligation in the event of non-payment or that collateral can be readily liquidated. ETFs are subject to the risks of investing in the underlying securities and the Fund will bear a pr o rata portion of the operating expenses of an ETF in which it invests. Investing in exchange-traded notes (ETNs) exposes the Fund to the performance of the issuer. The Fund's investments may lose their entire value if the issuer fails. Investments in in come securities may be affected by changes in the creditworthiness of the issuer and are subject to the risk of nonpayment of principal and interest. The value of income securities also may decline because of real or perceived concerns about the issuer's  ability to make principal and interest payments. Investments rated below investment grade (typically referred to as "junk") are generally subject to greater price volatility and illiquidity than higher-rated investments. As interest rates rise, the valu e of certain income investments is likely to decline. The Fund will incur a loss as a result of a short sale if the price of the security sold short increases in value between the date of the short sale and the date on which the Fund purchases the securi ty to replace the borrowed security. A nondiversified fund may be subject to greater risk by investing in a smaller number of investments than a diversified fund. No fund is a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in a fund. The Fu nd may engage in other investment practices that may involve additional risks and you should review the Fund prospectus for a complete description.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds and exchange-traded funds) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considere d a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding  consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.The Overall Morningstar Rat ing for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns,  60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most  weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. Star ratings do not reflect the effect of any applicable sales load.©2017 Morningstar. All  Rights Reserved.

Ratings are based on Moody's, S&P or Fitch, as applicable. If securities are rated differently by the ratings agencies, the higher rating is applied. Ratings, which are subject to change, apply to the creditworthiness of the issuers of the underlying sec urities and not to the Fund or its shares. Credit ratings measure the quality of a bond based on the issuer's creditworthiness, with ratings ranging from AAA, being the highest, to D, being the lowest based on S&P's measures. Ratings of BBB or higher by  S&P or Fitch (Baa or higher by Moody's) are considered to be investment-grade quality. Credit ratings are based largely on the ratings agency's analysis at the time of rating. The rating assigned to any particular security is not necessarily a reflection  of the issuer's current financial condition and does not necessarily reflect its assessment of the volatility of a security's market value or of the liquidity of an investment in the security. Holdings designated as "Not Rated" are not rated by the nati onal ratings agencies stated above.

Portfolio profile subject to change due to active management. Percentages may not total 100% due to rounding. Fund primarily invests in one or more affiliated investment companies (Portfolios) and may also invest directly. Unless otherwise noted, referen ces to investments are to the aggregate holdings of the Fund, including its pro rata share of each Portfolio or Fund in which it invests.


About Risk: 
While the Fund has a targeted annual performance volatility range, its actual, or realized, volatility for longer or shorter periods may be materially higher or lower than the target range depending on market conditions. An imbalance in supply and demand  in the income market may result in valuation uncertainties and greater volatility, less liquidity, widening credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in the market. Investments in foreign instruments or currencies can involve greater risk and vola tility than U.S. investments because of adverse market, economic, political, regulatory, geopolitical or other conditions. Fund performance is sensitive to stock market volatility. Derivative instruments can be used to take both long and short positions,  be highly volatile, result in economic leverage (which can increase both the risk and return potential of the Fund), and involve risks in addition to the risks of the underlying instrument on which the derivative is based, such as counterparty, correlat ion and liquidity risk. If a counterparty is unable to honor its commitments, the value of Fund shares may decline and/or the Fund could experience delays in the return of collateral or other assets held by the counterparty. The effectiveness of the Fund 's option strategy is dependent upon a general imbalance of natural buyers over natural sellers of index options. This imbalance could decrease or be eliminated, which could have an adverse effect on the Fund. The secondary market for loans is a private,  unregulated inter-dealer or inter-bank resale market. Purchases and sales of loans are generally subject to contractual restrictions that must be satisfied before a loan can be bought or sold. These restrictions may impede the Fund’s ability to bu y or sell loans and may negatively impact the transaction price. It may take longer than seven days for transactions in loans to settle. It is unclear whether U.S. federal securities law protections are available to an investment in a loan. In certain ci rcumstances, loans may not be deemed to be securities, and in the event of fraud or misrepresentation by a borrower, lenders may not have the protection of the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws. There can be no assurance that the liqui dation of collateral securing  a loan will satisfy the issuer’s obligation in the event of non-payment or that collateral can be readily liquidated. ETFs are subject to the risks of investing in the underlying securities and the Fund will bear a pr o rata portion of the operating expenses of an ETF in which it invests. Investing in exchange-traded notes (ETNs) exposes the Fund to the performance of the issuer. The Fund's investments may lose their entire value if the issuer fails. Investments in in come securities may be affected by changes in the creditworthiness of the issuer and are subject to the risk of nonpayment of principal and interest. The value of income securities also may decline because of real or perceived concerns about the issuer's  ability to make principal and interest payments. Investments rated below investment grade (typically referred to as "junk") are generally subject to greater price volatility and illiquidity than higher-rated investments. As interest rates rise, the valu e of certain income investments is likely to decline. The Fund will incur a loss as a result of a short sale if the price of the security sold short increases in value between the date of the short sale and the date on which the Fund purchases the securi ty to replace the borrowed security. A nondiversified fund may be subject to greater risk by investing in a smaller number of investments than a diversified fund. No fund is a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in a fund. The Fu nd may engage in other investment practices that may involve additional risks and you should review the Fund prospectus for a complete description.

MSAM Completion Portfolio  October 31, 2014    Notes to Financial
Statements      1  Significant Accounting Policies  MSAM Completion Portfolio (the Portfolio) is a Massachusetts business
trust registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act), as a non-diversified, open-end management investment company. The Portfolios investment objective is total return. The Declaration of Trust permits the
Trustees to issue interests in the Portfolio. At October 31, 2014, Eaton Vance Multi-Strategy All Market Fund held a 99.9% interest in the Portfolio. 
The following is a summary of significant accounting policies of the Portfolio. The policies are in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (U.S. GAAP). The Portfolio is an investment company and follows accounting and reporting guidance in the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification Topic 946. 
A  Investment Valuation  The following
methodologies are used to determine the market value or fair value of investments.  Debt Obligations. Debt obligations (including short-term
obligations with a remaining maturity of more than sixty days) are generally valued on the basis of valuations provided by third party pricing services, as derived from such services pricing models. Inputs to the models may include, but are
not limited to, reported trades, executable bid and asked prices, broker/dealer quotations, prices or yields of securities with similar characteristics, interest rates, anticipated prepayments, benchmark curves or information pertaining to the
issuer, as well as industry and economic events. The pricing services may use a matrix approach, which considers information regarding securities with similar characteristics to determine the valuation for a security. Short-term obligations
purchased with a remaining maturity of sixty days or less are generally valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value.  Derivatives.
Exchange-traded options (other than FLexible EXchange traded options) are valued at the mean between the bid and asked prices at valuation time as reported by the Options Price Reporting Authority for U.S. listed options or by the relevant exchange
or board of trade for non-U.S. listed options. Over-the-counter options (including options on securities, indices and foreign currencies) and FLexible EXchange traded options traded at the Chicago Board Options Exchange are valued by a third party
pricing service using techniques that consider factors including the value of the underlying instrument, the volatility of the underlying instrument and the period of time until option expiration. Financial futures contracts are valued at the
closing settlement price established by the board of trade or exchange on which they are traded.  Affiliated Fund. The Portfolio may invest in
Eaton Vance Cash Reserves Fund, LLC (Cash Reserves Fund), an affiliated investment company managed by Eaton Vance Management (EVM). The value of the Portfolios investment in Cash Reserves Fund reflects the Portfolios proportionate
interest in its net assets. Cash Reserves Fund generally values its investment securities utilizing the amortized cost valuation technique in accordance with Rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act. This technique involves initially valuing a portfolio
security at its cost and thereafter assuming a constant amortization to maturity of any discount or premium. If amortized cost is determined not to approximate fair value, Cash Reserves Fund may value its investment securities in the same manner as
debt obligations described above.  Fair Valuation. Investments for which valuations or market quotations are not readily available or are deemed
unreliable are valued at fair value using methods determined in good faith by or at the direction of the Trustees of the Portfolio in a manner that fairly reflects the securitys value, or the amount that the Portfolio might reasonably expect
to receive for the security upon its current sale in the ordinary course. Each such determination is based on a consideration of relevant factors, which are likely to vary from one pricing context to another. These factors may include, but are
not limited to, the type of security, the existence of any contractual restrictions on the securitys disposition, the price and extent of public trading in similar securities of the issuer or of comparable companies or entities, quotations or
relevant information obtained from broker/dealers or other market participants, information obtained from the issuer, analysts, and/or the appropriate stock exchange (for exchange-traded securities), an analysis of the companys or
entitys financial condition, and an evaluation of the forces that influence the issuer and the market(s) in which the security is purchased and sold.  B  Investment Transactions  Investment transactions for financial statement purposes are
accounted for on a trade date basis. Realized gains and losses on investments sold are determined on the basis of identified cost.  C  Income  Interest income is recorded on the basis of interest accrued, adjusted for amortization of premium or accretion of discount.
 D  Federal Taxes  The Portfolio has
elected to be treated as a partnership for federal tax purposes. No provision is made by the Portfolio for federal or state taxes on any taxable income of the Portfolio because each investor in the Portfolio is ultimately responsible for the payment
of any taxes on its share of taxable income. If one of the Portfolios investors is a regulated investment company that invests all or substantially all of its assets in the Portfolio, the Portfolio normally must satisfy the applicable source
of income and diversification requirements (under the Internal Revenue Code) in order for its investors to satisfy them. The Portfolio will allocate, at least annually among its investors, each investors distributive share of the
Portfolios net investment income, net realized capital gains and any other items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit.  As of
October 31, 2014, the Portfolio had no uncertain tax positions that would require financial statement recognition, de-recognition, or disclosure. The Portfolio files a U.S. federal income tax return annually after its fiscal year-end, which is
subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service for a period of three years from the date of filing.  E  Expense Reduction  State Street Bank and Trust Company (SSBT) serves as custodian of the Portfolio. Pursuant to the custodian agreement, SSBT
receives a fee reduced by credits, which are determined based on the average daily cash balance the Portfolio maintains with SSBT. All credit balances, if any, used to reduce the Portfolios custodian fees are reported as a reduction of
expenses in the Statement of Operations.

MSAM Completion Portfolio  October 31, 2014    Notes to Financial
Statements  continued     
F  Use of Estimates  The preparation of the
financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expense
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
G  Indemnifications  Under the Portfolios
organizational documents, its officers and Trustees may be indemnified against certain liabilities and expenses arising out of the performance of their duties to the Portfolio. Under Massachusetts law, if certain conditions prevail, interestholders
in the Portfolio could be deemed to have personal liability for the obligations of the Portfolio. However, the Portfolios Declaration of Trust contains an express disclaimer of liability on the part of Portfolio interestholders and the By-laws
provide that the Portfolio shall assume the defense on behalf of any Portfolio interestholder. Moreover, the By-laws also provide for indemnification out of Portfolio property of any interestholder held personally liable solely by reason of being or
having been an interestholder for all loss or expense arising from such liability. Additionally, in the normal course of business, the Portfolio enters into agreements with service providers that may contain indemnification clauses. The
Portfolios maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Portfolio that have not yet occurred.  H  Financial Futures Contracts  Upon entering into a financial futures contract, the Portfolio is
required to deposit with the broker, either in cash or securities, an amount equal to a certain percentage of the contract amount (initial margin). Subsequent payments, known as variation margin, are made or received by the Portfolio each business
day, depending on the daily fluctuations in the value of the underlying security or currency, and are recorded as unrealized gains or losses by the Portfolio. Gains (losses) are realized upon the expiration or closing of the financial futures
contracts. Should market conditions change unexpectedly, the Portfolio may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the financial futures contracts and may realize a loss. Futures contracts have minimal counterparty risk as they are exchange traded
and the clearinghouse for the exchange is substituted as the counterparty, guaranteeing counterparty performance.  I  Written Options  Upon the writing of a call or a put option, the premium received by the Portfolio is included in the Statement of Assets and
Liabilities as a liability. The amount of the liability is subsequently marked-to-market to reflect the current market value of the option written, in accordance with the Portfolios policies on investment valuations discussed above. Premiums
received from writing options which expire are treated as realized gains. Premiums received from writing options which are exercised or are closed are added to or offset against the proceeds or amount paid on the transaction to determine the
realized gain or loss. When an index option is exercised, the Portfolio is required to deliver an amount of cash determined by the excess of the strike price of the option over the value of the index (in the case of a put) or the excess of the value
of the index over the strike price of the option (in the case of a call) at contract termination. If a put option on a security is exercised, the premium reduces the cost basis of the securities purchased by the Portfolio. The Portfolio, as a writer
of an option, may have no control over whether the underlying securities or other assets may be sold (call) or purchased (put) and, as a result, bears the market risk of an unfavorable change in the price of the securities or other assets underlying
the written option. The Portfolio may also bear the risk of not being able to enter into a closing transaction if a liquid secondary market does not exist.  J  Purchased Options  Upon the purchase of a call or put option, the premium paid by the
Portfolio is included in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities as an investment. The amount of the investment is subsequently marked-to-market to reflect the current market value of the option purchased, in accordance with the Portfolios
policies on investment valuations discussed above. As the purchaser of an index option, the Portfolio has the right to receive a cash payment equal to any depreciation in the value of the index below the strike price of the option (in the case of a
put) or equal to any appreciation in the value of the index over the strike price of the option (in the case of a call) as of the valuation date of the option. If an option which the Portfolio had purchased expires on the stipulated expiration date,
the Portfolio will realize a loss in the amount of the cost of the option. If the Portfolio enters into a closing sale transaction, the Portfolio will realize a gain or loss, depending on whether the sales proceeds from the closing sale transaction
are greater or less than the cost of the option. If the Portfolio exercises a put option on a security, it will realize a gain or loss from the sale of the underlying security, and the proceeds from such sale will be decreased by the premium
originally paid. If the Portfolio exercises a call option on a security, the cost of the security which the Portfolio purchases upon exercise will be increased by the premium originally paid. The risk associated with purchasing options is limited to
the premium originally paid.  2  Investment Adviser Fee and Other Transactions with Affiliates 
The investment adviser fee is earned by Boston Management and Research (BMR), a subsidiary of EVM, as compensation for investment advisory services rendered to the
Portfolio. The fee is computed at an annual rate of 0.615% of the Portfolios average daily net assets up to $500 million and at reduced rates on daily net assets of $500 million or more. In addition, BMR also receives an investment adviser fee
in an amount equal to 0.55% of the Portfolios average daily net assets up to $500 million that are subject to a written put spread and/or call spread strategy and at reduced rates when the Portfolios daily net assets are $500 million or
more. The Portfolios daily net assets that are subject to a written put spread and/or call spread strategy may exceed the Portfolios daily net assets on any day. The investment adviser fee is payable monthly. For the year ended
October 31, 2014, the investment adviser fee amounted to $56,052 or 1.04% of the Portfolios average daily net assets. The Portfolio invests its cash in Cash Reserves Fund. EVM does not currently receive a fee for advisory services
provided to Cash Reserves Fund. Pursuant to a sub-advisory agreement, BMR has delegated the investment management of the Portfolios options strategy to Parametric Risk Advisors LLC (PRA), an indirect affiliate of EVM. BMR pays PRA a portion of
its adviser fee for sub-advisory services provided to the Portfolio.

MSAM Completion Portfolio  October 31, 2014    Notes to Financial
Statements  continued     
Trustees and officers of the Portfolio who are members of EVMs or BMRs organizations receive remuneration for their services to the Portfolio out of the
investment adviser fee. Trustees of the Portfolio who are not affiliated with the investment adviser may elect to defer receipt of all or a percentage of their annual fees in accordance with the terms of the Trustees Deferred Compensation Plan. For
the year ended October 31, 2014, no significant amounts have been deferred. Certain officers and Trustees of the Portfolio are officers of the above organizations.  3  Purchases and Sales of Investments  Purchases and sales of investments, other than short-term
obligations, and including maturities and paydowns, for the year ended October 31, 2014 were as follows:

 5  Financial Instruments 
The Portfolio may trade in financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of its investing activities. These financial instruments may
include financial futures contracts and written options and may involve, to a varying degree, elements of risk in excess of the amounts recognized for financial statement purposes. The notional or contractual amounts of these instruments represent
the investment the Portfolio has in particular classes of financial instruments and do not necessarily represent the amounts potentially subject to risk. The measurement of the risks associated with these instruments is meaningful only when all
related and offsetting transactions are considered. A summary of written options at October 31, 2014 is included in the Portfolio of Investments. 
The Portfolio did not have any open financial futures contracts at October 31, 2014.  Written options activity for the year ended October 31, 2014 was as follows:

MSAM Completion Portfolio  October 31, 2014    Notes to Financial
Statements  continued     
At October 31, 2014, the Portfolio had sufficient cash and/or securities to cover commitments under these contracts. 
In the normal course of pursuing its investment objective and its use of derivatives, the Portfolio is subject to the following risks: 
Equity Price Risk: The Portfolio seeks to generate incremental return by writing a series of call and put option spread transactions on an index of common stocks.
If the index appreciates or depreciates sufficiently over the period to offset the net premium received, the Portfolio will incur a net loss. The amount of potential loss in the event of a sharp market movement is subject to a cap defined by the
difference in strike prices between written and purchased call and put options, and the notional value of the positions. During the year ended October 31, 2014, the Portfolio also held certain purchased call options contracts to enhance return.
 Foreign Exchange Risk: During the year ended October 31, 2014, the Portfolio entered into currency futures contracts to enhance total return. The
Portfolio also purchased options on currency futures contracts to hedge against fluctuations in currency exchange rates.  Interest Rate Risk: The
Portfolio holds fixed-rate bonds. The value of these bonds may decrease if interest rates rise. During the year ended October 31, 2014, the Portfolio purchased and sold U.S. Treasury futures contracts to hedge against fluctuations in interest
rates and to manage its effective duration.  The fair value of open derivative instruments (not considered to be hedging instruments for accounting
disclosure purposes) and whose primary underlying risk exposure is equity price risk at October 31, 2014 was as follows:

Statements  continued     
The average principal amount of purchased currency options contracts and average number of purchased index options contracts outstanding during the year ended
October 31, 2014, which are indicative of the volume of these derivative types, were approximately $265,000 and 142 contracts, respectively. 
6  Line of Credit  The Portfolio participates with other
portfolios and funds managed by EVM and its affiliates in a $750 million unsecured line of credit agreement with a group of banks. Borrowings are made by the Portfolio solely to facilitate the handling of unusual and/or unanticipated short-term cash
requirements. Interest is charged to the Portfolio based on its borrowings at an amount above either the Eurodollar rate or Federal Funds rate. In addition, a fee computed at an annual rate of 0.08% on the daily unused portion of the line of credit
is allocated among the participating portfolios and funds at the end of each quarter. Because the line of credit is not available exclusively to the Portfolio, it may be unable to borrow some or all of its requested amounts at any particular time.
The Portfolio did not have any significant borrowings or allocated fees during the year ended October 31, 2014.  7  Fair Value
Measurements  Under generally accepted accounting principles for fair value measurements, a three-tier hierarchy to prioritize the assumptions, referred
to as inputs, is used in valuation techniques to measure fair value. The three-tier hierarchy of inputs is summarized in the three broad levels listed below.   



 
 Level 1  quoted prices in active markets for identical investments 
 



 
 Level 2  other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar investments, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risk, etc.)
  



 
 Level 3  significant unobservable inputs (including a funds own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments)
 In cases where the inputs used to measure fair value fall in different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level disclosed is
determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those
securities.  At October 31, 2014, the hierarchy of inputs used in valuing the Portfolios investments and open derivative instruments, which
are carried at value, were as follows:

MSAM Completion Portfolio  October 31, 2014    Report of Independent
Registered Public Accounting Firm     
To the Trustees and Investors of MSAM Completion Portfolio:  We have
audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of MSAM Completion Portfolio (the Portfolio), including the portfolio of investments, as of October 31, 2014, and the related statement of operations for the year then
ended, the statements of changes in net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended, and the supplementary data for each of the three years in the period then ended. These financial statements and supplementary data are the
responsibility of the Portfolios management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and supplementary data based on our audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements and supplementary data are free of material misstatement. The Portfolio is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included
consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Portfolios internal
control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of October 31, 2014, by correspondence with the custodian and brokers;
where replies were not received from brokers, we performed other auditing procedures. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  In our opinion, such financial statements and supplementary data referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of MSAM Completion Portfolio as of October 31, 2014, the
results of its operations for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended, and the supplementary data for each of the three years in the period then ended, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP  Boston, Massachusetts  December 17, 2014

(e)(1) The registrants audit committee has adopted policies and procedures relating to the pre-approval of services provided by the registrants
principal accountant (the Pre-Approval Policies). The Pre-Approval Policies establish a framework intended to assist the audit committee in the proper discharge of its pre-approval responsibilities. As a general matter, the Pre-Approval
Policies (i) specify certain types of audit, audit-related, tax, and other services determined to be pre-approved by the audit committee; and (ii) delineate specific procedures governing the mechanics of the pre-approval process, including
the approval and monitoring of audit and non-audit service fees. Unless a service is specifically pre-approved under the Pre-Approval Policies, it must be separately pre-approved by the audit committee. 
The Pre-Approval Policies and the types of audit and non-audit services pre-approved therein must be reviewed and ratified by the registrants audit
committee at least annually. The registrants audit committee maintains full responsibility for the appointment, compensation, and oversight of the work of the registrants principal accountant.

Certain subsidiaries of Eaton Vance Corp. provide ongoing services to the registrant.  (h) The
registrants audit committee has considered whether the provision by the registrants principal accountant of non-audit services to the registrants investment adviser and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control
with the adviser that provides ongoing services to the registrant that were not pre-approved pursuant to Rule 2-01(c)(7)(ii) of Regulation S-X is compatible with maintaining the principal accountants independence.
