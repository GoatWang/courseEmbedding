 CHICAGO, July 26, 2017 /PRNewswire/ Crowe Horwath LLPjoins the growing coalition pledging to advance diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Only one month after 150 CEOs came together to launch CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion, more than 100 additional CEOs have taken the pledge, committing themselves and the organizations they lead to advance diversity and inclusion in the workplace. 
By signing on to this commitment, Croweis pledging to take action to cultivate a workplace where diverse perspectives and experiences are welcomed and respected, and where employees feel encouraged to discuss diversity and inclusion. The collective of more than 270 signatories have already shared nearly 200 best-known actions, exchanging tangible learning opportunities and creating collaborative conversations via the initiative's unified hub, CEOAction.com.
"Creating an inclusive culture and building a diverse workforce is a strategic driver for our business," said Crowe CEO Jim Powers. "Leveraging the diversity of experiences, backgrounds and perspectives leads us to make better decisions, fuels innovation and creates an environment where our people feel a sense of belonging. We know that the tone from the top of the organization matters when trying to drive change. I am personally committed to the pledge of the coalition and believe we can achieve greater results by working together with other leaders and organizations in making an impact in the workplace."
Organizations joining the pledge are taking a step toward effecting positive change. New research from the Center for Talent Innovation, a nonprofit think tank, found that when employees can discuss the topic of race relations at work, they feel significantly more included and that their ideas are heard and recognized.
CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusionis cultivating a new type of ecosystem centered around collaboration and sharing. The actions, available via CEOAction.com, showcase real-life examples of the open and transparent conversations to cultivate more diverse and inclusive workplace environments. The addition of new signatories will expand the impact of this work beyond the office to communities and industries.
CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion is led by a steering committee of CEOs and leaders from Accenture, BCG, Deloitte US, The Executive Leadership Council, EY, General Atlantic, KPMG, New York Life, Procter & Gamble and PwC. The coalition represents nearly 70 industries, all 50 U.S. states and millions of employees globally.

Founding[edit]

Previously, Crowe had worked in public accounting for many years and also served as the St. Joseph County auditor for eight years. Chizek was head of the accounting department at the University of Notre Dame and also worked part-time in public accounting. Following the death of Fred P.Crowe Sr. in 1952, Cletus F. Chizek reorganized the firm as Crowe, Chizek and Company and two firm personnel, M. Mendel Piser and Fred P. Crowe Jr., became partners. The first legal partnership of Crowe Chizek and Company was formulated in 1962 with six founding partners: Cletus F. Chizek, M. Mendel Piser, Fred P. Crowe Jr., Robert W. Green, Joseph A. Bauters and John J. Pairitz.[1]
Name change to Crowe Horwath[edit]
The firm changed its name to Crowe Horwath in 2008 to strengthen its alignment with Horwath International and in 2009 Horwath International changed its name to Crowe Horwath International. The new name combined the international awareness of the Horwath brand with the United States awareness of Crowe Horwath LLP (Crowe), the network’s largest member firm in the U.S.
Historically, Crowe is one of the fastest growing firms with an average annual growth rate of 17 percent over the past 40 years.[2]

To get you away from a larger firm-they will offer more money. They won't offer it at first, but ask for a signing bonus, and they’ll pay it.Work Environment- an interesting client portfolio. They do tax/accounting and advisory services for government and mid-size companies (think small cap stocks). This makes for clients that aren't as bureaucratic and many times the value of your work is felt by the C-suite and is immediately realizable by the client.People/Training- talented people and partnership is small which has it's advantages/disadvantages. Their slogan is “the unique alternative to the Big Four”. That means they sell to clients that usually can’t afford the prices that Big Four firms charge for professional services. From an advancement perspective it also means there’s not as many people there trying to make partner.Technology- their homegrown technology packages are simple and easy to use. The company intranet is built off a SharePoint and if you need to research for projects you have lots of periodicals at your disposal. It’s not a big enough firm to where Technology is a strategic lever for them in selling to clients- so don’t think that you will have fancy software packages at your disposal.Processes-it’s a small firm, so they’re simple and usually the part of the company you work in has some best practices to learn and execute. You can be creative/entrepreneurial about how you process work and get things done faster here.ConsPeople/Training- From a people variety standpoint-you won’t find it. You’re stuck with the people in your part of the practice so better hope you like them. Chance are you’ll be too busy executing your project to branch out and meet others. You’ll meet more interesting people at a larger firm. Training and development is something mentioned-but it’s non-existent. There’s not much of an apprenticeship/mentor culture.Processes-If you travel a lot they do NOT provide you a corporate credit card. Inevitably you will have to pay your credit card bills before you get reimbursed for what you spent on the road. Inconvenient.Overall-An opinion but, if you have a good standing and promising future at a larger and more eminent firm- it’s not advisable to leave that behind to join Crowe Horwath. Like many opportunities that pop up in Professional Services-they’ll offer you more money and they offer a smaller organization to where you can be a bigger fish in a smaller pond. It’s better if you have deeper experience working in a smaller firm and to know that you can handle and enjoy it before giving Crowe Horwath a try. If you work in a backoffice type of job it might be a different. But if it’s a client facing job: You have little to no resources, you are the team, and there’s not much margin for error or learning. Carefully consider your options and be aware of the scale of the part of their practice that you are applying for.Advice to ManagementMake sure the hiring manager tells the truth about expectations at this firm when interviewing a candidate. Maybe there’s a way to redo the business model where projects are staffed at a reasonable team size, on a realistic budget, and can be completed in a realistic timeframe.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (2) Crowe Horwath Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Crowe Horwath 2017-07-06 20:29 PDT Jun 23, 2017"Good public accounting firm"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Audit Manager in Fort Lauderdale, FLCurrent Employee - Audit Manager in Fort Lauderdale, FLRecommendsPositive OutlookApproves of CEOI have been working at Crowe Horwath full-time (Less than a year)ProsOpportunity to specialize in an industry.
