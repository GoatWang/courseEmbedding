(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this report to "QEP Midstream" the "Partnership," "we," "our," "us," or like terms, refer to QEP Midstream Partners, LP and its subsidiaries. For purposes of this report, "QEP" refers to QEP Resources, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries including the Partnership. Additionally, "TLLP" refers to Tesoro Logistics LP and its consolidated subsidiaries.  The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited historical condensed consolidated financial statements and notes in Item 1. Financial Statements contained herein and the Partnership's audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Among other things, those historical consolidated financial statements include more detailed information regarding the basis of presentation for the following information. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below as a result of various risk factors, including those that may not be within the control of management. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section entitled "Risk Factors" included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. See also Forward-Looking Statements in Item 3 of this report. For a glossary of commonly used terms found in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, please refer to the "Glossary of Terms" provided in the Partnership's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Overview  QEP Midstream ("the Partnership") is a master limited partnership formed to own, operate, acquire and develop midstream energy assets.  On July 1, 2014, the Partnership acquired 40% of the membership interests in Green River Processing, LLC ("Green River Processing") from QEP Field Services Company ("QEPFSC") for $230 million (the "Green River Processing Acquisition"). The Green River Processing Acquisition was funded with $220 million of borrowings under the Partnership's $500 million revolving credit facility (the "Prior Credit Facility") and cash on hand.  On December 2, 2014, QEP Resources' midstream business was acquired by TLLP, which included all of the issued and outstanding membership interest of QEP Field Services, LLC ("QEPFS"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of QEPFSC formed for purposes of consummating the QEP Field Services acquisition. QEPFS is the owner of QEP Midstream Partners GP, LLC (our "General Partner"), which owns a 2% general partner interest in QEP Midstream and all of the Partnership's incentive distribution rights. The acquisition also included an approximate 56% limited partner interest in the Partnership (collectively, the "Acquisition"). Prior to the Acquisition, QEPFSC owned and operated QEP Midstream's general partner. This resulted in a change of control of the Partnership's general partner and the Partnership became a consolidated subsidiary of TLLP on the acquisition date. Prior to this transaction, QEP Resources, through its wholly-owned subsidiary QEPFSC, served as the Partnership's general partner and owned a 2% general partner interest, all of the Partnership's incentive distribution rights and an approximate 56% limited partner interest in the Partnership.  The Partnership's assets consist of ownership interests in four gathering systems and two Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") regulated pipelines through which we provide natural gas and crude oil gathering and transportation services. Additionally, we have a 40% interest in two gas processing complexes through the Green River Processing Acquisition. Our assets are located in, or are within close proximity to, the Green River Basin located in Wyoming and Colorado, the Uinta Basin located in eastern Utah, and the Williston Basin located in North Dakota.  Recent Developments  On April 22, 2015, the Partnership declared a quarterly cash distribution totaling $18 million, or $0.32 per unit for the first quarter of 2015. The quarterly distribution will be paid on May 15, 2015, to unitholders of record as of the close of business on May 4, 2015.  On April 6, 2015, QEP Midstream entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with TLLP, Tesoro Logistics GP, LLC ("TLGP"), QEPFS, TLLP Merger Sub LLC ("Merger Sub"), and our General Partner. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions in the Merger Agreement, upon the later of the filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware of a certificate of merger or the later date and time set forth in such certificate, Merger Sub will merge with and into QEP Midstream, with QEP Midstream surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of TLLP (the "Merger"). Following the Merger, our General Partner will remain the general partner of QEP Midstream, and all outstanding common units representing limited partnership interests in QEP Midstream (the "QEP Midstream Common Units") other than QEP Midstream Common Units held by QEPFS will be converted into the right to receive 0.3088 common units representing limited partnership interests in TLLP (the "TLLP Common Units"). No fractional TLLP Common Units will be issued in the Merger, and holders of QEP Midstream Common Units other than QEPFS will instead receive cash in lieu of fractional TLLP Common Units, if any.  In the regions where we operate, several producers have announced lower drilling expenditures for 2015. Our 2015 capital plan primarily includes compression projects, which we expect will generate incremental volumes independent of drilling plans.  Our Operations  Our results are driven primarily by the volumes of natural gas and crude oil we gather and the fees charged for such services. We connect wells to gathering lines through which crude oil may be delivered to a downstream pipeline and ultimately to end-users, and natural gas may be delivered to a processing plant, treating facility or downstream pipeline, and ultimately to end-users.  We generally do not take title to the natural gas and crude oil that we gather or transport. We provide substantially all of our gathering services pursuant to fee-based agreements, the majority of which have annual inflation adjustment mechanisms. Under these arrangements, we are paid a fixed or margin-based fee with respect to the volume of the natural gas and crude oil we gather. This type of contract provides us with a relatively steady revenue stream that is not subject to direct commodity price risk, except to the extent that we retain and sell condensate that is recovered during the gathering of natural gas from the wellhead. Approximately 6% of our Partnership's revenue was generated through the sale of condensate volumes that we collected on our gathering systems during three months ended March 31, 2015. Although the Partnership has entered into a fixed price condensate sales agreement with QEPFS, we still have indirect exposure to commodity price risk in that persistent low commodity prices may cause our current or potential customers to delay drilling or shut in production, which would reduce the volumes of oil and natural gas available for gathering by our systems. Refer to the "Commodity Price Risk" discussion in Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in Item 3 for a discussion of our exposure to commodity price risk through our condensate recovery and sales.  With the Green River Processing Acquisition, our activities have expanded to include the processing of natural gas to separate NGL from the natural gas, fractionating the resulting NGL into the various components and selling or delivering pipeline quality natural gas and NGL to various industrial and energy markets as well as interstate pipeline systems. Our earnings from our investment in Green River Processing are primarily driven by commodity prices for NGL and natural gas, as well as the volumes of natural gas processed under fee-based agreements. Effective December 2, 2014, following the completion of the Acquisition, Green River Processing entered into the Keep-Whole Commodity Fee Agreement (the "Keep-Whole Commodity Agreement") with Tesoro Refining & Marketing Company LLC ("TRMC"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tesoro Corporation ("Tesoro"), to minimize and mitigate commodity price risk. See Note 4 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, for additional information regarding related party agreements.  We have significant acreage dedications from several of our largest customers. Pursuant to the terms of those agreements, our customers have dedicated all of the oil and natural gas production they own or control from (i) wells that are currently connected to our gathering systems and located within the acreage dedication and (ii) future wells that are drilled during the term of the applicable gathering contract and located within the dedicated acreage as our gathering systems currently exist and as they are expanded to connect to additional wells.  We provide a portion of our gathering and transportation services on our Three Rivers and Williston gathering systems through firm contracts with minimum volume commitments, which are designed to ensure that we will generate a certain amount of revenue over the life of the gathering agreement by collecting either gathering fees for actual throughput or payments to cover any shortfall.  How We Evaluate Our Business  Our management uses a variety of financial and operating metrics to analyze our performance, including throughput volumes, gathering expenses, maintenance and growth capital expenditures, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow. Both Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow are non-GAAP financial measures. Definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures are discussed below.  Throughput Volumes  The amount of revenue we generate depends primarily on the volumes of natural gas and crude oil that we gather for our customers. The volumes transported on our gathering pipelines are driven by upstream development drilling activity and production volumes from the wells connected to our gathering pipelines.  Gathering Expenses  We seek to maximize the profitability of our operations in part by minimizing, to the extent appropriate, expenses directly tied to operating and maintaining our assets. Direct labor costs, compression costs, ad valorem and property taxes, repair and maintenance costs, integrity management costs, utilities and contract services comprise the most significant portion of our operations and maintenance expense. These expenses generally remain relatively stable across broad ranges of throughput volumes but can fluctuate from period to period depending on the mix of activities performed during that period and the timing of these expenses.  Maintenance and Growth Capital Expenditures  We define maintenance capital expenditures as those that will enable us to maintain our operating capacity or operating income over the long term and growth capital expenditures as those that we expect will increase our operating capacity or operating income over the long term. We schedule our ongoing, routine operating and maintenance capital expenditures on our gathering systems throughout the calendar year to avoid significant variability in our cash flows and maintain safe operations. There is typically some seasonality in our expenditures as we generally reduce routine maintenance in the winter months due to weather conditions. We actively seek new opportunities to add throughput to our systems by expanding the geographic areas covered by our gathering systems, connecting new wells to the systems and installing additional compression. We analyze the expected return on growth capital expenditures and attempt to negotiate terms in our agreements that ensure we will receive an acceptable rate of return on those expenditures.  Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow (Non-GAAP)  We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to the Partnership before depreciation and amortization, interest and other income and expense, gains and losses from asset sales, deferred revenue associated with minimum volume commitment payments and certain other non-cash and/or non-recurring items. We define Distributable Cash Flow as Adjusted EBITDA less net cash interest paid, maintenance capital expenditures and cash adjustments related to equity method investments and noncontrolling interests, and other non-cash expenses. Distributable Cash Flow does not reflect changes in working capital balances.  Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow are non-GAAP financial measures used by management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors and commercial banks, to assess:   our operating performance as compared to other publicly traded partnerships in the midstream energy industry, without regard to historical cost basis or financing methods;   the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to our unitholders;   our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and   the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects, and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities.  General Trends and Outlook  We expect our business to continue to be affected by the following key trends. Our expectations are based on assumptions made by us and information currently available to us. To the extent our underlying assumptions about, or interpretations of, available information prove to be incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from our expected results.  Oil and Natural Gas Supply and Demand  Our gathering operations are primarily dependent upon natural gas and crude oil production in our areas of operation. The decline in natural gas prices over the prior years has caused a related decrease in natural gas drilling in the United States. In addition, there is a natural decline in production from existing wells that are connected to our gathering systems. We anticipate the current level of exploration and production activities in all of the areas in which we operate to fluctuate, although we have no control over this activity. Fluctuations in natural gas and crude oil prices could affect production rates over time and levels of investment by third parties in exploration for and development of new natural gas and crude oil reserves.  Commodity Price Risk  Future exposure to changes in natural gas and NGL prices could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition as changes in prices will impact our production levels and gathering volumes. On December 2, 2014, following the completion of the Acquisition, Green River Processing entered into the Keep-Whole Commodity Agreement with TRMC, to minimize and mitigate commodity price risk; however, it is renewed annually which is subject to renegotiation of terms and pricing each year. For the NGLs that we handle under keep-whole agreements, the Partnership has a fee-based processing agreement with Tesoro which minimizes the impact of commodity price movement during the annual period subsequent to renegotiation of terms and pricing each year. See Note 4 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, for additional information regarding related party agreements.  The regulation of natural gas and crude oil transportation activities by the FERC, and other federal and state regulatory agencies, including the Department Of Transportation (the "DOT"), has a significant impact on our business. For example, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration office of the DOT has established pipeline integrity management programs that require more frequent inspections of pipeline facilities and other preventative measures, which may increase our compliance costs and increase the time it takes to obtain required permits. FERC regulatory policies govern the rates that each pipeline is permitted to charge customers for interstate transportation of natural gas and crude oil. Our operations are also impacted by new regulations, which have increased the time that it takes to obtain required permits. Additionally, increased regulation of natural gas and crude oil producers in our areas of operations, including regulation associated with hydraulic fracturing, could reduce regional supply of natural gas and crude oil, and therefore throughput on our gathering systems.  Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Financial Results  Investment in Green River Processing  On July 1, 2014, the Partnership acquired 40% of the membership interests in Green River Processing from QEPFSC for $230 million. Green River Processing owns the Blacks Fork processing complex and the Emigrant Trail processing plant, both of which are located in southwest Wyoming. The Green River Processing Acquisition is accounted for as an equity method investment in an unconsolidated affiliate. For the three months ended March 31, 2015, Green River Processing net income attributable to the Partnership was $4 million.  Results of Operations The discussion of our historical performance and financial condition is presented for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014. Three Months Ended March 31, 2015 2014 (in millions) Revenues Gathering and transportation $ 33 $ 29 Condensate sales 2 2 Total revenues 35 31 Operating expenses Gathering expense 6 6 General and administrative 4 5 Depreciation and amortization 8 8 Total operating expenses 18 19 Operating income 17 12 Income from unconsolidated affiliates (a) 6 2 Interest expense (1 ) (1 ) Net income 22 13 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest (1 ) (1 ) Net income attributable to QEP Midstream $ 21 $ 12 Operating Statistics Natural gas throughput in millions of MMBtu (b) Gathering and transportation 73 70 Equity interest (c) 7 5 Total natural gas throughput 80 75 Throughput attributable to noncontrolling interests (d) (3 ) (3 ) Total throughput attributable to QEP Midstream 77 72 Crude oil and condensate gathering system throughput volumes (in MBbls) (b) 1,265 1,070 Water gathering volumes (in MBbls) (b) 1,194 1,076 Condensate sales volumes (in MBbls) (b) 25 25 Price Average gas gathering and transportation fee (per MMBtu) (b) $ 0.35 $ 0.31 Average oil and condensate gathering fee (per barrel) $ 2.08 $ 2.36 Average water gathering fee (per barrel) $ 1.88 $ 1.85 Average condensate sale price (per barrel) $ 85.25 $ 85.25 Non-GAAP measures Adjusted EBITDA (e) $ 30 $ 20 Distributable Cash Flow (e) $ 26 $ 18 _____________  (b) MMBtu ("MMBtu") represents one million British thermal units. A British thermal unit is a measure of the energy content in fuel. MBbls ("MBbls") represents one thousand barrels.  (d) Includes the 22% noncontrolling interest in Rendezvous Gas.  (e) Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow are non-GAAP financial measures. See Definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures in section labeled "How we evaluate our business" above. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are included in "Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow" below.  Three Months Ended March 31, 2015 Compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2014  Revenue  Gathering and transportation. Gathering and transportation revenue increased $4 million, or 14%, to $33 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 (the "2015 Quarter") compared to $29 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014 (the "2014 Quarter").  Natural gas gathering and transportation revenue increased $6 million, or 27%, to $28 million for the 2015 Quarter, compared to $22 million for the 2014 Quarter. During the 2015 Quarter, there was throughput of 77 million MMBtu and an average gas gathering and transportation fee of $0.35 per MMBtu. The majority of the natural gas throughput was attributable to our Green River Gathering System and our Vermillion Gathering System, which contributed 60 MMBtu of throughput. During the 2014 Quarter, there was throughput of 72 million MMBtu and an average gas gathering and transportation fee of $0.31 per MMBtu.  Revenues from crude oil, condensate and water gathering decreased $2 million, or 29%, to $5 million during the 2015 Quarter, compared to $7 million for the 2014 Quarter. The average gathering fee for crude oil and condensate decreased by $0.28 per barrel during the 2015 Quarter as compared to the 2014 Quarter. This decrease was offset by a higher throughput for both crude oil and condensate and water gathering during the 2015 Quarter. The 2014 Quarter also included $2 million of revenue attributable to the Williston Gathering System.  Condensate sales. Revenue from condensate sales remained consistent at $2 million during the 2015 Quarter and the 2014 Quarter. During the 2015 Quarter and the 2014 Quarter, sales volumes were approximately 25 MBbls at a fixed price of $85.25 per barrel pursuant to our fixed price sales agreement with QEPFS and QEP, respectively.  Income from unconsolidated affiliates. Income from unconsolidated affiliates increased $4 million, or 200%, to $6 million for the 2015 Quarter, compared to $2 million for the 2014 Quarter. The 2015 Quarter includes $4 million of income from our 40% interest in Green River Processing, acquired July 1, 2014, and $2 million of income from our 50% interest in Three Rivers Gathering. During the 2014 Quarter, all of the income from unconsolidated affiliates was from our interest in Three Rivers Gathering.  Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow (Non-GAAP)  We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow provides information useful to investors in assessing our results of operations. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow are net income attributable to the Partnership and net cash provided by operating activities. Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow should not be considered an alternative to net income attributable to the Partnership, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income attributable to the Partnership and net cash provided by operating activities, and these measures may vary among other companies. As a result, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

QEP Midstream Partners, LP Unitholders Approve Merger with Tesoro Logistics LP






Jul 21, 2015, 4:15pm EDT














SAN ANTONIO, July 21, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Tesoro Logistics LP (NYSE:TLLP) ("TLLP") and QEP Midstream Partners, LP (NYSE:QEPM) ("QEPM") today announced the approval of the merger of QEPM with TLLP during a unitholder meeting held today in San Antonio. Over 64% of the QEPM common units entitled to vote and held by unitholders other than QEP Midstream Partners GP, LLC ("QEPM GP") and its affiliates were cast in favor of the merger. TLLP, who indirectly holds all of QEPM's subordinated units, approved the merger by written consent. The merger required approval of at least a majority of the outstanding common units of QEPM held by unitholders other than QEPM GP and its affiliates. 

Under the terms of the merger agreement, unitholders of QEPM (other than QEPM GP and its affiliates) are entitled to receive 0.3088 TLLP common units for each QEPM common unit. Cash will be paid to QEPM unitholders in lieu of any fractional units they otherwise would have been entitled to receive in accordance with the merger agreement.

Tesoro Logistics LP to Acquire Remaining Portion of QEP Midstream Partners, LP
Apr 6, 2015




SAN ANTONIO, April 6, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Tesoro Logistics LP (NYSE:TLLP) ("TLLP") and QEP Midstream Partners, LP (NYSE:QEPM) ("QEPM") today jointly announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement whereby TLLP will acquire QEPM in a unit-for-unit exchange. Under the terms of the merger agreement, QEPM public unitholders will receive 0.3088 TLLP common units for each QEPM Common Unit held. This consideration is valued at $17.09 per QEPM common unit based on today's TLLP closing price of $55.34 and represents an 8.5% premium to TLLP's original proposal of 0.2846 announced on December 2, 2014 and an 8.6% premium to today's QEPM closing price of $15.74. The transaction has been approved by the boards of directors at both companies as well as the Conflicts Committee (the "Conflicts Committee") of the Board of Directors of QEP Midstream Partners GP, LLC, the general partner of QEPM ("QEPM GP").
"We are pleased to announce the execution of this agreement for the merger of QEP Midstream Partners into Tesoro Logistics," said Greg Goff, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of TLLP's general partner. "The merger will allow for a more simplified business structure, which is consistent with our integrated logistics strategy." 
TLLP currently owns an approximate 55.8% limited partner interest in QEPM, consisting of 3,701,750 common units and 26,705,000 subordinated units, and 100% of the limited liability company interests of QEPM GP, which itself holds a 2% general partner interest and 100% of the incentive distribution rights in QEPM.
The transaction is expected to close in 2015 and is subject to customary closing conditions, including approval by the QEPM unitholders.
Norton Rose Fulbright US LLP acted as legal counsel to TLLP. Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. acted as financial advisor to the Conflicts Committee, and Andrews Kurth acted as special legal advisor to the Conflicts Committee.

We expect to receive net proceeds of approximately $391.8 million from the sale
of 20,000,000 common units offered by this prospectus, based on an initial
public offering price of $21.00 per common unit, after deducting underwriting
discounts and estimated offering expenses. We intend to use these proceeds as
follows:

. make a cash distribution to QEP of $272.2 million, a portion of which will 
  be used to reimburse QEP for certain capital expenditures it incurred with 
  respect to assets contributed to us;                                       

. contribute $114.0 million to QEP Operating, which will use those funds to  
  repay all $114.0 million of its outstanding debt;                          

. pay revolving credit facility origination fees of $3.5 million; and

. pay Wells Fargo Securities, LLC a structuring fee of $2.1 million.

As of March 31, 2013, QEP Operating, our wholly owned subsidiary, had
approximately $114.0 million of debt outstanding, comprised of intercompany
loans from QEP that bear interest at 6.05% and are due March 31, 2014 and 2017,
respectively. QEP Operating assumed this intercompany debt in connection with
this offering. The outstanding indebtedness was incurred to primarily fund
capital expenditures.

The net proceeds from any exercise by the underwriters of their option to
purchase additional common units will be used to redeem from QEP a number of
common units equal to the number of common units issued upon exercise of the
option at a price per common unit equal to the net proceeds per common unit in
this offering before expenses but after deducting underwriting discounts and the
structuring fee. Accordingly, any exercise of the underwriters’ option will not
affect the total number of units outstanding or the amount of cash needed to pay
the minimum quarterly distribution on all units.

The underwriters may, from time to time, engage in transactions with and perform
services for us and our affiliates in the ordinary course of business.


The oil and natural gas gathering business is very competitive. Our competitors
include other midstream companies, producers and intrastate and interstate
pipelines. Competition for oil and natural gas volumes is primarily based on
reputation, commercial terms, reliability, service levels, flexibility, access
to markets, location, available capacity, capital expenditures and fuel
efficiencies. Our principal competitors are Enterprise Products Partners, L.P.,
Western Gas and The Williams Companies, Inc.

In addition to competing for oil and natural gas volumes, we face competition
for customer markets, which is primarily based on the proximity of pipelines to
the markets, price and assurance of supply.

As a result of our contractual relationship with QEP under our gathering
agreements, we believe that our gathering systems and other midstream assets
will not face significant competition from other pipelines for QEP’s crude oil,
natural gas or products transportation requirements.
---

Under our partnership agreement, QEP and its affiliates are expressly permitted
to compete with us. QEP and any of its affiliates may acquire, construct or
dispose of additional gathering systems or other midstream assets in the future
without any obligation to offer us the opportunity to purchase or construct
those assets.


Company Description
We are a limited partnership recently formed by QEP Resources, Inc. (NYSE: QEP)
to own, operate, acquire and develop midstream energy assets. Our primary assets
consist of ownership interests in four gathering systems and two FERC-regulated
pipelines through which we provide natural gas and crude


 oil gathering and
transportation services. Our assets are located in, or are within close
proximity to, the Green River Basin located in Wyoming and Colorado, the Uinta
Basin located in eastern Utah, and the portion of the Williston Basin located in
North Dakota. As of and for the three months ended March 31, 2013, our gathering
systems had 1,507 miles of pipeline and an average gross throughput of 1.6
million MMBtu/d of natural gas and 17,414 Bbls/d of crude oil. We believe our
customers are some of the largest natural gas producers in the Rocky Mountain
region, including QEP, Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko), EOG Resources,
Inc. (EOG), Questar Corporation (Questar) and Ultra Resources, Inc. (Ultra).

We provide all of our gathering services through fee-based agreements, the
majority of which have annual inflation adjustment mechanisms. For the three
months ended March 31, 2013, approximately 71% of our revenues were generated
pursuant to contracts with remaining terms in excess of seven years, including
56% of our revenues that were generated pursuant to “life-of-reserves”
contracts. In addition to our fee-based gathering services, for the three months
ended March 31, 2013, approximately 6% of our revenue was generated through the
sale of condensate volumes that we collect on our gathering systems. For the 
three months ended March 31, 2013, approximately 50% of our natural gas 
gathering volumes and approximately 33% of our crude oil volumes were comprised
of production owned by QEP, making QEP our largest customer.

We have secured significant acreage dedications from several of our largest
customers, including QEP. We believe that drilling activity on acreage dedicated
to us should maintain or increase our existing throughput levels and offset the
natural production declines of the wells currently connected to our gathering
systems. Pursuant to the terms of those agreements, our customers have dedicated
all of the oil and natural gas production they own or control from (i) wells
that are currently connected to our gathering systems and located within the
acreage dedication and (ii) future wells that are drilled during the term of the
applicable gathering contract and located within the dedicated acreage as our
gathering systems currently exist and as they are expanded to connect to
additional wells.

We believe that one of our principal strengths is our relationship with QEP. QEP
is engaged in crude oil and natural gas exploration and production (E&P)
activities, as well as midstream activities related to its E&P operations. For
the year ended December 31, 2012, QEP reported 3.9 Tcfe of total net proved
reserves and total net production of 319.2 Bcfe, representing a 9% and a 16%
increase, respectively, in proved reserves and production as compared to the
year ended December 31, 2011. We believe this relationship will provide us with
the opportunity to increase throughput volumes from QEP production in areas
where we have gathering systems.

To help facilitate the growth of its E&P operations, QEP invested over $1.1
billion in midstream infrastructure from 2007 through 2012. Following the
completion of this offering and the transactions contemplated thereby, QEP will
continue to own a substantial portfolio of other midstream assets. QEP intends
for us to be the primary growth vehicle for its midstream business. As a result,
we believe QEP will offer us the opportunity to purchase additional midstream
assets from it, although it is under no obligation to offer to sell us
additional assets, and we do not know when, or if, QEP will make any such offer.

Our principal executive offices are located at 1050 17th Street, Suite 500, 
Denver, Colorado 80265, and our telephone number is (303) 672-6900. Our website
