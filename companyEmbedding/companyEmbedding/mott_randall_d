Back to Corporate Officers




Randall D. Mott
Senior Vice President, Global Information Technology & Chief Information Officer






Randy Mott was named senior vice president and chief information officer, Global Information Technology (IT) in February 2012, responsible for the company’s global IT strategy and all IT assets. He is a member of the Executive Leadership Team, reporting to CEO Mary Barra.
Prior to his current position, Mott served since 2005 as executive vice president and chief information officer of Hewlett-Packard, where he was responsible for all IT, including company-wide application development, data management, technology infrastructure, data center operations and telecommunication networks worldwide.
From 2000 to 2005, Mott was senior vice president and chief information officer for Dell, Inc. He was responsible for managing the company's global IT, which included the backbone of its extensive Internet and web-based capabilities. Mott significantly enhanced the company's IT executive talent and focused the organization on global, scalable and common systems.
Prior to Dell, Mott spent 22 years at Wal-Mart Stores Inc., where he held a variety of technical and management positions and pioneered retail and supply-chain systems automation. In 1994, Mott was named senior vice president and chief information officer.  For the next six years, Wal-Mart almost tripled in revenue and its IT group earned a "best-of-class" reputation as it cost-effectively leveraged global and common IT systems. In 1996, Mott was promoted to Wal-Mart's executive committee and in 1997 InformationWeek named him "Chief of the Year."
Mott's vision and leadership approach has garnered him global recognition in leading transformational initiatives focused on optimizing IT as a business. In June 2007, he received the "Roger Milliken Career Achievement Award" from the Voluntary Interindustry Commerce Solutions Association for his dedication and contributions to enabling the retail and consumer-focused industries through the creation and implementation of supply chain standards and best practices.
Mott has a bachelor of science in mathematics from the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville. In 2005, he was named in the Fulbright College Alumni Academy as a Distinguished Alumni.  Mott was elected to the Board of Directors for Dun & Bradstreet in June 2015, and serves on the Audit Committee and Innovation & Technology Committee.

Customer Analytics: Taking the First Step

Modernizing Your Analytics Environment

GM's Randy Mott: What I Believe...CIO's five core principles underpin automaker's three-year "IT transformation" plan.During Randy Mott's 30-plus years in IT, he has developed some core beliefs. Rely on in-house people rather than outsourcers. Get data to the right people to help them make more-informed decisions. Deliver projects faster than before. Streamline and automate IT operations to free up more money for innovative work.
Now Mott is applying that belief system to General Motors under a three-year "IT transformation" plan, during one of the most tumultuous times in the company's 106-year history. He joined GM as CIO in February 2012, when the automaker was emerging from a controversial government bailout and takeover, and now much of the public's attention is turning to GM's handling of a defective ignition switch on earlier-model Chevy Cobalts and other models that is linked to driver deaths.
Against that backdrop, Mott and team are a little over a year into the IT overhaul plan, one of whose goals is to improve data sharing and analysis to help GM identify engineering and manufacturing problems earlier in the process. Underpinning that broad plan are Mott's five core principles -- as he has expressed them in recent presentations under the heading "What I believe..." -- which I lay out below, adding a bit of my own analysis on how they relate to the modern world.
1. Real innovation happens with IT professionals tightly aligned to company strategy. We've all been hearing this refrain for decades. In fact, IT-business "alignment" is almost always the No. 1 challenge cited by respondents to the annual Society for Information Management survey. You'd think such alignment would have happened by now.
Sure, CIOs and other IT leaders must be on the same page with every business unit, whether it's sales, marketing, finance, HR, or manufacturing. But IT-business alignment isn't a one-way street. Mott talked about a refined senior executive structure at GM that -- not necessarily by design -- is starting to align the company's business leaders with Mott's IT goals, one of which is to eliminate the sprawl of applications and data while moving to global software platforms. For instance, there's now a single head of global manufacturing (Timothy E. Lee) as Mott looks to standardize GM units on global manufacturing systems. There's now a single head of global quality and customer experience (Alicia Boler-Davis) as Mott looks to consolidate GM's quality, customer, and other data into a single global data warehouse.
Learn more about how analytics and data management are core to GM's IT transformation. See GM's Data Strategy Pushed To Center Stage.]
So it's not just about IT aligning with the business. "The business has moved toward us," he told InformationWeek in a recent interview at GM's Detroit headquarters.
2. Real business applications on an enterprise scale DO NOT come from venture capitalists. The all caps emphasis is Mott's, not mine. This may be the most contentious point in Mott's belief system. It's trendy these days for companies in a range of industries (Capital One, GE, Ford, Wal-Mart) to set up a digital innovation shop/lab/center in Silicon Valley, and for their CIOs/chief digital officers to meet with venture capitalists and startups to tap into the latest thinking. But when Mott was identifying locations last year for four technical innovation centers GM wanted to set up across the country, he stayed away from the Valley and other VC hotbeds. Instead, he opted for suburban Detroit, Atlanta, Phoenix, and Austin, mainly for their proximity to current GM operations and/or affordable tech talent, including a dozen or so universities.





Mott isn't arguing that VC-backed startups produce no meaningful enterprise IT innovations. But he's skeptical that their systems and applications can scale, affordably, to meet Fortune 100 needs.
As Mott's team started last year to pull billions of dollars of IT operations and development in-house from four or five outsourcers, the automaker signed long-term (five-year) enterprise license agreements with 11 blue chip vendors: Adobe, CA, Cisco, EMC, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, McAfee, Microsoft, Oracle, SAP, and VMware. Mott values not only the proven scalability of those vendors' products, but also their global footprint and product line breadth.
He also values systems and applications that can be customized and integrated with others, one reason he's not a big fan of cloud services. Embracing cloud software and infrastructure is "a strategy of how do I get even, not how do I get ahead," Mott says. "And I think the companies that win in their industries are the ones that figure out how to get ahead, because getting competitive advantage takes innovation, it takes creativity, and you're not going to get that from someone who's going to make everyone on the planet even."
3. Modern, innovative companies have a good mix of experienced IT professionals and college hires who are forward-thinking and less resistant to change. As GM moves from doing 10% of its IT work in-house as of January 2013 to doing 90% of it in-house by the end of 2015, it's hiring thousands of people while taking billions of dollars of work back from outsourcers.
As part of that effort, GM's IT organization will have brought on 4,500 new people by the end of this year, 600 of them recent college grads. Long term, by about 2018, GM will have about 12,000 IT employees, Mott estimates.
Mott and team are hiring for a mix of skills, including SAP, Siebel, and even PeopleSoft development and integration; Java and .Net development, especially for sales, marketing, and dealer apps; and Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server databases. The overall focus: Do much less "run the business" IT work, whether by staffers or the outsourcers that remain, and more new

Transformation 
I think Randy made couple of mistakes in insourcing in GM, and it might collapse. I got a strange feeling he is building a typical IT company across GM, forgeting he's a CIO of the automotive coorporation, with business spread across the globe. People insourced on new positions are not having any experience in automotive industry at all, nor the experience with other regions outside of the US. This is leading to much stronger separation between GM business and GM IT and at the end it might destroy all relations that have been already built between IT and business. This is a point where Randy and his ex-HP and ex-DELL guys forgot that business owns the company, not IT. Business rates IT as well. Somebody mentioned about Shadow IT. According to me, Shadow IT was an answer on a weak performance of an IT organization in general. If business couldn't get from IT what they want, they are going to suppliers leaving GM IT and all is done, working without issues, without tons of documents, processes, analysis. I think Randy's organization will be hit again with Shadow IT, when the business will get angry about delayed projects, non-working apps, forced centralized apps with a limited business engagement lead by typical IT PMs with no idea about markets and business needs. That will be the first step the system is failing. Additionally when those projects or apps will have errors and for another year IT will be fixing it up, the level of business aggression which is quite high today will reach the top and the transformation will be over.
I think the general idea of Randy's strategy is worth trying, but not in the automotive industry, but he's doing too many things in one time in huge organization where the intertia between top and bottom might be even 1 year. I can belive he was an expert 30 years ago knowing the Walmart business across US, but I doubt if he's experienced automotive person across all the globe with multi-continental automotive regulations. Cars are not the same as a pop-corn, and I think he's treating this business this way. HP is still returning to the model before transformation. Have no idea about DELL, but I keep the fingers crossed. I'm giving personally 1 year - big success or failed transformation with huge mess... 3rd time in a row?

Re: Will the trend toward inhouse IT stick at GM? 
You should interview the business unit leaders at GM... and ask them what they think about the insourcing...
 
GM IT has become bad to worse to impossible is what they will say..
 
GM's neighbours Ford, Chrysler etc. - all of them had insourced for many years... What happened there??

Great article 
Randy was my first project leader at Wal-Mart in the early days (I was there 1981 to 87).  We did a lot of innovative stuff, all in-house.  The environment was friendly, fun, and we got things done.  (By the way, here's a news flash to anyone who says COBOL is dead: Wal-Mart was programmed 99% in COBOL).  Randy knows the IT business, and I dare say he is as innovative and daring in his thinking for enterprise computing as Steve Jobs was for micro computing.  GM is lucky to have him.

A good model for others to follow 
This sounds like the strategy John Reed, a strong proponent of IT, implemented that helped make Citicorp the global leader under his watch. This is also a great model for other companies, who are having problems reigning in IT, to follow
For most companies, IT-business "alignment" is doublespeak which means "sure, we'll create a new division whose job is to 'work closely' with you, while we continue working on what's really important". The business divisions don't need a feel good team that delivers hot air while shadow IT divisions continue to proliferate, but better access to the resources already there. IT internal alignment is a step in the right direction.
Many companies which create innovation centers in these trendy locations fail to realize that many of the best ideas, which will help the company long term, will come from the workers who already understand the environment, what the problems are and what's needed. What they usually lack is access to the right people to present these ideas. Building innovation centers close to staff is a step in the right direction and a great morale booster. Integrating new with existing talent rather than replacing one with the other helps this process along. The new thinkers can help existing staff formulate and better articulate their ideas.
The ability to deliver faster is what the automakers need. If Mott can deliver them GM has a good chance of making it to top.

Speed 
If speed of development is so important, why is he talking about annual updates on the plan rather than quarterly?

Re: Mott misconstrues cloud services 
His cloud skepticism definitely bucks the trend, Charlie. I can't think of any CIO I've spoken with that is as skeptical about the value to be had from cloud software. I'm looking forward to the on stage discussion with InformationWeek Conference attendees this week, to hear what kind of questions CIO peers ask.

Integrate 
I can't agree enough with his comment, "Real innovation happens with IT professionals tightly aligned to company strategy."  Too many times you have IT running for IT's sake and ignorant of the true business needs of the organization.  If IT wants to have any relevance, they have to move beyond basic plumbing support and maintenance.

GM's CIO 
If you are CIO of a GM, you can afford to speak whatever you want. However, this looks like classic CIO speak who is disconnected with the ground realities and how the technology world is changing. Though some of the bets he is taking will be good, overall GM is going to lose. GM needs to smell coffee and leverage digital transformation across its business processes to leap ahead of its competition. He makes valid point that enterprise software are not best served by the VC-funded companies. However, GM should look to acquire such small companies and create in-house solutions that help in excel.

Mott misconstrues cloud services 
When Mott says using cloud infrastructure and software as a service is a way to get even, not get ahead, he misconceives of what's going on out there. I agree it is a good idea to keep core IT skills in house, but they can be put to work effectively on cloud infrastructure and customizing SaaS, if that's what the CIO wants. He's thinking too much in-house resources are better than external ones. You don't have to be an advocate of outsourcing to make good use of the cloud. On the contrary, the cloud gives the internal managers control over the resource and allows them to use it as an extension of the data center. To misconceive this could be damaging to your long term prospects.

Re: Will the trend toward inhouse IT stick at GM? 
I think it will stick as long as Mott is there, when he leaves, not if when, then all bets are off.  

I was very glad to see someone in a position of authority say what I have been saying for years.  Pundits and CIOs always talk about IT aligning with the business goals but never put any onus on the business to align with the IT goals and philosophies.  That is why you have so much money wasted on what you called shadow IT, things that get one thing done for one part of the business but don�t achieve any larger or longer term goals.

GM CIO Mott: Own IT To Own Innovation
Insourcing Key To GM’s Turnaround
GM CEO Akerson Is An IT Believer



        By   
Paul McDougall 
 | November 27, 2013 | 


Bankrupt and in need of a bailout, GM appeared headed for the wrecking yard in 2009. Fast forward, and CEO Dan Akerson’s transformation program has the iconic automaker back in the black. In a CruxialCIO exclusive, CIO Randy Mott explains how he reengineered GM’s IT unit to support the turnaround.

Mobility in the Manufacturing Workplace: 8 Must-have Mobile Application Qualities to Increase Operational Efficiency 

 



General Motors emerged from a prepackaged, government backed Chapter 11 bankruptcy in mid-2009 as “the new GM,” or, more precisely, NGMCO, Inc. Prior to that, the automaker suffered through years of losses that brought it to the point of extinction.To prevent a repeat, CEO Dan Ackerson, who took the helm in August 2010, knows that the new GM can’t look much like its pre-bankruptcy self. It needs to be nimble, streamlined, and globally integrated, while producing reliable, fuel efficient cars that can meet and beat foreign competitors--especially in fast-growing emerging markets.The strategy looks good on paper, but meaningless unless Akerson and his team can execute. Enter Senior VP and CIO Randy Mott, who joined the automaker in February 2012 after leading IT departments at global giants such as Hewlett-Packard, Dell, and Wal-Mart.Mott’s mission: Drive an IT transformation that aligns with and supports GM’s business revamp. “To drive the overall business transformation, we needed to build an IT organization that could support and enable rapid innovation,” said Mott, in an exclusive interview with CruxialCIO.Mott’s first priority on coming aboard was to turn GM’s IT department from one that depended mostly on outsourcing contractors for key projects to one that got things done in-house. Mott’s predecessor, Ralph Szygenda, was a big believer in outsourcing, and relied heavily on vendors like Electronic Data Systems (now part of Hewlett-Packard), AT&T, Cap Gemini, Accenture, and Wipro Technologies.Szygenda insisted that his “dream team” operate globally, and use standards-based approaches to IT service delivery. Their playbooks had to include ITIL, CMM, Six Sigma and other standards to ensure that, for instance, both EDS’ and Accenture’s approach to provisioning were compatible.But Mott says that doesn’t go far enough for a company that needs to rapidly innovate. “Part of the premise for innovation and application change is that you implement projects. And implementing projects into an outsourced environment is by definition hard, costly, and slow.”So shortly after his arrival, Mott cut ties with the bulk of GM’s contractors, and began the process of bringing projects back to Michigan. In the process, the company’s IT staff expanded from 1,400 to more than 7,000 workers. GM is also investing $546 million in a new technology infrastructure.GM’s transformation also includes an effort to collect and make better use of the vast amount of data that it collects from its operations. It’s building an Enterprise Data Warehouse to centralize and standardize information gathered from company operations across the globe. It’s harvesting data from the manufacturing floor to support a quality initiative led by senior VP Alicia Boler-Davis, and it’s culling bits and bytes that come in through customer-facing services like OnStar. “Every piece of transactional data gives us an opportunity to improve,” says Mott.Post-bailout GM needs to be lean, mean, and efficient. That applies to its IT unit. Among the efficiency projects that Mott is pursuing is data center consolidation. The company is trimming its IT real estate footprint from 23 datacenters to just two. There’s the recently opened, 5,040 square-foot facility in Warren, Mich., and a new datacenter that will come online next year at its vehicle proving ground in Milford, Mich.Mott also wants to drive efficiency into his IT department by automating routine processes, such as provisioning and network monitoring. That will save the company money, and also frees up staff to work on projects that drive business value for General Motors. Prior to his arrival, Mott says about 75% of GM’s IT personnel, whether company employees or outsourced contractors, were engaged in routine, keep-the-servers-up type of work, while only 25% were engaged in truly innovative projects. Mott wants to flip that, to the point where 80% are driving innovation. “We need to change the mix,” says Mott.

Mott’s vision for a more efficient, streamlined, and innovative IT organization for GM sounded good in theory, but he had to execute. That required careful planning, lots of backup plans, and flawless execution. “We’ve got a $150 billion business we don’t want to interrupt,” says Mott.Insourcing. GM’s insourcing initiative involved eliminating roughly 30 vendor contracts and moving the work in-house—everything from mainframe operations and application development, to network management. Mott says the transition was eased by the fact that he automated some of the work rather than hand it off to new, in-house teams. “When you do that you take a lot of the work out of the process; it’s move and automate.”Recruitment. GM’s insourcing initiative resulted in the company’s internal IT workforce expanding from 1,400 tech pros to more than 7,000. In an era when even tech giants like Microsoft complain that it’s hard to find individuals with the skills they need, GM required a strategy for recruiting and retention. One tactic the company used was to go to where the talent is. The automaker’s four innovation centers--one is co-located at the Warren data center, the others are in Roswell, Georgia, Austin, Texas, and Chandler Arizona--put it within a 500 mile radius of 75% of the available talent in the U.S. according to Mott. “We tried to go where they are,” says Mott. “The new GM has also earned a reputation for our product design and engineering and winning in the marketplace; that’s also appealing to candidates.”GM also hired a number of employees that previously worked for its contractors, including 3,000 from HP.Consolidation. GM is moving from 23 data centers to just two, in Warren and Milford, Michigan. Such moves can be fraught with risk. Data can be lost, key applications can become unavailable, and network systems can be disrupted. “The key is that if we have any kind of problem we just don’t go,” says Mott. “We protect the business that way.” Among other things, GM moved applications that had been running on an outsourced mainframe at a Hewlett-Packard facility in Plano, Texas to a new mainframe at Warren. “We did it over two weekends; we did dry runs and dress rehearsals as this touched factories all over the world.”Big Data and analytics. GM’s IT transformation includes building a platform that allows the company to glean business insights—at a granular level—from incoming data from factory floors and customer-facing apps and services. Mott says choosing the right technology is key. At the heart of GM’s Big Data platform is Hadoop, a flexible, open-source architecture that ropes together hundreds of industry-standard servers to form a Big Data hive. GM previously ran 200 data marts. By year’s end, it will have moved 40 of those into the new architecture. “We can now invest very high volumes of data into the new data platform,” says Mott.GM’s growing Enterprise Data Warehouse also relies on IBM Infosphere BigInsights for building Hadoop applications, and reporting and analytics tools from Teradata.Private clouds. GM’s new IT infrastructure makes use of cloud principles like virtualization, shared services, load balancing and standardization. It all makes for a more efficient, cost effective environment. Mott, however, is not about to put any of GM’s applications in public or vendor-run clouds. “A lot of people who are promoting these off premises clouds are really promoting outsourcing by a different name and I think it will have all the same problems in terms of how do you stay current, how do you add to it, and how do you remain responsive to the business,” says Mott. “I’m not looking to go back.”

GM CIO Randy Mott is not overhauling the company’s global tech footprint just for the sake of change. The IT transformation parallels an overall business transformation that CEO Dan Akerson has been driving since he was named to the top job in 2010.Akerson wants to make GM a nimble, efficient, innovative company with a consistent, worldwide footprint. By 2015, he wants 65% of GM’s auto manufacturing on global platforms. And, of course, he wants the automaker to be consistently profitable. There’s little chance, as in zero, that the company would get another bailout from the federal government.Mott’s role is to create an IT environment that supports and enables Akerson’s goals. “We needed a different mix in terms of how much innovation we do and how do we grow our business. You take that with all the other GM initiatives going on from a business standpoint and that was the mission, starting two years ago, and we’re still executing on it today.”Akerson himself is a big believer in GM owning its own tech infrastructure. “You have to own it and you have to control it and when you don’t, you’re at the whim of other companies and their priorities, and if they have financial problems, their difficulties,” the CEO said earlier this year at a press conference to open the Warren tech center.One example of how GM’s IT unit is supporting company goals is a new service that helps the automaker and its customers connect more easily. Salespeople, and even consumers, can walk the lot at GM dealers and use a mobile app, for the Apple iPad or smartphones, that provides deep-dive information on the vehicle the user is looking at. “It offers a richer experience for the customer and helps them with what may be a large purchasing decision in their lives,” says Mott.There’s evidence that GM’s transformation, including the IT part, is starting to pay off. The company’s stock price has increased from a $19.36 on July 20 of last year, to $37.36 on Nov. 22 of last week, a gain of 93%.And the company is profitable. It posted net income of $0.7 billion in the third quarter on $39 billion in net revenues, up from $37.6 billion in the prior year quarter.But GM, and Mott, aren’t satisfied. Next year, the CIO plans to push even harder on the innovation front. The business value created from new projects undertaken will be three times that of what his group delivered this year. “That’s the headline for 2014,” says Mott. “We want shorter projects, and we want to deliver more projects with higher business value more quickly.”GM CEO Akerson Touts Company’s TurnaroundTheoretical Foundations Of Big Data AnalysisWhy Enterprise Data WarehouseVirtual Hierarchies To Support Server Consolidation
