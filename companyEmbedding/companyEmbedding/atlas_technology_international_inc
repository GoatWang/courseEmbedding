Atlas Technology International Sees Significant Gains for Third Quarter
Company to Enter New Era of Growth and Expansion



















March 20, 2017 11:40 ET

 | Source: Atlas Technology International, Inc.





LOS ANGELES, March  20, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Atlas Technology International, Inc. (OTCQB:ATLT), a rapidly growing designer, manufacturer and distributor of touchscreen devices, today announced that it expects significant sequential and year-over-year gains for its third fiscal quarter ended, March 31, 2017.“Our third quarter continues to be on the record pace set in the first half of our current fiscal year,” said Matthew Tsai, Chief Executive Officer of Atlas Technology International, Inc.  “Demand for our existing and new touch screen product lines continue to increase faster than anticipated, which should enable us to book more revenues in just one quarter than the entire first half of fiscal 2017.”Revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 are expected to be in the range of $1.0 to $1.2 million, an increase of between 30%-56% on a sequential basis compared to revenues of $769,821 in the Company’s second fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2016.Gross margins are expected to improve slightly towards approximately 29% as the Company expects to see continued gains in earnings due primarily to an expanded client base, new international revenue channels as well as overall economies of scale.Net income is expected to increase sharply, rising over 10-fold on a sequential basis to a range of between $90,000-$100,000.  In the second quarter, the Company posted a profit of $4,346 compared with a loss of $112,957 in the first quarter.“Our senior management team brings extensive executive and technical experience from the touchscreen technology industry, enabling a quick ramp-up of operations, a blue-chip client base and profitability,” noted Mr. Tsai. “With touchscreen technology increasingly becoming somewhat of a commodity, our affordable pricing, intellectual property and innovative product construction continues to set us apart from our competitors.  Our team is focusing on better, smarter materials, easier integrations into any device and achieving new technological breakthroughs.  Our efforts benefit our clients directly by providing more dependable and flexible solutions in the design phase.“We believe the recent move of our corporate headquarters to Los Angeles and increase in personnel, particularly in sales and marketing, will help accelerate our growth going forward, particularly as we look to further expand our presence across the United States, one of the largest and growing markets for touchscreen technology in the world. With a strong balance sheet, growing earnings and leading edge technology, we strongly believe we are about to enter into an entire new era of growth and expansion, all of which has been supported largely by our dedicated employees, loyal client base and supportive shareholder base,” concluded Mr. Tsai.To be added to the Atlas Technology’s investor lists, please contact Brandon Thompson at Investor Relations Partners at (888) 992-8527 or via email at bthompson@irpartnersinc.com.About Atlas Technology International, Inc.Atlas Technology International, Inc.

Atlas Technology International Inc (OTCMKTS:ATLT) Could Build Momentum After Announcement of Potential Significant Gains for Third Quarter

By Michael Luke -  May 10, 2017 459

Tweet on Twitter











Atlas Technology International Inc (OTCMKTS:ATLT) shares were up over 200% in a one-month period and over 300% over a one-year period, recently. Now, the stock’s strong performance could be attributed to the company’s expectation of its significant gains in third quarter of the 2017 fiscal year. Before we get into the reason for why ATLT could continue to build momentum, let’s take a look at what the company does.
 
Atlas Technology International is a leading designer and distributor of touch screen technologies and solutions to consumer electronic producers across the globe. That in mind, with the recent shift in technology, consumer electronic producers could potentially increase the demand for touch screens. According to the company, Atlas Technology’s touchscreen devices are incredibly durable and exceptionally responsive for a wide array of industries such as GPS, watches, point-of-sale (POS), hospitality, medical/healthcare IT, industrial, and consumer. Atlas´ products are proven in the toughest environments and are highly trusted.
 
Atlas Technology International Inc (OTCMKTS:ATLT) recently announced that it expects to report significant sequential and year-over-year gains for the third quarter of the 2017 fiscal year. That said, investors and traders are focused on these forecast because it could give clues about how the company may perform.
 
The company expects to report revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 to be in the range between $1.0M to $1.2M, which would be a potential increase of a range between 30% and 56% on a sequential basis compared to revenues of approximately $770K in its second fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2016.
Additionally, Atlas Technologies expects it Q3 2017 gross margins to improve slightly towards approximately 29% due to the company’s expectation of continued gains in earnings, attributed primarily to an expanded client base, new international revenue channels, as well as overall economies of scale.
Moreover, Atlas Technologies’ net income is expected to increase sharply, increasing over 10-fold on a sequential basis to a range of between $90K and $100K.  In the second quarter of the fiscal 2017 year, the Company posted a profit of $4.3K, compared with a net loss of $112K in the first quarter of the 2017 fiscal year..
 

 
According to Matthew Tsai, Chief Executive Officer of Atlas Technology International, Inc., “Our third quarter continues to be on the record pace set in the first half of our current fiscal year.”
 
Tsai added, “Demand for our existing and new touch screen product lines continue to increase faster than anticipated, which should enable us to book more revenues in just one quarter than the entire first half of fiscal 2017.”
 
Atlas CEO continued, “Our senior management team brings extensive executive and technical experience from the touchscreen technology industry, enabling a quick ramp-up of operations, a blue-chip client base and profitability.”
Tsai concluded “With touchscreen technology increasingly becoming somewhat of a commodity, our affordable pricing, intellectual property and innovative product construction continues to set us apart from our competitors.  Our team is focusing on better, smarter materials, easier integrations into any device and achieving new technological breakthroughs.  Our efforts benefit our clients directly by providing more dependable and flexible solutions in the design phase.
Now, the company only issued guidance for the company not too long ago, and it has not reported its third quarter 2017 financial results yet. That in mind, you might want to stay up to date on ATLT, as it could experience a high degree of volatility prior to its Q3 2017 financial results. You don’t need to read company filings to stay up to date on ATLT. All you have to do is enter your email address into the box below, and you’ll be on your way to receive our free newsletter, which would provide updates, if any, on ATLT.

Men's ClothingGuys, it’s time to update your wardrobe. Luckily for you, we’ve got all the staples and on-trend pieces your closet needs. Explore men’s clothing (including big & tall sizes), plus shoes and accessories to create outfits tailored for every occasion. And if you’re interested in a few helpful styling tips, then check out our Men’s Guide to Style. Don’t worry, you can thank us later.
First, let’s keep it casual. The keys to a great laid-back wardrobe are to pick pieces that fit well, are comfortable and are versatile. T-shirts and tees are a great place to start. Plain tees are simple and can be worn with anything. Bonus? They can double as undershirts in a pinch. Graphic tees are an easy way to show off your personality. Go with versions that showcase your interests, rep your favorite sports team or just look cool. Finish your chill shirt collection with a few polos—they’re a more polished option and can easily be dressed down or up.
Now that you’ve got your list of classic casual shirts, it’s time to focus on refreshing your collection of shorts and pants. From cargos and chinos to denim, we’ve got you covered. When it comes to jeans, especially, grab a few pairs in various washes—think light, medium and dark. Feeling adventurous? Colored denim provides a fresh update to your look. From skinny and slim fit to bootcut and relaxed, fit matters and you should always pick pairs that suit your frame and that you feel good in.
Let’s move on to pieces you’ll need to dress to impress. Look pulled together with suits, dress shirts, undershirts and men’s dress shoes. Take the opportunity to mix and match with sport coats and blazers. Pair them with dress pants or jeans for a modern feel (but only if if the dress code is more lenient). Whether you’re headed to the office, a wedding or special event, your stylish clothes will speak for themselves. Don’t forget accessories. Grab a wallet, cuff links, ties, belts and more to round out your look.
Whether you’re dressed up or down, you’ll need to layer up when it’s cold outside. Our collection of jacket, coats and vest will keep you warm. Throw on cozy sweaters and sweatshirts into your look, and for even more warmth, stock up on hats, scarves and gloves. Stick with Timberland boots and thicker fabrics that help trap heat—think wool, leather, cotton and more.
Oh, and we can’t forget workout clothes. Whether you live at the gym or are just getting back into an exercise routine, you’re going to need a solid collection of activewear. And on rest days (and every evening), pajamas and loungewear will come in handy. We’re here to help you look great every hour of the day. Find helpful styling tops and tricks with Macy’s Men’s Guide to Style.
Who’s ready for a wardrobe refresh? Shop men’s clothing, shoes, accessories and more at Macy’s.Looking for huge savings? Shop our Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Holiday Gift Guide!
