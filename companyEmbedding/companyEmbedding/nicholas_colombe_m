Herbalife to Nominate Three Additional Icahn Designees to Board

 LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

      Herbalife (NYSE: HLF) today announced that it has amended and restated

      its agreement with Carl C. Icahn, Icahn Enterprises Holdings L.P. and

      certain related entities (collectively the "Icahn Parties"), which

      beneficially own, in the aggregate, 17,000,000 shares of Herbalife

      common stock, representing approximately 16.8% of the company's

      outstanding shares. As part of the agreement, Herbalife will nominate

      three designees of the Icahn Parties, Hunter C. Gary, Jesse A. Lynn and

      James L. Nelson, for election to Herbalife's board of directors at its

      2014 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, currently scheduled for

      April 29, 2014 ("the Annual Meeting"). Messrs. Gary and Lynn are

      employees of Icahn Enterprises L.P., and will be nominated for election

      to the Class I directorships currently held by Carole Black and Michael

      Levitt, whose three-year terms end at the Annual Meeting. Colombe M.

      Nicholas intends to resign from Herbalife's board, and Mr. Nelson, who

      is an independent director of Icahn Enterprises L.P., will be nominated

      for election to serve the remainder of the term of Ms. Nicholas' Class

      II directorship. These three nominations are in addition to the two

      representatives of the Icahn Parties currently on the board. The size of

      the board will remain at thirteen directors.

    


      Under the terms of the amended and restated agreement, the Icahn Parties

      have agreed, among other things, to continue to abide by certain

      standstill provisions and vote their shares in support of all of the

      board's director nominees at the upcoming Annual Meeting. The Icahn

      Parties continue to have the right to increase the size of their

      ownership position in Herbalife up to 25% of the outstanding common

      stock. A copy of the agreement with further detail will be attached to a

      Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed by Herbalife with the Securities

      and Exchange Commission.

    


      "This is a very positive agreement and we appreciate the Icahn Parties'

      shared confidence in Herbalife's continued success," said Michael O.

      Johnson, chairman and chief executive officer of Herbalife. "The current

      Icahn representatives have brought considerable insight and experience

      to our board and we look forward to working with the additional

      representatives in a similarly collaborative way. I would like to thank

      Carole Black, Michael Levitt and Colombe Nicholas for their many

      contributions to the board."

    


      "We remain resolute in our commitment to the long term success of

      Herbalife," said Mr. Icahn. "We continue to have confidence in its board

      and management team, and believe in the company's great potential. We

      thank the board for their trust in us and hope and believe our directors

      will enhance value and contribute to the long term success of the

      company, as we have done at so many companies over the past decade."
