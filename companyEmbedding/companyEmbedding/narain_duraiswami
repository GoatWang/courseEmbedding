Inclusion & Diversity
True innovation requires people who are brave enough to ask big questions and offer truly unique perspectives. Diversity of opinion and knowledge are key to the scientific method, and are therefore key to the way we hire. The more welcoming Monsanto beomes, the more opportunities we have to better serve farmers as they steward the land.
