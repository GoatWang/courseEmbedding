A smart product management hub for retailthat streamlines digital content and data sharing






 





















Our mission
 
We have made it our mission to provide brands and retailers simple and affordable tools that tackle many challenges in digital product management and distribution by:













Solving the practical challenge of organizing, sourcing, and sharing product content.









Giving brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed ecommerce data and analytics
















Take control of your products with Plytix
 









Our Story
 
The idea for Plytix evolved from our time at Google, when we were working with some of the biggest companies in the e-commerce space. At the time, technology allowed tracking user behaviour on individual websites, but we wanted to give brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed data, bringing them a better understanding of their products through 3rd party product analytics. 
 
Since then Plytix has evolved into an end-to-end product management eco-system where brands and retailers can organize, analyze, and share product content and performance in a user-friendly and efficient way without breaking the bank. 
 




























Our Team
 
We're a diverse, international team passionate about creating extraordinary client experiences and serious about revolutionizing e-commerce. We are growing rapidly and we're always on the look out for smart, driven people to join our team.

Advisory Network
Sectoral's investment approach dictates that we examine every potential investment opportunity in the healthcare sector on its inherent scientific and technological merit. To assist our investment professionals in their due diligence, we have established a proprietary Advisory Network. 
Sectoral's Advisory Network is composed of practicing scientists, physicians and regulatory experts with no ties to industry. Members of this network are experts in a wide variety of fields and are active in clinical trial design, epidemiology, molecular immunology, cell biology, bioinformatics, neurobiology, gene expression regulation, molecular oncology and DNA micro-arrays. Additionally, they are affiliated with many of the world's most esteemed hospitals and universities. 
Because of their insight into the most recent developments in their respective fields, members of Sectoral's Advisory Network also help us generate new investment ideas.

		Knight Therapeutics Inc. Invests in Sectoral Asset Management Inc. for Preferred Access to Canadian Product Rights


MONTREAL, Canada, June 26, 2014 – Knight Therapeutics Inc. (TSX:GUD) (“Knight”), a leading Canadian specialty pharmaceutical company, announced today that it has entered into a letter of agreement with Sectoral Asset Management Inc. (“Sectoral”) to invest USD$13 million into its New Emerging Medical Opportunities Funds II, Ltd. (“NEMO II”).
In exchange for Knight’s investment in NEMO II, which is expected to close June 30, 2014, Sectoral will encourage Sectoral-invested companies (“Investee Companies”) to select Knight as their Canadian partner of choice. Additionally, Sectoral will facilitate introductions for loan agreements between Investee Companies and Knight.

Since 2000, Sectoral has invested in over 500 companies and currently holds positions in over 100 companies. "Sectoral is an ideal partner from which we can leverage their proven pharma deal hunting skills and vast relationships to secure Canadian product rights," said Jonathan Ross Goodman, President and CEO of Knight. “We expect this investment to pay dividends both (i) from the fund return and (ii) from new products commercialized in Canada by Knight.”

A smart product management hub for retailthat streamlines digital content and data sharing






 





















Our mission
 
We have made it our mission to provide brands and retailers simple and affordable tools that tackle many challenges in digital product management and distribution by:













Solving the practical challenge of organizing, sourcing, and sharing product content.









Giving brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed ecommerce data and analytics
















Take control of your products with Plytix
 









Our Story
 
The idea for Plytix evolved from our time at Google, when we were working with some of the biggest companies in the e-commerce space. At the time, technology allowed tracking user behaviour on individual websites, but we wanted to give brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed data, bringing them a better understanding of their products through 3rd party product analytics. 
 
Since then Plytix has evolved into an end-to-end product management eco-system where brands and retailers can organize, analyze, and share product content and performance in a user-friendly and efficient way without breaking the bank. 
 




























Our Team
 
We're a diverse, international team passionate about creating extraordinary client experiences and serious about revolutionizing e-commerce. We are growing rapidly and we're always on the look out for smart, driven people to join our team. 
 
Get a closer look on  LinkedIn and Instagram.
