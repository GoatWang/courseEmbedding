Battery Cells
A Brain Behind Every Battery
Battery cells are the smallest components of the BESS and contain the actual battery chemicals. Each BESS can have thousands of cells, which comprise the building blocks for the entire system. 











Battery Modules
Strength in Numbers
Modules protect a group of cells from being strained too heavily. Each module comes with a controller that balances charges across its particular selection of cells. 











Battery Packs
The Core Of Our BESS
Modules are connected together into packs to scale to a wide range of power capacities. These packed units have a dedicated controller, ensuring that the modules behind each pack work together just as efficiently as the cells inside.











Battery Strings
Scaling Energy
Once all of the cells are aggregated into modules and packs they form a complete string. Multiple battery packs make critical decisions in unison as each reports states of charge, voltage, temperature, and other critical data to the BMS. 











BESS
Battery Energy Storage System
We then take multiple strings of batteries and compile them under a unified battery management system: the Powin BESS.
The BESS software gauges the information each system element passes up the chain, making the most of every computational cycle and working together with broader energy managers with ease.











Balancing
Lasting Durability
Take comfort in knowing your system is engineered to give the most reliable performance possible, with no downtime for manual battery balancing. With specialized charging controls, the Powin BESS balances the charge of each battery in real-time, ensuring equal voltage levels across the system. 











Optimized
Protecting Your Investment
As the BESS tracks temperature, voltage, and current flowing through the cells, Powin’s custom algorithms monitor when conditions encroach warranty parameters. The system can isolate problem zones, send email notifications, and file warranty claims before damage occurs.

01
									Resource Adequacy
								
Fulfill minimum energy requirements across the entire grid more efficiently and cleanly than diesel generators. Using multiple battery energy storage systems in targeted hotspots or alongside generation facilities, the BESS caters to needs across the entirety of the grid. 



02
									Grid Regulation
								
The BESS reacts in real-time in tandem with inverters and energy management systems to provide robust frequency and voltage regulation. Ensure grid health with the quick response of a Powin BESS. 



03
									Targeted Demand Response
								
Address hotspots in specific regions of the grid by deploying a Powin BESS in areas with seasonal high rates of demand. React quickly to unforeseen weather events and prevent rolling blackouts before they start. 



04
									Off-Grid Applications
								
The Powin BESS brings reliability to customers in even the most remote areas. Provide always-on functionality and resource adequacy for communities with no classical grid to connect to, using renewables or existing generation in concert with battery storage. 



05
									T&D Deferral
								
Defer costly infrastructure overhauls to transmission and distribution equipment by implementing scalable energy storage. As peak demand climbs, BESS extends the value of existing equipment by offsetting demand with on-demand energy. 



06
									Renewables Integration
								
Easily incorporate existing or newly installed infrastructure directly with a Powin BESS. As production ebbs and flows across peak generation periods, the Powin BESS automatically smoothes out the intermittent surges in energy. Each system is built to work seamlessly with renewable generation methods, adding value to your facility's investment.

System Demand
Solar Generation





Renewable energy generation can be an inconsistent business. From managing ramp rate control to mismatches in peak production and demand, wind and solar facilities can leverage the flexibility and control the Powin BESS provides.








solutions
renewables

01
									Solar
								
Solar arrays without the support of energy storage leaves your facility vulnerable to inconsistent production. Peak production rarely coincides with peak demand, but with a Powin BESS peak production can be stored and discharged during higher demand hours. On top of managing peak production, inconsistent generation is smoothed out by the BESS to provide additional stability throughout the day. 



02
									Wind
								
Don’t leave your facility exposed to overgeneration issues as wind turbines come online. Using a Powin BESS, ramp rate is smooth and controlled, ensuring that contractual requirements are met each day. Moreover, the BESS ensures that no power is lost to curtailment or left unserved to the grid during generation lows. 



03
									For Microgrids
								
The Powin BESS gives microgrids unprecedented control over their consumption. Not only does the system provide consistency and energy resiliency, it also grants the provider the peace of mind that there will be power during emergencies and critical genset ramping events. 



04
									For Power Producers
								
Maximizing the amount of energy passing between a facility and the grid should never be dependent on the weather. Leverage your energy 100% of the time with a Powin BESS supporting your facility.

We just ordered our first container from the new supplier and with the savings it more than paid for the ImportGenius.com service on the first container load."

View full sizeERIC APALATEGUI/Special to The OregonianHarry Hu, who directs Powin Corp.'s Channel Partner Program, will soon help products such as Peter Lamas personal care products and Earth's Best organic baby formulas go to market in China. TUALATIN -- Powin Corp. spent more than 20 years building a pipeline pumping Chinese-made products -- from fitness equipment to furniture to gun safes -- into the American market. 
Now the Tualatin company, in a unique partnership with some of China's largest banks, is working to reverse the flow of goods by helping American companies introduce upscale brands to a surging class of affluent customers in a country of 1.3 billion people. 
As early as this month, Chinese customers will start buying Anne Klein watches, Peter Lamas organic hair and skin care products, John Lennon limited-edition art prints and Earth's Best organic baby formulas, among other Powin clients, directly from retail websites operated by Chinese banks. 
"Chinese consumers are ready for this better-quality merchandise," said Harry Hu, Powin's Shanghai-born chief information officer and director of its Channel Partner Program, which offers a lower-cost alternative for U.S. companies who want to see if their wares can compete in China. "If your product is good enough, you might build up your buzz among this population." 
"It's a gold rush," Daniel Sanders, president of Peter Lamas, a Los Angeles-based producer of high-end products, said of one of the world's fastest growing consumer markets. "China represents a huge opportunity for us. (Powin's program) makes it a lot easier to enter the marketplace." 
Powin's program soon could be a boon for local businesses as well, said Linda Moholt, CEO of the Tualatin Chamber of Commerce. "We need to find places to sell outside of Oregon," she said, noting that China is one of the world's largest markets. 
Powin founder Joseph Lu built the company, which recently relocated to new Tualatin headquarters, through manufacturing in China and elsewhere for U.S. clients. Its business interests range from big-rig truck parts to renewable energy. 
After joining Powin last year, Hu suggested using established channels in reverse, bringing more American products to Chinese buyers. 
China is the world's second-largest economy (behind the United States) and one of the world's fastest-growing consumer markets, especially for luxury goods, according to reports from the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and Boston Consulting Group. 
Though America is China's biggest market, companies in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan all export more to China than the United States does, according to the U.S.-China Business Council. 
The exploding Chinese market is alluring but notoriously hard to crack, Hu said. Going it alone, a company would spend $500,000 or more before knowing whether it can make its first sale, Hu said. 
Powin's program is designed to take advantage of its channels between the two countries to simplify bringing goods to market in China. 
Its other big advantage, Hu said, is that Powin is the only American company partnered with nine Chinese banks after helping many of them set up their own online retail businesses serving 90 million customers -- about three-quarters of China's total credit card holders. 
Unlike the United States, banks in China own some of the nation's busiest retail websites and sell directly to their own well-heeled credit customers. The banks also provide demographic and sales data to Powin, enabling American companies to target and track sales, Hu said. 
Kenn Nickell, Channel Partner Program's sales manager, said shoppers on the banks' retail websites have been known to purchase more than half the items they click on because they already know what they want and they trust the seller. 
"They are thirsty for this. They want this product," Nickell said. "That's why the click-through (sales) rate is so high." 
Channel Partner Program's entry-level package markets an American client's products to bank customers for a three-month test run. Powin's fee is $10,000, plus $10,000 worth of the merchandise a participating company wants to sell, for a minimum $20,000 commitment. 
Powin can also help American companies build larger marketing programs in China through the banks and other sales pipelines, including television, mobile phones and retail websites such as Taobao, sometimes described as China's version of eBay. 
"It's a crazy market," Hu said. "You never know what can be successful."
