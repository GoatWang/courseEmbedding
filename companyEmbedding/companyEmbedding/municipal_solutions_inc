Total Municipal Solutions, Inc.














				About Us
			

				Total Municipal Solutions was founded by Charles Billias, retired City Manager of Cocoa Beach, and Raj Verma, 
				retired director of public works/utilities/engineering for the Cities of Coconut Creek, Tamarac and Cocoa Beach, 
				Florida.  Together, they possess over 65 years of combined experience and bring a wealth of tested practical knowledge 
				in all facets of local government.  Applying their unique combination of excellent management skills and great technical 
				ingenuity, they’ve saved millions of dollars in their long public careers.   Inspired by their experience and success, 
				they formed TMS to provide guidance and services to those local governments, which have limited resources, or need help 
				for special projects that require immediate attention. Their goal is to help government officials find solutions for 
				their operational issues in a cost effective manner. 
			



Charles Billias is an acclaimed City Manager and Utilities professional in Florida.  He is a visionary leader and known 
				for his innovative concepts in the area of wastewater management.  Scoffed by his peers against using reclaimed water 25 
				years ago, he partnered with Florida Department of Environmental Regulation to install first segment of reclaimed water in 
				Cocoa Beach.  We now know that effective reuse of wastewater is an indispensable global reality.
			

				Rising through the ranks of utilities operations, Chuck, as he is fondly known, became the City Manager of Cocoa beach in 1998.  
				He inherited a challenging budget and demoralized workforce, which he quickly turned around in less than two years.  He retired 
				as a 41-year employee, including 14 years as the City Manager, the longest tenure for Cocoa Beach in recent history.  Chuck is a 
				recipient of prestigious LeRoy Scott Memorial award and WEF sponsored William D Hatfield award.  Under his leadership, Cocoa Beach
				wastewater treatment plant won the Earle B. Phelps and Region Five EPA Reuse Facility Awards. Chuck also served on a prestigious 
				EPA roundtable panel. 



Raj Verma is a registered Professional Engineer 
				in the State of Florida.  As a key director for the cities of Coconut Creek, Tamarac and Cocoa Beach for over 26 years, he is 
				credited with solving complex organizational, financial and employee issues to deliver exemplary public services; restructuring 
				departments to accommodate changes and improve efficiency; and updating ordinances and policies to make them user-friendly and 
				suitable for redevelopment. 
			

				Although an engineer by profession, Raj’s highest accomplishments have been in the areas of financial management, organizational 
				restructuring and infrastructure improvement. Throughout his public career, he has effectively utilized employee strength and 
				transformed his departments into high-performing working groups to deliver “more for less!” He has mentored several employees, 
				many of whom have risen to higher positions. Raj was a speaker at Transforming Local Government (TLG) Conference on 
				“Institutionalizing Good Government.”
