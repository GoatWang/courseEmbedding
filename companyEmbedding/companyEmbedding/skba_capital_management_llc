 The Baywood ValuePlus Fund is a SKBA-advised mutual fund that follows SKBA's ValuePlus equity strategy.  ValuePlus is a value-oriented investment strategy which seeks to achieve long-term capital appreciation by investing in undervalued equity securities. The portfolio also provides meaningful current income by investing in equities with dividend yields in excess of the market. The strategy is designed for clients who desire the potential long-term real economic returns of the stock market alongside of high current income which is designed to dampen portfolio volatility.
					The Baywood ValuePlus Fund is a series of Forum Fund II, a mutual fund series trust administered 
					by Atlantic Fund Services.  The Baywood ValuePlus Fund is distributed by Foreside Fund Services, LLC.
					



								Mutual fund investing involves risk including the possible loss of principal. The Fund
								primarily invests in undervalued securities which may not appreciate in value as anticipated
								by the Adviser or remain undervalued for longer than anticipated. The Fund may invest in American
								Depositary Receipts (ADRs) which involves risks relating to political, economic or regulatory
								conditions in foreign countries and may cause greater volatility and less liquidity. The Fund
								may also invest in convertible securities and preferred stock which may be adversely affected
								as interest rates rise.
								The Baywood SKBA ValuePlus Fund came into existence on this date as a result of the conversion
								of the SKBA ValuePlus Collective Trust Fund, which had its inception in June of 2008, into
								the new mutual fund format with two share classes. The Prospectus contains information about
								these share classes, and persons interested in investing in the Fund should read the Prospectus
								and the SAI before investing. You may invest in Fund shares either by contacting your broker/dealer
								and financial advisor or by making a direct purchase of shares by calling the Transfer Agent,
								Atlantic Fund Services at 1-855-409-2297.

Performance  as of 6/30/2017 








Performance for periods greater than one year is annualized. On 12/02/2013, a collective trust (the Predecessor 
							Vehicle) was converted into the Baywood ValuePlus Fund (the Fund). The Predecessor Vehicle's 
							performance has been included for the period June 27, 2008 to December 2, 2013 for Investor Shares. For the 
							Institutional Shares, performance for the period includes the returns of Investor Shares prior to May 2, 2011, the 
							commencement of operations of Institutional Shares. The Predecessor Vehicleâs performance for shares in each 
							class has been adjusted to reflect the monthly deduction of fees and expenses applicable to their respective share 
							class of the Baywood ValuePlus Fund. The Predecessor Vehicle was not registered as a mutual fund under the 
							Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (1940 Act), and therefore was not subject to certain investment 
							restrictions, limitations and diversification requirements imposed by the 1940 Act and Internal Revenue Code. If the 
							Predecessor Vehicle had been registered under the 1940 Act its performance may have been different.

							The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. 
							Investment return and principal value will fluctuate, and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than 
							their original cost. The Russell 1000 Value Index and the S&P 500 Index are unmanaged indices.
							  The performance shown reflects fee waivers/reimbursements in effect, without these 
							waivers, performance would have been lower. Total returns are based on net change in NAV with reinvestment of all dividends.
							Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. For performance current to the most
							 recent month-end, please call 1-855-409-2297. Individuals cannot invest in an index.

Q1 2017
Q4 2016
Q3 2016
Q2 2016


Investment Outlook
 Q2 2017 
 Market Commentary 
Given the slow but steady improvement in economic conditions for many world economies in the first half of 2017,
					second quarter results were still surprising in a number of ways. In Late June both the U.S. and European central banks announced
					they would not be "as easy" in managing the supply and outlook for the world's currencies.  In addition, a number of incidents
					and political statements in some of the largest countries (particularly in France, the UK, and the U.S.) shook up the expectation
					s for an improvement in the economies as well as the political practices of many of the governments.  In spite of these jolts,
					financial markets continued their improvement in the second quarter.
The now clichéd "Trump Bump" in the U.S. — which was based on the presumption of a resurgence of "animal spirits"
					and a major improvement in economic policies proposed by the new Republican administration — morphed into the "Trump Slump" as it
					has become apparent that neither new tax policies nor the speed of their adoption is going to be as easy and timely as expected.
					The outlook for the domestic economy was downgraded due to the uncertainty regarding these beneficial changes, and it is
					believed that the U.S. GDP growth will have a difficult time accelerating from the 2% rate we have been stuck in for the past
					seven years.  Interest rates retraced much of the post-election rise and incipient price inflation pressures faded. As a result,
					sectors in the market with commodity-price exposure or cyclical sensitivity reacted negatively in the quarter.
Yet the Trump Slump appeared to have run its course by the end of May, and in June, Large-Cap Value benchmark
					returns improved relative to Large-Cap Growth as some of the most popular, most richly-valued growth technology stocks saw
					short-lived but sharp periods of price decline.  Interest-sensitive stocks like utilities also weakened, whereas
					economically-sensitive stocks strengthened again.
At this point in the year the Federal Reserve Board's policy seems clear — expect another rate hike later in 2017.
					It is also clear that the Fed is determined to adhere to its change in money supply/dollar stance, as reflected in its
					discussion of the timing of the planned reduction in the Bank's balance sheet, rather than continuing to focus on micro
					managing Fed policy with its large holdings of securities.  The greatest surprise for U.S. and European bond markets was
					the statement by the ECB's Mario Draghi that the risk of deflation in Europe was considerably reduced.  Bond prices sold
					off and yields rose dramatically as investors understood that the long period of extraordinary monetary ease in Europe
					might be coming to an end.
Overall, the stock market's current valuation no longer looks inexpensive, particularly among the high-growth
					tech companies and many perceived safe havens.  Investors are in a "show me" mood which indicates it will take more than hope
					to drive the market significantly higher. Corporate decisions not to invest in new plant and equipment are a negative for more
					robust domestic economic outlook therefore it looks like "real" positive change on regulation and tax policy.  In other words,
					fiscal policy will be needed to create more confidence in the economy for the balance of the year.
Amid all of this noise, the wide swings in stock markets around the world widened valuation spreads among
					sectors.  Our emphasis on the quality of companies selling at reasonable prices seems appropriate to continue to meet our
					clients' needs.  The consensus seems to be torn between hoping for strengthening in the U.S. without triggering a round

Investment Approach





SKBA manages the Large Cap Value model using its ValuePlus investment strategy. Investments are selected from a universe of securities passing Azzad’s ethical screens. The strategy seeks to achieve long-term capital appreciation by investing in a diversified portfolio of large cap, undervalued securities. SKBA incorporates a bottom-up, fundamental research process that invests in companies that pass its proprietary initial valuation filters. Only companies that pass SKBA’s initial valuation filters make it to the next stage where a company’s earnings power is carefully analyzed. SKBA focuses on a company’s balance sheet and income statement strength, competitive position and overall industry prospects, as well as management’s alignment with shareholders’ interests.
SKBA employs a team approach to investing. Its research effort is centralized to ensure that investment ideas translate to each investment discipline. The investment process and expertise are vested in the organization, not just one “star” manager. SKBA have vested in the organization the expertise for the successful execution of this discipline. Its success is not dependent upon any one individual portfolio manager, analyst or trader, but is the result of a strategy team process. Hence, the portfolio management team process ensures that ideas are cross-fertilized and that investment philosophies are transferred to the next generation of employees. The success of the overall process will undoubtedly outlive the founders of the firm.
