Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

New Hedge Fund Melvin Capital Raises $700 Million
Jan 7 2015  |  5:31am ET

By Saijel Kishan and Simone Foxman (Bloomberg) -- Gabriel Plotkin, who was one of billionaire Steven A. Cohen’s top money managers, raised about $700 million for his new hedge fund, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.
Plotkin, 36, has posted a 0.8 percent gain in his fund, Melvin Capital, since it started trading on Dec. 11, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. Melvin Capital expects to manage $900 million by Feb. 1, the other person said. Plotkin declined to comment on the fundraising.
Plotkin, who left Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management at the end of November, received an investment of about $200 million from his former boss, according to one of the people. He joined Cohen’s previous hedge fund firm, SAC Capital Advisors, in 2006, where he oversaw more than $1 billion, including leverage, in consumer-related stocks.
Melvin Capital charges clients fees depending on the amount of profit it makes. The incentive fee will be 20 percent if it generates gross profits of as much as 12 percent, according to a November government filing. If the gain is greater than 12 percent but not more than 22 percent, the fee will be 20 percent plus the amount that matches the excess return.
If the return is 22 percent or more, the fund will charge a 30 percent profit fee. Melvin will levy the industry standard management fee of 2 percent of assets, according to the filing.
SAC Settlement
SAC last year paid a record fine to settle U.S. charges of insider trading and Cohen agreed to stop managing money for outside clients. He changed the name of his firm to Point72, which manages about $10 billion of his own fortune. Cohen was never charged criminally with any wrongdoing.
Plotkin was linked in March 2013 to a trade that led to the insider-trading conviction of a former SAC money manager. Plotkin hasn’t been accused of any wrongdoing. Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for SAC at Sard Verbinnen & Co., said at the time that Plotkin did nothing wrong and that he built his career on conducting legitimate research.
Plotkin started his career at Ken Griffin’s hedge fund firm Citadel after graduating from Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, with an economics degree in 2001. After that, he was an analyst at North Sound Capital, a hedge fund firm in Connecticut, before joining SAC Capital.
Within five years of starting at Cohen’s firm, Plotkin was managing more than $1 billion, one of only a handful of managers at the firm with such a large portfolio. He was one of the highest-paid professionals at the firm, keeping 30 percent of his profits, while most of his colleagues earned between 15 percent and 25 percent, according to former colleagues who asked not to be identified.

 Beyond the tear sheet: War stories from the front lines of hedge fund due diligence 
 Investing in private partnership structures such as hedge funds, private equity and private real estate can be a fruitful and exciting endeavor, especially when venturing into asset classes that lack competition and efficiency. An important qualification to remember when beginning due diligence on a partnership is that no investment is perfect. Each one has its own risks, however esoteric or idiosyncratic, and risks change over time, as do the operations and other intricacies of investment management.

  Former SAC Capital star portfolio manager Gabe Plotkin had a
  monster first year running his own hedge fund.

  Melvin Capital, a $1.5 billion long/short equity hedge fund,
  finished 2015 up an impressive 47%, 
  according to Bloomberg News' ranking of top-performing hedge
  funds with $1 billion or more in assets under management.

  Those returns place Melvin Capital as the No. 2 fund for 2015,
  the Bloomberg ranking shows.

  Hedge funds on average fell about 3.64% in 2015, 
  according to data from Hedge Fund Research.

  Melvin Capital's largest long positions were McDonald's, Dollar
  Tree, Domino's Pizza, Royal Caribbean Cruises, Signet Jewelers,
  Constellation Brands, Lowe's, Advance Autoparts, Facebook, Visa,
  and Amazon, according to 
  the most recent 13F data for the fourth quarter, which ended
  December 31.





  The fund is off to a strong start in 2016, gaining 2.9% in
  January, 
  Bloomberg's Simone Foxman reported. Hedge funds on average
  fell 2.76% in January, HFR's data shows.

  Plotkin, 37, worked as a portfolio manager at Sigma Capital, a
  subsidiary of Steve Cohen's SAC Capital (now the family-office
  fund Point72 Asset Management), from 2006 until April 2014. There
  he ran a $1.3 billion portfolio focused on consumer product
  stocks, 
  according to a report in The New York Times.

  He officially launched Melvin Capital, named after his late
  grandfather, in September 2014.

  Cohen, his former boss, reportedly agreed to invest 
  up to $200 million with Plotkin.

  Cohen also had a strong year in 2015, with Point72 
  ending up 15.5%.
