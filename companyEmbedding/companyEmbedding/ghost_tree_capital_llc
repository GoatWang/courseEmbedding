   Hedge Funds-News  David Kim’s Ghost Tree Capital Loves These Healthcare Stocks    Published on February 27, 2014 at 3:29 pm by  
                                Javier Hasse
                                  in Hedge Funds,News                 Ghost Tree Capital is a healthcare-oriented hedge fund headquartered in New York. It was founded in 2013 by David Kim who is the portfolio manager, Ken Greenberg and Brian Kim (Senior Analysts), and Matt Diaz (trader). Ghost Tree Capital team formerly worked at Richard Schimel‘s Diamondback Capital. David Kim also worked as a portfolio manager at Ken Griffin‘s Citadel Investment Group. With almost 90% of its equity portfolio (valued at approximately $162 million) allocated to the healthcare industry, “the firm’s strategy is focused on driving strong absolute returns, independent of market cycles, based on fundamental primary research and disciplined financial analysis” (Ghost Tree). Many hedge funds have been filing their 13Fs for the fourth quarter of 2013 lately. In these forms, they disclose most of their long equity positions as of the end of December. Although the portfolio information is a few weeks old, there are still a few ways for investors to use it. In this article, we will briefly look into the equity portfolio of Ken Greenberg and David Kim’s Ghost Tree Capital by the end of the fourth quarter (this was the first time that the fund reported its equity portfolio at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission). Although its most valuable holdings are mostly comprised by call and put options at several companies –including Allergan Inc. (NYSE:AGN) and Gilead Sciences Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD), we will focus on its long stock positions.  The fund has placed its largest bet on Gilead Sciences Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD), a $128 billion market cap research-based biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and commercializes new medicines for different medical sectors. Kim and Greenberg’s fund owned 135,000 shares of the company by Dec. 31st 2013, valued at roughly $11.3 million –which comprises about 6.2% of its equity portfolio. Including ‘Put’ and ‘Call’ options, the percentage of its portfolio invested in Gilead raises to roughly 14%. This investment certainly makes sense, especially given the company’s industry leading margins and returns, low debt levels and amazing growth prospects (analysts expect it to deliver average annual EPS growth rates around 36% over the next five years). With a privileged position in the HIV and hepatitis C markets, this stock looks like a safe bet. In addition, it trades at a substantial discount in relation to its peers; at 46 times the company’s earnings, versus an industry average valuation of 75x P/E. Moreover, the stock is already up more than 10% since their purchases. Even further, several other major hedge funds, including Julian Robertson’s Tiger Management, which holds 320,000 shares, up by 26% over Q4, and Lee Munder’s Lee Munder Capital Group, also seem to feel quite bullish on this company. Ghost Tree’s second largest long position is in Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (NYSE:BMY), a biopharmaceutical company with a market cap of $88.9 billion. The fund owns 100,000 shares of the company, valued at $5.4 million. Comprising 3.2% of its portfolio, this holding is the fund’s seventh most valuable one. Despite Ghost Tree’s bullishness, opinion among funds and analysts is quite divided in relation to Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (NYSE:BMY). Some feel encouraged by decent growth projections, a strong portfolio of drugs, a robust pipeline, a wide economic moat –mainly supported by its patent holdings and pipeline, and a 2.69% dividend yield. Amongst them we can find Christopher Medlock’s Partner Fund Management, which holds 7.5 million shares, and Alex Denner’s Sarissa Capital Management. Others, instead, would rather hold on this stock, mainly in account of the company’s below average margins and returns, valuation at 34x P/E (double its industry´s average), high debt levels, and important patent losses that will continue through 2017. In this group of bears, I would like to highlight Jim Simons, who sold out 99% of his stakes in the company during the fourth quarter, amongst several  others who closed out or significantly reduced their positions. The fund’s top 10 list is completed by Biogen Idec Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB) and The Spectranetics Corporation (NASDAQ:SPNC), two healthcare tech companies. Each of these holdings are worth more than $4 million, and comprise, combined, about 5.5% of Ghost Tree’s portfolio. No doubt about it, Ken Greenberg and David Kim’s bets are placed on the healthcare segment. Are their choices good enough for you too?

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60) 

DAYS





      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):
Starting Quarter

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.
