Information is updated every day at approximately 6P CST. The Last Price, Change, and Change Percent is listed at the top, with other quote data listed in the quoteboard below.  Quoteboard data fields include:  Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session. Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram. Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session. Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity. YTD High, Low, Change, %Change: The high and low price year-to-date, with the change and percent change year-to-date.

Click the "See More" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.Barchart Technical Opinion The Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overally Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal." If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."                                  Add Data Columns to this Table Learn about our Custom Views   Want to use this as  your default charts setting?

NORTHQUEST CAPITAL FUND, INC. 

To the Shareholders of NorthQuest Capital Fund, Inc.:                           

    Our Fund began the year at a share price of $10.96 and ended 2004 at $11.93.
The Fund's total return before taxes for this period was 8.85%.  The following  
table may be helpful in comparing the Fund's performance with other indexes.    

   Index            2004 Performance            Year-To-Date
   -----                                        ------------
 D.J.I.A.                                         3.15 %
 S&P 500                                          8.99 %
 S&P 500 with reinvested dividends               10.88 %

The presidential and congressional elections, the on war terrorism, rising in-  
terest rates, escalating legal expenses and high commodity prices put a cap on  
the earnings of many U.S. companies. During 2004, numerous State governments    
continued to increase tax rates, fees and spending at the expense of the econo- 
my. Despite these negatives, the Fund's portfolio continued to grow in value.   
The Fund's gross unrealized capital gain, which is the difference between the   
cost of our common stock holdings and their current value, continued to in-     
crease. The total cost of these securities as of 12/31/04 totaled $1,108,406.   
The current value of all Fund common stock securities was $1,485,584, which is a
gross unrealized gain of $377,178. The Fund's net assets increased $134,770 from
$1,715,250 in 2003 to $1,850,020 in 2004. NorthQuest received $20,502 in divi-  
dends and $3,603 in interest income. Our portfolio of companies performed well  
during this period of uncertainties.                                            
  NorthQuest is eagerly looking forward to 2005, especially since the Fund has
approximately 20% of its assets in cash and short-term investments.             
You will find enclosed the information and commentary about the Fund's    
holdings, year-end financial statements, and the Auditor's opinion stated in the
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm. Please do not hestitate
to call or write me any comments or questions that you may have about this      
report. Thank you again for your trust, confidence, and investments!

General Corporate Information and Update on Companies in Fund's Investment      
Portfolio                                                                       

SECURITY                          STOCK SYMBOL                                  
ALLSTATE CORPORATION                  ALL                                       
Allstate Corporation sells auto, property/casualty and life insurance throughout
the U.S. This security increased 19% in 2004. Low debt and steady earnings con- 
tinued to make this an attractive holding.                                      

BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY                    BRKB                                      
Berkshire is a conglomerate that owns many different types of businesses such as
See's Candies, Dexter Shoe Company, Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey Home   
Furnishings, Flight Safety International, Inc, NetJets, Dairy Queen, Benjamin   
Moore, Geico Corporation, Shaw Industries, Clayton Homes, Inc, Fruit of the     
Loom, Johns Mansville and many other companies.  BRKB also invests in several   
common stock securities such as Coca-Cola Co. and Gillette. BRKB's earnings     
declined in 2004 and as a consequence its share price increased a modest 4.7%.  

CHOICEPOINT                           CPS                                       
CPS collects risk management/anti-fraud information on individuals and provides 
this data to government agencies and businesses.  ChoicePoint earnings increased
sharply in 2004, which enabled its share price to rise 20%. This holding is     
undervalued at its current price.                                               

CISCO SYSTEMS                         CSCO                                      
Cisco produces, services, and supplies computer-networking equipment, which con-
nect many local computer networks into one computer system network via the in-  
ternet.  CSCO's share price declined 20.3% in 2004. At this time the share price
of Cisco is fairly valued.                                                      

DIEBOLD INC.                          DBD                                       
DBD produces, sells and services ATM machines, point of sale systems (e.g.; cash
registers with inventory control), vaults, electronic voting machines, and alarm
systems.  During the November elections, Diebold's voting machines performed    
well in many states throughout the U.S. But ATM sales were soft. Diebold's stock
price increased a modest 2.4% in 2004. Currently, DBD is undervalued.           

DONALDSON CO.                         DCI                                       
Donaldson manufactures filters for large trucks, computer drives, manufacturing 
facilities, industrial gas turbines and other specialized applications.  DCI's  
price per share climbed 11.2% in 2004. The Fund will purchase additional shares 
of DCI upon price weakness.                                                     

E.I. DU PONT DE NEMOURS               DD

Du Pont is one of the largest chemical companies in the U.S.  The restructuring 
of Du Pont has increased net profit margins, cash flow and cash on hand. The    
share price of DD increased 7.8% in 2004. Du Pont remains an attractive         
holding.                                                                        

EMC CORP.                             EMC                                       
EMC is a leader in designing, manufacturing, and servicing storage data software
and hardware for corporations and institutions.  EMC earnings were stronger in  
2004 and accordingly its share price increased 12.5%. Currently, this security  
is fairly valued.

include; home appliances, aircraft engines, lighting products, leasing, commer- 
cial and consumer lending, plastics, TV and radio broadcasting, medical equip-  
ment products, and turbine-generators for power utility companies.  GE has been 
increasing its debt to buy businesses with stronger earnings potential. General 
Electric's price per share increased 17.3% in 2004. GE is fairly valued at this 
time.

Hershey produces chocolate and non-chocolate sweets under the following names:  
Hershey, Reese's, Kit Kat, Milk Duds, Cadbury, TasteTations, Jolly Rancher, and 
Good 'n' Plenty. A slight increase in profit margins and new products helped    
Hershey's share price increase 45.1% in 2004. This is a core holding but is     
overvalued at this time.

MBNA offers credit to consumers by issuing bank and affinity credit cards in the
U.S., Europe, and Canada.  This stock increased 14.5% in 2004. MBNA continues to
be successful on account of its high lending standards. Currently, this security
is undervalued.

2004. NJ Resources is a core holding but is currently overvalued.

throughout most of 2004. Two of Pfizer's drugs, Celebrex and Bextra, have come  
under greater scrutiny by the Federal Drug Adm. ("FDA").The results of a recent 
medical study revealed that these drugs may increase the risk of a heart attack 
when taken by some patients. As a consequence of this report and other negative 
pharmaceutical related news, PFE fell 24.4% in 2004. Pfizer is still a core     
holding and is currently undervalued.                                           

SEALED AIR                            SEE                                       
SEE is a manufacturer of protective packaging products such as bubble wrap, foam
protectors, and food packaging materials. Sealed Air stock had a modest increase
of .4% in 2004. Higher energy costs, competition and news reports on Mad Cow    
disease limited the short-term performance of SEE. The Fund will be adding to   
this position as earnings become more consistent.                               

STRYKER CORP.                         SYK                                       
SYK designs, manufactures and markets medical devices (power instruments used in
surgery), equipment (stretchers and maternity beds), and orthopaedic implants   
(hip, knee, shoulder and spinal).  Stryker stock increased 15.2% in 2004. This  
security is undervalued at this time and remains a core holding.                

SYMANTEC CORP.                        SYMC                                      
SYMC is a software company that develops, markets, and supports computer pro-   
grams that protect personal computers of individuals (Norton products) and bus- 
inesses (commercial contracts) from computer viruses and other types of security
breaches.  During the fourth quarter of 2004, SYMC announced the acquisition of 
Veritas, which designs software for corporate accounts. SYMC's share price drop-
ped sharply after the Veritas announcement but SYMC stock still advanced 48.3%  
in 2004. This security remains overvalued.                                      

TECHNITROL, INC.                      TNL                                       
TNL designs, manufactures and markets electrical contacts and other electrical  
components, which are used in consumer electronics, military/aerospace naviga-  
tion and weapon guidance systems, data and telephone networks, automobiles, and 
other power equipment devices.  Earnings predictability still remains a         
problem. As a consequence, TNL's price per share fell 13.1% in 2004. This secur-
ity is extremely undervalued. But the Fund will not purchase additional shares  
of this holding until sales and earnings become more consistent.                

WASHINGTON MUTUAL                     WM                                        
WM is the largest savings bank in the U.S. with over 2,500 offices. This company
offers consumer and commercial lending, insurance, brokerage and asset manage-  
ment services.  Washington Mutual earnings declined in 2004 due to higher inter-
est rates and less mortgage refinancing.  WM management continues to cut costs. 
WM share price was up 6.74% in 2004. Washington Mutual remains a core holding.  

EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION               XOM                                       
XOM is one of the largest oil companies in the world. During the past year,     
higher oil prices increased Exxon Mobil's revenues and net profits. Exxon       
Mobil's share price increased 26.2% in 2004. XOM is fairly valued at this       
time.

EXPENSES

EXPENSES EXAMPLE                                                                
As a shareholder of the Fund, you incur ongoing costs, including management fees
and other Fund operating expenses. This example is intended to help you under-  
stand your ongoing costs (in dollars) of investing in the Fund and to compare   
costs with the ongoing costs of investing in other mutual funds.                

This Example is based on an investment of $1,000 invested at the beginning of   
the period and held for the entire six-month period of July 1, 2004 to          
December 31, 2004.                                                              

Actual Expenses                                                                 
The first line of the table below provides information about actual account     
values and actual expenses. You may use the information in this line, together  
with the amount you invested at the beginning of the period, to estimate the ex-
penses that you paid over the period. Simply divide your account value by $1,000
(for example, an $8,600 account value divided by $1,000=8.6), then mutliply the 
result by the number in the first line under the heading "Expense Paid During   
Period" to estimate the expenses you paid on your account during the period.    

Hypothetical Example for Comparison Purposes                                    
The second line of the table below provides information about hypothetical ac-  
count values and hypothetical expenses based on the Fund's actual expense ratio 
and an assumed rate of return of 5% per year before expenses, which is not the  
Fund's actual return. The hypothetical account values and expenses may not be   
used to estimate the actual ending account balance or expenses you paid for the 
period. You may use this information to compare the ongoing costs of investing  
in the Fund and other Funds. To do so, compare this 5% hypothetical example with
the 5% hypothetical examples that appear in the shareholder reports of other    
funds.                                                                          

Please note that the expenses shown in the table are meant to highlight your on-
going costs only and do not reflect any transactional costs, such as sales      
charges (loads), redemption fees, or exchange fees. Therefore, the second line  
of the table is useful in comparing ongoing costs only, and will help you deter-
mine the relative total costs of owning different funds. In addition, if these  
transactional costs were included, your costs would have been higher.

* Expenses are equal to the Fund's annualized expense ratio of 1.38%, multiplied
by the average account value over the period, multiplied by 184 days/366 days   
[number of days in most recent fiscal half-year/365[or 366](to reflect the one- 
half year period).

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                                   

  Nature of Operations:  NorthQuest Capital Fund, Inc. ("the Fund") was incor-
  porated on January 3, 2001 in New Jersey and commenced investment operations
January 15, 2002.  The Fund is registered as an open-end, non-diversified 
 management investment company under the Investment Company act of 1940, and
  its share are registered under the Securities Act of 1933.  The following is
a summary of significant accounting policies consistently followed by the 
Fund in the preparation of its financial statements.  The policies are in 
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.                 

  Security Valuations:  Equity securities generally are valued by using market
 quotations, but may be valued on the basis of prices furnished by a pricing
service when the Advisor believes such prices accurately reflect the fair 
market value of such securities. Securities that are traded on any stock  
   exchange or on the NASDAQ over-the-counter market are generally valued by the
  pricing service at the last quoted sale price. Lacking a last sale price, an
equity security is generally valued by the pricing service at its last bid
   price. When market quotations are not readily available,  or when the Advisor
determines that the markert quotation or the price provided by the pricing
service does not accurately reflect the current market value, or when re- 
  stricted or illiquid securities are being valued, such securities are valued
  as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors in accordance with the
  Fund's "Fair Value Policy" that has been authorized by the Fund's board. The
Board has delegated to the Advisor the responsibility for determining fair
value pricing, subject to review by the Board of Directors.               

 Federal Income Taxes:  The Fund's policy is to comply with the requirements
of the Internal Revenue Code that are applicable to regulated investment  
companies and to distribute all its taxable income to its shareholders.   
Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required.                   

  Distributions to Shareholders:  The Fund intends to distribute to its share-
 holders substantially all of its net realized capital gains and net invest-
ment income, if any, at year-end.                                         

  Other:  The Fund follows industry practice and records security transactions
  on the trade date.  The specific identification method is used for determin-
  ing gains and losses for financial statements and income tax purposes.  Div-
 idend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date and interest income is re-
corded on an accrual basis.                                               

Estimates:  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with ac-
cepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and as-
  sumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and dis-
  closure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial state-
ments and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting
period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

2. INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT AND OTHER RELATED TRANSACTIONS                 

  The Fund has an investment advisory agreement with Emerald Research Corpora-
tion ("the Advisor"), whereby the Advisor receives a fee of 1% per year on
   the net assets of the Fund.  All fees are computed on the average daily clos-
ing net asset value of the Fund and are payable monthly.  The Advisor has 
   agreed to decrease the investment advisory fee or, if necessary, to reimburse
  the Fund if and to the extent that the Fund's aggregate annual operating ex-
penses exceed 2%.                                                         

  The Management fee for 2004, as computed pursuant to the advisory agreement,
totaled $17,443.  The Advisor additionally paid $8,394 of the Fund's total
expenses, which totaled $32,785.                                          

  Mr. Peter J. Lencki is President of the Advisor and is also President of the
Fund.  Mr. Walter A. Lencki is the Fund's treasurer and an investor in the
Advisor.                                                                  

3. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS                                                      

  For the year ended December 31, 2004, purchases and sales of investment sec-
urities other than short-term investments aggregated $44,365 and $58,854  
respectively.                                                             

4. CAPITAL SHARE TRANSACTIONS                                                   

As of December 31, 2004, there were 500,000,000 shares of $.001 par value 
capital stock authorized.

5. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES                                                         

  Income and long-term capital gain distributions are determined in accordance
 with Federal income tax regulations, which may differ from accounting prin-
ciples generally accepted in the United States.                           

At December 31, 2004, the gross unrealized appreciation for all securities
totlated $399,541 and the gross unrealized depreciation for all securities
 totaled $22,363 or a net unrealized appreciation of $377,178. The aggregate
 cost of securities for federal income tax purposes at December 31, 2004 was
$1.468,174, including short-term investments.                             

As of December 31, 2004, the components of distributed earnings on a tax  
basis were as follows:                                                    

Undistributed ordinary income           $    -              
Accumulated capital losses              $    (507)          
Unrealized appreciation                 $ 377,178           

The accumulated capital loss carryover expires in 2012.                   
  There were no distributions to shareholders for the years ended December 31,
2004 and 2003.                                                            

6. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS                                                            

On February 24, 2004, the Fund received a notice from the Securities and  
 Exchange Commission ("SEC"), advising that the staff was considering recom-
  mending that the Commission bring a civil injunction action and/or institute
administrative proceedings against the Fund, the Advisor and Peter Lencki,
individually. This action stemmed from the SEC's routine examination. The 
Fund, the Advisor and Mr. Lencki have entered into settlement negotiations
  with the SEC to resolve this matter. There can be no assurance that the set-
 tlement negotiations will be successful or that the terms of the final set-
   tlement will not have a material adverse effect on the Fund or the ability of
the Advisor to perform its contract with the Fund.                        

  The SEC questioned the procedure in which shareholders were transferred into
the Fund from a limited partnership ("LP") managed by the Advisor. The SEC
requested that the Fund voluntarily suspend sales of new shares to current
and prospective shareholders. The Fund continued to honor redemption re-  
  quests. Sales of new shares were suspended on July 23, 2003. The former lim-
   ited partners of the LP were brought into the Fund by transferring securities
  they received from the LP to the Fund and receiving their pro rata shares of
the Fund in exchange for the securities transferred at the current market 
  value on the date of transfer. The Fund accepted these shareholders into the
   Fund individually within five groups on five different dates throughout 2002.
   The SEC believed that all limited partners of the LP should have been accept-
   ed into the Fund on the same day. The affected shareholders were issued 1,582
additional shares of the Fund and the Advisor reimbursed the Fund $543 for
losses sustained due to redemptions. On March 23, 2004 sales of new Fund  
shares were accepted. As previously disclosed, the Fund and Advisor are   
awaiting a final settlement in this matter.

7. SHARE SUBSCRIPTIONS AND EXPENSE RATIO                                        

While the Fund was updating its prospectus the SEC determined that the ex-
  pense ratio being charged the Fund was not in accordance with its prospectus
  thus the Advisor voluntarily recalculated the expense ratio and promptly re-
 inbursed the Fund $4,545 for expenses that were above the expense cap. This
amount is included in the total reimbursement and expenses paid by the    
 Advisor in the amount of $8,394. Due to this expense cap situation the Fund
made an offer of recission to any shareholder who purchased shares of the 
Fund from January 1, 2004 to October 21, 2004. To date no shareholder has 
accepted this recission offer.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Board of Directors of the                                                       
NorthQuest Capital Fund, Inc.                                                   

 We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of the
NorthQuest Capital Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") including the schedule of invest-    
ments, as of December 31, 2004 and the related statements of operations, changes
in net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended and the finan- 
cial highlights for each of the two years in the period then ended and for the  
period from January 15, 2002 (commencement of investment operations) to December
31, 2002. These financial statements and financial highlights are the responsi- 
bility of the Fund's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on 
these financial statements based on our audit.                                  

   We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. An audit 
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclo-
sures in the financial statements.  Our procedures included confirmation of se- 
curities owned as of December 31, 2004, by correspondence with the custodian and
brokers.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and   
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
