  The Indianapolis Business Journal has named Interactive Intelligence Group Inc. (Nasdaq: ININ) CFO Ashley Vukovits among its 2015 Women of Influence. The IBJ's Women of Influence program recognizes women in Indiana who are at the top of their field based on professional excellence, leadership, vision, community service and mentoring. This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20151105005032/en/   Ashley Vukovits, CFO Interactive Intelligence (Photo: Business Wire)   Vukovits has 20-plus years of experience in corporate accounting and financial management, and since 2003 has served in finance roles at Interactive Intelligence, a global provider of software and cloud services for customer engagement, unified communications and collaboration.  "We looked all over the country for the best CFO available and realized Ashley was just as competent as anyone we could find," said Dr. Donald Brown, Interactive Intelligence founder and CEO. "It was a delight to be able to promote her into the position and a credit to her talent and hard work. Although we focused on finding the best person for the job regardless of gender, I can't deny that it was a special pleasure to add a woman to our executive management team."  Vukovits serves as chief financial officer, senior vice president of administration, secretary and treasurer at Interactive Intelligence.  During her time at Interactive Intelligence, the company has grown from 300 employees to 2,200. Revenues have increased from just over $50 million in 2003 to more than $340 million in 2014.

Chief Financial Officer
Interactive Intelligence Group

	Ashley Vukovits was “a little hesitant” when she joined Interactive Intelligence Group in 2003.

	“The thing that concerned me most was that I had no software experience,” she said.

	It was right after the tech bubble and, given the amount of tech crashes, she wondered about the company’s viability. “What I really liked, though, is that we were a small company around giants. We were holding our own and doing pretty well.

	“When I looked at the analyst reports, the clear, overriding factor was that this little company had really good software and a good product.”

	She wisely took the chance.

	During her tenure, the company has grown from 300 employees to 2,100, and its revenue has shot from $50 million to $340 million. The company now sells in more than 100 countries.

	Vukovits rose to chief financial officer in 2015, which makes her responsible for global financial planning, accounting and reporting, human resources, information technology, and risk management. Her achievements include managing a $150 million convertible debt offering to raise funds to support Interactive Intelligence’s market shift from on-premises software sales to a cloud-based solution. The offering also provided capital for mergers and acquisitions.

	Originally from Ohio, Vukovits recalls sitting at the bookkeeper’s desk at her father’s construction company and pretending to be on the job. “I liked numbers and was good at math,” she said. “I knew since high school I wanted to do something with accounting.”

	She double-majored in accounting and finance at Miami University in Ohio. Wanting to be away but not too far from home, she landed in Indianapolis at KPMG, where she served as an audit associate. She left to serve as vice president of finance with the auto finance firm Union Acceptance Corp. before moving on to Interactive Intelligence.

	Vukovits joined the advisory council for Informatics: Diversity-Enhanced Workforce, an initiative within the IU School of Informatics and Computing. The IUPUI program introduces computing concepts and problem solving to high school students. “Students start the program as freshman,” she said, “and we’ll be with them through all four years, hoping to add a new grade every year.”

	She also helped launch the Interactive Intelligence Foundation, a not-for-profit committed to improving the lives of at-risk children through 10 charities around the world. Interactive Intelligence was always charitable, she said, but previously giving back was done in “a haphazard manner,” she said.

	“There was some connection through a vendor or an employee or the president,” she said. “I wanted to see it get more focus—and to get more employees involved.” Vukovits serves as the foundation’s treasurer.

	She’s also a volunteer with the Julian Center in Indianapolis and is involved at Holy Spirit at Geist Catholic Church. She started there as a classroom volunteer when her children were young.

	“It was not only fun to be a part of their experience, but it also helped me learn more about the church,” she said. “As they got older, I became a Eucharistic minister there.”•

Interactive Intelligence Appoints New Chief Financial Officer





Ashley Vukovits brings 20-plus years of finance experience, 
        primarily at Interactive Intelligence, as new CFO


Company also promotes Bill Gildea to newly created chief operating 
        officer position







July 23, 2015 10:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



INDIANAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Interactive Intelligence Group Inc. (Nasdaq: ININ), a global provider of 
      software and cloud services for customer engagement, unified 
      communications and collaboration, has appointed Ashley Vukovits as its 
      new chief financial officer, senior vice president of administration, 
      secretary and treasurer effective Aug. 1, 2015.
    


      Vukovits replaces Stephen R. Head, who is retiring as chief financial 
      officer, effective with Vukovits’ appointment. Head is expected to 
      remain with Interactive Intelligence through mid-August.
    

      Vukovits, who brings with her more than 20 years of experience in 
      corporate finance, will be responsible for global financial planning, 
      accounting and reporting; human resources; information technology; and 
      risk management.
    

      Vukovits had served in finance roles at Interactive Intelligence since 
      2003. Most recently she served as vice president of finance for the 
      company, during which time she managed more than 70 employees and was 
      responsible for all global accounting and financial management 
      activities.
    

      Prior to that, Vukovits held roles as corporate controller and senior 
      manager of financial reporting for Interactive Intelligence. Vukovits 
      also served as treasurer for the Interactive Intelligence Foundation 
      since its inception in 2010 – a role she will continue to fill.
    

      Before joining Interactive Intelligence, Vukovits held senior finance 
      positions with Union Acceptance Corp., and was an audit professional for 
      KPMG LLP.
    

      Vukovits has a bachelor’s degree with a double major in accounting and 
      finance from Miami University. She is a certified public accountant.
    

      “Ashley’s 20-plus years of experience in finance, combined with her 12 
      years at Interactive Intelligence, make her an ideal fit for our CFO 
      role,” said Dr. Donald E. Brown, Interactive Intelligence founder and 
      CEO. “She has earned the trust and respect of everyone on the senior 
      management team. We all have complete confidence in her ability to take 
      the next step and I’m delighted to name her our new CFO.”
    

      Effective Aug. 1, 2015, Interactive Intelligence will also promote its 
      chief performance officer Bill Gildea to a newly created chief operating 
      officer position. As COO, Gildea will be responsible for driving 
      operational efficiencies throughout the company, and managing corporate 
      development, legal and investor relations.
    

      “Bill has been playing an increasingly critical role in improving the 
      effectiveness and efficiency of our operations,” Brown said. “His broad 
      knowledge of the business from sales to product strategy has allowed him 
      to work effectively across departments and geographies. I’ve come to 
      rely on him to solve problems and tackle the thorny issues associated 
      with rapid growth. As COO, he will be able to build on this strong 
      foundation, while expanding his scope to encompass legal and IR 
      functions for even greater impact.”
