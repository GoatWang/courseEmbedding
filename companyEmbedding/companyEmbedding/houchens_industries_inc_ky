Operations[edit]
The company is best known as a grocer, owning and operating convenience stores (Jr. Food Stores, Tobacco Shoppe) and supermarkets (Houchens Markets, IGA, Save-A-Lot, Mad Butcher and most recently Price Less Foods/Price Less IGA). In 2004, Houchens acquired Food Giant supermarkets, which operates stores under the Food Giant, Market Place and Piggly Wiggly name.[3]
In recent years, Houchens Industries has diversified greatly, with acquisitions of a Bowling Green-based construction company, as well as recycling, insurance, cigarette manufacturing, and warehousing.
Price Less Foods/Price Less IGA is the newest brand of stores to join Houchens.
Price Less Foods and Price Less IGA[edit]
Price Less Foods and Price Less IGA are a chain supermarkets located in Alabama, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana, Tennessee and Virginia. They operate on a cost-plus format. They price their products at the cost and then add 10 percent to the final cost at the checkout. They do not have rewards cards or weekly sales ads. The only difference between Price Less Foods and Price Less IGA is that "Foods" does not sell IGA brand products. They sell Best Choice and Always Save brands as well as other top national brands. They currently have 28 locations, and are expanding. [4]
History[edit]




Houchens first store


The company traces its beginnings to 1917, when founder Ervin Houchens opened his first store ("BG Wholesale") at the age of 19 in a shed in southern Kentucky. This shed, along with other historical structures, has been well preserved and is open to the public. He sold the company in 1983.[2] The current CEO, Jimmie Gibson, started with the company in 1965, as an accountant.[2]
In 2004, Houchens acquired Hitcents, an Internet marketing and development company founded by two high school students from Bowling Green, and now headquartered at Hitcents Park Plaza in Downtown Bowling Green.
In 2007, the company sold its Commonwealth Brands subsidiary - the fourth-largest cigarette producer in the United States - to the British company Imperial Tobacco Group PLC, for $1.9 billion. It had acquired the company from its founder Brad Kelley in 2001; it was the first time that Houchens had ever sold one of its acquisitions.[2]
Diversification continued in 2007 when Houchens announced that it would acquire Hilliard Lyons, a full-service stock broker and investment firm based in Louisville, from PNC Financial Services.[5] The sale was completed in March 2008.[6]
In January 2008, Houchens announced that it would acquire 14 convenience stores which sell Shell Oil products from Bowling Green businessman Jerry Browning. The stores are located in Bowling Green and surrounding towns.[7]
In April 2008, Buehler Foods of Jasper, Indiana, signed a letter of intent to sell the company to Houchens.[8]
In July 2008, Houchens acquired juice maker Tampico Beverages.[9]
In January 2010, White's Fresh Foods, in the Tri-Cities, Tennessee area sold their local grocery chain to Houchens.[10]
Other[edit]

The company has been completely owned by its employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) since 1988. Employees select members of the board of directors and vote on the sale of any substantial assets.[2]
Houchens Industries sponsors the annual Kentucky High School Athletic Association's Girls' "Sweet 16" Basketball Championship Tournament, held annually at WKU's E.A. Diddle Arena.
Houchens also contributes heavily to the community, most notably Western Kentucky University, even having acquiring naming rights to WKU's football home, Houchens Industries-L. T. Smith Stadium in Bowling Green.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Operations[edit]
The company is best known as a grocer, owning and operating convenience stores (Jr. Food Stores, Tobacco Shoppe) and supermarkets (Houchens Markets, IGA, Save-A-Lot, Mad Butcher and most recently Price Less Foods/Price Less IGA). In 2004, Houchens acquired Food Giant supermarkets, which operates stores under the Food Giant, Market Place and Piggly Wiggly name.[3]
In recent years, Houchens Industries has diversified greatly, with acquisitions of a Bowling Green-based construction company, as well as recycling, insurance, cigarette manufacturing, and warehousing.
Price Less Foods/Price Less IGA is the newest brand of stores to join Houchens.
Price Less Foods and Price Less IGA[edit]
Price Less Foods and Price Less IGA are a chain supermarkets located in Alabama, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana, Tennessee and Virginia. They operate on a cost-plus format. They price their products at the cost and then add 10 percent to the final cost at the checkout. They do not have rewards cards or weekly sales ads. The only difference between Price Less Foods and Price Less IGA is that "Foods" does not sell IGA brand products. They sell Best Choice and Always Save brands as well as other top national brands. They currently have 28 locations, and are expanding. [4]
History[edit]




Houchens first store


The company traces its beginnings to 1917, when founder Ervin Houchens opened his first store ("BG Wholesale") at the age of 19 in a shed in southern Kentucky. This shed, along with other historical structures, has been well preserved and is open to the public. He sold the company in 1983.[2] The current CEO, Jimmie Gibson, started with the company in 1965, as an accountant.[2]
In 2004, Houchens acquired Hitcents, an Internet marketing and development company founded by two high school students from Bowling Green, and now headquartered at Hitcents Park Plaza in Downtown Bowling Green.
In 2007, the company sold its Commonwealth Brands subsidiary - the fourth-largest cigarette producer in the United States - to the British company Imperial Tobacco Group PLC, for $1.9 billion. It had acquired the company from its founder Brad Kelley in 2001; it was the first time that Houchens had ever sold one of its acquisitions.[2]
Diversification continued in 2007 when Houchens announced that it would acquire Hilliard Lyons, a full-service stock broker and investment firm based in Louisville, from PNC Financial Services.[5] The sale was completed in March 2008.[6]
In January 2008, Houchens announced that it would acquire 14 convenience stores which sell Shell Oil products from Bowling Green businessman Jerry Browning. The stores are located in Bowling Green and surrounding towns.[7]
In April 2008, Buehler Foods of Jasper, Indiana, signed a letter of intent to sell the company to Houchens.[8]
In July 2008, Houchens acquired juice maker Tampico Beverages.[9]
In January 2010, White's Fresh Foods, in the Tri-Cities, Tennessee area sold their local grocery chain to Houchens.[10]
Other[edit]

The company has been completely owned by its employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) since 1988. Employees select members of the board of directors and vote on the sale of any substantial assets.[2]
Houchens Industries sponsors the annual Kentucky High School Athletic Association's Girls' "Sweet 16" Basketball Championship Tournament, held annually at WKU's E.A. Diddle Arena.
Houchens also contributes heavily to the community, most notably Western Kentucky University, even having acquiring naming rights to WKU's football home, Houchens Industries-L. T. Smith Stadium in Bowling Green.

Operations[edit]
The company is best known as a grocer, owning and operating convenience stores (Jr. Food Stores, Tobacco Shoppe) and supermarkets (Houchens Markets, IGA, Save-A-Lot, Mad Butcher and most recently Price Less Foods/Price Less IGA). In 2004, Houchens acquired Food Giant supermarkets, which operates stores under the Food Giant, Market Place and Piggly Wiggly name.[3]
In recent years, Houchens Industries has diversified greatly, with acquisitions of a Bowling Green-based construction company, as well as recycling, insurance, cigarette manufacturing, and warehousing.
Price Less Foods/Price Less IGA is the newest brand of stores to join Houchens.
Price Less Foods and Price Less IGA[edit]
Price Less Foods and Price Less IGA are a chain supermarkets located in Alabama, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana, Tennessee and Virginia. They operate on a cost-plus format. They price their products at the cost and then add 10 percent to the final cost at the checkout. They do not have rewards cards or weekly sales ads. The only difference between Price Less Foods and Price Less IGA is that "Foods" does not sell IGA brand products. They sell Best Choice and Always Save brands as well as other top national brands. They currently have 28 locations, and are expanding. [4]
History[edit]




Houchens first store


The company traces its beginnings to 1917, when founder Ervin Houchens opened his first store ("BG Wholesale") at the age of 19 in a shed in southern Kentucky. This shed, along with other historical structures, has been well preserved and is open to the public. He sold the company in 1983.[2] The current CEO, Jimmie Gibson, started with the company in 1965, as an accountant.[2]
In 2004, Houchens acquired Hitcents, an Internet marketing and development company founded by two high school students from Bowling Green, and now headquartered at Hitcents Park Plaza in Downtown Bowling Green.
In 2007, the company sold its Commonwealth Brands subsidiary - the fourth-largest cigarette producer in the United States - to the British company Imperial Tobacco Group PLC, for $1.9 billion. It had acquired the company from its founder Brad Kelley in 2001; it was the first time that Houchens had ever sold one of its acquisitions.[2]
Diversification continued in 2007 when Houchens announced that it would acquire Hilliard Lyons, a full-service stock broker and investment firm based in Louisville, from PNC Financial Services.[5] The sale was completed in March 2008.[6]
In January 2008, Houchens announced that it would acquire 14 convenience stores which sell Shell Oil products from Bowling Green businessman Jerry Browning. The stores are located in Bowling Green and surrounding towns.[7]
In April 2008, Buehler Foods of Jasper, Indiana, signed a letter of intent to sell the company to Houchens.[8]
In July 2008, Houchens acquired juice maker Tampico Beverages.[9]
In January 2010, White's Fresh Foods, in the Tri-Cities, Tennessee area sold their local grocery chain to Houchens.[10]
Other[edit]

The company has been completely owned by its employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) since 1988. Employees select members of the board of directors and vote on the sale of any substantial assets.[2]
Houchens Industries sponsors the annual Kentucky High School Athletic Association's Girls' "Sweet 16" Basketball Championship Tournament, held annually at WKU's E.A. Diddle Arena.
Houchens also contributes heavily to the community, most notably Western Kentucky University, even having acquiring naming rights to WKU's football home, Houchens Industries-L. T. Smith Stadium in Bowling Green.

Employee Retirement Plan
An Employee Stock Ownership Plan and Trust provides employees with a retirement through the company. Employees earn ESOP shares which are awarded annually by the trust to each qualifying employees' account. ESOP shares are subject to vesting requirements, and are held in that trust account until the employee retires, or leaves the company. An ESOP provides employees with an opportunity to contribute to the success of the retirement plan.The value of the ESOP shares is determined by the total appraised value of the company at the end of each fiscal year.ESOPs are regulated by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act [ERISA], a federal law that sets minimum standards for investment plans in private industry.

Operations[edit]
The company is best known as a grocer, owning and operating convenience stores (Jr. Food Stores, Tobacco Shoppe) and supermarkets (Houchens Markets, IGA, Save-A-Lot, Mad Butcher and most recently Price Less Foods/Price Less IGA). In 2004, Houchens acquired Food Giant supermarkets, which operates stores under the Food Giant, Market Place and Piggly Wiggly name.[3]
In recent years, Houchens Industries has diversified greatly, with acquisitions of a Bowling Green-based construction company, as well as recycling, insurance, cigarette manufacturing, and warehousing.
Price Less Foods/Price Less IGA is the newest brand of stores to join Houchens.
Price Less Foods and Price Less IGA[edit]
Price Less Foods and Price Less IGA are a chain supermarkets located in Alabama, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana, Tennessee and Virginia. They operate on a cost-plus format. They price their products at the cost and then add 10 percent to the final cost at the checkout. They do not have rewards cards or weekly sales ads. The only difference between Price Less Foods and Price Less IGA is that "Foods" does not sell IGA brand products. They sell Best Choice and Always Save brands as well as other top national brands. They currently have 28 locations, and are expanding. [4]
History[edit]




Houchens first store


The company traces its beginnings to 1917, when founder Ervin Houchens opened his first store ("BG Wholesale") at the age of 19 in a shed in southern Kentucky. This shed, along with other historical structures, has been well preserved and is open to the public. He sold the company in 1983.[2] The current CEO, Jimmie Gibson, started with the company in 1965, as an accountant.[2]
In 2004, Houchens acquired Hitcents, an Internet marketing and development company founded by two high school students from Bowling Green, and now headquartered at Hitcents Park Plaza in Downtown Bowling Green.
In 2007, the company sold its Commonwealth Brands subsidiary - the fourth-largest cigarette producer in the United States - to the British company Imperial Tobacco Group PLC, for $1.9 billion. It had acquired the company from its founder Brad Kelley in 2001; it was the first time that Houchens had ever sold one of its acquisitions.[2]
Diversification continued in 2007 when Houchens announced that it would acquire Hilliard Lyons, a full-service stock broker and investment firm based in Louisville, from PNC Financial Services.[5] The sale was completed in March 2008.[6]
In January 2008, Houchens announced that it would acquire 14 convenience stores which sell Shell Oil products from Bowling Green businessman Jerry Browning. The stores are located in Bowling Green and surrounding towns.[7]
In April 2008, Buehler Foods of Jasper, Indiana, signed a letter of intent to sell the company to Houchens.[8]
In July 2008, Houchens acquired juice maker Tampico Beverages.[9]
In January 2010, White's Fresh Foods, in the Tri-Cities, Tennessee area sold their local grocery chain to Houchens.[10]
Other[edit]

The company has been completely owned by its employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) since 1988. Employees select members of the board of directors and vote on the sale of any substantial assets.[2]
Houchens Industries sponsors the annual Kentucky High School Athletic Association's Girls' "Sweet 16" Basketball Championship Tournament, held annually at WKU's E.A. Diddle Arena.
Houchens also contributes heavily to the community, most notably Western Kentucky University, even having acquiring naming rights to WKU's football home, Houchens Industries-L. T. Smith Stadium in Bowling Green.

Operations[edit]
The company is best known as a grocer, owning and operating convenience stores (Jr. Food Stores, Tobacco Shoppe) and supermarkets (Houchens Markets, IGA, Save-A-Lot, Mad Butcher and most recently Price Less Foods/Price Less IGA). In 2004, Houchens acquired Food Giant supermarkets, which operates stores under the Food Giant, Market Place and Piggly Wiggly name.[3]
In recent years, Houchens Industries has diversified greatly, with acquisitions of a Bowling Green-based construction company, as well as recycling, insurance, cigarette manufacturing, and warehousing.
Price Less Foods/Price Less IGA is the newest brand of stores to join Houchens.
Price Less Foods and Price Less IGA[edit]
Price Less Foods and Price Less IGA are a chain supermarkets located in Alabama, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana, Tennessee and Virginia. They operate on a cost-plus format. They price their products at the cost and then add 10 percent to the final cost at the checkout. They do not have rewards cards or weekly sales ads. The only difference between Price Less Foods and Price Less IGA is that "Foods" does not sell IGA brand products. They sell Best Choice and Always Save brands as well as other top national brands. They currently have 28 locations, and are expanding. [4]
History[edit]




Houchens first store


The company traces its beginnings to 1917, when founder Ervin Houchens opened his first store ("BG Wholesale") at the age of 19 in a shed in southern Kentucky. This shed, along with other historical structures, has been well preserved and is open to the public. He sold the company in 1983.[2] The current CEO, Jimmie Gibson, started with the company in 1965, as an accountant.[2]
In 2004, Houchens acquired Hitcents, an Internet marketing and development company founded by two high school students from Bowling Green, and now headquartered at Hitcents Park Plaza in Downtown Bowling Green.
In 2007, the company sold its Commonwealth Brands subsidiary - the fourth-largest cigarette producer in the United States - to the British company Imperial Tobacco Group PLC, for $1.9 billion. It had acquired the company from its founder Brad Kelley in 2001; it was the first time that Houchens had ever sold one of its acquisitions.[2]
Diversification continued in 2007 when Houchens announced that it would acquire Hilliard Lyons, a full-service stock broker and investment firm based in Louisville, from PNC Financial Services.[5] The sale was completed in March 2008.[6]
In January 2008, Houchens announced that it would acquire 14 convenience stores which sell Shell Oil products from Bowling Green businessman Jerry Browning. The stores are located in Bowling Green and surrounding towns.[7]
In April 2008, Buehler Foods of Jasper, Indiana, signed a letter of intent to sell the company to Houchens.[8]
In July 2008, Houchens acquired juice maker Tampico Beverages.[9]
In January 2010, White's Fresh Foods, in the Tri-Cities, Tennessee area sold their local grocery chain to Houchens.[10]
Other[edit]

The company has been completely owned by its employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) since 1988. Employees select members of the board of directors and vote on the sale of any substantial assets.[2]
Houchens Industries sponsors the annual Kentucky High School Athletic Association's Girls' "Sweet 16" Basketball Championship Tournament, held annually at WKU's E.A. Diddle Arena.
Houchens also contributes heavily to the community, most notably Western Kentucky University, even having acquiring naming rights to WKU's football home, Houchens Industries-L. T. Smith Stadium in Bowling Green.

Our Story







It began in a 12-foot by 20-foot building.









Houchens Industries began in 1917 with the Houchens Food Group when Ervin G. Houchens opened his first grocery store in a rural area of Kentucky. The potential of the small store was recognized as Houchens took the lead in promoting his stores by utilizing the latest innovations and theories in grocery management, and also by purchasing businesses that correlated to the grocery industry.

"The principle of trying to do something for your employees, is the same principle we apply today."
Jimmie Gipson
Chairman/CEO





Nearly a century later and more than 18,000 employees corporate-wide, Houchens Industries is one of the largest employee-owned companies in the United States. We maintain a widely diverse portfolio of holdings to support company growth and prosperity for our employee owners.
