Zions Capital Advisors


























Our Mission
The Institutional Liquidity Management investment group offers individually customized money market and short-term, fixed-income asset management for institutional and corporate clients.
The primary mission of the Institutional Liquidity Management group is to provide maximum investment returns on clients' short-term assets (5 years and shorter), while strictly investing within each client's specific investment policies.
Institutional Liquidity Management
Preserve Principal, Individual portfolio assets are actively managed, using a buy and hold to maturity strategy, which preserves principal while generating incremental returns. A customized portfolio managed by the Institutional Liquidity Management group may include obligations of the U.S. Treasury, U.S. Government Agencies, money market instruments and top quality corporate securities. 
Provide Liquidity, Our Portfolio Managers use strategic yield curve analysis and active calendar management to optimize returns. The most critical component of maintaining your liquidity is our portfolio managersâ ongoing customization of your portfolio according to your changing needs. This is accomplished through our quarterly face-to-face account reviews.
Optimize Investment Returns, Only after preservation of principal and maintenance of ongoing liquidity have been met do our portfolio managers seek to optimize investment returns. Portfolios can be configured to provide either taxable or tax-exempt investment exposure, and may also be structured as a tax-advantaged portfolio. Our expertise places an emphasis on high current income inside of short-term investment horizons.
