ARTICLE I

 

GOVERNANCE


 



1.1            
Board of Directors
.



 



(a)             
Effective as of the Closing, the
board of directors of the Company (the “ Board
”) will increase the size of the Board to eleven (11) members
and the Board shall appoint Jonathan Sokoloff to the Board to serve
for a term expiring at the 2017 annual general meeting of the
Company’s shareholders or until his successor is duly elected
and qualified.  Upon his appointment to the Board, the Company
will promptly appoint Jonathan Sokoloff to serve as a member of the
Compensation Committee and the Nomination and Corporate Governance
Committee.









(b)             
For so long as the Approved Holders
beneficially own at least (i) thirty-five percent (35%) of the
total number of Convertible Preference Shares beneficially owned by
the Initial Shareholder as of the Closing (or the total number of
Common Shares (on an “as-converted basis”) beneficially
owned by the Initial Shareholder as of the Closing) (or a
combination thereof, without duplication) or (ii) five percent (5%)
of the total number of issued Common Shares (on an
“as-converted basis”), the Majority Approved Holders
shall have the right to designate one (1) designee to be nominated
by the Company for election (including in accordance with Section
6(c) of the Company’s Certificate of Designation of Series A
Convertible Preference Shares (the “ Series A
Certificate ”), if applicable), to the Board;
provided that such designee is (A) an employee or partner of
Leonard Green & Partners, L.P. and reasonably acceptable to the
Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or (B)
acceptable to the Company in its sole discretion.  At any time
that none of the thresholds set forth in this Section 1.1(b)
are satisfied, at the written request of the Board, the designee
shall promptly resign, and the Approved Holders shall cause the
designee promptly to resign, from the Board.



 



(c)             
For so long as the Majority Approved
Holders have the right to designate a director for nomination
pursuant to Section 1.1(b) , the Board shall include such
designee in the slate of nominees to be elected or appointed to the
Board at the next (and each applicable subsequent) annual or
special meeting of shareholders (including pursuant to Section 6(c)
of the Series A Certificate, if applicable), subject to such
designee’s satisfaction of all applicable requirements
regarding service as a director of the Company under Applicable Law
and NYSE rules (or the rules of the principal market on which the
Common Shares are then listed) regarding service as a director and
such other criteria and qualifications for service as a director
applicable to all directors of the Company as in effect on the date
thereof; provided , however , that in no event shall
any such designee’s relationship with the Approved Holders or
their Affiliates (or any other actual or potential lack of
independence resulting therefrom) be considered to disqualify such
designee from being a member of the Board pursuant to this
Section 1.1 .



 



(d)             
For so long as the Majority Approved
Holders have the right to designate a director for nomination
pursuant to Section 1.1(b) :



 



(i)             
the Company or the Board shall (A)
to the extent necessary cause the Board to have a vacancy to permit
such Person to be added as a member of the Board, (B) nominate such
Person for election to the Board in accordance with Section
1.1(c) and (C) recommend that the Company’s shareholders
vote in favor of the Person designated for nomination by the
Majority Approved Holders.  In the event of the death,
disability, resignation or removal of any Person designated by the
Majority Approved Holders as a member of the Board, subject to the
continuing satisfaction of the applicable threshold set forth in
Section 1.1(b) , the Majority Approved Holders may designate
a Person satisfying the criteria and qualifications set forth in
Section 1.1(c) to replace such Person, and the Company shall
cause such newly designated Person to fill such resulting
vacancy.  So long as any Person designated by the Majority
Approved Holders as a member of the Board is eligible to be so
designated in accordance with this Section 1.1, the Company
shall not take any action to remove such Person as a director
without Cause without the prior written consent of the Majority
Approved Holders;



- 2 -







(ii)             
The Company shall appoint Jonathan
Sokoloff (and any successors) to serve as a member of the
Compensation Committee and the Nomination and Corporate Governance
Committee, subject to meeting the applicable requirements for
service on each such committee as set forth in the New York Stock
Exchange Listed Company Manual, the Company’s corporate
governance guidelines applicable to all of the members of each such
committee and each such committee’s charter.  Such
designee shall be entitled to attend meetings of any committee of
the Board in a non-voting observer capacity;



 



(iii)             
the Majority Approved Holders’
designee for the Board shall be entitled to compensation consistent
with the compensation received by other members of the Board,
including any fees and equity awards, and reimbursement for
reasonable, out-of-pocket and documented expenses incurred in
attending meetings of the Board and its committees;



 



(iv)             
the Company shall provide the
Majority Approved Holders’ designee for the Board with the
same rights to indemnification and advancement and the same
director and officer insurance that it provides to the other
members of the Board; and



 



(v)             
the Company shall have the right to
implement reasonable recusal requirements applicable to all of the
meetings of its Board, and any committees thereof, to ensure that
no Confidential Information of the Company, its Subsidiaries or its
Affiliates is disclosed to a competitor, supplier or vendor, which
shall be reasonably acceptable to the Majority Approved
Holders.



 



(e)             
For so long as the Majority Approved
Holders have the right to designate a director for nomination
pursuant to Section 1.1(b) , the Majority Approved Holders
shall have the right to designate one (1) non-voting observer to
the Board, subject to such observer’s satisfaction of all
requirements regarding service as a board observer of the Company
under Applicable Law and NYSE rules (or the rules of the principal
market on which the Common Shares are then listed) regarding
service as a board observer of the Company; provided that
such observer is an employee or partner of Leonard Green &
Partners, L.P. and reasonably acceptable to the Company, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, or otherwise
acceptable to the Company in its sole discretion.  Such
observer to the Board shall have (i) the right to attend all Board
meetings and all committee meetings of the Board as an observer
(but whose presence shall not be counted towards the Board’s
quorum), (ii) the right to receive advance notice of each meeting,
including such meeting’s time and place, at the same time and
in the same manner as such notice is provided to the members of the
Board and (iii) the right to receive copies of all materials,
including notices, minutes, consents and regularly compiled
financial and operating data distributed to the members of the
Board at the same time as such materials are distributed to the
Board; provided , however , the Company shall have
the right to exclude such observer or withhold such information to
the extent such observer’s presence or receipt of such
information could reasonably be expected to result in the loss of
attorney-client privilege or any other privilege or a violation of
antitrust, export control or other Laws, breach of any
confidentiality agreement or any other adverse consequence to the
Company.  The initial Board observer shall be Jonathan
Seiffer.  The Board observer shall be bound by all
confidentiality, conflicts of interests, trading and disclosure and
other governance requirements of a director on the
Board.



 



(f)             
For so long as the Majority Approved
Holders have the right to designate a director for nomination
pursuant to Section 1.1(b) , the Company shall not, without
the prior written approval of the Majority Approved Holders,
increase the size of the Board in excess of eleven (11) or decrease
the size of the Board if such decrease would require the
resignation of the Majority Approved Holders’ designee from
the Board.



- 3 -







(g)             
If the Majority Approved Holders
have the right to designate a director for nomination pursuant to
Section 1.1(b) and the Majority Approved Holders notify the
Company in writing that the Majority Approved Holders elect or
agree not to designate a director for nomination, then the Majority
Approved Holders shall have the right to instead designate a second
non-voting observer to the Board with the rights set forth in
Section 1.1(e) .



 



1.2            
Voting .  For so long as the Majority Approved
Holders have the right to designate a director for nomination
pursuant to Section 1.1(b) , at each meeting of the
shareholders of the Company and at every postponement or
adjournment thereof, each Shareholder shall take such action as may
be required so that all of the Convertible Preference Shares or
Common Shares beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by such
Shareholder and entitled to vote at such meeting of shareholders
are voted (i) in favor of each director nominated and recommended
by the Company’s Nomination and Corporate Governance
Committee of the Board for election at any such meeting (provided
that such nomination is not inconsistent with Section 1.1(b)
), and against the removal of any director designated by the
Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board,
(ii) against any shareholder nominations for director which
are not approved and recommended by the Board for election at any
such meeting, (iii) in favor of the Company’s
“say-on-pay” proposal and any proposal by the Company
relating to equity compensation that has been approved by the
Compensation Committee of the Board, (iv) in favor of the
Company’s proposal for ratification of the appointment of the
Company’s independent registered public accounting firm and
(v) in accordance with the recommendation of the Board with respect
to any proposed business combination between the Company and any
other Person, but no Shareholder shall be under any obligation to
vote in the same manner as recommended by the Board or in any other
manner, other than in its sole discretion, with respect to any
other matter.

the offerees or transferees, the price per security, and all of the
other material terms and conditions of such issuance (the “
Preemptive Rights Offer Notice ”).  Each
Shareholder may, by irrevocable written notice to the Company (a
“ Preemptive Rights Acceptance Notice ”)
delivered no later than ten (10) days after delivery of such
Company notice, commit itself to purchase (or designate an
Affiliate thereof to purchase) up to such number of securities as
necessary to maintain such Shareholder’s Percentage Ownership
of the Company as of immediately prior to such Preemptive Rights
Issuance, which number shall be specified by such Shareholder in
such Preemptive Rights Acceptance Notice (which amount shall not
exceed the number of securities necessary to maintain the
Shareholder’s Percentage Ownership of the Company as of
immediately prior to such Preemptive Rights Issuance), on the same
terms and conditions as such Preemptive Rights Issuance (it being
understood and agreed that the price per security that such
Shareholder shall pay shall be the same as the price per security
set forth in the Preemptive Rights Offer Notice).  If a
Shareholder exercises its preemptive rights hereunder with respect
to such Preemptive Rights Issuance, the Company shall issue to such
Shareholder (or its designated Affiliates) the number of securities
specified in such Preemptive Rights Acceptance Notice in accordance
with the terms of the issuance but in no event earlier than twenty
(20) days after delivery of the Preemptive Rights Offer
Notice.  For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that the
issuance of New Issue Securities in a Preemptive Rights Issuance
involves the purchase of a package of securities that includes New
Issue Securities and other securities in the same Preemptive Rights
Issuance, each Shareholder shall only have the right to acquire its
applicable pro rata portion of such other securities, together with
its applicable pro rata portion of such New Issue Securities, in
the same manner described above (as to amount, price and other
terms).  If the Shareholders exercise their right to purchase
under this Section 2.1 with respect to less than their pro
rata portion of the Preemptive Rights Issuance proposed to be
issued and sold, the Company shall have ninety (90) days thereafter
to sell any or all of the remaining New Issue Securities (i.e.,
those not to be sold to a Shareholder), upon terms and conditions
no less favorable to the Company, and no more favorable to the
purchasers of such New Issue Securities, than those set forth in
the Preemptive Rights Offer Notice. In the event the Company has
not sold such New Issue Securities within such ninety (90)-day
period, the Company shall not thereafter issue or sell any New
Issue Securities without first offering such securities to the
Shareholders in the manner provided in this Section 2.1. The
purchase of New Issue Securities by the Shareholders pursuant to
this Section 2.1 shall be consummated simultaneously with
the closing of the sale of the New Issue Securities set forth in
the Preemptive Rights Offer Notice, but in no event prior to twenty
(20) days after the submission of the Preemptive Rights Offer
Notice to each Shareholder.



 



(c)             
The election by a Shareholder not to
exercise its preemptive rights hereunder in any one instance shall
not affect its right as to any future Preemptive Rights
Issuances.



 



(d)             
Notwithstanding anything contained
in this Section 2.1, to the extent a Preemptive Rights
Issuance is being made only to investors that are “accredited
investors” within the meaning of Rule 501 under Regulation D
promulgated under the Securities Act, then, at the option of the
Board, in its sole discretion, any Shareholder may be excluded from
the offer to purchase any securities pursuant to this
Section 2.1 and shall have no rights under this
Section 2.1 with respect to such Preemptive Rights Issuance
to the extent it is not an “accredited
investor”.



- 5 -







(e)             
If the Board determines in good
faith that circumstances require the Company to effect a Preemptive
Rights Issuance without first complying with the terms set forth in
this Section 2.1, the Company shall be permitted to do so
without complying with the terms set forth in this Section
2.1 in connection with such Preemptive Rights Issuance;
provided that as promptly as practicable, but in any event
within thirty (30) days, following such Preemptive Rights Issuance,
the Company permits each Shareholder to purchase its proportionate
amount of the applicable securities, taking into account the
securities previously issued in such Preemptive Rights Issuance, in
the manner contemplated by this Section 2.1.



 



(f)             
Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, the Company shall not be required to
issue any securities pursuant to this Section 2.1, and may
modify the voting or other rights of such securities, in each case
to the extent that the issuance of such securities to a Shareholder
would constitute noncompliance with NYSE rules (or the rules of the
principal market on which the Common Shares is then listed)
regarding approval by shareholders or would require such
approval.



 



2.2            
Information Rights
.

become available but no later than the earlier of (1) the time they
are provided to the Board and (2) fifteen (15) days after the end
of each month) financial statements, (B) quarterly (as soon as
reasonably practicable after they become available but no later
than forty-five (45) days after the end of each of the first three
quarters of each fiscal year of the Company) financial statements;

with the SEC and (C) audited (by a nationally recognized accounting
firm) annual (as soon as reasonably practicable after they become
available but no later than ninety (90) days after the end of each
fiscal year of the Company) financial statements; provided
that this requirement shall be deemed to have been satisfied if on
or prior to such date, the Company files its annual report on Form
10-K for the applicable fiscal year with the SEC, in each case,
prepared in accordance with GAAP as in effect from time to time,
which statements shall include the consolidated balance sheets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries and the related consolidated
statements of income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows and
(ii) subject to reasonable restrictions imposed by the Company to
comply with antitrust, export control and other Laws and to avoid

inspect any of the properties of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, including its and their books of accounting and other

Section 1.1(b) , subject to Section 5.4, the Company
shall provide to the Approved Holders copies of all material
written information that is provided to the Board at substantially
the same time at which such information is first delivered or
otherwise made available in writing to the Board; provided ,
however , that the Company shall not be required to provide
information to the extent it could reasonably be expected to result
in the loss of privilege or a violation of antitrust, export
control or other Laws.



- 6 -







(c)             
Nothing herein shall require the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to disclose any information to
the extent (i) prohibited by Applicable Law or (ii) that such
disclosure would reasonably be expected to cause a violation of any
agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party or would cause a risk of loss of privilege to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries ( provided that the Company shall
use reasonable best efforts to make appropriate substitute
arrangements under circumstances where the restrictions in clauses
(i) and/or (ii) apply).



 



(d)             
Notwithstanding anything else in
this Agreement and without limiting the foregoing, the Approved
Holders shall implement reasonable firewalls and confidentiality
screens, which extend to such of the Approved Holders and their
Affiliates, employees, directors, partners and members as is
reasonably necessary to ensure that no Confidential Information of
the Company, its Subsidiaries or its Affiliates is disclosed to,
shared with, or used by or in connection with Other Investments of
the Purchaser Group, and which shall be reasonably acceptable to
the Company.  The Company acknowledges and agrees that
employees of the Initial Shareholder or its Affiliates serve as
directors of portfolio companies of the Initial Shareholder or its
Affiliates, and such portfolio companies shall not be deemed to
have received or used Confidential Information solely due to the
