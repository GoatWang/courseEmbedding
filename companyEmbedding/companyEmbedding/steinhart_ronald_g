In the past, Ron has served as chairman of the Dallas Citizens Council, chairman
of the Board of Trustees of the Teacher Retirement System of Texas, chairman of
the Housing Authority of the City of Dallas, president of the Dallas Assembly,
president of the 500, Inc., chairman of the United Way of Metropolitan Dallas,

member of the Executive Committee and Board of Trustees, co-chairman of two
fundraising campaigns, and president of the foundation.
Ron is the first American citizen in his family, his parents Werner and Marga
having escaped the Holocaust in late 1938, though his paternal grandparents,
uncle, aunt, and two cousins perished. In 2002, President George W. Bush appointed Ron to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Council for a five year

In 2005, Governor Rick Perry created the Texas Tax Reform Commission to make
recommendations for financing Texas’s public schools and appointed Ron to the

and was a member of the Texas Cowboys and Friar Society. He earned a BBA in
accounting in 1962, and a MBA in finance the following year.
Ron developed his entrepreneurial skills early, striking a deal with the
Beaumont Coca-Cola distributor to sell Cokes door to door from his wagon at the
young age of 8. After leaving the University, Ron learned the ropes of the
financial world with Ray Torgerson traveling the Southwest for the Walter Heller
Company. In 1965, he began work with a small Dallas bank, and married Phyllis
Yonet, whom he first met while at UT. Between 1969 and 1980, Ron teamed with
investors to charter or purchase six banks. In 1980, he joined InterFirst
Corporation, the largest bank in Texas at the time, and became President a year
later.
In 1988, at the height of the Texas real estate bust, Ron led a group of
investors to establish Deposit Guaranty Bank, which became Team Bank after a
number of acquisitions, eventually merging with Bank One. By 1996, Ron was CEO
of Bank One Corporation’s Commercial Banking Group and a member of the
corporation’s Management Committee until his retirement in 2000.
Ron is a Certified Public Accountant (retired) and presently serves as a
director of Animal Health International, Texas Industries, Penske Automotive
Group, and a trustee of MFS/Compass Group of mutual funds. He and his wife
Phyllis have three sons and five grandchildren.
