Overview :: Takung Art Co., Ltd. (TKAT)




























 










































Home
About














 


Overview
Based in Hong Kong, Takung Art Company Ltd. provides a secure and easy way for art collectors and investors to acquire shared ownership in Asian and other fine art - including paintings, calligraphies, jewelry and precious gems - and participate in the booming international art market without fear of price manipulation and forgery.
The ability to trade these valuable assets on Takung's proprietary online trading platform has attracted a significant number of fine art investors - including many ordinary people without substantial financial resources. This novel platform significantly expands the number of interactions between sellers and buyers of fine art far beyond those generated by art galleries and auction houses alone.
For providing this unique service, Takung Art Company earns multiple streams of revenue, including listing fees, trading commissions, management fees and authorized agent fees.
Takung's business model is to continually add to its fine art listings by offering collectors units in carefully selected items. First, an artwork - either an individual piece or portfolio of several pieces - is presented to Takung by an authorized agent, who helps get the artwork professionally appraised. After making its own assessment, if Takung believes it is clearly marketable and will likely appreciate near-term, the company will - after receiving all offering documents - list the artwork on its site and divide it into equal ownership units based on its appraised value. For this listing the artwork's owner or the offering agent pay Takung a one-time offering fee of 22.5 to 48 percent of the artwork's offering price and a refundable listing deposit of roughly 20 percent of the offering price. In addition, Takung charges trading commissions for the online purchase and sale of artwork units, as well as management fees covering the insurance, storage, and transportation for artwork. Takung may also receive substantial annual fees from those agents authorized to list products on the company's platform.
Traders utilize our platform through a client app available for download from the company's commercial website. Currently, most of our traders are located in mainland China. To expand our number of traders, Takung has employed various online promotion strategies and also entered into an agreement with an arts marketing agency that has a broad network of both amateur and professional art traders and dealers. In July 2016, the company initiated its first major expansion of operations outside of China when it introduced the trading platform to residents of Russia, Mongolia, Australia and New Zealand.
As of June 30, 2017, Takung had 210 art listings trading on our platform, with an aggregate initial listing value of US$51.9 million. Most of the listed pieces and portfolios have traded actively and shown significant appreciation since their introduction on the site. The purchase and sale of ownership units of Takung’s listed artwork generated a total transaction value of US$4.74 billion in the first quarter of 2017 versus US$812.79 million transacted in the comparable year-ago period.
Each of our artwork listings will remain intact for ten years, after which it will be sold and the proceeds paid to the unit holders.
Takung was incorporated in late 2012 and went public in October 2014.

	TAKUNG REPORTS $1.90 BILLION IN ONLINE
	TRADING TRANSACTIONS

	AND ADDS NINE NEW LISTINGS IN MARCH 2017



	 


	Company Expects to Expand Product Offerings
	in 2017


	 


	Hong Kong, April 11, 2017 -- Takung Art Co., Ltd. (

	NYSE:TKAT

	),
	an online platform for acquiring shared ownership units in Asian and other fine art, jewelry and precious gems, today said it processed
	transactions totaling US$1.90 billion in the 23-day trading month of March 2017, a 494 percent increase on total transactions of
	US$319.36 million recorded in the 21-day trading month of March 2016.


	 


	Total trading transaction value in the first quarter of 2017
	was US$4.74 billion, an increase of 483 percent on total transactions of US$812.79 million in the like year-ago period.


	 


	Takung added nine new listings in March 2017, bringing the total
	number of artworks trading on its platform to 199.


	 


	As reported in the company’s 2016 annual report, and noted
	in its recent conference call to investors, the platform’s rising transaction volume and strong liquidity have helped the
	company maximize total artwork listings. This, in turn, maximizes both listing and management fees, which together contributed
	two-thirds of Takung’s revenue in 2016.


	 


	“With a well-established and active trading platform,”
	said CEO Di Xiao, “we expect the Takung program to expand in 2017 to include even more emerging artists and artwork, as well
	as non-art-related product offerings for which we believe there will be considerable interest among our traders. Our focus is always
	to provide trading and ownership opportunities to our target audience, China’s burgeoning middle class.”


	 


	Since December 2013, Takung has provided a way for art collectors
	and investors to buy and sell ownership units in valuable paintings, calligraphies, jewelry and precious gems. Takung’s unique
	approach is to divide selected artwork into equal ownership units based on its appraised value. Traders can then buy and sell these
	units online via a client app available for download from the company’s commercial website. While most of the traders on
	the platform are currently located in mainland China, Takung announced last year an expansion of operations

	to
	increase its trader base with residents of Russia, Mongolia, Australia and New Zealand

	.


	 


	Currently there are two types of listings on the Takung site
	- an individual artwork or a portfolio of several pieces. Most of the listed artworks trade actively and have shown significant
	appreciation following their initial sale and introduction on the site. Each listing - with its initial offering price and current
	price and value - can be found on Takung’s corporate website at


	http://www.takungart.com/portfolio/listed-artwork


	.

Furthermore, the Company is focusing on increasing its daily unit trading volume and getting a competitive head-start on the shared ownership paradigm. Takung Art is suited to a particular niche of investors. As noted by Paramount Investment Research: "This trading platform makes expensive artwork investment more accessible to investors with less financial resources." (Seeking Alpha - Jun. 9, 2016) Expanding its trading platform For its first major expansion of operations outside of China, Takung Art introduced its platform for trading to residents of Russia, Mongolia, Australia and New Zealand, this past July. Chief Executive Mr. Di Xiao said he believes this expansion could add new registrants and diversify the mix of listings on the Company's trading platform, and, in time, produce higher trading commission and listing fee revenue.
 Takung Art has entered into a strategic cooperation agreement with two art-related establishments. This is to add the valuable gemstone southern red agate to Takung's art portfolio. These two organizations include: Nanhong Culture Professional Committee of the China Culture Information Association: A committee approved by the Ministry of Civil Affairs of China. Its function includes promoting southern red agate culture through conducting seminars, appraisals, assessments and exhibitions across China. Wenhua Dagong (Hong Kong) Culture Communication Co., Ltd: The authorized agent for owners of southern red agate to undergo listing on Takung Art's online trading platform. Southern red agate is coveted by collectors and aficionados for its first-rate color and low volume. (The Largest Southern Red Agate Market In China - June 5, 2015) The online art industry - Takung's competition The trading, buying, and selling of art online attracts the big online players as well. Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are direct competitors to Takung Art. Think of it, you can even buy various art, jewelry and such at Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY). It seems this market is divided among large, medium, small, and very small providers offering a plethora of inventive products, thus a very competitive arena. An investor cannot discount this when investigating Takung Art - as art abounds online for consumers. In 2015, Amazon attained more than $100 billion in annual sales. Alibaba, the globe's largest retail commerce company, had revenue in Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 of US$15,686 million. This represents an increase of 33% versus FY 2015. This growth was led by its China commerce retail business - a market that Takung art is tapping into as well. Etsy, for 2015, had revenue of $273 Million. Why Takung Art has potential Takung Art is productively driving revenue and growing its net income - strong underpinnings for sustainable and successful operations going forward. Here's a look at its recent numbers for these:
 High Margin Revenue For Q3 2016, ended September 30, Takung Art's revenue was $5,742,209. This represents a 112% improvement on revenue of $2,706,388 in Q3 of 2015. For the first nine months of 2016 ended September 30, revenue was $14,214,252. This represents a 189% improvement on revenue of $4,917,368 in the same period the year prior. Takung Art's quarterly revenue growth, year over year is 400.30%. 

 Net Income Growth The Company's net income for Q3 2016 was $2,451,737, or $.23 per share. This is 114% higher than the net income of $1,144,073, or $.12 per share, reported for Q3 of 2015. Net income for the first three quarters of 2016 was $4,664,632, or $.44 per share. This is 172% higher than the net income of $1,715,344, or $.18 per share, reported for the first three quarters of last year. The Company's most recent trading results Takung Art processed transactions totaling US$1.10 billion in the 14-day trading month of October 2016. This represents a 278% increase on total transactions of US$291.05 million recorded in the 16-day trading month of October 2015. The purchase and sale of ownership units of Takung's listed artwork produced US$6.01 billion during the first ten months of calendar/fiscal 2016. This is in comparison to US$1.57 billion transacted in the comparable 2015 period. This transaction growth is a positive for investors to consider when performing due diligence on an alternative investment vehicle as it shows compelling interest in the Company's offerings on its platform (Takung Art - Listed Pieces). Transaction growth is the seed that eventually blooms into profit growth in an efficiently operated company. Profit Margin Takung Art's profit growth for Q3 2016 was mainly because of quarterly growth in listing fees and management fee revenue. The Company's profit margin is 40.22%. Its operating margin for the trailing twelve months is 52.54%.
 As a profitability ratio, profit margin is important to consider as it quantifies what percentage of sales is made up of net income. A business can cut costs to improve this ratio or grow revenues. Takung Art has grown its revenue. However, the Company had quarter-over-quarter increases of $861,983 in general and administrative expenses and $536,117 in selling expenses, so it must get a handle on these increases to facilitate even greater profits. Revenue/Employee & Income/Employee Takung Art is operating relatively efficiently with revenue/employee of $354,248 and income/employee of $169,878. Amazon's revenue/employee is $463,631. Its income/employee is $2,582. Alibaba's revenue/employee is $436,364. Its income/employee is a healthy $308,302. Etsy's revenue/employee is $333,943, and its income/employee is - (66,011). Return on Assets (ROA) Takung Art's ROA for the trailing twelve months is 21.17%. Alibaba's ROA for the trailing twelve months is 5.72%. Amazon's ROA for the trailing twelve months is 3.97%. Etsy's ROA for the trailing twelve months is 2.72%. Consider ROA when studying a stock for possible purchase because it's an indicator of how well a business is earning a return on its asset investments. It quantifies the net income generated by total assets. 

 Return on Equity (ROE) Takung Art's ROE for the trailing twelve months is 81.85%. Alibaba's ROE for the trailing twelve months is 12.48%. Amazon's ROE for the trailing twelve months is 13.93%. Etsy's ROE for the trailing twelve months is - (3.82). As a profitability measure, it calculates how well a business is doing in producing profits from investments by its shareholders. Is the business efficiently using shareholder funds to produce profits?
 Levered free cash flow Takung Art's levered free cash flow for the trailing twelve months is 7.58 Million. Alibaba's is 6.46 Billion. Amazon's levered free cash flow for the trailing twelve months is 8.46 Billion. Etsy's is - (19.59 Million). I've mentioned levered free cash flow many times. I always consider this financial metric because it tells me how much money a business has after it has met its financial commitments. Positive levered free cash flow enables a company to reinvest in its business. It also tells me that company management has the funds to institute, continue or increase dividends. As a dividend investor, primarily, I always consider levered free cash flow. So, Takung Art's positive here, albeit a small player versus the Alibaba and Amazon giants. Two challenges in art investing Discretionary income Investors with less financial resources depend on discretionary income when wanting to make purchases of art. The art marketplace is competitive and volatile in economic upswings. In these uncertain economic times, art companies such as Takung Art must make art purchasing as affordable as possible, while working to maintain and grow sales and profit margins. This is easier said than accomplished and demands creative marketing and a good product mix. Appraisal and valuation The sector is dependent on first-rate appraising and valuation of artwork. This ensures an entity's credibility with the art buying community. From a profitability standpoint, proper appraisal and valuation ensures a company sets a proper market value on the art it offers for sale. This can make the difference between healthy profits or eroding losses The black market The New York Times noted that, "Billions of dollars' worth of art goes missing every year." (What Is the Value of Stolen Art? - NY Times - November 13, 2013) Therefore, this is billions lost for legitimate companies duking it out in bricks and mortar and online venues. It's also something that makes people sometimes wary of buying art, unless they can actually validate an art piece's true worth and authenticity. Much of this art ends up in the hands of unprincipled and dishonest art dealers - a challenge to honest players in the industry.
 Conclusion Takung Art has much going for it as it navigates the online artwork marketplace. It is aggressive in growing market penetration. The Company recently obtained loans for US$5.8 Million to build HKD (Hong Kong Dollar) reserves to support ongoing expansion of trading in China. The Company has a strong balance sheet. At September 30, 2016, Takung Art's cash and cash equivalents totaled $16,831,035. This represents an increase from $10,769,456 on December 31, 2015. Furthermore, the Company has robust demand for its artwork as evidenced by its growing sales and processed transactions. As a foray into the art world, it's a unique investment opportunity for investors willing to ride the gyrations of the artsy art sector. For now, though, I'll wait to see if Takung Art institutes a dividend. However, they are a company I'm currently keeping an eye on in the small cap space.

(NYSE MKT: TKAT), an online platform for acquiring shared ownership units in Asian and other fine art, jewelry and precious gems, today said it processed transactions totaling US$1.90 billion in the 23-day trading month of March 2017, a 494 percent increase on total transactions of US$319.36 million recorded in the 21-day trading month of March 2016.Total trading transaction value in the first quarter of 2017 was US$4.74 billion, an increase of 483 percent on total transactions of US$812.79 million in the like year-ago period.Takung added nine new listings in March 2017, bringing the total number of artworks trading on its platform to 199.As reported in the company's 2016 annual report, and noted in its recent conference call to investors, the platform's rising transaction volume and strong liquidity have helped the company maximize total artwork listings. This, in turn, maximizes both listing and management fees, which together contributed two-thirds of Takung's revenue in 2016."With a well-established and active trading platform," said CEO Di Xiao, "we expect the Takung program to expand in 2017 to include even more emerging artists and artwork, as well as non-art-related product offerings for which we believe there will be considerable interest among our traders. Our focus is always to provide trading and ownership opportunities to our target audience, China's burgeoning middle class."Since December 2013, Takung has provided a way for art collectors and investors to buy and sell ownership units in valuable paintings, calligraphies, jewelry and precious gems. Takung's unique approach is to divide selected artwork into equal ownership units based on its appraised value. Traders can then buy and sell these units online via a client app available for download from the company's commercial website. While most of the traders on the platform are currently located in mainland China, Takung announced last year an expansion of operations to increase its trader base with residents of Russia, Mongolia, Australia and New Zealand.Currently there are two types of listings on the Takung site - an individual artwork or a portfolio of several pieces. Most of the listed artworks trade actively and have shown significant appreciation following their initial sale and introduction on the site. Each listing - with its initial offering price and current price and value - can be found on Takung's corporate website at http://www.takungart.com/portfolio/listed-artwork.ABOUT TAKUNG ART CO., LTD: www.takungart.comBased in Hong Kong, Takung Art Co., Ltd. is an online trading platform for acquiring shared ownership in Asian and other fine art, jewelry and precious gems. This proprietary platform allows collectors and investors - including those with modest financial resources -- to buy and sell units of these assets and participate in the booming Asian art market. The company's shared-ownership business model significantly expands the number of interactions between sellers and buyers of fine art far beyond those generated by art galleries and auction houses alone.Takung operates its online trading platform via three wholly-owned subsidiaries, Hong Kong Takung Assets and Equity of Artworks Exchange Co.
