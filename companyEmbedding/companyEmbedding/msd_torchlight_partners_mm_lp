Mission Statement



The purpose of MSD Capital is to make investments that consistently generate superior absolute risk-adjusted returns over the long-term.



The purpose of MSD Capital is to make investments that consistently generate superior absolute risk-adjusted returns over the long-term.  We evaluate investment opportunities by utilizing multi-disciplinary frameworks of analysis to generate thoughtful and robust investment theses.  We are motivated by an intense curiosity to grasp the underlying truths that govern financial markets and economic behavior.  We note that these truths may be contrary to the consensus view, but we believe that our discipline as independent thinkers will allow us to identify these truths and secure long-term success.   Throughout the organization, we share a common desire to be the best at what we do, and we believe this never-ending pursuit of excellence has intrinsic value independent of any economic benefit that we may receive.  Finally and most importantly, we conduct all business with the highest level of integrity, honesty and discipline.




Business Principles




Our people are the key to our success. We recruit only world-class individuals who we would enjoy working with and who understand and accept our core values and beliefs.
Our primary asset is our reputation. Any actions we take with respect to our capital or business partners should be heavily influenced by their effect on our reputation. Investing our reputation is as important as investing our capital.
Our performance on a quarterly or annual basis, while important, will not be given priority over our long-term goals.
We conduct our business with the highest level of integrity and honesty. Deals should be fair to our partners and should not favor us at their expense. We will be forthright with those we deal with and expect the same in return. We work with prospective partners to develop a mutual understanding, appreciation and respect for our approach to investing. If such an understanding cannot be achieved, we will not become partners.
The best decision for Michael Dell and his family is the best decision for MSD Capital.
Much of the work that we do is of highly confidential nature, and we do everything that we possibly can to protect that information and maintain and respect the privacy of the firm.
Individual opportunity and reward is based on merit. Our vision places large demands on each of us. Those demands can become frustrating, so we should try to make sure that our jobs are fun, the office is friendly and the rewards for loyal employees are large. We work with passion, commitment and enthusiasm.
We understand and value the importance of technology and are constantly looking for ways to utilize technology to make MSD more efficient and productive.
Control over investment decisions is essential to our style of doing business. We will always do what we believe is right, regardless of what conventional wisdom might indicate.
In considering potential investments, we encourage an environment that fosters open debate, values contrary opinions and tolerates honest mistakes.
We seek out excellence in all we undertake. We should never be satisfied with the status quo. Instead, we should constantly seek to improve in all our endeavors.
We must continually remind ourselves of our limitations and dedicate ourselves to the avoidance of hubris. If our methodologies are valid and our people are talented, hubris is one of the only things that can make us fail.




 

Risk Management


We consider investment risk principally in terms of the potential for permanent loss of invested capital.


A thorough understanding of the risks for each investment that we make is central to our process. We strive only to make investments that meet our strict risk / reward criteria. This disciplined investment approach is a fundamental part of our firm’s method of managing risk.

MSD Capital - Teams






















































Teams




MSD Capital utilizes a multi-disciplinary investment strategy focused on maximizing long-term capital appreciation by making investments across the globe in the debt and equity of public and private companies, real estate and other asset classes.*
*If you intended to search for information relating to the Registered Investment Adviser MSD Partners, L.P. or MSD Partners’ MSD Private Capital Group, please use the following links to be redirected to their respective websites: www.msdpartners.com and www.msdprivatecapital.com.



Real Estate



MSD Real Estate pursues a value-oriented investment strategy that seeks attractive risk-adjusted returns, generally in “forever” real estate with significant barriers to entry.
The team invests across most real estate asset classes, and is open to investing in existing properties, value-added assets and ground-up development opportunities, as well as operating companies where real estate expertise and/or relationships can add value. It makes both equity and debt investments. MSD Real Estate looks for opportunities to create value through:
Direct ownership and aggressive asset management
Joint ventures with best-in-class sponsors seeking to grow their asset base
Debt investments
The team prefers situations where being a partner with MSD Capital brings value to the operating partners with whom it invests.



PUBLIC, PRIVATE & SPECIALSITUATION INVESTMENTS



MSD Capital has several investment teams which focus on public, private and special situations debt and equity investments.
These teams make concentrated and opportunistic investments with a focus on mispriced opportunities based on a deep understanding of each investment’s earnings potential over time. A core differentiating feature of each team is to use the flexible and longer term nature of its capital base to find investment opportunities which fewer competitors can feasibly pursue.  They are not restricted by where an investment is in the capital structure, its geographic exposure, or how it is transacted (e.g. publicly traded or privately negotiated). Each team seeks out opportunities where it can:
Develop a deep understanding of the future cash flows
Understand and quantify the risks
Acquire at valuations below the intrinsic value; which we derive through our thorough investment process



PARTNERSHIP INVESTMENTS GROUP



The Partnership Investments Group invests primarily in a select number of third-party funds for the benefit of Dell family charitable entities, including the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation.
The team applies a long-term, fundamentally-oriented view towards constructing and managing the portfolio which is primarily invested with third party managers. 
	    		It seeks to compound superior risk-adjusted returns over time by concentrating capital with outstanding managers who are interested in building economically aligned, long-term relationships with us. The team welcomes the chance to review new fund investment opportunities. Strategies that it commonly finds to be of interest include the following:
Value-oriented equity long/short (and long-biased) funds that invest based on extensive fundamental research
Fundamentally-oriented event-driven/distressed or special situation funds
Multi-strategy funds that may be comprised of several of these types of strategies
Given the team’s long-term outlook, it is not averse to funds with side pockets or longer lock-ups. It will generally consider funds that focus on any geography
Strategies that tend not to be a fit include: global macro, highly levered fixed-income arbitrage, CTAs or managed futures strategies as well as quantitative funds. Additionally, the team does not invest in new private equity, venture capital or real estate funds

MSD Partners - Equities Strategy
























































Equities



Overview





About
Approach
Philosophy
Investment Objective



ABOUT
The MSD Torchlight Team employs a fundamental, value-based philosophy that is concentrated, opportunistic and equity-focused.  We typically own 8-12 investments at a time.


APPROACH
The Torchlight Team’s approach is idiosyncratic by nature, primarily investing in equities but with the flexibility to invest across industries, capital structures and asset classes.  We generally deploy capital based on our assessment of the most compelling opportunities existing in our investment universe at a given time.  While the Team invests primarily in the U.S., we search for opportunities globally and contrast risk and reward across markets, geographies and seemingly unrelated securities.  We view cash as our “default investment” and generally do not employ leverage.  While the Team has always focused on the business characteristics, valuation, competitive advantages and management abilities of individual companies and securities, we also pursue limited macro investing strategies to hedge macroeconomic risk.


PHILOSOPHY
The Team believes short-term volatility is not a “loss”; permanent intrinsic value impairment is.  We are grounded in principles of absolute, not relative, value and believe long-term free cash flow generation is the ultimate source of business worth.


INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE
The Team generally owns interests in a very limited number of companies and securities that we hope will compound in value over many years. We seek to maximize long-term appreciation with an intense focus on risk management and margin of safety.







Unique Attributes







1 of 3





Long-term Outlook
Our longer-term orientation allows us to hold investments through periods of volatility and to enjoy the potential benefits of compounding.





Approach
Our flexible and opportunistic mandate, absolute value discipline, macro awareness, eclectic style and substantial investment by our portfolio management team, positions the Team to pursue capital appreciation with prudent risk and a margin of safety.





Process
The Torchlight Team has worked together for many years and has developed a consistent, rigorous and highly demanding analytical process. Intellectual honesty, continuous questioning and “constructive paranoia” are among our core principles.

Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 3 of 68 PageID: 3
-1- Plaintiffs MSD Torchlight Partners, L.P. and MSD Torchlight Partners (MM), L.P. 
(collectively, “Plaintiffs”) through their undersigned attorneys, by way of this Complaint and 
Jury Demand, for their federal securities claims against Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, 
Inc. (“Valeant” or the “Company”), J. Michael Pearson (“Pearson”), and Howard B. Schiller 
(“Schiller” and, collectively with Valeant and Pearson, “Defendants”), allege the following upon 
personal knowledge as to themselves and their own acts, and upon information and belief as to 
all other matters.
1

Plaintiffs’ information and belief is based on, among other things, an investigation by 
their attorneys, which investigation includes a review and analysis of: Valeant’s public filings 
with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”); Valeant conference and 
earnings call transcripts; investor presentations drafted by Valeant; press releases and public 
statements issued by Valeant and its representatives; congressional testimony of Pearson and 
Schiller; documents produced to congressional committees by Valeant; court filings concerning 
Philidor RX Services, LLC (“Philidor”) and R&O Pharmacy (“R&O”); analyst reports 
concerning Valeant; media reports concerning Valeant; and publicly available data relating to the 
prices and trading volumes of Valeant securities. 
Many of the facts supporting the allegations contained herein are known only to 
Defendants or are exclusively within their custody and/or control. Plaintiffs believe that further 
substantial evidentiary support will exist for the allegations in this Complaint after a reasonable 
opportunity for discovery. 

1
L. Civ. R. 10.1 Statement: Plaintiffs are investment funds whose investment adviser has its principal place of 
business at 645 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10022; Defendant Valeant has its U.S. headquarters at 400 Somerset 
Corporate Blvd., Bridgewater NJ 08807; Defendant Pearson’s address is 18 Tuttle Ave., Spring Lake, NJ 07762; and 
Defendant Schiller’s address is 40 Montview Ave., Short Hills, NJ 07078. Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 4 of 68 PageID: 4
-2- NATURE OF THE ACTION 
1. This is an action to recover significant investment losses suffered as a result of the 
unprecedented meltdown of a $90 billion drug company. Valeant is a pharmaceutical company 
based in Bridgewater, New Jersey, that develops, manufactures and markets prescription drugs, 
over-the-counter products, and medical devices. Unbeknownst to Plaintiffs and the rest of the 
market, between 2013 and 2015, Defendants Valeant, Pearson and Schiller made material 
misrepresentations and failed to disclose material facts in order to: (a) conceal the existence of a 
network of specialty pharmacies whose sole purpose was to steer patients toward Valeant 
products even when much cheaper generic alternatives were available; and (b) mislead investors 
that Valeant’s growth derived from organic volume increases when, in fact, such growth was 
driven primarily by Valeant’s unsustainable practice of acquiring medications and drastically 
increasing their prices. As the truth was gradually revealed to the market, the price of Valeant 
securities plummeted from over $250 per share in mid-2015 to under $25 per share by the time 
the fraud was fully revealed in mid-2016. 
2. Until October 19, 2015, Defendants improperly concealed the existence of and 
Valeant’s relationship with Philidor, a specialty pharmacy whose only client was Valeant, and 
which generated significant revenues for Valeant by using a network of purportedly independent 
pharmacies to dispense Valeant drugs over cheaper generic equivalents. 
3. Despite having a long and deep relationship with Philidor, Valeant went to great 
lengths to conceal its ties to Philidor. Valeant employees were heavily involved in the formation 
of Philidor in January 2013, but used aliases to conceal their involvement. Valeant was 
Philidor’s only pharmaceutical company client, but Philidor used a network of differently-named 
pharmacies in several states to keep other industry participants from learning about Philidor’s 
connection to Valeant. Philidor also required its employees to enter into confidentiality Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 5 of 68 PageID: 5
-3- agreements. Valeant exercised various forms of control over Philidor’s operations and senior 
personnel. In December 2014, Valeant obtained an option to acquire 100% of Philidor for $0, 
after which Valeant began consolidating Philidor’s financial results with its own (but did not 
identify Philidor to investors as a consolidated entity). 
4. Although Philidor effectively operated as a division of Valeant, Defendants hid 
Philidor’s existence and Valeant’s ties to Philidor. Their reason for doing so was the serious 
regulatory and reimbursement risks that would materialize if other participants in the industry 
knew of Valeant’s relationship with Philidor. Had they known about the connection between 
Valeant and Philidor, large pharmacy benefit managers would have scrutinized and denied 
reimbursement requests from Philidor because of the likelihood that the specialty pharmacy was 
just a shill for one of the large pharmaceutical manufacturers. This was subsequently confirmed 
when the three largest pharmacy benefit managers dropped Philidor from their programs after 
Philidor’s relationship with Valeant was revealed in late 2015. Despite trumpeting its “alternate 
fulfillment” distribution channel to investors, Valeant concealed that it consisted of a captive 
pharmacy that third-party payors would reject. 
5. Under generally accepted accounting principles, Valeant was required to provide 
certain information about Philidor (including, among other things, Philidor’s nature, size, 
purpose, activities, and how it was financed) in its financial statements. Valeant’s management 
also was required to disclose Philidor as a separate sales channel in its quarterly discussion of 
Valeant’s operating results. Defendants’ failure to do so rendered Valeant’s public filings with 
the SEC materially false, misleading, and incomplete. 
6. In addition to concealing Philidor, Defendants misled investors about the drivers 
of Valeant’s rapid growth. Between 2011 and 2015, Valeant experienced significant revenue Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 6 of 68 PageID: 6
-4- growth. As Valeant’s rapid rise came under increasing scrutiny, Valeant repeatedly stressed to 
investors that it was mostly the result of organic volume growth, and not because of Valeant 
raising prices on newly acquired drugs. As late as October 14, 2015, Valeant publicly 
represented that “volume growth contributes significantly more than price” to its business.
2

This mattered to investors because volume-based growth implies more sustainable long-term 
cash flows than short-term price increases. 
7. However, Valeant’s representations about its “organic growth” were materially 
false and misleading. As would later be revealed, Valeant’s steep growth was fueled by 
acquiring existing medications from other drug companies and then drastically increasing the 
prices on those drugs. Defendants were well aware of the real drivers behind Valeant’s growth. 
Indeed, after one occasion where Pearson told investors that growth was based on volume and 
not price, he received an email from Defendant Schiller, Valeant’s CFO, reminding him that 
price increases actually accounted for 80% of Valeant’s growth. 
8. The effect of Defendants’ misrepresentations about the existence of Philidor and 
Valeant’s growth was to artificially inflate the price of Valeant’s securities. 
9. Plaintiffs are investment funds that purchased Valeant common stock between 
February 27, 2015 and October 5, 2015, during the time when Defendants, unbeknownst to 
Plaintiffs, were concealing Valeant’s connection to Philidor and making misleading statements 
about Valeant’s growth. As the truth was gradually disclosed and processed by the market, 
thereby causing Valeant’s stock price to decline, Plaintiffs suffered significant losses.

-5- 10. Plaintiffs therefore bring this action under the federal securities laws and under 
the common law to recover damages for the investment losses they suffered as a result of 
Defendants’ materially false and misleading misstatements and omissions of material fact. 
JURISDICTION AND VENUE 
11. The claims asserted herein arise under and pursuant to Sections 10(b), 18 and 
20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), 15 U.S.C. §§ 78j(b), 78r and 
78t(a), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5, and under state common 
law. 
12. This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action pursuant to 
Section 27 of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78aa, and 28 U.S.C. § 1331, and has supplemental 
jurisdiction over the state law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a). 
13. Venue is proper in this District pursuant to Section 27 of the Exchange Act and 28 
U.S.C. § 1391. Many of the acts giving rise to the violations complained of herein, including the 
dissemination of false and misleading information, occurred in this District. 
14. In connection with the acts, transactions and conduct alleged herein, Defendants, 
directly or indirectly, used the means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce, including, but 
not limited to, the United States mails, interstate telephone communications and the facilities of a 
national securities exchange and market. 
PARTIES 
I. Plaintiffs 
15. Plaintiff MSD Torchlight Partners, L.P. is a Delaware limited partnership with its 
main office location in New York, New York. A list of the dates on which it purchased Valeant 
common stock in the United States during the relevant period is attached hereto as Exhibit A. Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 8 of 68 PageID: 8
-6- 16. Plaintiff MSD Torchlight Partners (MM), L.P. is a Delaware limited partnership 
with its main office location in New York, New York. A list of the dates on which it purchased 
Valeant common stock in the United States during the relevant period is attached hereto as 
Exhibit B. 
17. At all relevant times, MSD Partners, L.P. (“MSD Partners”) acted as investment 
adviser to Plaintiffs in connection with their purchases of Valeant securities. 
II. Defendants 
18. Defendant Valeant is a Canadian corporation with its U.S. headquarters in 
Bridgewater, New Jersey. Valeant is a multinational pharmaceutical and medical device 
company with approximately 22,000 employees. Valeant develops, manufactures and markets a 
broad range of brand-name and generic pharmaceuticals, over-the-counter (“OTC”) products and 
medical devices, which are marketed directly or indirectly in more than 100 countries. Valeant’s 
common stock is publicly traded in the United States on the New York Stock Exchange 
(“NYSE”) under the ticker symbol “VRX.” 
19. Defendant Pearson was Valeant’s CEO during most of the relevant time period. 
Pearson joined Valeant in 2008. When Valeant’s troubles began to spiral out of control in late 
2015, Pearson took a leave of absence for medical reasons. In March 2016, Valeant announced 
that Pearson would be replaced as CEO. In addition to being CEO of Valeant, Pearson served on 
Valeant’s Board of Directors, including as Chairman from March 2011 to January 2016. 
20. Defendant Schiller was Valeant’s CFO during most of the relevant time period, 
and also served as interim CEO during Pearson’s leave of absence. Schiller resigned as CFO on 
June 30, 2015, but retained his position on Valeant’s Board of Directors, which he held from 
September 2012 until June 2016. Schiller had a long career in investment banking prior to 
joining Valeant. Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 9 of 68 PageID: 9
-7- FRAUD-BASED CLAIMS 
I. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 
A. Overview of the Pharmaceutical Industry 
21. The global pharmaceutical industry is one of the largest markets in the world. 
The value of the U.S. pharmaceutical market alone is estimated to reach well over half a trillion 
dollars by 2020. 
22. The traditional business model for how pharmaceutical companies generate 
revenue is relatively straightforward. Drug companies develop new medications that, once 
approved by the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), are patented and marketed to the 
medical profession and consumers; medical professionals prescribe those drugs to patients; 
patients take the prescription to a pharmacy to be filled; and the pharmacist dispenses the 
medication to the patient, with the patient paying a co-pay and the patient’s insurer paying the 
remaining amount for the medication. 
23. In the modern pharmaceutical industry, pharmacy benefit managers, or “PBMs,” 
play a significant role. PBMs are third-party administrators retained by prescription drug plans 
that, according to the American Pharmacists Association, “are primarily responsible for 
developing and maintaining the formulary, contracting with pharmacies, negotiating discounts 
and rebates with drug manufacturers, and processing and paying prescription drug claims.” 
PBMs create pharmacy networks, pursuant to which only approved pharmacies can dispense 
drugs under plans that the PBMs administer. The three largest PBMs – ExpressScripts, CVS 
Caremark, and OptumRx – control approximately of 80% of the PBM market in the U.S. 
24. For many pharmaceutical manufacturers, the time during which their brand-name 
products face no generic competition is an extremely important period. When a brand-name 
drug is first approved by the FDA, there is a period of exclusivity that allows the drug Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 10 of 68 PageID: 10
-8- manufacturer to set the price so that it can first recoup its expenses and then generate a profit. 
Once generic equivalents of the brand-name drug enter the market, however, the brand-name 
drug loses its competitive advantage. Indeed, it is not unusual for a pharmacist to automatically 
substitute an available generic equivalent for a brand-name prescription because of the lower 
price of the generic drug. 
25. One of the faster growing areas in the pharmaceutical industry is the rise of 
“specialty pharmacies” to dispense specialty drugs. Specialty drugs are typically prescribed to 
treat chronic diseases (such as cancer, HIV, and multiple sclerosis), are high-cost, and can be 
difficult to administer. Traditional retail pharmacies are not well-equipped to provide the 
individual attention that patients require to determine the cheapest way to obtain specialty drugs 
and to administer the medication. Legitimate specialty pharmacies provide the necessary 
services to help patients obtain and administer specialty drugs. 
B. Valeant’s Business Model 
26. Valeant was founded as a pharmaceutical company in California in 1960 by Milan 
Panic, a former Olympic cyclist who later became prime minister of Yugoslavia. Originally 
called ICN Pharmaceuticals, the Company changed its name to Valeant in 2003. 
27. In 2008, one of Valeant’s largest investors – ValueAct – brought Defendant 
Pearson on board as Valeant’s CEO. Pearson did not have a medical background, but rather had 
spent twenty-three years at McKinsey, a management consulting firm. Pearson’s business 
background shaped the direction in which he steered Valeant. 
28. Pearson pursued a business model for Valeant that was different from other 
pharmaceutical manufacturers. Traditionally, pharmaceutical companies invest significant 
capital in the research and development (“R&D”) of new drugs. However, the pharmaceutical 
R&D process can be inefficient, costly and time-consuming. Therefore, Pearson advocated for a Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 11 of 68 PageID: 11
-9- strategy of spending less on R&D, and instead acquiring other drug companies that had already-
developed products. According to a recent Vanity Fair article, Pearson’s motto was, “Don’t bet 
on science – bet on management.” 
29. Pearson followed a hands-on approach to his management of Valeant. According 
to an article in Bloomberg Businessweek that quoted Valeant employees who worked for 
Pearson, “he had his fingers in everything, from operations to making decisions about the 
salaries of individual employees.” 
30. Valeant experienced tremendous growth. The Company made over 100 
acquisitions between 2008 and 2015. In 2011 and 2012, Valeant built a significant position in 
dermatology by acquiring companies such as Medicis Pharmaceutical Corp. (“Medicis”), Obagi 
Medical Products (“Obagi”), Dermik, and Ortho Dermatologics. In 2013, Valeant became a 
large player in the ophthalmology market when it acquired Bausch & Lomb. 
31. Valeant also cut costs with Pearson at its helm. Pearson slashed Valeant’s 
investment in R&D of new drugs. Then, in 2010, Valeant reduced its tax rate to the lowest of 
any pharmaceutical company in the world by merging with a Canadian company, Biovail, which 
operated through offshore subsidiaries in tax friendly jurisdictions. 
32. Between 2008 and 2015, Valeant’s stock priced soared, rising from around $10 
per share to over $250 per share. As explained below, much of this stock price growth was 
caused by Defendants’ material misrepresentations and omissions. 
C. Valeant’s Reporting Obligations as a Public Company 
33. Under the federal securities laws and the regulations and guidance promulgated 
by the SEC pursuant to those laws, companies whose stock is publicly traded in the U.S. – such 
as Valeant – have important reporting and disclosure obligations. These requirements were Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 12 of 68 PageID: 12
-10- created by the government to restore investor confidence in the integrity of the U.S. capital 
markets in the wake of the Great Depression. 
34. Public companies are required to file with the SEC certain disclosure documents 
containing comprehensive information about their business operations and their financial 
condition. Investors rely on the accuracy and transparency of these disclosures when 
determining whether to invest. 
35. As a publicly traded corporation with significant operations in the U.S., Valeant is 
required to prepare its financial statements in accordance with United States Generally Accepted 
Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”) in order for those financial statements not to be deemed 
misleading and inaccurate. U.S. GAAP is a set of rules and standards that are designed to ensure 
uniform financial reporting. 
36. One of those standards is ASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 810, 
Consolidation (“ASC 810”). Among other things, ASC 810 sets forth rules governing the 
disclosure by public companies in their financial statements of “variable interest entities” or 
“VIEs.” Loosely defined, a VIE is an entity in which the reporting company has a controlling 
interest. A VIE of which the reporting company is the “primary beneficiary” must be 
consolidated in the reporting company’s financial statements. ASC 810 requires that certain 
information about both consolidated and unconsolidated VIEs be disclosed in an issuer’s 
financial statements. 
37. In addition to complying with U.S. GAAP, public companies are required to 
follow the standards developed by the SEC governing what information must be disclosed in 
financial statements and other public filings. For example, with respect to assessing materiality 
in preparing financial statements, the SEC has released Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 99 (“SAB Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 13 of 68 PageID: 13
-11- 99”), which emphasizes the importance of qualitative factors in determining materiality. In SAB 
99, the SEC stated that while it had no objection to using a numerical threshold of 5% as a 
starting point in assessing materiality, “quantifying, in percentage terms, the magnitude of a 
misstatement is only the beginning of an analysis of materiality; it cannot appropriately be used 
as a substitute for a full analysis of all relevant considerations.” Thus, for example, a 
quantitative misstatement of revenue under 5% might be deemed material if “the misstatement 
hides a failure to meet analysts’ consensus expectations.” 
38. Certain SEC filings – such as the issuer’s annual report – are required to contain a 
section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of 
Operations” (the “MD&A”). The purpose of the MD&A is to give investors an opportunity to 
see the issuer’s past results and future prospects through the eyes of management. See 17 C.F.R. 
§ 229.303. According to Topic 13 of the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Series (“SAB Topic 
13”): 
[The
A
requires a discussion of liquidity, capital resources, 
results of operations and other information necessary to an 
understanding of a registrant’s financial condition, changes in 
financial condition and results of operations. This includes 
unusual or infrequent transactions, known trends or uncertainties 
that have had, or might reasonably be expected to have, a favorable 
or unfavorable material effect on revenue, operating income or net 
income and the relationship between revenue and the costs of the 
revenue. Changes in revenue should not be evaluated solely in 
terms of volume and price changes, but should also include an 
analysis of the reasons and factors contributing to the increase or 
decrease. 
SAB Topic 13 further provides that the types of revenue transactions or events that should be 
disclosed in the MD&A include, among other things, “[cng trends in shipments into, and 
sales from, a sales channel or separate class of customer that could be expected to have a 
significant effect on future sales or sales returns.” Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 14 of 68 PageID: 14
-12- 39. As explained in greater detail below, throughout the relevant period Valeant 
represented to investors that it was complying with these important public reporting obligations 
by timely disclosing truthful material facts about its business. However, unbeknownst to the 
market, Valeant was making misrepresentations about its illicit use of a secret network of 
pharmacies and its growth, which – when the truth was slowly revealed to the outside world – 
caused a precipitous decline in the value of Valeant securities. 
D. Valeant’s Web of Deception 
1. Valeant’s Clandestine Specialty Pharmacy Network 
40. In September 2012, Valeant announced that it was acquiring Medicis for a price 
of $2.6 billion. Medicis was a dermatological and aesthetic pharmaceutical products company 
that manufactured, among other things, the acne treatment drugs Solodyn and Ziana. 
41. A new business model that Medicis had been exploring prior to its acquisition by 
Valeant was an “alternate fulfillment” or “AF” initiative. Under that program, rather than wait 
for insurance approval to dispense Solodyn and Ziana to a patient, Medicis would dispense the 
medication and assume the risk that the insurer would refuse to pay. 
42. When Valeant acquired Medicis, it decided to expand the AF intiative. Pearson 
told investors that the AF initiative was complex, had several “stages” or “phases,” but that 
Valeant was developing some “exciting opportunities” by expanding the alternate fulfillment 
initiative. However, Defendants refused to provide specifics about what those developments 
were. 
43. Unbeknownst to investors, Valeant’s expansion of the AF initiative involved 
creating a captive, specialty pharmacy whose only client was Valeant but whose success was 
based on the outside world having no knowledge of Valeant’s connection to that pharmacy. This 
pharmacy was named “Philidor.” Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 15 of 68 PageID: 15
-13- 44. Philidor was an illegitimate sales channel that Valeant created to peddle numerous 
Valeant products. Valeant’s ability to increase the sales of its drugs through Philidor had the 
effect of materially boosting Valeant’s revenues. However, in order to do so Valeant had to 
conceal its ties to Philidor. Had the third-party payors who reimbursed Valeant known that 
Philidor was effectively operating as a division of Valeant, they would not have paid for the 
Valeant drugs Philidor was dispensing. 
45. Philidor was founded in January 2013, purportedly as an independent specialty 
mail-order pharmacy designed to fill, ship and obtain insurance approval for dermatological 
medicines. Philidor was licensed in 45 states and the District of Columbia. Its network of 
pharmacies included locations in California, Florida, New Jersey, South Carolina and Texas. 
46. Valeant used its own employees to launch Philidor. Valeant hired Gary Tanner to 
act as its liaison with Philidor prior to Philidor even being incorporated. Tanner traveled 
frequently between Philidor’s offices and Valeant’s offices. According to a former Philidor 
employee, Tanner oversaw all Valeant employees who were sent to work at Philidor. 
47. Just one day after Philidor was incorporated, Valeant hired Laizer Kornwasser to 
act as Tanner’s supervisor. Kornwasser reported directly to Defendant Pearson. 
48. After having set up Philidor, Valeant employees were then used to develop 
Philidor’s business of selling Valeant products. 
49. To conceal Valeant’s connection to Philidor, Valeant employees used fake names 
on their Philidor email accounts. A Valeant manager who worked at Philidor’s Phoenix, Arizona 
office used the alias “Peter Parker” – the alter ego of Spiderman. Another Valeant employee 
masqueraded under the name “Jack Reacher,” a fictional character played by Tom Cruise in a Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 16 of 68 PageID: 16
-14- 2012 movie of the same name. Yet another Valeant employee – apparently a fan of the Beach 
Boys – used the name “Brian Wilson” to conceal his identity. 
50. At Valeant’s direction, Philidor representatives steered patients toward Valeant’s 
medications and away from less expensive alternatives and generics. Philidor provided patients 
who were prescribed Valeant medications coupons to reduce the cost of the drug to the patient. 
Philidor would then ship the Valeant drugs to the patient prior to obtaining insurance approval. 
If the insurers questioned why doctors prescribed Valeant drugs instead of more affordable 
alternatives, Philidor representatives intervened. Philidor was paid a per prescription service fee 
for its work in implementing Valeant’s alternate fulfillment program. 
51. As Philidor’s business of distributing only Valeant medications grew, Valeant 
decided to purchase Philidor to further cement its ties to Philidor’s network of pharmacies 
operating throughout the U.S. solely for the benefit of Valeant. 
52. However, Valeant needed to do so in a way that would not reveal its ties to 
Philidor to the outside world. Accordingly, Valeant agreed to pay significant amounts to acquire 
Philidor, but structured the transaction in a way so that it did not disclose it as an acquisition. 
53. Specifically, in December 2014, Valeant entered into a purchase option agreement 
with Philidor, agreeing to pay Philidor $100 million for a ten-year option to purchase Philidor for 
$0. Valeant also agreed to make additional payments to Philidor upon the attainment of various 
milestones. 
54. Management and the board of directors of Valeant toured Philidor’s facilities 
prior to executing the purchase agreement in December 2014. Valeant’s management then made 
the decision to enter into the transaction and how to account for it. Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 17 of 68 PageID: 17
-15- 55. As a result of this transaction, Valeant created a joint steering committee to 
directly control Philidor. The joint steering committee was composed of members from Valeant 
and Philidor. 
56. Valeant also obtained the right to control who Philidor hired for certain positions 
(including an advisor to the CEO, the head compliance officer, an in-house lawyer, and a head IT 
officer), and received the right to obtain certain information from Philidor (including the ability 
to access Philidor’s books, records and facilities). 
57. In the purchase option agreement, Philidor covenanted to Valeant that it would 
comply with all applicable laws, and agreed to indemnify Valeant against third-party claims 
relating to Philidor’s business practices. 
58. Although Philidor effectively operated as a division of Valeant, Valeant took 
deliberate measures to conceal the relationship from PBMs, insurers, and medical professionals. 
59. Rather than operating throughout the United States under Philidor’s name, 
Valeant and Philidor created a network of pharmacies with different names. These pharmacies 
were designed to obscure Valeant’s close ties to Philidor and to avoid scrutiny from the PBMs by 
creating the appearance that many separate, independent pharmacies were distributing Valeant 
medications. 
60. Philidor also required its employees to sign confidentiality agreements so that, 
according to Reuters, Philidor could “sue workers who divulged information about its activities.” 
61. As Philidor’s covert network of pharmacies to exclusively distribute Valeant 
products expanded, Philidor’s sales accounted for more and more of Valeant’s revenues. By the 
time that Valeant began disclosing its relationship with Philidor at the end of October 2015, Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 18 of 68 PageID: 18
-16- Philidor accounted for at least 5.9% of Valeant’s year-to-date net revenue. For the third quarter 
of 2015 alone, Philidor accounted for at least 6.8% of Valeant’s total revenues. 
62. Valeant does not dispute that it considered Philidor to be a VIE for accounting 
purposes from 2013 on. However, it improperly failed to disclose Philidor in its annual reports 
for 2013 and 2014, in each of its quarterly reports in 2013 and 2014, and the first two quarterly 
reports of 2015. 
63. Valeant’s failure to disclose Philidor rendered its affirmative statements about its 
alternate fulfillment program materially misleading and incomplete. In 2014, at various investor 
conferences, Pearson made references to improvements that it was making to its alternate 
fulfillment program. However, Pearson failed to disclose that its approach to that program could 
subject Valeant to serious regulatory and reimbursement risks because of the way Valeant was 
covertly utilizing Philidor to increase sales of Valeant products. 
64. Moreover, under SAB Topic 13, as discussed in more detail below, Valeant had 
an obligation to disclose Philidor as a distinct sales channel in the MD&A portion of its periodic 
reports between 2013 and 2015. 
65. The fact that Valeant considered Philidor to be a VIE required Defendants to 
disclose certain information about Philidor in Valeant’s financial statements pursuant to ASC 
810, including: (a) Philidor’s nature, size, purpose, activities, and how it was financed; and (b) 
the methodology for concluding that Valeant was not required to consolidate Philidor’s financial 
statements with its own. In its 2013 10-K, Valeant misrepresented to the market that: “There 
were no material arrangements determined to be variable interest entities.” 
66. Once Valeant consolidated Philidor’s financial statements in 2014 because it 
determined that Philidor was a VIE of which Valeant was the primary beneficiary, Valeant was Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 19 of 68 PageID: 19
-17- additionally required under ASC 810 to disclose the factors that resulted in the consolidation – 
i.e., the purchase option agreement with Philidor. However, it failed to do so, simply (and 
falsely) stating in its 2014 10-K that: “The consolidated financial statements include the 
accounts of the Company and those of its subsidiaries and any variable interest entities (“VIEs”) 
for which the Company is the primary beneficiary” and “[dber 31, 
2014, the Company completed other smaller acquisitions, including the consolidation of variable 
interest entities, which are not material individually or in the aggregate.” 
67. There can be no dispute that Defendants knew about the existence of Philidor and 
Valeant’s relationship to Philidor at the same time they hid their existence from investors and 
other pharmaceutical industry players. Indeed, the Company has conceded as much, stating that 
it did not disclose Philidor because it wanted to maintain a “competitive advantage.” However, 
the fact that a company wishes to maintain a competitive advantage does not relieve it from its 
obligations to comply with U.S. GAAP and the SEC’s disclosure requirements and to avoid 
misleading its investors. 
68. In an October 26, 2015 investor presentation, Valeant told investors that, although 
it considered Philidor to be a VIE, it was not required to disclose Philidor in its financial reports 
because it did not consider Philidor to be a material part of its business. Specifically, Valeant 
argued that U.S. GAAP required sales to “customers” to be disclosed only if such sales 
accounted for more than 10% of Valeant’s revenues. 
69. Valeant’s claim that Philidor was not material to its business is insupportable. As 
an initial matter, Valeant stated in its October 26, 2015 presentation on Philidor that the specialty 
pharmacy accounted for “7% or less of consolidated net revenues since Q4 2014.” Given that 
Valeant’s revenue losses following Philidor’s closure in late 2015 were far greater than 7%, this Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 20 of 68 PageID: 20
-18- was an understatement. Thus, Philidor met the 5% quantitative materiality standard under SAB 
99. 
70. Valeant’s argument that Philidor was not quantitatively material because it did not 
meet Valeant’s 10% threshold for customer sales is completely misplaced. Philidor was not a 
“customer” of Valeant; rather, it effectively operated as a division of Valeant. Valeant should 
have consolidated Philidor prior to December 2014 because Valeant was the primary beneficiary 
of Philidor. See ASC 810. In any event, once Valeant consolidated Philidor in December 2014, 
it could not possibly claim that Philidor was a customer because Philidor was an arm of Valeant. 
71. Moreover, even if not quantitatively material, both before and after consolidation 
Philidor was still qualitatively material to Valeant and its investors because of the risks that 
Valeant’s relationship with Philidor posed to the Company. See SAB 99. The concealment of 
Valeant’s relationship with Philidor was essential to Valeant being able to channel sales through 
Philidor. So long as the PBMs had no idea about the connection between Philidor and Valeant, 
they had no reason to suspect any collusion. 
72. That Philidor’s ties to Valeant were qualitatively material to Valeant’s business is 
confirmed by the fact that the three major PBMs dropped Philidor from their networks – which 
was a death-knell for Philidor – when they found out about Valeant’s deceptive use of Philidor to 
move Valeant products. 
2. The Myth of Valeant’s Purported “Organic” Growth 
73. Between January 1, 2012, and September 30, 2015, Valeant experienced 
significant revenue growth. 
74. Specifically, in 2012, Valeant recorded $3.48 billion of revenue; in 2013, Valeant 
recorded $5.76 billion of revenue; in 2014, Valeant recorded $8.25 billion of revenue; and in the 
first three quarters of 2015, Valeant recorded annualized revenues of $10.28 billion. Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 21 of 68 PageID: 21
-19- 75. Valeant represented to investors that the main driver of this growth was organic 
volume increases in drug sales, and not price hikes on the medications themselves. 
76. Whether Valeant’s steep growth was driven by volume instead of price increases 
was highly material to investors. The problem with price increases is that they constitute the 
corporate equivalent of a sugar rush. The price increase gives the company a large, short-term 
bump in revenue. But that revenue bump soon runs its course. Because there is a market-
imposed limit to how often, and by how much, the price of a particular drug can be increased, 
price increases generally cannot sustain robust, long-term growth. 
77. To achieve sustained growth, the Company needed a program to increase demand 
for its current products (thereby leading to higher sales volumes), as well as a development or 
acquisition pipeline to introduce new products. 
78. Thus, for investors focused on long-term cash flows and growth, it mattered 
whether Valeant’s reported revenue increases were the product of short-term price hikes or 
organic sales volume increases. A company that obfuscates or lies about its real growth-drivers 
misleads investors about its current financial health and long-term prospects. 
79. In early 2014, Valeant made a hostile takeover bid for Allergan, Inc. 
(“Alllergan”). In an attempt to ward off the takeover bid, Allergan told its shareholders that it 
had “serious concerns about the sustainability of Valeant’s business model.” Specifically, 
Allergan accused Valeant of, among other things, “low organic growth (driven mostly by price 
increases).” 
80. In response to Allergan’s accusations, on May 28, 2014, Valeant held an investor 
meeting and conference call. During that call, Pearson denied Allergan’s accusations and told Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 22 of 68 PageID: 22
-20- investors that Valeant had “delivered strong organic growth,” and that its ability to increase 
prices in certain sectors was actually restricted. 
81. That same day, Pearson participated in a conference in which he further 
expounded that Valeant “focus[es
e growth, and the vast majority of our growth on a 
global basis – and we went through some of that this morning – is volume.” 
82. On June 17, 2014, Pearson and Schiller hosted a conference call to further address 
Allergan’s accusations, during which Pearson told investors that “volume is a much larger piece 
of our organic growth than most people would assume it is.” 
83. Throughout 2014 and into 2015, Valeant continued to tout its significant “organic 
growth” as a result of volume increases. Of particular note, on April 29, 2015, Pearson and 
Schiller hosted a conference call in connection with the release of Valeant’s first quarter 
financial results. During the call, one analyst asked Pearson to quantify how price and volume 
contributed to Valeant’s first quarter growth. Pearson responded: 
In terms of price volume, actually volume was greater than price 
in terms of our growth. Outside the United States it’s all volume . 
. . . And in the United States it’s shifting more to volume than 
price, and we expect that to continue. A lot of our prices for most 
of our products are negotiated with managed care. And there’s 
only a limited amount of price we can take . . . So it’s primarily 
volume. 
84. In September 2015, as public scrutiny of Valeant’s practices was increasing, 
Pearson wrote a letter to Valeant’s employees. In that letter – which was publicly filed by 
Valeant with the SEC – Pearson boldly stated that “Valeant is well-positioned for strong 
organic growth, even assuming little to no price increases,” and that “Valeant’s core operating 
principles include a focus on volume growth.” 
85. As Pearson and Schiller have since admitted, however, these statements about 
Valeant’s purported strong organic growth driven by volume increases were patently false. Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 23 of 68 PageID: 23
-21- 86. Valeant’s significant growth was not attributable to volume increases, but rather 
was driven by significant price hikes on newly acquired products. 
87. Many of the drugs acquired by Valeant were designed to treat rare medical 
conditions. Such drugs faced little competition from generic equivalents because of the small 
populations they serviced. Moreover, due to a backlog at the FDA, there was a significant period 
before any such generic equivalents would come to market. Accordingly, after Valeant acquired 
these drugs, it was able to – and did – significantly increase their prices with little scrutiny from 
the other participants in the pharmaceutical industry. 
88. For example, in early 2015, Marathon Pharmaceuticals LLC (“Marathon”) was 
seeking to divest itself of about half a dozen medications as part as a change in business strategy. 
Two of the drugs for sale were the heart medications, Isuprel and Nitropress. At that time, there 
were no generic equivalents for Isuprel and Nitropress. 
89. Internal documents produced by Valeant to Congress show that in December 
2014 and January 2015 Valeant conducted research on its ability to purchase Isuprel and 
Nitropress and immediately raise their prices. According to a presentation dated January 16, 
2015, Valeant believed that the drugs had pricing “flexibility by multiple orders of magnitude.” 
90. The day after acquiring Isuprel and Nitropress, Valeant significantly raised their 
prices. Specifically, a vial of Nitropress went from $257.80 to $805.61 (212% increase), and 
Isuprel was bumped up from $215.46 to $1,346.62 (525% increase). 
91. Isuprel and Nitropress were not the only drugs that Valeant acquired and 
increased prices. Other drugs where Valeant implemented steep price increases to drive its 
revenue growth included: Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 24 of 68 PageID: 24
-22- ?
Targretin gel, a topical treatment for lymphoma, from $1,687 
in 2009 to $30,320 in 2015 (1700% increase), most of which 
occurred after Valeant acquired the drug in 2013. 
? Carac cream, used to treat precancerous skin lesions, from 
$159 in 2009 to $2,865 in 2015 (1700% increase), most of 
which occurred after Valeant acquired the drug in 2011. 
? Syprine, a chelating agent for treatment of Wilson’s disease, 
from $650 in 2010 to $21,000 in 2015 (3200% increase). 
? Cuprimime, also a chelating agent for treatment of Wilson's 
disease, from $450 in 2010 to $26,000 in 2015 (5800% 
increase). 
? Glumetza, a diabetes drug, from $900 to $10,000 (1100% 
increase). 
92. Despite their public statements to the contrary, Defendants were well aware of the 
connection between Valeant’s price increases and its significant revenue growth. For example, 
on May 21, 2015, Schiller sent Pearson an email with the subject, “price volume.” In that email, 
Schiller stated: “Last night, one of the investors asked about price vs volume for Q1. Excluding 
[Isuprel and Nitropressprice represented about 60% of our growth. If you include [Isuprel 
and Nitropress], price represents about 80%.” 
93. Both Pearson and Schiller have since admitted that Valeant’s steep growth was 
the result of price increases, and not what was previously represented to the market. 
94. On February 4, 2016, Schiller appeared before Congress as Valeant’s acting CEO. 
Schiller admitted to the congressional panel that 80% of Valeant’s growth in the first quarter of 
2015 was the result of price increases and not expanded market share. 
95. On April 27, 2016, Pearson appeared before Congress. In his prepared remarks, 
Pearson confessed that Valeant had “made mistakes.” In delivering a mea culpa to the members 
of the Senate Committee on Aging, Pearson stated: “[Tpany was too aggressive – and I, 
as its leader, was too aggressive – in pursuing price increases on certain drugs. Let me state Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 25 of 68 PageID: 25
-23- plainly that it was a mistake to pursue, and in hindsight I regret pursuing, transactions where a 
central premise was planned increase in the prices of the medicines . . . .” 
96. During that hearing, Pearson was questioned by Senator McCaskill about whether 
growth was driven by price rather than volume between the first quarter of 2013 and the third 
quarter of 2015 for all but one quarter. In response, Pearson admitted that, “Yes, pricing has 
driven more growth than volume.” 
E. The Truth Gradually Emerges and the Prices of Valeant’s Securities 
Plummet 
97. Valeant’s business was a house of cards built on unsustainable price increases, a 
secret network of pharmacies designed to exclusively peddle Valeant’s products, and a culture of 
deception set by Pearson and Schiller that resulted in the manipulation of the Company’s 
financial information. As the truth about Philidor, Valeant’s improper revenue recognition, and 
Valeant’s artificial growth slowly leaked into the market through a series of partial disclosures, 
the price of Valeant securities dropped precipitously. 
98. On October 4, 2015, The New York Times published an article with the headline: 
“Valeant’s Drug Price Strategy Enriches It, but Infuriates Patients and Lawyers.” While price 
increases for the drugs Valeant acquired had recently become the focus of public scrutiny, The 
New York Times Article was the first time that the market was apprised that Valeant’s steep 
revenue growth might be driven by something other than organic sales. Specifically, the article 
questioned Pearson’s claim that Valeant was well-positioned for growth even without price 
increases. 
99. In response to this news, the price of Valeant securities fell. Valeant common 
stock declined $18.86/share, or 10.3%, from a price of $182.32/share at the close of trading on 
October 2, 2015, to a price of $163.46/share at the close of trading on October 5, 2015. Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 26 of 68 PageID: 26
-24- 100. However, Valeant immediately took steps to attempt to dispel any suggestion that 
its public statements concerning its organic growth were materially misleading. On October 5, 
2015, the Company released a statement entitled “Valeant Corrects Misleading Reports,” seeking 
to refute allegations leveled against Valeant by short sellers on the internet. 
On October 14, 2015, Pearson sent a letter to Senator McCaskill. In that letter, Pearson noted 
that “[t
i
sperception in the media that Valeant’s revenue growth for existing products 
has been driven primarily by price.” This was a “misperception,” according to Pearson, because 
“volume growth contributes significantly more than price for our U.S. branded pharmaceutical 
business.” 
101. On October 14, 2015, after the markets closed, Valeant issued a press release 
announcing that it had received two subpoenas, one from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the 
District of Massachusetts and one from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of 
New York. The documents requested by these prosecutors included, among other things, 
materials relating to “pricing decisions.” Thus, the market was notified that Valeant was being 
investigated for potential criminal violations. 
102. In response to this news, the price of Valeant securities fell again. Valeant 
common stock declined $8.42/share, or 4.8%, from a price of $177.29/share at the close of 
trading on October 14, 2015, to a price of $168.87/share at the close of trading on October 15, 
2015. 
103. Yet Valeant still continued to deny any wrongdoing. In the same press release, 
Pearson was quoted as saying: “All of us at Valeant firmly believe in maintaining strong 
regulatory and financial controls and believe we have operated our business in a fully compliant 
manner.” Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 27 of 68 PageID: 27
-25- 104. On October 19, 2015, during trading hours, Valeant held an investor call to 
address its third quarter results and the scrutiny it was receiving from the government and the 
media. During that call, Valeant disclosed that for 2014 and through three quarters of 2015, 
price hikes, and not volume increases, accounted for the majority of Valeant’s revenue growth 
from its U.S. branded pharmaceuticals portfolio. Specifically, in 2014, volume accounted for 
40% of growth, while prices increases accounted for 60% of growth. In 2015, as of the October 
19 disclosure, volume accounted for 41% of growth, and price increases accounted for 59%. 
105. Valeant also, for the first time, acknowledged the existence of Philidor, apparently 
in response to a California state lawsuit against Valeant that questioned the connection between 
Valeant and Philidor. On the call, Pearson described Valeant’s relationship with Philidor as 
follows: 
Philidor, one of our specialty pharmacy partners, provides 
prescription services to patients across the country, and provides 
administrative services for our co-pay cards and is a dispensary 
that fills prescriptions. We have a contractual relationship with 
Philidor and late last year we purchased an option to acquire 
Philidor if we so choose. Given accounting rules, we consolidate 
Philidor’s financials. Inventory held at Philidor remains on 
Valeant’s books and is not included in the specialty pharmacy 
channel inventory. 
For many of our dermatology products, Philidor and other 
specialty pharmacies, dispense our medicine before adjudication of 
the reimbursement is finalized. To ensure patients get their 
medicines prescribed quickly as a result we take on a risk for non-
reimbursement. 
We understand that Philidor provides services under our programs 
for commercially insured and cash-paying claims only. Any claim 
that would be reimbursed in whole or in part by government 
insurance is not eligible for our co-pay subsidy programs. It does 
not restrict prescriptions it fills to any particular manufacturers. It 
dispenses generic products as specified in the patient’s prescription 
or as requested by the patient. Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 28 of 68 PageID: 28
-26- 106. Although Valeant finally disclosed that it had a “contractual relationship with 
Philidor,” its disclosure was materially incomplete because it failed to disclose the true nature of 
the relationship between Valeant and Philidor (i.e., that Philidor effectively was a division of 
Valeant that peddled Valeant’s products only). 
107. In response to this news, the price of Valeant securities fell again. Valeant 
common stock declined $13.73/share, or 7.73%, from a price of $177.56/share at the close of 
trading on October 16, 2015, to a price of $163.83/share at the close of trading on October 19, 
2015. 
108. After the markets closed on October 19, The New York Times published an article 
entitled “Drug Makers Sidestep Barriers on Pricing.” The article disclosed that Philidor’s 
application for a license to operate in California had been denied because Philidor had concealed 
its ties to Valeant. According to the article, Valeant used Philidor to “keep the health system 
paying for high-priced drugs.” 
109. In response to this news, the price of Valeant securities dropped. Valeant 
common stock declined $17.09/share, or 10.4%, from a price of $163.83/share at the close of 
trading on October 19, 2015, to a price of $146.74/share at the close of trading on October 20, 
2015. 
110. Plaintiffs liquidated their entire position in Valeant common stock by October 20, 
2015, having suffered huge losses in connection with the partial disclosures alleged above and as 
a result of Defendants’ materially false and misleading statements and omissions of material fact. 
111. Over the rest of 2015 and the first half of 2016, more facts about Philidor and 
Valeant’s volume growth were publicly disclosed. Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 29 of 68 PageID: 29
-27- 112. For example, on October 21, 2015, Citron published a research article claiming 
that it had a “smoking gun” and asking the question: “Could this be the Pharmaceutical Enron?” 
The Citron report claimed that Valeant was using a secret network of mail-order specialty 
pharmacies to force patients to purchase Valeant medications. The report claimed that Philidor 
shared a phone number with other, purportedly independent pharmacies. Citron concluded that 
“it appears to Citron that Valeant/Philidor have created an entire network of phantom captive 
pharmacies.” 
113. Valeant issued a press release seeking to downplay the accusations in the Citron 
report. The press release was titled, “Valeant Pharmaceuticals Responds to Erroneous Report.” 
114. On October 22, 2015, BMO Capital Markets Corp. (“BMO”) downgraded its 
guidance on Valeant to “market perform” due, in part, to it having received no satisfactory 
explanation for Valeant’s use of Philidor and concealment of that relationship. BMO – which 
had previously been bullish on Valeant – found Valeant’s relationship with Philidor to be 
“questionable.” 
115. That same day, Bloomberg published an article entitled “Valeant Still Has 
Explaining to Do, Citron’s Left Says.” In the article, Bloomberg quoted the drug industry’s 
Washington lobbying group, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, as 
describing Valeant’s business strategy as “more reflective of a hedge fund than an innovative 
biopharmaceutical company.” The article also quoted Adam Fein, president of Pembroke 
Consulting Inc., as saying: “What Valeant was doing, whether right or wrong, was very, very 
unusual and not consistent with practices that other pharmaceutical manufactures use.” 
116. On Sunday, October 25, 2015, The Wall Street Journal published an article 
entitled “Valeant and Pharmacy More Intertwined Than Thought.” The article included more Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 30 of 68 PageID: 30
-28- details about Valeant’s ties to Philidor, disclosing that several Valeant employees had been sent 
to work at Philidor and had used the pop culture aliases Peter Parker, Jack Reacher and Brian 
Wilson. The article also noted that Valeant had used Philidor to “fuel its business.” Philidor 
“can steer patients to Valeant’s drugs, rather than less-expensive alternatives, and then help 
negotiate reimbursements with insurers,” the article revealed. 
117. On October 26, 2015, Valeant released a 90-page PowerPoint presentation on 
Philidor. Valeant disclosed, among other things: (a) how it used Philidor to generate revenues 
through alternate fulfillment; (b) that Philidor represented 6.8% of Valeant’s total revenue for the 
third quarter of 2015; (c) that Valeant had entered into the option purchase agreement with 
Philidor in December 2014; (d) that Philidor had agreements with other pharmacies to distribute 
in California, where Philidor was not licensed; (e) that Valeant had long considered Philidor a 
VIE; and (f) that its management and board of directors had toured Philidor’s facilities prior to 
entering into the purchase option agreement. 
118. However, this presentation still failed to disclose the full truth about Philidor and 
was materially misleading to the extent it claimed that Philidor was immaterial to Valeant’s 
business. 
119. On October 28, 2015, after the markets closed, The Wall Street Journal published 
an article entitled “Pharmacy’s Sales Tactics Disclosed.” The article revealed that Philidor had 
been in engaging in highly questionable practices to sell Valeant’s products. 
120. The next day, while the markets were still open, it was reported by Dow Jones 
Newswire that CVS/Caremark – one of the largest PBM’s in the United States – had terminated 
Philidor from its network of pharmacies. Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 31 of 68 PageID: 31
-29- 121. After the markets closed on October 29, 2015, the other two of the “big three” 
PBMs – Express Scripts and OptumRx – also cut ties with Philidor. 
122. The next day, Friday, October 30, 2015, Valeant announced that it was severing 
its connections with Philidor and that Philidor would be closing its doors imminently. In a 
statement released by Valeant, Pearson was quoted as saying: “The newest allegations about 
activities at Philidor raise additional questions about the company’s business practices. . . . We 
have lost confidence in Philidor’s ability to continue in a manner that is acceptable to Valeant 
and the patients and doctors we serve.” However, this statement – in which Valeant tried to 
distance itself from Philidor – was materially misleading because it did not reveal the full extent 
of Valeant’s involvement with Philidor and how material Philidor was to Valeant’s business. 
123. On November 4, 2015, it was disclosed that the Senate had launched a formal 
probe into Valeant’s business practices. 
124. After the markets closed on November 4, 2015, The Wall Street Journal reported 
that Pershing Square – one of Valeant’s largest shareholders – was considering the removal of 
Pearson as CEO due to the turbulence surrounding Valeant. In addition, it was disclosed that the 
head of Pershing Square, Bill Ackman, had requested that Valeant management “come clean” 
and disclose the full extent of their knowledge regarding Philidor. 
125. On November 10, 2015, Valeant held an investor call to provide an update to the 
market. During that call, Pearson disclosed that Philidor had committed to cease operations by 
January 31, 2016, at the latest. Pearson also revealed the impact that the Philidor scandal was 
having on Valeant’s operations: “In the very short term, disruption in our dermatology business 
will be significant. Last week, we asked Philidor to stop adjudicating claims and to fill all 
prescriptions at no cost for the week.” Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 32 of 68 PageID: 32
-30- 126. On November 11, 2015, Bloomberg released an article warning of a “revenue 
squeeze” at Valeant due to the loss of Philidor and the scrutiny over drug price increases. As a 
result, Valeant could breach important covenants to its lenders, which would be disastrous for 
Valeant and its shareholders. 
127. On November 12, 2015, Bloomberg published another article providing further 
details on Valeant’s relationship with Philidor and how Philidor peddled Valeant products over 
cheaper generic alternatives. 
128. On November 16, 2015, Bloomberg reported that Congressman Elijah Cummings 
had demanded that Pearson make the Valeant employees involved with Philidor available for 
interviews. 
129. Before the market opened on December 17, 2015, an analyst at Mizuho Securities 
USA (“Mizuho”) downgraded Valeant from “buy” to “neutral,” pointing to a lack of clarity in 
Valeant’s disclosures. 
130. On December 28, 2015, Valeant announced that Pearson had left the Company on 
medical leave. On January 6, 2016, Valeant announced that Schiller – who had left his position 
as CFO in 2015 but remained on the Company’s board – would be taking over as interim CEO. 
131. On February 19, 2016, several news outlets reported on a Wells Fargo analyst’s 
detailed review of Valeant. Among other things, the Wells Fargo analyst questioned Valeant’s 
claim that Philidor accounted for only 7% of revenues, given that the unwinding of that revenue 
from Valeant’s financials resulted in a one-third reduction in earnings-per-share. The analyst 
also found that Valeant’s accounting did not match up to its performance. Accordingly, the 
analyst concluded that Valeant was at “substantial risk” of having misstated its financials. Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 33 of 68 PageID: 33
-31- 132. On February 22, 2016, while the markets were still open, it was reported that 
Valeant would likely be restating some of its financials based on its internal review of Philidor. 
On this news, the price of Valeant securities again fell precipitously. 
133. After the markets closed, Valeant issued a press release confirming that it 
expected to have to restate its financials. 
134. On February 28, 2016, Valeant issued a press release announcing that Pearson 
was returning from medical leave and that, as a result, it would reschedule its previously 
announced call for February 29 to discuss its fourth quarter 2015 results. 
135. During trading hours on February 29, 2016, Moody’s reported that it had placed 
Valeant’s corporate credit rating “under review for downgrade” because of concerns about 
Valeant’s operating performance. 
136. On March 15, 2016, before the market opened, Valeant announced that it was 
reducing its financial guidance for 2016 as a result of the termination of its relationship with 
Philidor, making the materiality of Philidor painfully obvious to investors. In a release issued 
that same day, Valeant disclosed $51.3 million in “wind down” costs for Philidor. 
137. On June 7, 2016, Valeant announced its results for the first quarter of 2016. The 
results were not good, primarily because of the hit the Company had taken in having to shut 
down its clandestine network of specialty pharmacies. Specifically, revenues from Valeant’s 
skin care products – the very products that Valeant used Philidor to peddle – were down 43% 
from the same quarter in 2015. Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 34 of 68 PageID: 34
-32- II. DEFENDANTS’ FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS AND OMISSIONS 
A. Misrepresentations and Omissions about Valeant’s Ties to Philidor 
1. Valeant Misleads Investors about Its Alternate Fulfillment Program 
138. Throughout the relevant period, Defendants made several statements about the 
purported success of Valeant’s alternate fulfillment program without disclosing the truth about 
that program – i.e., that Valeant was secretly using Philidor to steer patients to Valeant products 
while concealing any links between Valeant and Philidor. Defendants’ decision to speak about 
the AF program without disclosing Valeant’s ties to and use of Philidor rendered their statements 
about alternative fulfillment materially incomplete and misleading. 
139. On January 4, 2013, Pearson and Schiller held an investor call to discuss 
Valeant’s financial guidance for 2013. During that call, Pearson discussed the alternate 
fulfillment program: “[T
o
re we
understand about it, the more excited we get about it, quite 
frankly because it’s not just a singular sort of initiative that there’s a while evolution being 
planned in terms of the Stage I, Stage II, Stage III. And there’s some exciting opportunities 
there that we are not going to give specifics of.” Later in in the call, Pearson spoke more about 
alternate fulfillment: “[T, if it all works out, will both help eliminate or get rid of non-
revenue producing or non-profitable scripts, but, hopefully, can be used to start generating truly 
profitable scripts through a different channel.” 
140. On February 28, 2013, Pearson and Schiller held an investor conference call 
where they again touted the benefits of the AF program. When asked, however, how the AF 
program contributes to growth, Pearson stated: “We have never given details. . . . So when I can 
give details in terms of what’s flowing through full alternate fulfillment, what’s not. What we 
can reiterate is that all of our key brands in dermatology . . . are now growing.” Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 35 of 68 PageID: 35
-33- 141. On May 8, 2014, Pearson and Schiller held an investor call to discuss Valeant’s 
first quarter results. During that call, Pearson was asked about the marketing of Valeant’s 
dermatology products. In response, Pearson referred to Valeant’s alternate fulfillment program: 
“[W
u
ch more sophis
t
icated alternate fulfillment system that we’ve 
implemented in the US, which is really helping. . . . [W’ve applied that to a number of our 
other products, which is also helping in terms of the growth.” 
142. The statements above in paragraphs 139 through 141, which caused Valeant 
securities to trade at artificially inflated prices, were materially misleading and incomplete 
because they failed to disclose the covert network of specialty pharmacies that Valeant was 
developing to implement its AF program. Valeant’s secretive deployment of Philidor to peddle 
its high-priced products over cheaper generic equivalents subjected Valeant to serious regulatory 
and reimbursement risks that would materialize if other participants in the industry knew of 
Valeant’s relationship with Philidor. Had they known that Philidor was effectively a division of 
Valeant, large PBMs would have scrutinized and denied reimbursement requests from Philidor 
because of the likelihood that the specialty pharmacy was just a shill for Valeant. This was 
subsequently confirmed when the three largest PBMs dropped Philidor from their networks after 
Philidor’s relationship with Valeant was revealed in late 2015. 
2. Valeant’s Failure to Disclose Its Connection to Philidor Prior to the 
Purchase Option Agreement 
143. After forming Philidor in January 2013, Valeant issued its quarterly financial 
reports without revealing that Philidor was a material VIE. Specifically: 
? On May 3, 2013, Valeant filed its quarterly report on Form 10-
Q with the SEC for the period ended March 31, 2013 (the 
“1Q2013 10-Q”). Valeant represented that the financial 
statements reported therein “have been prepared by the 
Company in United States (‘U.S.’) dollars and in accordance 
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (‘U.S. Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 36 of 68 PageID: 36
-34- GAAP’) for interim financial reporting.” However, those 
financial statements contained no mention of Philidor as a 
material unconsolidated VIE. 
? On August 7, 2013, Valeant filed its quarterly report on Form 
10-Q with the SEC for the period ended June 30, 2013 (the 
“2Q2013 10-Q”). Valeant again represented that the financial 
statements reported therein “have been prepared by the 
Company in United States (‘U.S.’) dollars and in accordance 
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (‘U.S. 
GAAP’) for interim financial reporting.” However, those 
financial statements again contained no mention of Philidor as 
a material unconsolidated VIE. 
? On November 1, 2013, Valeant filed its quarterly report on 
Form 10-Q with the SEC for the period ended September 30, 
2013 (the “3Q2013 10-Q”). Valeant again represented that the 
financial statements reported therein “have been prepared by 
the Company in United States (‘U.S.’) dollars and in 
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles 
(‘U.S. GAAP’) for interim financial reporting.” However, 
those financial statements again contained no mention of 
Philidor as a material unconsolidated VIE. 
144. On February 28, 2014, Valeant filed its annual report on Form 10-K with the SEC 
for the year ended December 31, 2013 (the “2013 10-K”). The 2013 10-K was signed by 
Pearson and Schiller. In the 2013 10-K, Valeant, Pearson and Schiller represented that the 
audited financial statements included therein were “prepared in accordance with U.S. generally 
accepted accounting principles.” In Note 2 to its Consolidated Financial Statements – entitled 
“Significant Accounting Policies” – Valeant, Pearson and Schiller represented that, “[t
no material arrangements determined to be variable interest entities.” They made this statement 
notwithstanding that Valeant had been operating Philidor effectively as a division of the 
Company for the entirety of 2013. 
145. Valeant’s quarterly financial statements for the first three quarters of 2014 also 
failed to disclose that Philidor was a material VIE. Specifically: Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 37 of 68 PageID: 37
-35- ?
On May 9, 2014, Valeant filed its quarterly report on Form 10-
Q with the SEC for the period ended March 31, 2014 (the 
“1Q2014 10-Q”). Valeant again represented that the financial 
statements reported therein “have been prepared by the 
Company in United States (‘U.S.’) dollars and in accordance 
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (‘U.S. 
GAAP’) for interim financial reporting.” However, those 
financial statements contained no mention of Philidor as a 
material unconsolidated VIE. 
? On August 1, 2014, Valeant filed its quarterly report on Form 
10-Q with the SEC for the period ended June 30, 2014 (the 
“2Q2014 10-Q”). Valeant again represented that the financial 
statements reported therein “have been prepared by the 
Company in United States (‘U.S.’) dollars and in accordance 
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (‘U.S. 
GAAP’) for interim financial reporting.” However, those 
financial statements again contained no mention of Philidor as 
a material unconsolidated VIE. 
? On October 24, 2014, Valeant filed its quarterly report on Form 
10-Q with the SEC for the period ended September 30, 2014 
(the “3Q2014 10-Q”). Valeant again represented that the 
financial statements reported therein “have been prepared by 
the Company in United States (‘U.S.’) dollars and in 
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles 
(‘U.S. GAAP’) for interim financial reporting.” However, 
those financial statements again contained no mention of 
Philidor as a material unconsolidated VIE. 
146. The statements above in paragraphs 143 through 145, which caused Valeant 
securities to trade at artificially inflated prices, were materially false, misleading and incomplete 
because the fact that Philidor was a material unconsolidated VIE required Defendants to disclose 
certain information about Philidor pursuant to ASC 810. Specifically, Valeant was required to 
disclose, among other things: (a) quantitative and qualitative information about Valeant’s ties to 
Philidor, including the “nature, purpose, size and activities” of Philidor, and how Philidor was 
financed; and (b) Valeant’s methodology for concluding that it was not required to consolidate 
Philidor’s financial statements with its own, including disclosure of key factors, assumptions and 
significant judgments used in making the determination. See ASC 810-10-50-5A. Moreover, Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 38 of 68 PageID: 38
-36- Valeant was required to disclose information concerning: (a) significant judgments and 
assumptions made in determining whether it needed to consolidate Philidor and/or disclose 
information about its involvement with Philidor; (b) the “nature of, and changes in, the risks 
associated with” Valeant’s involvement with Philidor; and (c) how Valeant’s involvement with 
Philidor affected Valeant’s “financial position, financial performance and cash flows.” See ASC 
810-10-50-8. 
147. Furthermore, each of Valeant’s 1Q2013 10-Q, 2Q2013 10-Q, 3Q2013 10-Q, 2013 
10-K, 1Q2014 10-Q, 2Q2014 10-Q, and 3Q2014 10-Q contained an MD&A section. However, 
Valeant failed to disclose Philidor as a distinct sales channel in any of those reports. The MD&A 
in each of each of Valeant’s 1Q2013 10-Q, 2Q2013 10-Q, 3Q2013 10-Q, 2013 10-K, 1Q2014 
10-Q, 2Q2014 10-Q, and 3Q2014 10-Q reports, which caused Valeant securities to trade at 
artificially inflated prices, was materially misleading and incomplete because, under SAB Topic 
13, Valeant had an obligation to disclose Philidor as a distinct sales channel in its MD&A. 
Specifically, Valeant was required to disclose Philidor as a “[cents into 
. . . a sales channel . . . that could be expected to have a significant effect on future sales or sale 
returns.” By the third quarter of 2015, sales through Philidor were accounting for at least 
approximately 7% of Valeant’s revenues, and likely more given the substantial decline in 
Valeant’s revenue following Philidor’s closure. Thus, Valeant was required to disclose its use of 
Philidor as a changing trend in a sales channel that was expected to have a significant effect on 
Valeant’s sales. 
148. The 2013 10-K was also materially false and misleading because Valeant failed to 
consolidate Philidor in its financial statements. Under ASC 810, Valeant was required to 
consolidate any VIE for which it was the primary beneficiary. As Philidor’s only client, Valeant Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 39 of 68 PageID: 39
-37- was the primary beneficiary of Philidor even prior to entering into the purchase option 
agreement. Accordingly, Valeant should have consolidated Philidor in its financial statements 
prior to 2014, and its failure to do so rendered its 2013 financial reports materially false and 
misleading. 
3. Valeant’s Failure to Disclose Its Connection to Philidor after the 
Purchase Option Agreement 
149. In December 2014, Valeant entered into the purchase option agreement with 
Philidor, which required Valeant to consolidate Philidor’s financials. However, Valeant still 
failed to disclose Philidor as a material consolidated VIE prior to October 2015. 
150. Specifically, on February 25, 2015, Valeant filed its annual report on Form 10-K 
for the year ended December 31, 2014 (“2014 10-K”). The 2014 10-K was signed by Pearson 
and Schiller. Valeant, Pearson and Schiller again represented that the audited financial 
statements included therein were “prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted 
accounting principles.” In Note 2 to its Consolidated Financial Statements – entitled “Significant 
Accounting Policies” – Valeant, Pearson and Schiller represented that, “[tated 
financial statements include the accounts of the Company and those of its subsidiaries and any 
variable interest entities (“VIEs”) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary.” In Note 3 
to its Consolidated Financial Statements – entitled “Business Combinations” – Valeant, Pearson 
and Schiller represented that, “[dthe year ended December 31, 2014, the Company 
completed other smaller acquisitions, including the consolidation of variable interest entities, 
which are not material individually or in the aggregate.” The 2014 10-K contained no references 
to Philidor. 
151. On April 30, 2015, Valeant filed its quarterly report on Form 10-Q with the SEC 
for the period ended March 31, 2014 (the “1Q2015 10-Q”). Valeant represented that the Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 40 of 68 PageID: 40
-38- financial statements reported therein “have been prepared by the Company in United States 
(‘U.S.’) dollars and in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (‘U.S. 
GAAP’) for interim financial reporting.” However, those financial statements again contained 
no mention of Philidor as a material consolidated VIE. 
152. On July 28, 2015, Valeant filed its quarterly report on Form 10-Q with the SEC 
for the period ended June 30, 2015 (the “2Q2015 10-Q”). Valeant again represented that the 
financial statements reported therein “have been prepared by the Company in United States 
(‘U.S.’) dollars and in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (‘U.S. 
GAAP’) for interim financial reporting.” However, those financial statements contained no 
mention of Philidor as a material consolidated VIE. 
153. The statements above in paragraphs 150 through 152, which caused Valeant 
securities to trade at artificially inflated prices, were materially false, misleading and incomplete 
because the fact that Philidor was a material consolidated VIE required Defendants to disclose 
certain information about Philidor pursuant to ASC 810. Specifically, Valeant was required to 
disclose, among other things, quantitative and qualitative information about Valeant’s ties to 
Philidor, including the “nature, purpose, size and activities” of Philidor, and how Philidor was 
financed. See ASC 810-10-50-5A. Additionally, Valeant was required under U.S. GAAP to 
disclose the factors that resulted in the consolidation of Philidor – i.e., the purchase option 
agreement with Philidor. See id. Moreover, Valeant was required to disclose information 
concerning: (a) significant judgments and assumptions made in determining whether it needed 
to consolidate Philidor and/or disclose information about its involvement with Philidor; (b) the 
“nature of, and changes in, the risks associated with” Valeant’s involvement with Philidor; and Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 41 of 68 PageID: 41
-39- (c) how Valeant’s involvement with Philidor affected Valeant’s “financial position, financial 
performance and cash flows.” See ASC 810-10-50-8. 
154. Furthermore, each of Valeant’s 2014 10-K, 1Q2015 10-Q, and 2Q2015 10-Q 
contained an MD&A section. However, Valeant failed to disclose Philidor as a distinct sales 
channel in any of those reports. The MD&A in each of each of Valeant’s 2014 10-K, 1Q2015 
10-Q, and 2Q2015 10-Q reports, which caused Valeant securities to trade at artificially inflated 
prices, was materially misleading and incomplete because, under SAB Topic 13, Valeant had an 
obligation to disclose Philidor as a distinct sales channel in its MD&A. Specifically, Valeant 
was required to disclose Philidor as a “[cents into . . . a sales channel . . 
. that could be expected to have a significant effect on future sales or sale returns.” SAB Topic 
13.B. By the third quarter of 2015, sales through Philidor were accounting for at least 
approximately 7% of Valeant’s revenues and likely far more given the substantial declines in 
Valeant’s revenues following Philidor’s closure. Thus, Valeant was required to disclose its use 
of Philidor as a changing trend in a sales channel that was expected to have a significant effect 
on Valeant’s sales. 
B. Misrepresentations Concerning the Reason for Valeant’s Steep Revenue 
Growth 
155. Throughout 2014 and 2015, Defendants repeatedly misrepresented that Valeant’s 
revenue growth was driven by organic factors, i.e., increased sales volume. However, 
Defendants’ statements were materially false and misleading because they failed to disclose that 
Valeant’s steep growth was actually caused by Valeant’s unsustainable practice of acquiring new 
medications and then raising the prices on those drugs. 
156. On January 7, 2014, Pearson and Schiller held an investor call to discuss 
Valeant’s financial guidance for 2014. During the conference, Pearson stated that Valeant’s Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 42 of 68 PageID: 42
-40- revenue growth was driven through organic growth of Valeant’s existing products: “[Valeant’s 
growth in revenuesis a result of achieving strong organic growth in a fiscally responsible 
manner for the products that we already own . . . .” 
157. On May 28, 2014, Valeant held an investor call to respond to accusations by 
Allergan that Valeant’s business model was based on price hikes and was not sustainable. In 
adamantly denying Allergan’s claims, Pearson told investors that Valeant “has delivered strong 
organic growth since I have been here.” 
158. Also on May 28, 2014, Pearson participated in the Sanford C. Bernstein Strategic 
Decisions Conference. Pearson was asked several questions during the conference about the 
drivers behind Valeant’s growth. After noting that Valeant’s ability to raise prices was capped 
for certain products, he told attendees: [We growth, and the vast majority of 
our growth on a global basis . . . is volume.” 
159. On June 17, 2014, Pearson and Schiller held an investor call to address additional 
questions raised by Allergan about Valeant’s business in trying to fend off a hostile takeover bid 
by Valeant. On that call, Pearson again stated that volume, not price, was the primary driver of 
Valeant’s growth. Pearson suggested that when Valeant breaks down its organic growth into 
“volume and price parts,” “I suspect it will be surprising to people because I think volume is a 
much larger piece of our organic growth than most people would assume it is.” 
160. On January 8, 2015, Pearson and Schiller held an investor call to discuss 
Valeant’s guidance for 2015. During that call, Pearson reflected on Valeant’s growth, stating: 
“Our robust organic growth profile is evidenced by our ability to deliver double-digit organic 
growth, not only in 2014 and 2015 but strong organic growth for the foreseeable future.” Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 43 of 68 PageID: 43
-41- 161. On April 29, 2015, Pearson and Schiller held an investor call in connection with 
the release of Valeant’s first quarter financial results. During the call, one analyst asked Pearson 
to quantify how price and volume contributed to Valeant’s first quarter growth. The analyst 
asked Pearson: “If you could just quantify a little bit, how much was price versus volume that 
contributed to growth in 1Q?” Pearson responded: 
In terms of price volume, actually volume was greater than price 
in terms of our growth. Outside the United States it’s all volume . 
. . . And in the U.S. it’s shifting more to volume than price, and 
we expect that to continue . . . . A lot of our prices, for most of our 
products, are negotiated with managed care. And there’s only a 
limited amount of price we can take. . . . So it’s primarily volume 
. . . . 
162. During the week of May 18, 2015, RBC Capital Markets hosted Valeant-related 
investor events in Canada at which Pearson spoke. During those events, the source of Valeant’s 
growth was questioned several times. In discussing Valeant’s growth, Pearson stated the 
following: “We’ve been accused of raising price, but our organic growth is more volume-based 
than price-based, and will continue to be.” 
163. On September 28, 2015, Valeant filed a Form 8-K with the SEC that attached a 
letter that Pearson had sent that day to Valeant’s employees. In that letter, Pearson made several 
statements about Valeant’s purported organic growth being driven by volume increases and not 
price increases. Specifically, Pearson stated: “Valeant is well-positioned for strong organic 
growth, even assuming little to no price increases.” Pearson further stated: “Valeant’s core 
operating principles include a focus on volume growth . . . . [The majority of our portfolio will 
continue to deliver strong volume-based organic growth and is not dependent on price 
increases.” 
164. The statements above in paragraphs 156 through 163, which caused Valeant 
securities to trade at artificially inflated prices, were materially false and misleading because Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 44 of 68 PageID: 44
-42- Valeant’s growth was not driven by organic volume growth, but by Valeant’s unsustainable 
practice of acquiring pharmaceuticals and immediately raising the prices on those drugs. Indeed, 
when appearing before the U.S. Senate on April 27, 2016, Pearson admitted that for each quarter 
(except one) between January 1, 2013 and September 30, 2015, “pricing has driven more 
growth than volume.” Furthermore, in a May 21, 2015 email to Pearson, Schiller stated that for 
the first quarter of 2015, price represented “about 80%” of Valeant’s growth. On February 4, 
2016, Schiller testified before Congress and confirmed that 80% of Valeant’s growth in the first 
quarter of 2015 was the result of price increases and not expanded market share. In addition, on 
October 19, 2015, Valeant released a presentation showing that its revenue growth for 2014 and 
the first three quarters of 2015 in the U.S. branded prescription portfolio was due more to price 
hikes that volume increases. 
III. SUMMARY OF DEFENDANTS’ SCIENTER 
165. Plaintiffs repeat and reallege each and every paragraph contained above as if set 
forth herein. 
166. Defendants Pearson and Schiller acted with scienter with respect to the materially 
false and misleading statements and omissions of material fact set forth above because they 
knew, or at the very least recklessly disregarded, that those statements were false when made. 
As the most senior executives of Valeant during the relevant time period, Pearson’s and 
Schiller’s scienter is imputable to Valeant. 
167. Pearson and Schiller knew, or at the very least recklessly disregarded, prior to 
October 19, 2015 that Philidor was effectively a division of Valeant whose sole purpose was to 
steer patients toward Valeant products even when much cheaper generic alternatives were 
available. In fact, Pearson and Schiller have never denied such knowledge, but rather admitted 
that they did not disclose the arrangement with Philidor because they believed it was a Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 45 of 68 PageID: 45
-43- competitive advantage. As explained above, Pearson frequently touted the benefits of Valeant’s 
alternate fulfillment program – which consisted of Philidor and its secret network of pharmacies 
– but refused to ever discuss “details” about that program. 
168. Valeant has also disclosed that prior to entering into the purchase option 
agreement with Philidor in December 2014, the majority of Valeant’s board of directors – of 
which both Pearson and Schiller were members – toured Philidor in person, and that Pearson and 
Schiller were responsible for the decision to enter into the purchase option agreement with 
Philidor. 
169. Pearson and Schiller admitted in an October 26, 2015 presentation to investors 
that it was they who determined “the appropriate accounting treatment” for Philidor. In doing 
so, Pearson and Schiller recklessly disregarded the requirements of ASC 810 and SAB Topic 13, 
which required them to disclose the “nature, purpose, size and activities” of Philidor, how 
Philidor was financed, significant judgments and assumptions made in determining whether 
Valeant needed to consolidate Philidor and/or disclose information about its involvement with 
Philidor, the “nature of, and changes in, the risks associated with” Valeant’s involvement with 
Philidor, and how Valeant’s involvement with Philidor affected Valeant’s “financial position, 
financial performance and cash flows.” See ASC 810-10-50-5A; ASC 810-10-50-8. Valeant 
was also required to disclose Philidor as a distinct sales channel in the MD&A in Valeant’s 
periodic filings with the SEC. See SAB Topic 13.B. 
170. Pearson and Schiller’s assertion in the October 26, 2015 presentation that they 
were not required to disclose Philidor because Valeant’s sales to Philidor did not account for 
more than 10% of its revenues is nothing more than a pretext for their reckless disregard of the 
accounting rules. Philidor was not a customer of Valeant; it was effectively operating as a Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 46 of 68 PageID: 46
-44- division of Valeant. Once Philidor’s financials were consolidated with Valeant, the notion that 
Philidor had to meet the 10% customer sales threshold for disclosure is rendered even more 
absurd because at that point even Valeant considered Philidor to be a part of Valeant and not a 
customer. 
171. Pearson and Schiller knew that the illegitimate sales channel they created was 
highly material to Valeant’s business. Indeed, their claim that Philidor was not material to 
Valeant is belied by the adverse financial impact that Philidor’s closure had on Valeant and by 
the market’s negative reaction to the several disclosures about Philidor from October 19, 2015 
and into the middle of 2016. 
172. The reason that Pearson and Schiller intentionally concealed Philidor is apparent. 
The concealment of Valeant’s relationship with Philidor was essential to Valeant being able to 
channel sales through Philidor. So long as the PBMs had no idea about the connection between 
Philidor and Valeant, they had no reason to suspect any collusion. Of course, when they 
eventually found out about Valeant’s deceptive use of Philidor to move Valeant products, the 
three major PBMs – which account for 80% of the market – immediately cut ties with Philidor. 
173. Pearson and Schiller knew, or at the very least recklessly disregarded, that 
between January 1, 2013 and September 30, 2015, Valeant’s steep revenue growth was driven 
not by organic volume increases, but rather primarily by Valeant’s unsustainable practice of 
acquiring medications and drastically increasing their prices. Indeed both Pearson and Schiller 
have since admitted that Valeant’s growth was the result of price increases, and not what was 
previously represented to the market. 
174. On April 27, 2016, Pearson appeared before Congress. In his prepared remarks, 
Pearson confessed that Valeant had “made mistakes” and that he personally was too aggressive Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 47 of 68 PageID: 47
-45- in seeking price increases to drive revenue: “[The company was too aggressive – and I, as its 
leader, was too aggressive – in pursuing price increases on certain drugs. Let me state plainly 
that it was a mistake to pursue, and in hindsight I regret pursuing, transactions where a central 
premise was planned increase in the prices of the medicines . . . .” 
175. During that hearing, Pearson was questioned by Senator McCaskill about whether 
growth was driven by price rather than volume between the first quarter of 2013 and the third 
quarter of 2015 for all but one quarter. In response, Pearson admitted that, “Yes, pricing has 
driven more growth than volume.” 
176. On February 4, 2016, Schiller appeared before Congress as Valeant’s acting CEO. 
Schiller admitted to the congressional panel that 80% of Valeant’s growth in the first quarter of 
2015 was the result of price increases and not expanded market share. 
177. Indeed, Valeant’s practice – at the behest of Pearson and Schiller – of driving 
revenue growth through price increases formed the core of its operations. Rather than follow the 
traditional model of developing new drugs by investing in R&D, Pearson and Schiller 
implemented a strategy of acquiring already developed drugs and increasing revenues through 
price hikes. Pearson and Schiller were thus well aware that organic volume increases were not 
the primary driver of Valeant’s revenue growth. 
178. As the CEO and CFO of Valeant, respectively, Pearson and Schiller were acutely 
aware of what was driving Valeant’s growth. This is corroborated by internal Valeant 
documents. For example, on May 21, 2015, Schiller sent Pearson an email with the subject, 
“price volume.” In that email, Schiller stated: “Last night, one of the investors asked about price 
vs volume for Q1. Excluding [Isuprel and Nitropress], price represented about 60% of our 
growth. If you include [Isuprel and Nitropressabout 80%.” Despite receiving Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 48 of 68 PageID: 48
-46- this emails from Schiller, Pearson continued to make misstatements about organic volume-driven 
growth. 
179. In 2016, both Pearson and Schiller were forced out of Valeant. 
IV. PRESUMPTION OF RELIANCE 
180. Plaintiffs intend to rely upon the presumption of reliance established by the fraud-
on-the-market doctrine in that, among other things: (a) Defendants made public 
misrepresentations or failed to disclose material facts during the relevant time period; (b) the 
omissions and misrepresentations were material; (c) Valeant securities traded in efficient 
markets; (d) the misrepresentations alleged would tend to induce a reasonable investor to 
misjudge the value of the Valeant securities; and (e) Plaintiffs purchased Valeant securities 
between the time Defendants misrepresented or failed to disclose material facts and the time 
when the true facts were disclosed, without knowledge of the misrepresented or omitted facts. 
181. The market for Valeant common stock was open, well-developed and efficient at 
all relevant times. As a result of the aforementioned materially false and misleading statements 
and failures to disclose, Valeant common stock traded at artificially inflated prices during the 
relevant period. The artificial inflation continued until the time the market fully came to realize 
the nature and extent of the Valeant’s misrepresentations and omissions concerning Valeant’s 
organic growth and Philidor. 
182. At all relevant times, the market for Valeant common stock was efficient for the 
following reasons, among others: (a) Valeant filed periodic reports with the SEC; (b) Valeant 
common stock met the requirements for listing, and was listed and actively traded, on the NYSE; 
(c) numerous analysts followed Valeant; and (d) Valeant regularly communicated with public 
investors via established market communication mechanisms, including through regular 
disseminations of press releases on the major news wire services and through other wide-ranging Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 49 of 68 PageID: 49
-47- public disclosures, such as communications with the financial press, securities analysts and other 
similar reporting services. 
183. Plaintiffs relied on the market price of Valeant’s common stock, which reflected 
all the information in the market, including the misstatements by Defendants. 
184. Plaintiffs are also entitled to a presumption of reliance under Affiliate Ute Citizens 
of Utah v. United States, 406 U.S. 128 (1972), because the claims asserted herein against 
Defendants are also predicated upon omissions of material facts which there was a duty to 
disclose. 
V. LOSS CAUSATION 
185. Defendants’ wrongful conduct, as alleged herein, directly and proximately caused 
the economic loss suffered by Plaintiffs. During the time that Plaintiffs purchased Valeant 
common stock, set forth in Exhibits A through B, the market price of those securities was 
artificially inflated as a direct result of Defendants’ materially false and misleading statements 
and omissions of material facts. As a series of partial but inadequate disclosures was issued 
correcting the prior false and misleading statements, as detailed above in paragraphs 97 through 
109, the price of those securities declined precipitously, and Plaintiffs were damaged. 
186. Defendants concealed the existence of Philidor and Valeant’s relationship to 
Philidor. In doing so, they concealed the foreseeable risk to Valeant’s business if market 
participants discovered the true nature of the relationship between Valeant and Philidor (i.e., that 
Philidor effectively was a division of Valeant) and that Valeant, through Philidor, had created an 
entire network of phantom captive pharmacies that Valeant was using to peddle its products. 
Beginning with the October 19, 2015 partial disclosure of Philidor by Valeant, that foreseeable 
risk gradually materialized, thus causing the price of Valeant securities to decline as detailed 
above. Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 50 of 68 PageID: 50
-48- 187. Defendants misrepresented to investors that Valeant’s revenue growth was driven 
primarily by organic volume growth. In doing so, they concealed the foreseeable risk that 
Valeant’s rapid growth was unsustainable if it was driven primarily by price increases on newly 
acquired drugs. Beginning with the October 4, 2015 partial disclosure that Valeant may not be 
well-positioned for growth even without price increases, that foreseeable risk gradually 
materialized, thus causing the price of Valeant securities to decline as detailed above. 
VI. NO SAFE HARBOR 
188. The statutory safe harbor provided for forward-looking statements under certain 
circumstances does not apply to any of the allegedly false statements pleaded in this Complaint. 
The specific statements pleaded herein were not “forward-looking statements” nor were they 
identified as “forward-looking statements” when made. Nor was it stated with respect to any of 
the statements forming the basis of this Complaint that actual results “could differ materially 
from those projected.” To the extent there were any forward-looking statements, there were no 
meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to 
differ materially from those in the purportedly forward-looking statements. Alternatively, to the 
extent that the statutory safe harbor does apply to any forward-looking statements pleaded 
herein, Defendants are liable for those false forward-looking statements because at the time each 
of those forward-looking statements was made, the particular speaker knew that the particular 
forward-looking statement was false, and/or the forward-looking statement was authorized 
and/or approved by an executive officer of Valeant who knew that those statements were false 
when made. Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 51 of 68 PageID: 51
-49- VII. FRAUD-BASED CAUSES OF ACTION 
FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION 
Violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 
Against All Defendants 

189. Plaintiffs repeat and reallege each and every paragraph contained above as if set 
forth herein. 
190. This cause of action is brought against Defendants Valeant, Pearson and Schiller 
for violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78j, and Rule 10b-5 
promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5. 
191. Defendants Valeant, Pearson and Schiller both directly and indirectly used the 
means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce in the United States to make the materially 
false and misleading statements and omissions of material fact alleged herein to: (i) deceive the 
investing public, including Plaintiffs, as alleged herein; (ii) artificially inflate and maintain the 
market price of Valeant securities; and (iii) cause Plaintiffs to purchase Valeant securities at 
artificially inflated prices. In furtherance of this unlawful scheme, plan and course of conduct, 
Valeant, Pearson and Schiller took the actions set forth above. 
192. Defendants Valeant, Pearson and Schiller both directly and indirectly: (i) 
employed devices, schemes and artifices to defraud; (ii) made untrue statements of material fact 
and/or omitted to state material facts necessary to make the statements not misleading; and (iii) 
engaged in acts, practices, and a course of business that operated as a fraud and deceit upon the 
purchasers of Valeant securities in an effort to artificially inflate and maintain the market prices 
for Valeant securities in violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5. 
193. By virtue of their high-level positions at the Company, Pearson and Schiller were 
authorized to make public statements, and made public statements on Valeant’s behalf. These Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 52 of 68 PageID: 52
-50- senior executives were privy to and participated in the creation, development, and issuance of the 
materially false and misleading statements alleged herein, and/or were aware of the Company’s 
and their own dissemination of information to the investing public that they recklessly 
disregarded was materially false and misleading. 
194. In addition, Valeant, Pearson and Schiller had a duty to disclose truthful 
information necessary to render their affirmative statements not materially misleading so that the 
market price of the Company’s common stock would be based on truthful, complete and accurate 
information. 
195. Defendants Valeant, Pearson and Schiller acted with knowledge or reckless 
disregard for the truth of the misrepresented and omitted facts alleged herein, in that they failed 
to ascertain and disclose the facts, even though such facts were known or readily available to 
them. Defendants Valeant’s, Pearson’s and Schiller’s material misrepresentations and omissions 
were done knowingly and/or recklessly, and had the effect of concealing the truth with respect to 
Valeant’s operations, business, performance and prospects from the investing public, including 
concealing the existence of certain information about Philidor that they had a legal obligation to 
disclose and misstating that Valeant’s growth derived from organic volume increases. By 
concealing these material facts from investors, Valeant, Pearson and Schiller supported the 
artificially inflated price of Valeant’s common stock. 
196. The dissemination of the materially false and misleading information and failure 
to disclose material facts, as set forth above, artificially inflated the market price of Valeant’s 
common stock. In ignorance of the fact that the market prices were artificially inflated, and 
relying directly or indirectly upon the materially false and misleading statements made by 
Defendants, and upon the integrity of the market in which the Company’s securities trade, or Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 53 of 68 PageID: 53
-51- upon the absence of material adverse information that was recklessly disregarded by Defendants, 
but not disclosed in public statements by Defendants, Plaintiffs purchased Valeant common 
stock at artificially inflated prices. As a series of partial but inadequate disclosures were issued, 
the price of Valeant’s securities substantially declined. 
197. At the time of the material misrepresentations alleged herein, Plaintiffs were 
ignorant of their falsity, and believed them to be true. Had Plaintiffs known the truth with 
respect to the business, operations, performance and prospects of Valeant, which was concealed 
by Defendants, Plaintiffs would not have purchased Valeant common stock, or if they had 
purchased such securities, they would not have done so at the artificially inflated prices that they 
paid. 
198. By virtue of the foregoing, Defendants Valeant, Pearson and Schiller have 
violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. 
199. As a direct and proximate result of Defendants Valeant’s, Pearson’s, and 
Schiller’s, wrongful conduct, Plaintiffs have suffered damages in connection with their 
transactions in the Company’s common stock. 
200. Plaintiffs have brought this claim within two years of discovery of the violations 
alleged herein, and within five years of the violations alleged herein. Consequently, this action is 
timely. 
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION 
Violations of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act 
Against Defendants Pearson and Schiller 

201. Plaintiffs repeat and reallege each and every allegation contained in each of the 
foregoing paragraphs as if set forth fully herein. Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 54 of 68 PageID: 54
-52- 202. This Cause of Action is asserted against Defendants Pearson and Schiller and is 
based upon Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78t(a). 
203. Each of Defendants Pearson and Schiller was at the time of the wrongs alleged 
herein a controlling person of Valeant within the meaning of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. 
204. By virtue of their high level positions, and their ownership and contractual rights, 
substantial participation in, and/or awareness of, the Company’s operations and/or knowledge or 
reckless disregard of the materially false and misleading statements filed with the SEC and 
disseminated to the investing public, Defendants Pearson and Schiller had the power to influence 
and control, and did in fact influence and control, directly or indirectly, the decision-making of 
the Company. 
205. Defendants Pearson and Schiller were provided with or had unlimited access to 
copies of the Company’s reports, press releases, public filings, and other statements alleged 
herein to be materially false and misleading prior to and/or shortly after these statements were 
issued and had the ability to prevent the issuance of the statements of cause the statements to be 
corrected. In particular, Defendants Pearson and Schiller each had direct and supervisory 
involvement in the day-to-day operations of the Company, and therefore are presumed to have 
had the power to control or influence the particular false and misleading statements and 
omissions giving rise to the securities violations alleged herein. 
206. Defendants Pearson and Schiller culpably participated in Valeant’s violation of 
Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 with respect to the First Cause of Action. 
207. By reason of the conduct alleged in the First Cause of Action, Valeant is liable for 
violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 55 of 68 PageID: 55
-53- Defendants Pearson and Schiller are liable pursuant to Section 20(a) based on their control of 
Valeant. 
208. Defendants Pearson and Schiller are liable for the aforesaid wrongful conduct, 
and are liable to Plaintiffs for the substantial damages suffered in connection with their purchases 
of Valeant securities. 
209. Plaintiffs have brought this claim within two years of discovery of the violations 
alleged herein, and within five years of the violations alleged herein. Consequently, this action is 
timely. Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 56 of 68 PageID: 56
-54- NEGLIGENCE-BASED CLAIMS 
210. For purposes of Plaintiffs’ Section 18 and negligent misrepresentation claims, 
Plaintiffs expressly disclaim any allegation of fraud or intentional misconduct. 
I. DEFENDANTS’ FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS AND OMISSIONS 
211. On February 28, 2014, Valeant filed its annual report on Form 10-K with the SEC 
for the year ended December 31, 2013 (the “2013 10-K”). The 2013 10-K was signed by 
Pearson and Schiller. In the 2013 10-K, Valeant, Pearson and Schiller represented that the 
audited financial statements included therein were “prepared in accordance with U.S. generally 
accepted accounting principles.” In Note 2 to its Consolidated Financial Statements – entitled 
“Significant Accounting Policies” – Valeant, Pearson and Schiller represented that, “[t
no material arrangements determined to be variable interest entities.” They made this statement 
notwithstanding that Valeant had been operating Philidor effectively as a division of the 
Company for the entirety of 2013. 
212. These statements, which caused Valeant securities to trade at artificially inflated 
prices, were materially false, misleading and incomplete because the fact that Philidor was a 
material unconsolidated VIE required Defendants to disclose certain information about Philidor 
pursuant to ASC 810. Specifically, Valeant was required to disclose, among other things: (a) 
quantitative and qualitative information about Valeant’s ties to Philidor, including the “nature, 
purpose, size and activities” of Philidor, and how Philidor was financed; and (b) Valeant’s 
methodology for concluding that it was not required to consolidate Philidor’s financial 
statements with its own, including disclosure of key factors, assumptions and significant 
judgments used in making the determination. See ASC 810-10-50-5A. Moreover, Valeant was 
required to disclose information concerning: (a) significant judgments and assumptions made in 
determining whether it needed to consolidate Philidor and/or disclose information about its Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 57 of 68 PageID: 57
-55- involvement with Philidor; (b) the “nature of, and changes in, the risks associated with” 
Valeant’s involvement with Philidor; and (c) how Valeant’s involvement with Philidor affected 
Valeant’s “financial position, financial performance and cash flows.” See ASC 810-10-50-8. 
213. Furthermore, Valeant’s 2013 10-K contained an MD&A section. However, 
Valeant failed to disclose Philidor as a distinct sales channel. The MD&A in Valeant’s 2013 10-
K, which caused Valeant securities to trade at artificially inflated prices, was materially 
misleading and incomplete because, under SAB Topic 13, Valeant had an obligation to disclose 
Philidor as a distinct sales channel in its MD&A. Specifically, Valeant was required to disclose 
Philidor as a “[c
e
nts into . . . a sales channel . . . that could be expected 
to have a significant effect on future sales or sale returns.” By the third quarter of 2015, sales 
through Philidor were accounting for at least approximately 7% of Valeant’s revenues, and likely 
more given the substantial decline in Valeant’s revenue following Philidor’s closure. Thus, 
Valeant was required to disclose its use of Philidor as a changing trend in a sales channel that 
was expected to have a significant effect on Valeant’s sales. 
214. The 2013 10-K was also materially false and misleading because Valeant failed to 
consolidate Philidor in its financial statements. Under ASC 810, Valeant was required to 
consolidate any VIE for which it was the primary beneficiary. As Philidor’s only client, Valeant 
was the primary beneficiary of Philidor even prior to entering into the purchase option 
agreement. Accordingly, Valeant should have consolidated Philidor in its financial statements 
prior to 2014, and its failure to do so rendered its 2013 financial reports materially false and 
misleading. Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 58 of 68 PageID: 58
-56- 215. In December 2014, Valeant entered into the purchase option agreement with 
Philidor, which required Valeant to consolidate Philidor’s financials. However, Valeant still 
failed to disclose Philidor as a material consolidated VIE prior to October 2015. 
216. Specifically, on February 25, 2015, Valeant filed its annual report on Form 10-K 
for the year ended December 31, 2014 (“2014 10-K”). The 2014 10-K was signed by Pearson 
and Schiller. Valeant, Pearson and Schiller again represented that the audited financial 
statements included therein were “prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted 
accounting principles.” In Note 2 to its Consolidated Financial Statements – entitled “Significant 
Accounting Policies” – Valeant, Pearson and Schiller represented that, “[t
financial statements include the accounts of the Company and those of its subsidiaries and any 
variable interest entities (“VIEs”) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary.” In Note 3 
to its Consolidated Financial Statements – entitled “Business Combinations” – Valeant, Pearson 
and Schiller represented that, “[de year ended December 31, 2014, the Company 
completed other smaller acquisitions, including the consolidation of variable interest entities, 
which are not material individually or in the aggregate.” The 2014 10-K contained no references 
to Philidor. 
217. These statements, which caused Valeant securities to trade at artificially inflated 
prices, were materially false, misleading and incomplete because the fact that Philidor was a 
material consolidated VIE required Defendants to disclose certain information about Philidor 
pursuant to ASC 810. Specifically, Valeant was required to disclose, among other things, 
quantitative and qualitative information about Valeant’s ties to Philidor, including the “nature, 
purpose, size and activities” of Philidor, and how Philidor was financed. See ASC 810-10-50-
5A. Additionally, Valeant was required under U.S. GAAP to disclose the factors that resulted in Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 59 of 68 PageID: 59
-57- the consolidation of Philidor – i.e., the purchase option agreement with Philidor. See id. 
Moreover, Valeant was required to disclose information concerning: (a) significant judgments 
and assumptions made in determining whether it needed to consolidate Philidor and/or disclose 
information about its involvement with Philidor; (b) the “nature of, and changes in, the risks 
associated with” Valeant’s involvement with Philidor; and (c) how Valeant’s involvement with 
Philidor affected Valeant’s “financial position, financial performance and cash flows.” See ASC 
810-10-50-8. 
218. Furthermore, Valeant’s 2014 10-K contained an MD&A section. However, 
Valeant failed to disclose Philidor as a distinct sales channel in that report. The MD&A in 
Valeant’s 2014 10-K, which caused Valeant securities to trade at artificially inflated prices, was 
materially misleading and incomplete because, under SAB Topic 13, Valeant had an obligation 
to disclose Philidor as a distinct sales channel in its MD&A. Specifically, Valeant was required 
to disclose Philidor as a “[cments into . . . a sales channel . . . that could 
be expected to have a significant effect on future sales or sale returns.” SAB Topic 13.B. By the 
third quarter of 2015, sales through Philidor were accounting for at least approximately 7% of 
Valeant’s revenues and likely far more given the substantial declines in Valeant’s revenues 
following Philidor’s closure. Thus, Valeant was required to disclose its use of Philidor as a 
changing trend in a sales channel that was expected to have a significant effect on Valeant’s 
sales. 







Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 60 of 68 PageID: 60
-58- II. SUMMARY OF DEFENDANTS’ NEGLIGENCE 
219. Had Pearson acted with the standard of care required of a CEO of a public 
company, and had Schiller acted with the standard of care required of a CFO of a public 
company, they would have been aware that Philidor was effectively a division of Valeant whose 
sole purpose was to steer patients toward Valeant products even when much cheaper generic 
alternatives were available, that Philidor was a material VIE, and that Valeant was required to 
disclose certain information about Philidor in its periodic reports filed with the SEC between 
2013 and 2015. 
220. In failing to exercise the care required of a CEO of a public company, Pearson 
was negligent in making materially false and misleading statements and omissions of material 
facts, and acted in bad faith, concerning Philidor. 
221. In failing to exercise the care required of a CFO of a public company, Schiller 
was negligent in making materially false and misleading statements and omissions of material 
facts, and acted in bad faith, concerning Philidor. 
222. Given the positions as the most senior executives of Valeant, Pearson’s and 
Schiller’s negligence is imputable to Valeant. 
III. PLAINTIFFS’ ACTUAL RELIANCE 
223. During the relevant period, Plaintiffs were managed by their investment advisor, 
MSD Partners. MSD Partners made the investment decisions with respect to Plaintiffs’ 
purchases of Valeant securities. Factors considered by MSD Partners in making such decisions 
included, among other things, Valeant’s financial performance and a review of the Company’s 
strengths, weaknesses and opportunities. 
224. Prior to making the decision to purchase Valeant securities, an investment analyst 
at MSD Partners actually read, reviewed and relied upon Valeant’s 2013 10-K, including Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 61 of 68 PageID: 61
-59- Defendants’ statement that, “[trial arrangements determined to be variable 
interest entities.” 
225. Prior to making the decision to purchase Valeant securities, an investment analyst 
at MSD Partners actually read, reviewed and relied upon Valeant’s 2014 10-K, including 
Defendants’ statements that: (a) “[tatements include the accounts of 
the Company and those of its subsidiaries and any variable interest entities (“VIEs”) for which 
the Company is the primary beneficiary”; and (b) “[d
the Company completed other smaller acquisitions, including the consolidation of variable 
interest entities, which are not material individually or in the aggregate.” 
226. Defendants’ statements concerning the absence of any material VIEs were 
material to MSD Partners’ decision to purchase Valeant securities on Plaintiffs’ behalf. If 
Valeant had a relationship with VIE that was material to Valeant’s business, such as Philidor, it 
was important for Valeant to disclose certain information about that VIE. Without such 
information, MSD Partners could not accurately assess the impact of the VIE on Valeant’s 
operations, performance and opportunities. 
227. The investment analyst at MSD Partners actually relied upon information 
contained in Valeant’s 2013 10-K and 2014 10-K (to the extent each such document was on file 
with the SEC at the time) in making each purchase set forth on Exhibits A through B on behalf 
of Plaintiffs. 
IV. LOSS CAUSATION 
228. Defendants’ wrongful conduct, as alleged herein, directly and proximately caused 
the economic loss suffered by Plaintiffs. During the time that Plaintiffs purchased Valeant 
common stock, set forth in Exhibits A through B, the market price of those securities was 
artificially inflated as a direct result of Defendants’ materially false and misleading statements Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 62 of 68 PageID: 62
-60- and omissions of material facts. As a series of partial but inadequate disclosures was issued 
correcting the prior false and misleading statements, as detailed above in paragraphs 97 through 
109, the price of those securities declined precipitously, and Plaintiffs were damaged. 
229. Defendants concealed the existence of Philidor and Valeant’s relationship to 
Philidor. In doing so, they concealed the foreseeable risk to Valeant’s business if market 
participants discovered the true nature of the relationship between Valeant and Philidor (i.e., that 
Philidor effectively was a division of Valeant) and that Valeant, through Philidor, had created an 
entire network of phantom captive pharmacies that Valeant was using to peddle its products. 
Beginning with the October 19, 2015 partial disclosure of Philidor by Valeant, that foreseeable 
risk gradually materialized, thus causing the price of Valeant securities to decline as detailed 
above. 
V. NO SAFE HARBOR 
230. The statutory safe harbor provided for forward-looking statements under certain 
circumstances does not apply to any of the allegedly false statements pleaded in this Complaint. 
The specific statements pleaded herein were not “forward-looking statements” nor were they 
identified as “forward-looking statements” when made. Nor was it stated with respect to any of 
the statements forming the basis of this Complaint that actual results “could differ materially 
from those projected.” To the extent there were any forward-looking statements, there were no 
meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to 
differ materially from those in the purportedly forward-looking statements. Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 63 of 68 PageID: 63
-61- VI. NEGLIGENCE-BASED CAUSES OF ACTION 
THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION 
Violations of Section 18 of the Exchange Act 
Against All Defendants 

231. Plaintiffs repeat and reallege each and every allegation contained in paragraphs 
210 through 230 above as if set forth herein. As to this Cause of Action, Plaintiffs expressly 
disclaim any allegation of fraud or intentional misconduct. 
232. As alleged herein, Defendants caused (at least negligently) statements to be made 
in Valeant’s 2013 10-K, including statements concerning the lack of any material variable 
interest entities, which statements were, at the time and in light of the circumstances under which 
they were made, false or misleading with respect to material facts. 
233. As alleged herein, Defendants caused (at least negligently) statements to be made 
in Valeant’s 2014 10-K, including statements concerning the immateriality of any consolidated 
variable interest entities and acquisitions, which statements were, at the time and in light of the 
circumstances under which they were made, false or misleading with respect to material facts. 
234. In purchasing Valeant’s, Plaintiffs’ investment team actually read, and had direct 
eyeball reliance on, Valeant’s 2013 10-K and 2014 10-K. 
235. Specifically, an investment analyst at MSD Partners read and actually relied upon 
information contained in Valeant’s 2013 10-K and 2014 10-K (to the extent each such document 
was on file with the SEC at the time) in making each purchase set forth on Exhibits A through B 
on behalf of Plaintiffs, as further described above in paragraphs 223 through 227. 
236. In ignorance of the falsity of Defendants’ statements and omissions, or of the true 
facts, Plaintiffs purchased Valeant securities in actual, eyeball reliance upon Defendants’ 
representations. Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 64 of 68 PageID: 64
-62- 237. Defendants’ materially false and misleading statements and omissions of material 
fact artificially inflated the price of Valeant common stock. 
238. Had they known the true facts, Plaintiffs would not have purchased the Valeant 
securities and/or would not have purchased them at the inflated prices they paid. 
239. Upon disclosure of the true facts, the price of Valeant securities dropped, and 
Plaintiffs suffered damages in an amount to be proven at trial. 
240. By reason of the foregoing, Defendants Valeant, Pearson and Schiller are liable to 
Plaintiffs for violations of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. §78r. 
241. Plaintiffs have brought this claim within one year of discovery of the violations 
alleged herein, and within three years of the accrual of this cause of action. Consequently, this 
action is timely. 
FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION 
Negligent Misrepresentation 
Against All Defendants 

242. Plaintiffs repeat and reallege each and every allegation contained in paragraphs 
210 through 241 above as if set forth herein. As to this Cause of Action, Plaintiffs expressly 
disclaim any allegation of fraud or intentional misconduct. 
243. Defendants Valeant, Pearson and Schiller authorized or caused the representations 
and/or omissions set forth above in paragraphs 211 through 218. 
244. These Defendants supplied false information for use by Plaintiffs in making an 
investment decision. 
245. Defendants Valeant, Pearson and Schiller made misrepresentations that they 
knew, or should have known, to be false in order to induce Plaintiffs to purchase Valeant 
securities. Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 65 of 68 PageID: 65
-63- 246. Defendants Valeant, Pearson and Schiller breached their duty to exercise 
reasonable care in making these misrepresentations to Plaintiffs. 
247. Moreover, Defendants had a duty to disclose certain information concerning 
Philidor. Defendants Valeant, Pearson and Schiller breached that duty by failing to disclose such 
information. 
248. Plaintiffs reasonably relied on the information Defendants Valeant, Pearson and 
Schiller provided and were damaged as a result of these misrepresentations and omissions. 
Plaintiffs would not have purchased Valeant securities at all, or at the inflated prices they paid, 
had they known the true facts regarding, inter alia, Philidor. 
249. By reason of the foregoing, Defendants are liable to Plaintiffs for negligent 
misrepresentation. 
250. As a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ negligent misrepresentations, 
Plaintiffs have suffered damages in an amount to be proven at trial. Case 3:16-cv-07324-MAS-LHG Document 1 Filed 10/14/16 Page 66 of 68 PageID: 66
-64- PRAYER FOR RELIEF 
WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request relief and judgment, as follows: 
(a) Awarding compensatory damages against Defendants for all damages sustained as 
a result of Defendants’ wrongdoing, in an amount to be proven at trial, including pre-judgment

MSD Ignition is at the Forefront of Performance Ignition Technology
MSD doesn’t just manufacture ignitions and ignition system parts, they create them. They were the innovators of the first multiple-spark discharge ignition control box, and since that breakthrough they’ve continued to change the concepts of ignition by reengineering ignition boxes, billet distributors, ignition coils of all types, and plug wires. And they’re not done yet. MSD continues to improve their existing product line and develop innovative products.
The benefits of MSD are numerous:
