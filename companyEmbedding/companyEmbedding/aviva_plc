					Specify that multiple subroutines should use the same Objects.  Maybe you’ve

					got an initialization routine you’d like in one subroutine, and a process you want in another.  

					They can share an object, so you don’t have to pass data between the two.




					View your data and create operator controls with

					Awesome, Free HMI

					Meet Branch








					Expansion has a vLink input port instead of USB. 

					Expansions are otherwise physically identical to Branch Main.

					Expansion units have full PLC processing power and memory.




					vBuilder’s power shines with Branch 

					Put subroutines inside of IO units to focus processing where it’s most needed.

A Value | D Growth | A Momentum | B VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Aviva PLC

Aviva to sell FPIL

RNS Number : 4699L Aviva PLC 19 July 2017  

 
19 July 2017
 
AVIVA TO SELL FPIL
 
 
Aviva plc ("Aviva") announces the sale of Friends Provident International Limited ("FPIL") to RL360 Holding Company Limited, a subsidiary of International Financial Group Limited, for a total consideration of £340m*.
 
Following a strategic review of FPIL, Aviva has concluded that the business is not central to the group's strategy to focus on a small number of markets where it has scale and profitability or a distinct competitive advantage. The sale of FPIL will allow Aviva to further reallocate capital to businesses that can achieve leading market positions and deliver superior returns.
 
The consideration represents a multiple of 3.2x FPIL's 2016 net asset value. The transaction will result in an increase of approximately £100m in Aviva's Solvency II capital surplus. The transaction will also create an IFRS loss on disposal of approximately £130m, which is primarily due to the intangible assets held on Aviva's balance sheet arising from Aviva's acquisition of FPIL in 2015. 
 
In 2016, FPIL made a post-tax loss of £2m and did not remit any cash to Aviva Group. As a result, a disposal of FPIL is expected to be positive to Aviva's cash dividend paying capacity.
 
FPIL will continue to serve customers, partners and intermediaries as usual and there is no change to customers' policies as a result of today's announcement.
 
The transaction is subject to customary regulatory approvals and is expected to complete in early 2018.
 
Chris Wei, Executive Chairman, Aviva Asia & FPIL, said:
 
"The sale of Friends Provident International Limited is a good outcome for Aviva. It allows us to focus on the significant opportunities we have to grow Aviva's business across Asia through digital and disrupting the traditional insurance industry."

Name[edit]
The name of the company upon its formation in May 2000 was CGNU plc.[5] In April 2002 the company's shareholders voted to change the company name to "Aviva plc", an invented word derived from "viva", the Latin for 'alive' and designed to be short, memorable and work worldwide.[6] In April 2008 Aviva announced that it would adopt the "Aviva" name as its worldwide consumer-facing brand, and that the Norwich Union brand would be phased out in the United Kingdom.[7]
History[edit]
Aviva can trace its history back to the establishment of the Hand in Hand Fire & Life Insurance Society in London in 1696.[8][9]

It was created by a merger of two British insurance firms, Norwich Union and CGU plc[10] (itself created by the 1998 merger of Commercial Union and General Accident[11]) as CGNU in 2000. The Aviva name was adopted in July 2002.[12] Thereafter, most of the group operations, except for some strong local brands, were carried out under the uniform brand "Aviva".[13]
During March 2005 Aviva acquired the RAC plc breakdown recovery operation for around £1.1 billion.[14]
In July 2006, Aviva greatly increased its presence in the United States by acquiring AmerUs Group, a Des Moines-based financial services company founded in 1896 in a $2.9 billion (£1.6 billion) deal.[15] AmerUs Group was rebranded as Aviva USA when the acquisition was completed.
The Company continued to use the Norwich Union name as a trading name in the UK until 1 June 2009 when it became formally known as Aviva within the United Kingdom. The launch was supported by a £9 million advertising campaign to promote the rebranding (one of the most expensive ever in the UK insurance field), with the participation of celebrities including Bruce Willis and Alice Cooper.[16]
In June 2009 the Company decided to dispose of Navigator, its Australian wealth management business, to National Australia Bank for A$825 million (£401 million).[17]
In October 2009 the company decided to focus on its commercial insurance sector and demonstrate its commitment to brokers by launching their 'find a broker' facility, using the British Insurance Brokers Association search engine. To help them with this endeavour, Paul Whitehouse was recruited to play the part of a successful hairdresser running three salons. The message of the campaign focused on business insurance through insurance brokers.[18] The closing line of the campaign was "We're in business to keep you in business".
In September 2011, Aviva completed the sale of RAC plc breakdown recovery operation for £1.0 billion to The Carlyle Group.[19]
In February 2012, Aviva sold its occupational health business to the British support services company Capita.[20][21]
In July 2012, Aviva announced plans to sell or close 16 non-core businesses in order to simplify its activities and boost shareholder returns.[22] As part of the plans Aviva announced the sale of its operations in South Korea and the closure to new business of its bulk-buying annuity unit in the United Kingdom.[22]
In August 2012, Aviva announced that up to 800 jobs would be lost following a reorganization caused by further turmoil in the Eurozone.[23]
In December 2012, Aviva agreed to sell Aviva USA Corporation to Athene Holding for US$1.8 billion (£1.1 billion) as part of a plan to improve shareholder returns and reduce the group's capital requirements.[24][25] Athene subsequently sold the life insurance business of Aviva to Global Atlantic.[26]
On 13 April 2015, Aviva completed the £5.6 billion all-share takeover of Friends Life Group. Andy Briggs, current group chief executive of Friends Life, became CEO of Aviva UK Life, with Mark Wilson continuing as CEO of the enlarged Aviva Group.[27]
In July 2016, Aviva froze withdrawals from the Aviva Investors Property Trust after announcing a lack of liquidity.[28][29][30]
Operations[edit]




St. Helen's, Aviva's world headquarters in London


Aviva's main activities are the provision of general and life insurance, long-term savings products and fund management services. The group has around 29,600 employees, 33 million customers and Aviva Investors has £289.9 billion assets under management.[3]

Following the completion of Friends Life Group Limited in April 2015, Friends Provident International Limited is now part of the Aviva Group.[27]
Senior management[edit]
CEO Richard Harvey retired on 11 July 2007. His successor was Andrew Moss, the former group finance director.[31] Moss was paid an annual base salary of £925,000 for his role as Chief Executive.[32] Moss resigned on 8 May 2012 after shareholders voted down a proposed senior management pay deal which would have seen Moss increase his basic pay by 5% despite several years of Aviva underperformance.[33] John McFarlane was appointed to the board of Aviva plc in September 2011. Following the departure of Aviva’s CEO, Andrew Moss,[33] McFarlane assumed the role of executive deputy chairman and became executive chairman on 1 July 2012. On 20 November 2012, Aviva announced that Mark Wilson had been appointed CEO, starting 1 January 2013.[34] On 12 September 2014 Aviva announced that Sir Adrian Montague would become non-executive chairman on the retirement of John McFarlane at the Aviva AGM in April 2015.[35]
Sponsorships[edit]
In May 2008 Aviva became Norwich City Football Club's main sponsor. In a 2009 television advert starring Paul Whitehouse they feature a Plymouth Argyle F.C. fan who uses Aviva car insurance followed by a Green Army chant.[36] It also acquired the naming rights for the redeveloped Lansdowne Road stadium in Dublin, Ireland, and will now be called the Aviva Stadium.[37]
In 2010, Aviva also took over sponsorship of rugby union's English Premiership from Guinness. The initial four-year sponsorship deal saw £20 million invested into club Rugby.[38] In July 2013, Aviva extended its title sponsorship of the Premiership until July 2017.[39]

Name[edit]
The name of the company upon its formation in May 2000 was CGNU plc.[5] In April 2002 the company's shareholders voted to change the company name to "Aviva plc", an invented word derived from "viva", the Latin for 'alive' and designed to be short, memorable and work worldwide.[6] In April 2008 Aviva announced that it would adopt the "Aviva" name as its worldwide consumer-facing brand, and that the Norwich Union brand would be phased out in the United Kingdom.[7]
History[edit]
Aviva can trace its history back to the establishment of the Hand in Hand Fire & Life Insurance Society in London in 1696.[8][9]

It was created by a merger of two British insurance firms, Norwich Union and CGU plc[10] (itself created by the 1998 merger of Commercial Union and General Accident[11]) as CGNU in 2000. The Aviva name was adopted in July 2002.[12] Thereafter, most of the group operations, except for some strong local brands, were carried out under the uniform brand "Aviva".[13]
During March 2005 Aviva acquired the RAC plc breakdown recovery operation for around £1.1 billion.[14]
In July 2006, Aviva greatly increased its presence in the United States by acquiring AmerUs Group, a Des Moines-based financial services company founded in 1896 in a $2.9 billion (£1.6 billion) deal.[15] AmerUs Group was rebranded as Aviva USA when the acquisition was completed.
The Company continued to use the Norwich Union name as a trading name in the UK until 1 June 2009 when it became formally known as Aviva within the United Kingdom. The launch was supported by a £9 million advertising campaign to promote the rebranding (one of the most expensive ever in the UK insurance field), with the participation of celebrities including Bruce Willis and Alice Cooper.[16]
In June 2009 the Company decided to dispose of Navigator, its Australian wealth management business, to National Australia Bank for A$825 million (£401 million).[17]
In October 2009 the company decided to focus on its commercial insurance sector and demonstrate its commitment to brokers by launching their 'find a broker' facility, using the British Insurance Brokers Association search engine. To help them with this endeavour, Paul Whitehouse was recruited to play the part of a successful hairdresser running three salons. The message of the campaign focused on business insurance through insurance brokers.[18] The closing line of the campaign was "We're in business to keep you in business".
In September 2011, Aviva completed the sale of RAC plc breakdown recovery operation for £1.0 billion to The Carlyle Group.[19]
In February 2012, Aviva sold its occupational health business to the British support services company Capita.[20][21]
In July 2012, Aviva announced plans to sell or close 16 non-core businesses in order to simplify its activities and boost shareholder returns.[22] As part of the plans Aviva announced the sale of its operations in South Korea and the closure to new business of its bulk-buying annuity unit in the United Kingdom.[22]
In August 2012, Aviva announced that up to 800 jobs would be lost following a reorganization caused by further turmoil in the Eurozone.[23]
In December 2012, Aviva agreed to sell Aviva USA Corporation to Athene Holding for US$1.8 billion (£1.1 billion) as part of a plan to improve shareholder returns and reduce the group's capital requirements.[24][25] Athene subsequently sold the life insurance business of Aviva to Global Atlantic.[26]
On 13 April 2015, Aviva completed the £5.6 billion all-share takeover of Friends Life Group. Andy Briggs, current group chief executive of Friends Life, became CEO of Aviva UK Life, with Mark Wilson continuing as CEO of the enlarged Aviva Group.[27]
In July 2016, Aviva froze withdrawals from the Aviva Investors Property Trust after announcing a lack of liquidity.[28][29][30]
Operations[edit]




St. Helen's, Aviva's world headquarters in London


Aviva's main activities are the provision of general and life insurance, long-term savings products and fund management services. The group has around 29,600 employees, 33 million customers and Aviva Investors has £289.9 billion assets under management.[3]

Following the completion of Friends Life Group Limited in April 2015, Friends Provident International Limited is now part of the Aviva Group.[27]
Senior management[edit]
CEO Richard Harvey retired on 11 July 2007. His successor was Andrew Moss, the former group finance director.[31] Moss was paid an annual base salary of £925,000 for his role as Chief Executive.[32] Moss resigned on 8 May 2012 after shareholders voted down a proposed senior management pay deal which would have seen Moss increase his basic pay by 5% despite several years of Aviva underperformance.[33] John McFarlane was appointed to the board of Aviva plc in September 2011. Following the departure of Aviva’s CEO, Andrew Moss,[33] McFarlane assumed the role of executive deputy chairman and became executive chairman on 1 July 2012. On 20 November 2012, Aviva announced that Mark Wilson had been appointed CEO, starting 1 January 2013.[34] On 12 September 2014 Aviva announced that Sir Adrian Montague would become non-executive chairman on the retirement of John McFarlane at the Aviva AGM in April 2015.[35]
Sponsorships[edit]
In May 2008 Aviva became Norwich City Football Club's main sponsor. In a 2009 television advert starring Paul Whitehouse they feature a Plymouth Argyle F.C. fan who uses Aviva car insurance followed by a Green Army chant.[36] It also acquired the naming rights for the redeveloped Lansdowne Road stadium in Dublin, Ireland, and will now be called the Aviva Stadium.[37]
In 2010, Aviva also took over sponsorship of rugby union's English Premiership from Guinness. The initial four-year sponsorship deal saw £20 million invested into club Rugby.[38] In July 2013, Aviva extended its title sponsorship of the Premiership until July 2017.[39]

In December 2012, Aviva agreed to sell Aviva USA Corporation to Athene Holding for US$1.8 billion (£1.1 billion) as part of a plan to improve shareholder returns and reduce the group's capital requirements.[24][25] Athene subsequently sold the life insurance business of Aviva to Global Atlantic.[26]
On 13 April 2015, Aviva completed the £5.6 billion all-share takeover of Friends Life Group. Andy Briggs, current group chief executive of Friends Life, became CEO of Aviva UK Life, with Mark Wilson continuing as CEO of the enlarged Aviva Group.[27]
In July 2016, Aviva froze withdrawals from the Aviva Investors Property Trust after announcing a lack of liquidity.[28][29][30]

Senior management[edit]
CEO Richard Harvey retired on 11 July 2007. His successor was Andrew Moss, the former group finance director.[31] Moss was paid an annual base salary of £925,000 for his role as Chief Executive.[32] Moss resigned on 8 May 2012 after shareholders voted down a proposed senior management pay deal which would have seen Moss increase his basic pay by 5% despite several years of Aviva underperformance.[33] John McFarlane was appointed to the board of Aviva plc in September 2011. Following the departure of Aviva’s CEO, Andrew Moss,[33] McFarlane assumed the role of executive deputy chairman and became executive chairman on 1 July 2012. On 20 November 2012, Aviva announced that Mark Wilson had been appointed CEO, starting 1 January 2013.[34] On 12 September 2014 Aviva announced that Sir Adrian Montague would become non-executive chairman on the retirement of John McFarlane at the Aviva AGM in April 2015.[35]
Sponsorships[edit]
In May 2008 Aviva became Norwich City Football Club's main sponsor. In a 2009 television advert starring Paul Whitehouse they feature a Plymouth Argyle F.C. fan who uses Aviva car insurance followed by a Green Army chant.[36] It also acquired the naming rights for the redeveloped Lansdowne Road stadium in Dublin, Ireland, and will now be called the Aviva Stadium.[37]
In 2010, Aviva also took over sponsorship of rugby union's English Premiership from Guinness. The initial four-year sponsorship deal saw £20 million invested into club Rugby.[38] In July 2013, Aviva extended its title sponsorship of the Premiership until July 2017.[39]

Name[edit]
The name of the company upon its formation in May 2000 was CGNU plc.[5] In April 2002 the company's shareholders voted to change the company name to "Aviva plc", an invented word derived from "viva", the Latin for 'alive' and designed to be short, memorable and work worldwide.[6] In April 2008 Aviva announced that it would adopt the "Aviva" name as its worldwide consumer-facing brand, and that the Norwich Union brand would be phased out in the United Kingdom.[7]
History[edit]
Aviva can trace its history back to the establishment of the Hand in Hand Fire & Life Insurance Society in London in 1696.[8][9]

It was created by a merger of two British insurance firms, Norwich Union and CGU plc[10] (itself created by the 1998 merger of Commercial Union and General Accident[11]) as CGNU in 2000. The Aviva name was adopted in July 2002.[12] Thereafter, most of the group operations, except for some strong local brands, were carried out under the uniform brand "Aviva".[13]
During March 2005 Aviva acquired the RAC plc breakdown recovery operation for around £1.1 billion.[14]
In July 2006, Aviva greatly increased its presence in the United States by acquiring AmerUs Group, a Des Moines-based financial services company founded in 1896 in a $2.9 billion (£1.6 billion) deal.[15] AmerUs Group was rebranded as Aviva USA when the acquisition was completed.
The Company continued to use the Norwich Union name as a trading name in the UK until 1 June 2009 when it became formally known as Aviva within the United Kingdom. The launch was supported by a £9 million advertising campaign to promote the rebranding (one of the most expensive ever in the UK insurance field), with the participation of celebrities including Bruce Willis and Alice Cooper.[16]
In June 2009 the Company decided to dispose of Navigator, its Australian wealth management business, to National Australia Bank for A$825 million (£401 million).[17]
In October 2009 the company decided to focus on its commercial insurance sector and demonstrate its commitment to brokers by launching their 'find a broker' facility, using the British Insurance Brokers Association search engine. To help them with this endeavour, Paul Whitehouse was recruited to play the part of a successful hairdresser running three salons. The message of the campaign focused on business insurance through insurance brokers.[18] The closing line of the campaign was "We're in business to keep you in business".
In September 2011, Aviva completed the sale of RAC plc breakdown recovery operation for £1.0 billion to The Carlyle Group.[19]
In February 2012, Aviva sold its occupational health business to the British support services company Capita.[20][21]
In July 2012, Aviva announced plans to sell or close 16 non-core businesses in order to simplify its activities and boost shareholder returns.[22] As part of the plans Aviva announced the sale of its operations in South Korea and the closure to new business of its bulk-buying annuity unit in the United Kingdom.[22]
In August 2012, Aviva announced that up to 800 jobs would be lost following a reorganization caused by further turmoil in the Eurozone.[23]
In December 2012, Aviva agreed to sell Aviva USA Corporation to Athene Holding for US$1.8 billion (£1.1 billion) as part of a plan to improve shareholder returns and reduce the group's capital requirements.[24][25] Athene subsequently sold the life insurance business of Aviva to Global Atlantic.[26]
On 13 April 2015, Aviva completed the £5.6 billion all-share takeover of Friends Life Group. Andy Briggs, current group chief executive of Friends Life, became CEO of Aviva UK Life, with Mark Wilson continuing as CEO of the enlarged Aviva Group.[27]
In July 2016, Aviva froze withdrawals from the Aviva Investors Property Trust after announcing a lack of liquidity.[28][29][30]

Senior management[edit]
CEO Richard Harvey retired on 11 July 2007. His successor was Andrew Moss, the former group finance director.[31] Moss was paid an annual base salary of £925,000 for his role as Chief Executive.[32] Moss resigned on 8 May 2012 after shareholders voted down a proposed senior management pay deal which would have seen Moss increase his basic pay by 5% despite several years of Aviva underperformance.[33] John McFarlane was appointed to the board of Aviva plc in September 2011. Following the departure of Aviva’s CEO, Andrew Moss,[33] McFarlane assumed the role of executive deputy chairman and became executive chairman on 1 July 2012. On 20 November 2012, Aviva announced that Mark Wilson had been appointed CEO, starting 1 January 2013.[34] On 12 September 2014 Aviva announced that Sir Adrian Montague would become non-executive chairman on the retirement of John McFarlane at the Aviva AGM in April 2015.[35]

Name[edit]
The name of the company upon its formation in May 2000 was CGNU plc.[5] In April 2002 the company's shareholders voted to change the company name to "Aviva plc", an invented word derived from "viva", the Latin for 'alive' and designed to be short, memorable and work worldwide.[6] In April 2008 Aviva announced that it would adopt the "Aviva" name as its worldwide consumer-facing brand, and that the Norwich Union brand would be phased out in the United Kingdom.[7]
History[edit]
Aviva can trace its history back to the establishment of the Hand in Hand Fire & Life Insurance Society in London in 1696.[8][9]

It was created by a merger of two British insurance firms, Norwich Union and CGU plc[10] (itself created by the 1998 merger of Commercial Union and General Accident[11]) as CGNU in 2000. The Aviva name was adopted in July 2002.[12] Thereafter, most of the group operations, except for some strong local brands, were carried out under the uniform brand "Aviva".[13]
During March 2005 Aviva acquired the RAC plc breakdown recovery operation for around £1.1 billion.[14]
In July 2006, Aviva greatly increased its presence in the United States by acquiring AmerUs Group, a Des Moines-based financial services company founded in 1896 in a $2.9 billion (£1.6 billion) deal.[15] AmerUs Group was rebranded as Aviva USA when the acquisition was completed.
The Company continued to use the Norwich Union name as a trading name in the UK until 1 June 2009 when it became formally known as Aviva within the United Kingdom. The launch was supported by a £9 million advertising campaign to promote the rebranding (one of the most expensive ever in the UK insurance field), with the participation of celebrities including Bruce Willis and Alice Cooper.[16]
In June 2009 the Company decided to dispose of Navigator, its Australian wealth management business, to National Australia Bank for A$825 million (£401 million).[17]
In October 2009 the company decided to focus on its commercial insurance sector and demonstrate its commitment to brokers by launching their 'find a broker' facility, using the British Insurance Brokers Association search engine. To help them with this endeavour, Paul Whitehouse was recruited to play the part of a successful hairdresser running three salons. The message of the campaign focused on business insurance through insurance brokers.[18] The closing line of the campaign was "We're in business to keep you in business".
In September 2011, Aviva completed the sale of RAC plc breakdown recovery operation for £1.0 billion to The Carlyle Group.[19]
In February 2012, Aviva sold its occupational health business to the British support services company Capita.[20][21]
In July 2012, Aviva announced plans to sell or close 16 non-core businesses in order to simplify its activities and boost shareholder returns.[22] As part of the plans Aviva announced the sale of its operations in South Korea and the closure to new business of its bulk-buying annuity unit in the United Kingdom.[22]
In August 2012, Aviva announced that up to 800 jobs would be lost following a reorganization caused by further turmoil in the Eurozone.[23]
In December 2012, Aviva agreed to sell Aviva USA Corporation to Athene Holding for US$1.8 billion (£1.1 billion) as part of a plan to improve shareholder returns and reduce the group's capital requirements.[24][25] Athene subsequently sold the life insurance business of Aviva to Global Atlantic.[26]
On 13 April 2015, Aviva completed the £5.6 billion all-share takeover of Friends Life Group. Andy Briggs, current group chief executive of Friends Life, became CEO of Aviva UK Life, with Mark Wilson continuing as CEO of the enlarged Aviva Group.[27]
In July 2016, Aviva froze withdrawals from the Aviva Investors Property Trust after announcing a lack of liquidity.[28][29][30]
Operations[edit]

Aviva's main activities are the provision of general and life insurance, long-term savings products and fund management services. The group has around 29,600 employees, 33 million customers and Aviva Investors has £289.9 billion assets under management.[3]

Following the completion of Friends Life Group Limited in April 2015, Friends Provident International Limited is now part of the Aviva Group.[27]
Senior management[edit]
CEO Richard Harvey retired on 11 July 2007. His successor was Andrew Moss, the former group finance director.[31] Moss was paid an annual base salary of £925,000 for his role as Chief Executive.[32] Moss resigned on 8 May 2012 after shareholders voted down a proposed senior management pay deal which would have seen Moss increase his basic pay by 5% despite several years of Aviva underperformance.[33] John McFarlane was appointed to the board of Aviva plc in September 2011. Following the departure of Aviva’s CEO, Andrew Moss,[33] McFarlane assumed the role of executive deputy chairman and became executive chairman on 1 July 2012. On 20 November 2012, Aviva announced that Mark Wilson had been appointed CEO, starting 1 January 2013.[34] On 12 September 2014 Aviva announced that Sir Adrian Montague would become non-executive chairman on the retirement of John McFarlane at the Aviva AGM in April 2015.[35]
Sponsorships[edit]
In May 2008 Aviva became Norwich City Football Club's main sponsor. In a 2009 television advert starring Paul Whitehouse they feature a Plymouth Argyle F.C. fan who uses Aviva car insurance followed by a Green Army chant.[36] It also acquired the naming rights for the redeveloped Lansdowne Road stadium in Dublin, Ireland, and will now be called the Aviva Stadium.[37]
In 2010, Aviva also took over sponsorship of rugby union's English Premiership from Guinness. The initial four-year sponsorship deal saw £20 million invested into club Rugby.[38] In July 2013, Aviva extended its title sponsorship of the Premiership until July 2017.[39]

Aviva can trace its history back to the establishment of the Hand in Hand Fire & Life Insurance Society in London in 1696.[8][9]

In a 2009 television advert starring Paul Whitehouse they feature a Plymouth Argyle F.C. fan who uses Aviva car insurance followed by a Green Army chant.[36] It also acquired the naming rights for the redeveloped Lansdowne Road stadium in Dublin, Ireland, and will now be called the Aviva Stadium.[37]
In 2010, Aviva also took over sponsorship of rugby union's English Premiership from Guinness. The initial four-year sponsorship deal saw £20 million invested into club Rugby.[38] In July 2013, Aviva extended its title sponsorship of the Premiership until July 2017.[39]

Name[edit]
The name of the company upon its formation in May 2000 was CGNU plc.[5] In April 2002 the company's shareholders voted to change the company name to "Aviva plc", an invented word derived from "viva", the Latin for 'alive' and designed to be short, memorable and work worldwide.[6] In April 2008 Aviva announced that it would adopt the "Aviva" name as its worldwide consumer-facing brand, and that the Norwich Union brand would be phased out in the United Kingdom.[7]
History[edit]
Aviva can trace its history back to the establishment of the Hand in Hand Fire & Life Insurance Society in London in 1696.[8][9]

It was created by a merger of two British insurance firms, Norwich Union and CGU plc[10] (itself created by the 1998 merger of Commercial Union and General Accident[11]) as CGNU in 2000. The Aviva name was adopted in July 2002.[12] Thereafter, most of the group operations, except for some strong local brands, were carried out under the uniform brand "Aviva".[13]
During March 2005 Aviva acquired the RAC plc breakdown recovery operation for around £1.1 billion.[14]
In July 2006, Aviva greatly increased its presence in the United States by acquiring AmerUs Group, a Des Moines-based financial services company founded in 1896 in a $2.9 billion (£1.6 billion) deal.[15] AmerUs Group was rebranded as Aviva USA when the acquisition was completed.
The Company continued to use the Norwich Union name as a trading name in the UK until 1 June 2009 when it became formally known as Aviva within the United Kingdom. The launch was supported by a £9 million advertising campaign to promote the rebranding (one of the most expensive ever in the UK insurance field), with the participation of celebrities including Bruce Willis and Alice Cooper.[16]
In June 2009 the Company decided to dispose of Navigator, its Australian wealth management business, to National Australia Bank for A$825 million (£401 million).[17]
In October 2009 the company decided to focus on its commercial insurance sector and demonstrate its commitment to brokers by launching their 'find a broker' facility, using the British Insurance Brokers Association search engine. To help them with this endeavour, Paul Whitehouse was recruited to play the part of a successful hairdresser running three salons. The message of the campaign focused on business insurance through insurance brokers.[18] The closing line of the campaign was "We're in business to keep you in business".
In September 2011, Aviva completed the sale of RAC plc breakdown recovery operation for £1.0 billion to The Carlyle Group.[19]
In February 2012, Aviva sold its occupational health business to the British support services company Capita.[20][21]
In July 2012, Aviva announced plans to sell or close 16 non-core businesses in order to simplify its activities and boost shareholder returns.[22] As part of the plans Aviva announced the sale of its operations in South Korea and the closure to new business of its bulk-buying annuity unit in the United Kingdom.[22]
In August 2012, Aviva announced that up to 800 jobs would be lost following a reorganization caused by further turmoil in the Eurozone.[23]
In December 2012, Aviva agreed to sell Aviva USA Corporation to Athene Holding for US$1.8 billion (£1.1 billion) as part of a plan to improve shareholder returns and reduce the group's capital requirements.[24][25] Athene subsequently sold the life insurance business of Aviva to Global Atlantic.[26]
On 13 April 2015, Aviva completed the £5.6 billion all-share takeover of Friends Life Group. Andy Briggs, current group chief executive of Friends Life, became CEO of Aviva UK Life, with Mark Wilson continuing as CEO of the enlarged Aviva Group.[27]
In July 2016, Aviva froze withdrawals from the Aviva Investors Property Trust after announcing a lack of liquidity.[28][29][30]
Operations[edit]

Following the completion of Friends Life Group Limited in April 2015, Friends Provident International Limited is now part of the Aviva Group.[27]
Senior management[edit]
CEO Richard Harvey retired on 11 July 2007. His successor was Andrew Moss, the former group finance director.[31] Moss was paid an annual base salary of £925,000 for his role as Chief Executive.[32] Moss resigned on 8 May 2012 after shareholders voted down a proposed senior management pay deal which would have seen Moss increase his basic pay by 5% despite several years of Aviva underperformance.[33] John McFarlane was appointed to the board of Aviva plc in September 2011. Following the departure of Aviva’s CEO, Andrew Moss,[33] McFarlane assumed the role of executive deputy chairman and became executive chairman on 1 July 2012. On 20 November 2012, Aviva announced that Mark Wilson had been appointed CEO, starting 1 January 2013.[34] On 12 September 2014 Aviva announced that Sir Adrian Montague would become non-executive chairman on the retirement of John McFarlane at the Aviva AGM in April 2015.[35]
Sponsorships[edit]
In May 2008 Aviva became Norwich City Football Club's main sponsor. In a 2009 television advert starring Paul Whitehouse they feature a Plymouth Argyle F.C. fan who uses Aviva car insurance followed by a Green Army chant.[36] It also acquired the naming rights for the redeveloped Lansdowne Road stadium in Dublin, Ireland, and will now be called the Aviva Stadium.[37]
In 2010, Aviva also took over sponsorship of rugby union's English Premiership from Guinness. The initial four-year sponsorship deal saw £20 million invested into club Rugby.[38] In July 2013, Aviva extended its title sponsorship of the Premiership until July 2017.[39]

Name[edit]
The name of the company upon its formation in May 2000 was CGNU plc.[5] In April 2002 the company's shareholders voted to change the company name to "Aviva plc", an invented word derived from "viva", the Latin for 'alive' and designed to be short, memorable and work worldwide.[6] In April 2008 Aviva announced that it would adopt the "Aviva" name as its worldwide consumer-facing brand, and that the Norwich Union brand would be phased out in the United Kingdom.[7]
History[edit]
Aviva can trace its history back to the establishment of the Hand in Hand Fire & Life Insurance Society in London in 1696.[8][9]

It was created by a merger of two British insurance firms, Norwich Union and CGU plc[10] (itself created by the 1998 merger of Commercial Union and General Accident[11]) as CGNU in 2000. The Aviva name was adopted in July 2002.[12] Thereafter, most of the group operations, except for some strong local brands, were carried out under the uniform brand "Aviva".[13]
During March 2005 Aviva acquired the RAC plc breakdown recovery operation for around £1.1 billion.[14]
In July 2006, Aviva greatly increased its presence in the United States by acquiring AmerUs Group, a Des Moines-based financial services company founded in 1896 in a $2.9 billion (£1.6 billion) deal.[15] AmerUs Group was rebranded as Aviva USA when the acquisition was completed.
The Company continued to use the Norwich Union name as a trading name in the UK until 1 June 2009 when it became formally known as Aviva within the United Kingdom. The launch was supported by a £9 million advertising campaign to promote the rebranding (one of the most expensive ever in the UK insurance field), with the participation of celebrities including Bruce Willis and Alice Cooper.[16]
In June 2009 the Company decided to dispose of Navigator, its Australian wealth management business, to National Australia Bank for A$825 million (£401 million).[17]
In October 2009 the company decided to focus on its commercial insurance sector and demonstrate its commitment to brokers by launching their 'find a broker' facility, using the British Insurance Brokers Association search engine. To help them with this endeavour, Paul Whitehouse was recruited to play the part of a successful hairdresser running three salons. The message of the campaign focused on business insurance through insurance brokers.[18] The closing line of the campaign was "We're in business to keep you in business".
In September 2011, Aviva completed the sale of RAC plc breakdown recovery operation for £1.0 billion to The Carlyle Group.[19]
In February 2012, Aviva sold its occupational health business to the British support services company Capita.[20][21]
In July 2012, Aviva announced plans to sell or close 16 non-core businesses in order to simplify its activities and boost shareholder returns.[22] As part of the plans Aviva announced the sale of its operations in South Korea and the closure to new business of its bulk-buying annuity unit in the United Kingdom.[22]
In August 2012, Aviva announced that up to 800 jobs would be lost following a reorganization caused by further turmoil in the Eurozone.[23]
In December 2012, Aviva agreed to sell Aviva USA Corporation to Athene Holding for US$1.8 billion (£1.1 billion) as part of a plan to improve shareholder returns and reduce the group's capital requirements.[24][25] Athene subsequently sold the life insurance business of Aviva to Global Atlantic.[26]
On 13 April 2015, Aviva completed the £5.6 billion all-share takeover of Friends Life Group. Andy Briggs, current group chief executive of Friends Life, became CEO of Aviva UK Life, with Mark Wilson continuing as CEO of the enlarged Aviva Group.[27]
In July 2016, Aviva froze withdrawals from the Aviva Investors Property Trust after announcing a lack of liquidity.[28][29][30]
Operations[edit]

Aviva's main activities are the provision of general and life insurance, long-term savings products and fund management services. The group has around 29,600 employees, 33 million customers and Aviva Investors has £289.9 billion assets under management.[3]

Following the completion of Friends Life Group Limited in April 2015, Friends Provident International Limited is now part of the Aviva Group.[27]
Senior management[edit]
CEO Richard Harvey retired on 11 July 2007. His successor was Andrew Moss, the former group finance director.[31] Moss was paid an annual base salary of £925,000 for his role as Chief Executive.[32] Moss resigned on 8 May 2012 after shareholders voted down a proposed senior management pay deal which would have seen Moss increase his basic pay by 5% despite several years of Aviva underperformance.[33] John McFarlane was appointed to the board of Aviva plc in September 2011. Following the departure of Aviva’s CEO, Andrew Moss,[33] McFarlane assumed the role of executive deputy chairman and became executive chairman on 1 July 2012. On 20 November 2012, Aviva announced that Mark Wilson had been appointed CEO, starting 1 January 2013.[34] On 12 September 2014 Aviva announced that Sir Adrian Montague would become non-executive chairman on the retirement of John McFarlane at the Aviva AGM in April 2015.[35]
Sponsorships[edit]
In May 2008 Aviva became Norwich City Football Club's main sponsor. In a 2009 television advert starring Paul Whitehouse they feature a Plymouth Argyle F.C. fan who uses Aviva car insurance followed by a Green Army chant.[36] It also acquired the naming rights for the redeveloped Lansdowne Road stadium in Dublin, Ireland, and will now be called the Aviva Stadium.[37]
In 2010, Aviva also took over sponsorship of rugby union's English Premiership from Guinness. The initial four-year sponsorship deal saw £20 million invested into club Rugby.[38] In July 2013, Aviva extended its title sponsorship of the Premiership until July 2017.[39]

Name[edit]
The name of the company upon its formation in May 2000 was CGNU plc.[5] In April 2002 the company's shareholders voted to change the company name to "Aviva plc", an invented word derived from "viva", the Latin for 'alive' and designed to be short, memorable and work worldwide.[6] In April 2008 Aviva announced that it would adopt the "Aviva" name as its worldwide consumer-facing brand, and that the Norwich Union brand would be phased out in the United Kingdom.[7]
History[edit]
Aviva can trace its history back to the establishment of the Hand in Hand Fire & Life Insurance Society in London in 1696.[8][9]




Predecessor company London and Lancashire Fire and Life, pictured in Dublin, c. 1871


It was created by a merger of two British insurance firms, Norwich Union and CGU plc[10] (itself created by the 1998 merger of Commercial Union and General Accident[11]) as CGNU in 2000. The Aviva name was adopted in July 2002.[12] Thereafter, most of the group operations, except for some strong local brands, were carried out under the uniform brand "Aviva".[13]
During March 2005 Aviva acquired the RAC plc breakdown recovery operation for around £1.1 billion.[14]
In July 2006, Aviva greatly increased its presence in the United States by acquiring AmerUs Group, a Des Moines-based financial services company founded in 1896 in a $2.9 billion (£1.6 billion) deal.[15] AmerUs Group was rebranded as Aviva USA when the acquisition was completed.
The Company continued to use the Norwich Union name as a trading name in the UK until 1 June 2009 when it became formally known as Aviva within the United Kingdom. The launch was supported by a £9 million advertising campaign to promote the rebranding (one of the most expensive ever in the UK insurance field), with the participation of celebrities including Bruce Willis and Alice Cooper.[16]
In June 2009 the Company decided to dispose of Navigator, its Australian wealth management business, to National Australia Bank for A$825 million (£401 million).[17]
In October 2009 the company decided to focus on its commercial insurance sector and demonstrate its commitment to brokers by launching their 'find a broker' facility, using the British Insurance Brokers Association search engine. To help them with this endeavour, Paul Whitehouse was recruited to play the part of a successful hairdresser running three salons. The message of the campaign focused on business insurance through insurance brokers.[18] The closing line of the campaign was "We're in business to keep you in business".
In September 2011, Aviva completed the sale of RAC plc breakdown recovery operation for £1.0 billion to The Carlyle Group.[19]
In February 2012, Aviva sold its occupational health business to the British support services company Capita.[20][21]
In July 2012, Aviva announced plans to sell or close 16 non-core businesses in order to simplify its activities and boost shareholder returns.[22] As part of the plans Aviva announced the sale of its operations in South Korea and the closure to new business of its bulk-buying annuity unit in the United Kingdom.[22]
In August 2012, Aviva announced that up to 800 jobs would be lost following a reorganization caused by further turmoil in the Eurozone.[23]
In December 2012, Aviva agreed to sell Aviva USA Corporation to Athene Holding for US$1.8 billion (£1.1 billion) as part of a plan to improve shareholder returns and reduce the group's capital requirements.[24][25] Athene subsequently sold the life insurance business of Aviva to Global Atlantic.[26]
On 13 April 2015, Aviva completed the £5.6 billion all-share takeover of Friends Life Group. Andy Briggs, current group chief executive of Friends Life, became CEO of Aviva UK Life, with Mark Wilson continuing as CEO of the enlarged Aviva Group.[27]
In July 2016, Aviva froze withdrawals from the Aviva Investors Property Trust after announcing a lack of liquidity.[28][29][30]
Operations[edit]




St. Helen's, Aviva's world headquarters in London


Aviva's main activities are the provision of general and life insurance, long-term savings products and fund management services. The group has around 29,600 employees, 33 million customers and Aviva Investors has £289.9 billion assets under management.[3]

Following the completion of Friends Life Group Limited in April 2015, Friends Provident International Limited is now part of the Aviva Group.[27]
Senior management[edit]
CEO Richard Harvey retired on 11 July 2007. His successor was Andrew Moss, the former group finance director.[31] Moss was paid an annual base salary of £925,000 for his role as Chief Executive.[32] Moss resigned on 8 May 2012 after shareholders voted down a proposed senior management pay deal which would have seen Moss increase his basic pay by 5% despite several years of Aviva underperformance.[33] John McFarlane was appointed to the board of Aviva plc in September 2011. Following the departure of Aviva’s CEO, Andrew Moss,[33] McFarlane assumed the role of executive deputy chairman and became executive chairman on 1 July 2012. On 20 November 2012, Aviva announced that Mark Wilson had been appointed CEO, starting 1 January 2013.[34] On 12 September 2014 Aviva announced that Sir Adrian Montague would become non-executive chairman on the retirement of John McFarlane at the Aviva AGM in April 2015.[35]
Sponsorships[edit]
In May 2008 Aviva became Norwich City Football Club's main sponsor. In a 2009 television advert starring Paul Whitehouse they feature a Plymouth Argyle F.C. fan who uses Aviva car insurance followed by a Green Army chant.[36] It also acquired the naming rights for the redeveloped Lansdowne Road stadium in Dublin, Ireland, and will now be called the Aviva Stadium.[37]
In 2010, Aviva also took over sponsorship of rugby union's English Premiership from Guinness. The initial four-year sponsorship deal saw £20 million invested into club Rugby.[38] In July 2013, Aviva extended its title sponsorship of the Premiership until July 2017.[39]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
