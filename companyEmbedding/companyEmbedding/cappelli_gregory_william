Apollo Education Group[edit]
Cappelli began working at Apollo Education Group (“Apollo”) in 2007,[4] serving as executive vice president of global strategy and assistant to the executive chairman. He was appointed co-CEO of Apollo on April 27, 2009, at the age of 41.[6] As co-CEO, he shared the role with Chas Edelstein. The two men had worked together at Credit Suisse before each joined Apollo Group. Three years later, he became the sole CEO of the Apollo.[1]
Cappelli’s tenure at Apollo is marked by his leadership improvement in two areas, one internal and one external. His external focus has been to apply the company’s assets to building a skilled workforce. His internal focus has been on improving the operations and recruiting strategy of the University of Phoenix.[citation needed]
In 2012, Mother Jones named him one of the ten most overpaid CEOs.[7]
Skilled workforce[edit]
In 2014, he told a journalist that he had he had traveled around the world over a span of 18 months to meet with companies. His goal was to learn how other companies developed their workforces.[8]
Under his leadership as CEO, Apollo partnered with Fortune 1000 companies to train company employees. In 2015, Apollo created a business unit called Apollo Professional Development. The unit runs programs that train employees at Fortune 1000 companies.[9] Chief Executive Magazine called him “passionate about creating a skilled workforce for employees.”[10]
Corporate leadership[edit]
During a conference call with investors at the end of 2015, he said, “None of us at Apollo are satisfied where we are right now.” On the call he pledged to improve the company and replace programs that don’t work with more forward-looking options, such as a cybersecurity certificate program, for example.[11]
Regarding internal improvements, Cappelli told the Phoenix Business Journal in 2014 that he changed the recruiting process at the University of Phoenix, resulting in recruiters focusing on listening to prospective students’ needs and goals.[8]
Cappelli has also taken a role in global leadership. He has been a keynote speaker at the Milken Institute Global Conference.[12] The Milken Institute is a think tank focused on global prosperity, capital expansion, jobs and health issues.[13]
Boards, media appearances and recognition[edit]
Cappelli is a member of:

Former[14] board of directors members of Everybody Wins!, located in New York[4]
The Board of Governors of the Boys and Girls Club of America[14]
The board of trustees of his graduate school alma mater, Dominican University[14]

A few days after the 2012 presidential election, he was on a live C-SPAN television special called “Voter Demographics and 2012 Elections.” He served as a panelist offering his insight and answering questions from the audience.[15]
While he was an analyst at Credit Suisse, in the 2003 “Beat on the Street” analyst survey, he earned “top honors.”[1]
Education[edit]
He graduated with a B.A. in economics from Indiana University. He later earned an MBA at Dominican University.[4]

Apollo Education Group[edit]
Cappelli began working at Apollo Education Group (“Apollo”) in 2007,[4] serving as executive vice president of global strategy and assistant to the executive chairman. He was appointed co-CEO of Apollo on April 27, 2009, at the age of 41.[6] As co-CEO, he shared the role with Chas Edelstein. The two men had worked together at Credit Suisse before each joined Apollo Group. Three years later, he became the sole CEO of the Apollo.[1]
Cappelli’s tenure at Apollo is marked by his leadership improvement in two areas, one internal and one external. His external focus has been to apply the company’s assets to building a skilled workforce. His internal focus has been on improving the operations and recruiting strategy of the University of Phoenix.[citation needed]
In 2012, Mother Jones named him one of the ten most overpaid CEOs.[7]
Skilled workforce[edit]
In 2014, he told a journalist that he had he had traveled around the world over a span of 18 months to meet with companies. His goal was to learn how other companies developed their workforces.[8]
Under his leadership as CEO, Apollo partnered with Fortune 1000 companies to train company employees. In 2015, Apollo created a business unit called Apollo Professional Development. The unit runs programs that train employees at Fortune 1000 companies.[9] Chief Executive Magazine called him “passionate about creating a skilled workforce for employees.”[10]
Corporate leadership[edit]
During a conference call with investors at the end of 2015, he said, “None of us at Apollo are satisfied where we are right now.” On the call he pledged to improve the company and replace programs that don’t work with more forward-looking options, such as a cybersecurity certificate program, for example.[11]
Regarding internal improvements, Cappelli told the Phoenix Business Journal in 2014 that he changed the recruiting process at the University of Phoenix, resulting in recruiters focusing on listening to prospective students’ needs and goals.[8]
Cappelli has also taken a role in global leadership. He has been a keynote speaker at the Milken Institute Global Conference.[12] The Milken Institute is a think tank focused on global prosperity, capital expansion, jobs and health issues.[13]
Boards, media appearances and recognition[edit]
Cappelli is a member of:

Former[14] board of directors members of Everybody Wins!, located in New York[4]
The Board of Governors of the Boys and Girls Club of America[14]
The board of trustees of his graduate school alma mater, Dominican University[14]

A few days after the 2012 presidential election, he was on a live C-SPAN television special called “Voter Demographics and 2012 Elections.” He served as a panelist offering his insight and answering questions from the audience.[15]
While he was an analyst at Credit Suisse, in the 2003 “Beat on the Street” analyst survey, he earned “top honors.”[1]
Education[edit]
He graduated with a B.A. in economics from Indiana University. He later earned an MBA at Dominican University.[4]

This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.
