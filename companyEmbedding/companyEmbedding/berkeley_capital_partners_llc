GO BEYOND
                                THE MAINSTREAM


Berkeley Capital is a Private Investment Office focused on helping entrepreneurs and their families grow and protect their net-worth.  
		

Go Beyond Generalized "Wealth Management" 
		







Investment Expertise applied across your entire Net Worth

                     
		

Our Investment Officers personally manage clients investments in the public markets as well as help clients evaluate moves within their private investments and businesses.     
		














 








Investments First


We’re not a supermarket for “Wealth Management” services. We focus on the investment side of wealth, and then help our client families resource any other services they might need.













Independent Expertise


Most Financial Advisor’s today focus on gathering assets and outsourcing investments. Our Investment Officers are experts who actively manage portfolios with no conflicts of interests on how they advise clients.













Financial Planning


Some clients don’t have a financial plan, but would like one to help guide them to their goals. Our planning process creates a simple roadmap to keep everyone on track along the way.

















THINK BEYOND the MAINSTREAM
Berkeley was founded on the notion that there had to be a better way to manage client investments than the trends we found on Wall Street. Our Investment Officers certainly aren’t your average “Investment Advisor.” Here are a few of the reasons why:
















Berkeley Capital Partners is a Private Investment Office.
Berkeley Capital was founded in 2009. Client assets are custodied through Charles Schwab, which also provides client statements and online account access.
Berkeley is located in Atlanta, Georgia but works with clients around the country.

“Active management strategies demand uninstitutional behavior from institutions, creating a paradox few can unravel.”
-David Swenson






Investment Services for Entrepreneurs






Equity Portfolio Management


Our Investment Officers personally build and actively manage clients’ investment portfolios. We have the freedom and independence to use a variety of global asset classes and avoid expensive third party managers, mutual funds and other investment “products.”











Financial Planning

Our planning process is simple and straightforward. Our goal is to create a roadmap to important milestones that will help keep everyone aligned and track our progress along the way.











Debt Portfolio & Credit Analysis


When building a personalized fixed-income portfolio, Berkeley carefully considers the credit, quality, and duration of every position. This includes an in-depth review of the Official Statement (OS) and a close look at comparable bond pricing before any trade decisions are made.











Private Investments


Most of our clients have created their wealth through small businesses and other private investments. Our Investment Officers understand the big picture and can help clients evaluate their private holding and new private investment opportunities. In some cases they can also help clients access capital.











Retirement Plan Strategies


We help our client’s who own businesses with the adoption and replacement of their retirement plans. As advisors, we help choose the best plans based on services, costs, and a specific business’ needs. And we continually help participants manage and review performance.











Resourcing for Additional Needs


We are Investment specialists but sometimes our clients need help with other wealth and financial related services. Whether its legal, accounting, lending or insurance, Berkeley has a list of trusted names we have worked with and will be happy to recommend.













Michael C. Eddy, 
Managing Partner

Sound investing requires one part knowledge and one part emotion – and knowledge is the easier part. A trusted advisor can make a huge difference for clients by simply giving them the peace of mind that someone is looking out for them.

Find out if we are a fit
Read through how we work below and check out some of our Investment thoughts. If our approach sounds interesting, we would love to meet with you or schedule a phone call at your convenience.

How we work
 1. Meet with a Berkeley Investment Officer.
Each client family is assigned an Investment Officer who is responsible for implementing, monitoring and keeping you up to speed on your investments.   Berkeley’s Investment Officers are different than most Financial Advisors today.  They personally manage client investment portfolios and when appropriate will even lend perspective on other investments you own or are considering outside the public markets.  Their goal is to see your big picture and help you  grow and protect your entire net worth.
2. Create a Smart Plan.
Many clients would like to have a Financial Plan to help guide them to their goals.  We are all for it as well. Our planning approach is straightforward and we simplify the process into a easy to understand dashboard so everyone is on the same page and can monitor progress along the way.
3. Portfolio Construction.
Once you decide Berkeley is a fit for you we will begin implementing an investment plan that satisfies your risk-reward profile.
4. Review and Coordinate. 
Your Investment Officer is always one phone call or email away.  Also, once your initial portfolio is constructed we will schedule regular updates with you to review progress, discuss the portfolio and consider any other investment opportunities you want do discuss.





Services
Equity Portfolio Management
Fixed Income Management
Private Investment Perspective
401K plans for small businesses
Options Strategies





Need other resources?
Over the years we have built a network of trusted advisors who can help our clients with specific financial, tax, insurance and legal needs.  Call your Investment Officer anytime and they will get you connected with the right person.

Most “wealth management” firms today are diversifying to offer a wide range of products and services to their clients. The industry has evolved into generalists. Some advisors may be good at a few things, but very few are great at any one thing. We’re building Berkeley on the notion that our client’s want more focused advise. Thats why we have built Berkeley to deliver deep investment expertise to our clients. For us that’s the most logical way to make a difference in helping clients manage and protect their wealth.








Berkeley Intelligent Net Worth provides client’s and their families with a trusted guide to help them protect and grow their net worth. Berkeley Investment Officers customize and manage equity and fixed income portfolios.  They are also available to review clients’ private investments and capital needs to help them best manage all of their wealth.
For clients who need help with other areas of their Wealth, we have a network of outside experts we work with in various areas including; accounting, legal, insurance and lending.












Berkeley NextGen is our platform for younger entrepreneurs and professionals, those who are still primarily in the “wealth accumulation” phase of their careers, and want an investment approach that reflects their phase of life.  Berkeley NextGen clients get access to Berkeley’s customized equity and fixed income portfolios without high account minimum requirements to get started.
In addition the Berkeley NextGen provides financial planning and investment coaching to help NextGen clients grow their net worth intelligently.












Berkeley Intelligent Business helps small businesses establish and manage 401k retirement plans for their employees.   Our Intelligent Business team is available to review existing plans or work with entrepreneurs to implement a new benefits strategy.
Once the plan is established Berkeley Investment Officers will meet with the employees of the business to help them make investment decisions and construct 401k portfolios.

Joining Berkeley
Our hands on approach to investment management is not for everyone.  We tend to stray away from selling financial products, mutual fund wrap programs or outsourcing to expensive third party managers.  We are looking for partners who have a focus and expertise in investment management.  Our Investment Officers know the markets and their client investments and can utilize that knowledge to educate clients, help them grow their net worth and give them peace of mind along the way. If you find our philosophy resonates with you, then Berkeley might just offer an environment where you can thrive and so can your business.   We understand that people who leave the Mainstream of Wall Street usually leave because they want more independence and a more productive business model. That’s where we can really help.









Benefits of Working with Berkeley:



Differentiate yourself and your business
Gain the independence of a small business owner without the headaches of operating a small business
Attractive pay-out structure
Experienced business transition team to minimize your stress and maximize client retention

For the past several years we have expressed concerns about the long term implications of the policies the Central Banks of the world have used to try to revive their economies.  The magnitude of money creation in the form of new dollars, yen, euros, pounds and the like are well documented.  GDP growth has returned […]

As we begin 2017 the following themes have emerged as the consensus of expectations for most of Wall Street for the coming 12 months.    If history is any guide, we know there will certainly be surprises to “consensus” expectations and our contrarian nature makes us even more skeptical that what “everyone” is expecting to […]

How to afford more national debt

We came across this chart yesterday and thought it was pretty astounding. In the past 9 years the US National debt has doubled from $9 trillion to $19 trillion.  The US borrows money by issuing US Treasury bonds.   Fortunately, although we doubled the amount of outstanding debt owed, interest rates also fell.   The […]

Berkeley Capital Partners was founded when we left the MainStream of Wall Street in 2009 because we wanted to pursue a different way of helping our clients preserve and grow their wealth independent of the conflicts of interests we found there.  It appears not much has changed.  Check out this article about the recent “comp” change at […]

Do low interest rates lead to growth?

Central bankers have lots of theories.  One of the theories for keeping interest rates low is so that businesses will become more apt to borrow.   Central bankers hope that the the access to cheap credit will incentivize businesses to invest.   As they invest in new projects and their businesses expand, they should, in theory, also […]

GO BEYOND
                                THE MAINSTREAM


Berkeley Capital is a Private Investment Office focused on helping entrepreneurs and their families grow and protect their net-worth.  
		

Go Beyond Generalized "Wealth Management" 
		







Investment Expertise applied across your entire Net Worth

                     
		

Our Investment Officers personally manage clients investments in the public markets as well as help clients evaluate moves within their private investments and businesses.     
		














 








Investments First


We’re not a supermarket for “Wealth Management” services. We focus on the investment side of wealth, and then help our client families resource any other services they might need.













Independent Expertise


Most Financial Advisor’s today focus on gathering assets and outsourcing investments. Our Investment Officers are experts who actively manage portfolios with no conflicts of interests on how they advise clients.













Financial Planning


Some clients don’t have a financial plan, but would like one to help guide them to their goals. Our planning process creates a simple roadmap to keep everyone on track along the way.

















THINK BEYOND the MAINSTREAM
Berkeley was founded on the notion that there had to be a better way to manage client investments than the trends we found on Wall Street. Our Investment Officers certainly aren’t your average “Investment Advisor.” Here are a few of the reasons why:
















Berkeley Capital Partners is a Private Investment Office.
Berkeley Capital was founded in 2009. Client assets are custodied through Charles Schwab, which also provides client statements and online account access.
Berkeley is located in Atlanta, Georgia but works with clients around the country.

“Active management strategies demand uninstitutional behavior from institutions, creating a paradox few can unravel.”
-David Swenson






Investment Services for Entrepreneurs






Equity Portfolio Management


Our Investment Officers personally build and actively manage clients’ investment portfolios. We have the freedom and independence to use a variety of global asset classes and avoid expensive third party managers, mutual funds and other investment “products.”











Financial Planning

Our planning process is simple and straightforward. Our goal is to create a roadmap to important milestones that will help keep everyone aligned and track our progress along the way.











Debt Portfolio & Credit Analysis


When building a personalized fixed-income portfolio, Berkeley carefully considers the credit, quality, and duration of every position. This includes an in-depth review of the Official Statement (OS) and a close look at comparable bond pricing before any trade decisions are made.











Private Investments


Most of our clients have created their wealth through small businesses and other private investments. Our Investment Officers understand the big picture and can help clients evaluate their private holding and new private investment opportunities. In some cases they can also help clients access capital.











Retirement Plan Strategies


We help our client’s who own businesses with the adoption and replacement of their retirement plans. As advisors, we help choose the best plans based on services, costs, and a specific business’ needs. And we continually help participants manage and review performance.











Resourcing for Additional Needs


We are Investment specialists but sometimes our clients need help with other wealth and financial related services. Whether its legal, accounting, lending or insurance, Berkeley has a list of trusted names we have worked with and will be happy to recommend.













Michael C. Eddy, 
Managing Partner

Sound investing requires one part knowledge and one part emotion – and knowledge is the easier part. A trusted advisor can make a huge difference for clients by simply giving them the peace of mind that someone is looking out for them.
