Creekside at Colleyville


The Location.
Creekside at Colleyville is located in northeastern Tarrant County in the heart of the Dallas/Fort Worth area just west of Highway 121 at Heritage Avenue and Cheek-Sparger Road. Neighboring towns include Grapevine, Southlake and Keller. Within minutes of DFW International Airport and is equal distance to Downtown Dallas or Downtown Ft. Worth. Perfect for commuters, this community is located close near major freeways Highways 114, 121, 360, 183, and 26.
The City of Colleyville is in the Grapevine Colleyville ISD and has plenty to offer.  Discover all the parks with amenities, a wide variety of family entertainment options including golf, shopping and dining. The newly completed 11 mile Cotton Belt Trail in Northeast Tarrant County connects the trail from Colleyville to Grapevine. This new addition includes a pocket park, rest areas, bench seating, and a multi-function drinking fountain, which means your dog can get a drink too.  Residents of Creekside at Colleyville will have access to the trail system right in the community.
The Community.
Creekside at Colleyville will have 48 luxury homes when completed. M/I is located in phases 3 and 5, offering large lots and brand new beautiful 60' floorplans. This gated community will offer 30 acres of park and open space on Little Bear Creek.
The Homes.
M/I Homes is now building in the beautiful community of Creekside in Colleyville with several other well-known builders. We are featuring gorgeous homes on oversized lots as part of Phases 3 and 5 in this expanding community. M/I Homes has 48 oversized lots, and features an amazing lineup of 10 brand new home designs in our Elite Series created exclusively to debut here in Colleyville. These knock-out homes will certainly leave a grand impression, and showcase an exciting use of space within the homes. These floor plans will range from 2,800 square feet to just under 5,000.
The Builder
For 40 years, M/I has built its reputation for quality, service, and genuine customer care, one home at a time. Today, 100,000 homes later, the M/I Difference continues to instill confidence in our homeowners. Our exclusive Whole Home Building Standards give you the features and benefits of a better built-home. They include the structural features that really matter to homeowners today. And our green features are the result of our relentless pursuit of the ultimate, energy-efficient home. We wrap every home in a weather-tight envelope. We seal every seam and caulk every crevasse. We have them independently rated to certify the energy savings. For an M/I home, you'll save an average of 30% over the cost of home built to standard code. Our ratings even beat Energy Star targets.

Creekwood


The Location.
Exciting development is taking place near this community in Fort Worth, TX. Residents of Creekwood will enjoy the new sport and recreational fields, lake access for kayaking and fishing, and acres of green space to spread out and play that are located nearby. Located just off of I-35W, plans for new outdoor shopping malls and movie theaters are well under way! This community is growing fast, and for good reason!
The Community.
This community has the charming features of country living with easy access to the shopping, dining, and entertainment that North Fort Worth has to offer. Creekwood amenities include a duck pond, fishing pond, miles of hike and bike trails, swimming pools and playgrounds. You'll love to call Creekwood your new home in Fort Worth, TX.
The Homes.
M/I Homes in DFW is proud to be a part of Creekwood community in North Fort Worth and Saginaw, TX. Creekwood in Tarrant County features floorplans from our new Eco Series of homes. M/I Homes offers soaring ceilings, beautiful tile to choose from and plenty of options to personalize your home!
The Builder.
Since 1976, M/I Homes has been building new homes of outstanding design, quality and value. With each new home, we ask ourselves if we'd be happy with this new home and want to ensure you are as well! Building over 100,000 homes throughout the Nation, M/I Homes would be proud to build your new home. We also offer financing through M/I Financial which is a real M/I Difference. Because there are specific timetables in construction, financing a new home is more complicated than financing an existing home. We're experts. Our title companies will make your closing quick and convenient and we stand behind our work. We have the strongest Warranty Commitment in the business. Don't delay! Contact us today to learn more information or to schedule a tour!
