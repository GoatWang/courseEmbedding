Janus to Simplify Mutual Fund Product Platform






March 16, 2009 04:05 PM Eastern Daylight Time



DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Janus Capital Group Inc. (NYSE: JNS) announced today that the trustees 
      of the Janus mutual funds have approved a proposal to merge the Janus 
      Adviser Series fund (JAD) trust into the Janus Investment Fund (JIF) 
      trust. The merger, which is expected to occur on or about July 6, 2009, 
      will reorganize and simplify Janus’ product offerings and provide 
      investors with a broader range of investment strategies.
    


      Historically, Janus organized its retail mutual funds into two separate 
      trusts. The original mutual fund trust JIF was designed primarily to 
      meet the needs of the self-directed investor offering a single class of 
      no-load shares. In 2000, the JAD trust was introduced with multi-share 
      class pricing to meet the evolving needs of investors who were choosing 
      to use financial intermediaries. The two trusts are comprised of very 
      similar products managed by the same portfolio managers or teams. In 
      response to changing market conditions and investor migration toward 
      advice-driven channels, Janus believes that it is in the best interest 
      of its fund shareholders to create one consolidated mutual fund platform 
      with multi-share class pricing designed to meet the needs of the various 
      investors doing business with the firm.
    

      “We believe the merger provides Janus’ shareholders and clients with a 
      number of benefits, including access to additional product offerings, 
      and creates opportunities for reduced fund expenses over time,” said 
      Robin Beery, president of the Funds, executive vice president and chief 
      marketing officer of Janus Capital Group.
    

      At the time of the merger, the JIF trust’s direct investment platform 
      will be closed to new investors but will continue to be available to 
      current direct investors and members of their immediate family and 
      household.
    

      Under the terms of the merger, the following JAD funds would be merged 
      into existing JIF funds, which will have some differences in Fund names 
      from those currently in place in the JAD trust. In addition, 10 new 
      funds will be created in the JIF trust for JAD funds that have no 
      corresponding JIF strategy.

Returns quoted are past performance and do not guarantee future results; current performance may be lower or higher. Investment returns and principal value will vary; there may be a gain or loss when shares are sold.
Maximum Offering Price (MOP) returns include the maximum sales charge of 5.75% (4.75% for fixed income funds and 2.5% for Janus Henderson Short-Term Bond Fund). Net Asset Value (NAV) returns exclude these charges, which would have reduced returns.
CDSC returns include a 1% contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) on Shares redeemed within 12 months of purchase. Net Asset Value (NAV) returns exclude this charge, which would have reduced returns.
Information Regarding Sales Charge Reductions and Waivers
Click the name for additional important information including objectives, risks, performance history and expense detail.
Returns include reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. Returns greater than one year are annualized.
Shares of ETFs are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Market returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 p.m. Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined for most ETFs), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Ordinary brokerage commissions apply and will reduce returns.
The yield more closely reflects the current earnings of the money market portfolio than the returns.

Returns quoted are past performance and do not guarantee future results; current performance may be lower or higher. Investment returns and principal value will vary; there may be a gain or loss when shares are sold.
Maximum Offering Price (MOP) returns include the maximum sales charge of 5.75% (4.75% for fixed income funds and 2.5% for Janus Henderson Short-Term Bond Fund). Net Asset Value (NAV) returns exclude these charges, which would have reduced returns.
CDSC returns include a 1% contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) on Shares redeemed within 12 months of purchase. Net Asset Value (NAV) returns exclude this charge, which would have reduced returns.
Information Regarding Sales Charge Reductions and Waivers
Click the name for additional important information including objectives, risks, performance history and expense detail.
Returns include reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. Returns greater than one year are annualized.
Shares of ETFs are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Market returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 p.m. Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined for most ETFs), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Ordinary brokerage commissions apply and will reduce returns.
The yield more closely reflects the current earnings of the money market portfolio than the returns.

Returns quoted are past performance and do not guarantee future results; current performance may be lower or higher. Investment returns and principal value will vary; there may be a gain or loss when shares are sold.
Maximum Offering Price (MOP) returns include the maximum sales charge of 5.75% (4.75% for fixed income funds and 2.5% for Janus Henderson Short-Term Bond Fund). Net Asset Value (NAV) returns exclude these charges, which would have reduced returns.
CDSC returns include a 1% contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) on Shares redeemed within 12 months of purchase. Net Asset Value (NAV) returns exclude this charge, which would have reduced returns.
Information Regarding Sales Charge Reductions and Waivers
Click the name for additional important information including objectives, risks, performance history and expense detail.
Returns include reinvestment of dividends and capital gains.
Shares of ETFs are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Market returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 p.m. Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined for most ETFs), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Ordinary brokerage commissions apply and will reduce returns.
The yield more closely reflects the current earnings of the money market portfolio than the returns.
For Janus Henderson Government Money Market Fund: You could lose money by investing in the Fund. Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund’s sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at any time.
For Janus Henderson Money Market Fund: You could lose money by investing in the Fund.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or “star rating”, is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund’s monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The Morningstar Rating does not include any adjustment for sales loads. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. Ratings may vary by share class.
Ratings and/or rankings may be based, in part, on the performance of a predecessor fund or share class and are calculated by Morningstar using a methodology that differs from that used by Janus. Methodology differences may have a material effect on the return and therefore the rating/ranking.
When an expense waiver is in effect, it may have a material effect on the total return or yield, and therefore the ranking and/or rating for the period.

Amana Mutual Funds Trust
 





Amana Founders Video

 


Watch Amana Mutual Funds Trust founders, Nick Kaiser and Yaqub Mirza, discuss the creation and history of the Trust.

At Saturna Capital and the Amana Mutual Funds Trust, we endeavor to align our investments with our principles.
Our Funds favor companies with low price-to-earnings multiples, strong balance sheets, and proven businesses. They follow a value-oriented approach consistent with Islamic finance principles. Generally, these principles require that investors avoid interest and investments in businesses such as liquor, pornography, gambling, and banks. The Funds avoid bonds and other conventional fixed-income securities.
Saturna Capital selects investments in companies that to its knowledge do not violate the requirements of the Islamic faith at the time of investment. To ensure that investments continue to meet the requirements of the Islamic faith, Saturna Capital engages Amanie Advisors Sdn Bhd, a leading consultant specializing in Islamic finance.
The Amana Funds limit the securities they purchase to those consistent with Islamic principles. This limits opportunities and may affect performance.
 
 





Saturna White Papers: Educational Series 

  
  
 Dancing with Correlation 
 We explore the correlation between Islamic investment certificates, including sukuk, and other investment asset classes as a means of better understanding the risk and return characteristics of this unique and distinct asset class.
 
   

  
 What Makes Sukuk Halal? 
 We explain what differentiates Islamic investment certificates, often called sukuk, from conventional bonds, and identifies the distinctive features that form the core of what makes sukuk Islamic-compliant, or halal.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Amana Mutual Funds Trust
 





Amana Founders Video

 


Watch Amana Mutual Funds Trust founders, Nick Kaiser and Yaqub Mirza, discuss the creation and history of the Trust.

At Saturna Capital and the Amana Mutual Funds Trust, we endeavor to align our investments with our principles.
Our Funds favor companies with low price-to-earnings multiples, strong balance sheets, and proven businesses. They follow a value-oriented approach consistent with Islamic finance principles. Generally, these principles require that investors avoid interest and investments in businesses such as liquor, pornography, gambling, and banks. The Funds avoid bonds and other conventional fixed-income securities.
Saturna Capital selects investments in companies that to its knowledge do not violate the requirements of the Islamic faith at the time of investment. To ensure that investments continue to meet the requirements of the Islamic faith, Saturna Capital engages Amanie Advisors Sdn Bhd, a leading consultant specializing in Islamic finance.
The Amana Funds limit the securities they purchase to those consistent with Islamic principles. This limits opportunities and may affect performance.

 Dancing with Correlation 
 We explore the correlation between Islamic investment certificates, including sukuk, and other investment asset classes as a means of better understanding the risk and return characteristics of this unique and distinct asset class.
 
   

  
 What Makes Sukuk Halal? 
 We explain what differentiates Islamic investment certificates, often called sukuk, from conventional bonds, and identifies the distinctive features that form the core of what makes sukuk Islamic-compliant, or halal.

Returns quoted are past performance and do not guarantee future results; current performance may be lower or higher. Investment returns and principal value will vary; there may be a gain or loss when shares are sold.
Maximum Offering Price (MOP) returns include the maximum sales charge of 5.75% (4.75% for fixed income funds and 2.5% for Janus Henderson Short-Term Bond Fund). Net Asset Value (NAV) returns exclude these charges, which would have reduced returns.
CDSC returns include a 1% contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) on Shares redeemed within 12 months of purchase. Net Asset Value (NAV) returns exclude this charge, which would have reduced returns.
Information Regarding Sales Charge Reductions and Waivers
Click the name for additional important information including objectives, risks, performance history and expense detail.
Returns include reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. Returns greater than one year are annualized.
Shares of ETFs are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Market returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 p.m. Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined for most ETFs), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Ordinary brokerage commissions apply and will reduce returns.
The yield more closely reflects the current earnings of the money market portfolio than the returns.

Returns quoted are past performance and do not guarantee future results; current performance may be lower or higher. Investment returns and principal value will vary; there may be a gain or loss when shares are sold.
Maximum Offering Price (MOP) returns include the maximum sales charge of 5.75% (4.75% for fixed income funds and 2.5% for Janus Henderson Short-Term Bond Fund). Net Asset Value (NAV) returns exclude these charges, which would have reduced returns.
CDSC returns include a 1% contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) on Shares redeemed within 12 months of purchase. Net Asset Value (NAV) returns exclude this charge, which would have reduced returns.
Information Regarding Sales Charge Reductions and Waivers
Click the name for additional important information including objectives, risks, performance history and expense detail.
Returns include reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. Returns greater than one year are annualized.
Shares of ETFs are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Market returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 p.m. Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined for most ETFs), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Ordinary brokerage commissions apply and will reduce returns.
The yield more closely reflects the current earnings of the money market portfolio than the returns.

Returns quoted are past performance and do not guarantee future results; current performance may be lower or higher. Investment returns and principal value will vary; there may be a gain or loss when shares are sold.
Maximum Offering Price (MOP) returns include the maximum sales charge of 5.75% (4.75% for fixed income funds and 2.5% for Janus Henderson Short-Term Bond Fund). Net Asset Value (NAV) returns exclude these charges, which would have reduced returns.
CDSC returns include a 1% contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) on Shares redeemed within 12 months of purchase. Net Asset Value (NAV) returns exclude this charge, which would have reduced returns.
Information Regarding Sales Charge Reductions and Waivers
Click the name for additional important information including objectives, risks, performance history and expense detail.
Returns include reinvestment of dividends and capital gains.
Shares of ETFs are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Market returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 p.m. Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined for most ETFs), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Ordinary brokerage commissions apply and will reduce returns.
The yield more closely reflects the current earnings of the money market portfolio than the returns.
For Janus Henderson Government Money Market Fund: You could lose money by investing in the Fund. Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund’s sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at any time.
For Janus Henderson Money Market Fund: You could lose money by investing in the Fund. Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. The Fund may impose a fee upon the sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the Fund’s liquidity falls below required minimums because of market conditions or other factors. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund’s sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at any time.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or “star rating”, is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund’s monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The Morningstar Rating does not include any adjustment for sales loads. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. Ratings may vary by share class.
Ratings and/or rankings may be based, in part, on the performance of a predecessor fund or share class and are calculated by Morningstar using a methodology that differs from that used by Janus. Methodology differences may have a material effect on the return and therefore the rating/ranking.
When an expense waiver is in effect, it may have a material effect on the total return or yield, and therefore the ranking and/or rating for the period.

Amana Mutual Funds Trust
 





Amana Founders Video

 


Watch Amana Mutual Funds Trust founders, Nick Kaiser and Yaqub Mirza, discuss the creation and history of the Trust.

At Saturna Capital and the Amana Mutual Funds Trust, we endeavor to align our investments with our principles.
Our Funds favor companies with low price-to-earnings multiples, strong balance sheets, and proven businesses. They follow a value-oriented approach consistent with Islamic finance principles. Generally, these principles require that investors avoid interest and investments in businesses such as liquor, pornography, gambling, and banks. The Funds avoid bonds and other conventional fixed-income securities.
Saturna Capital selects investments in companies that to its knowledge do not violate the requirements of the Islamic faith at the time of investment. To ensure that investments continue to meet the requirements of the Islamic faith, Saturna Capital engages Amanie Advisors Sdn Bhd, a leading consultant specializing in Islamic finance.
The Amana Funds limit the securities they purchase to those consistent with Islamic principles. This limits opportunities and may affect performance.
 
 





Saturna White Papers: Educational Series 

  
  
 Dancing with Correlation 
 We explore the correlation between Islamic investment certificates, including sukuk, and other investment asset classes as a means of better understanding the risk and return characteristics of this unique and distinct asset class.
 
   

  
 What Makes Sukuk Halal? 
 We explain what differentiates Islamic investment certificates, often called sukuk, from conventional bonds, and identifies the distinctive features that form the core of what makes sukuk Islamic-compliant, or halal.
