The profound growth dynamics of the U.S. senior population and the success of the U.S. seniors housing industry create a powerful investment environment and position the Senior Living Investment Fund  for consistent profits in structured development opportunities. Demand for Senior Housing Continues to Exceed Supply. As an investor you can participate in early stage Senior Living Facility Developments







 
 
 


 
Why Senior Housing is Real Estate’s Most Recession Proof Asset Class ?
 
 




HIGH DEMAND  
The rate at which American Seniors are retiring is truly staggering. The number of Americans 65 and older will increase from 47.8 million in 2015 to 79.2 million by 2035, due to the emergence of Baby Boomers into the age of retirement. Such a vast increase only creates a greater demand for Senior Living Facilities.





LOW SUPPLY 
As the elderly population grows, the rate of senior housing new construction is not keeping pace. Units under construction began a significant decline in 2008 and continued to fall through 2011 with only modest growth through 2014. When these two dynamics are married, the need that is left unaddressed is the growing market for newer and better facilities/communities tailored to emerging retirees.

–
Senior Living Facilities are well positioned for success in all phases of the real estate cycle
 
Each Senior Living Development is Carefully Evaluated & Vetted

 

A detailed examination of all the risk elements are evaluated, managed and mitigated.
 



			–
		



 
Market demand, facility design & construction, location intelligence, operations management,  financial reserves, sound economics/business model and an executable exit strategy all must be present before any senior living development project is considered. Senior Living Fund gives investors insider access to these pre-vetted developments.
 
Senior Living as an asset class has been historically difficult for average investors to access until now. Institutional investors and specialized operators have been the primary beneficiaries concentrating on an asset class whose demand has been driven by major demographic trends.  Now astute individual investors can also capitalize on these trends and earn strong yields in a proven niche.
 
On a national macro level the demographic trends are clear. The rapidly aging population is fueling demand for senior living facilities that are in short supply. This is the main driver for growth and why senior living has continuously proven to be a strong asset class regardless of the condition of the overall economy.
 
On a micro level a much more detailed Due Diligence process takes place on each and every project to ensure every new senior living development is a success for investors and residents alike.  The projected returns of 13% – 21% are exceptional given the relative low risk of the investment.
 








 
LEARN MORE ABOUT OUR DETAILED DUE DILIGENCE PROCESS 











Location Selection: On every project sponsored by Senior Living Fund an independent 3rd party consultant is brought in to look at the local supply and demand and conduct absorption studies to insure facilities only get built in the highest demand micro markets.
Facility Design: Facilities are designed to highest standards for residence and for each project we bring in consultants on facility design that are known throughout the industry. Our facility designs are state of the art properties that are held in high regard by leading health care REITs which assist in executing exit strategy. More importantly our facility designs meet the demands on senior Baby Boomers, creating communities with multiple social destinations, restaurant style dining, spacious private rooms and baths, as well as therapy & wellness. The bottom line is Senior Living Fund encourages designs that afford the quality lifestyle that aging Americans deserve.
Developers: A detailed inquiry into each development team looks at the experience and track record of the developer. Our typical developer always has a seasoned team often with decades of experience in construction, development and management experience in the assisted living field.
Long Term Operators: *** This is where Senior Living projects differ from other real estate classes like multifamily, office or retail. The management of the facilities are highly specialized to the care of seniors. Having the right long term operator is possibly the most critical factor in a project’s success. Senior living Fund only works with long term operators with a track record of successful operation of senior living facilities in multiple states and multiple markets. Having high quality well respected Long Term Operators is one of the most essential elements in any senior living development.
Pre-Market Activities: Our operators start marketing occupancy during the development cycle. These Pre-market activities help minimize the time needed for stabilization and gets our properties to full occupancy and operational stabilization in short order.
Investor Exit Strategy: Senior Living Fund conducts the utmost due diligence on our Developers, Long Term Operators, Location Intelligence & Facility Design. Our facilities are operational and stabilized in the shortest amount of time possible. Facilities are built on demand to be acquired by a REIT or refinanced via HUD long term permanent financing typically in 48 months. A definitive timeline and exit strategy help mitigate and insure successful outcomes for all partners and investors.








 
 
How Does Senior Housing Perform Against Other Real Estate Sectors?
–







–
Senior Housing Is A Recession Resilient Asset Class
 







A major benefit for investors in the Senior Housing space is the resiliency of this particular sector of the commercial market. A key component of the Senior Housing market’s success is its lack of reliance on a particular economic or real estate environment. Senior Housing has been the number one performing commercial real estate sector for the last ten years. This includes the period encompassing the 2007 capital market collapse, in-which returns among other commercial sectors fell as much as 20%.








 

 
 



 
 
 
Senior Housing Has Been the Best Performing
Commercial Real Estate Sector For the Past 10 Years.

		3 Senior Housing REITs to Fund Your Retirement	
These senior REITs throw off big dividend yields

Sep 19, 2014, 9:11 am EDT  |  By Charles Sizemore, Principal of Sizemore Capital



 
  View All  

The Baby Boomers are going to need a new place to crash.
The largest generation in U.S. history is retiring en masse, and as things stand now, America lacks the senior housing inventory to accommodate them. A staggering 10,000 Baby Boomers turn 65 every day, and over the next 15 years, the number of Americans over the age of 50 will swell to 132 million. This means unprecedented demand for everything from active retirement communities with golf and tennis lessons to assisted living with full-time nurses.
This is fantastic news if you happen to be a senior housing landlord — and with the plethora of publicly traded senior-themed REITs, you can, indeed, be a landlord. Today, we’re going to look at the senior housing REITs best positioned to profit from the graying of America.
I should be clear on one point: Investing based on demographic trends is a long-term strategy. But your patience is likely to be rewarded. In their groundbreaking 2005 paper on demographics and industry returns, professors Stefano DellaVigna and Joshua Pollet found that, over time horizons of five to ten years, each additional point of annual demand growth due to demographic factors led to a 5%-10% jump in annual abnormal industry stock returns. But over periods of five years or less, demographics had little impact on stock returns. So just remember that patience is key with demographic trends.
With that said, let’s jump into some of the best potential long-term senior REIT buys.

21 of 100ResearchTop 100 Noncommercial OperatorsBrookdale Senior LivingSegment: Senior Living








 

2015 total resident capacity: 113, 0022015 total properties: 1, 140Headquarters: Brentwood, Tenn. 
With memory care, independent living, assisted living, continuing care retirement communities and skilled nursing care communities spread throughout 47 states, it’s fairly difficult not to find a Brookdale Senior Living community nearby. And the culture at those communities is changing—with baby boomers moving into senior living, operators are struggling to keep up. Here are three ways Brookdale is keeping up with those changing tides.
Training
Brookdale’s Culinary Arts Institute serves almost as an internal culinary school, bringing chefs into on-site classrooms to gain new cooking skills and learn about new cuisines—vital tools when facing a class of diners that is used to international flavors. A management training program also helps current employees develop their skills and take on new tasks, Joska J.W. Hajdu, former senior vice president of dining services, told FoodService Director earlier this year.
Menu variety
Brookdale’s culinary associates plan their own menus, which are added to a massive recipe database available to all facilities nationwide. This results in a resource that’s both regionally and ethnically diverse. The company’s memory care facilities follow the industry-leading Clare Bridge Dining Program; small dining rooms feature consistent seating, and menus focus on finger foods and weight loss prevention.
New spaces
Instead of constructing separate buildings for its first branded concept, Eat American Bistro, Brookdale found room for the multistyle concept within existing space. “You would almost need to envision a blend of a Starbucks coffee shop and a Panera soup-and-sandwich-type setup,” Hajdu said of the concept, which occupies a section of the lobby at a Dallas location. “In the evening, we have an element that would be similar to a Boston Market with a carving station.” Eat also features a full-service bar, and “really has become the heartbeat and the center of the community.”

BAY AREA HELP IS AVAILABLE

Care Indeed is here to help not only the patient but also the family member who’s caring for the patient as well. 

People with chronic conditions or disabilities prefer to be cared for at home as much as possible so they can be in familiar surroundings and with the people they love. The family member who is faced with an ongoing battle, whether it is a loved one's disease or impairment, may find his or her life changed. At some point, he or she will need help in order to stay emotionally and physically fit to care for his or her loved one. 

We can help the family member  prepare for the uncertainty that a loved one's health problem brings.

U.S. Real Estate
OverviewInvestment TeamInvestment CriteriaPortfolioNewsContactOverviewWe seek income and capital appreciation through a diverse portfolio of real estate investments.
HMC and its affiliates have owned, developed and managed multifamily, office, industrial, retail and hotel properties throughout the southeastern and southwestern United States. HMC has a history of identifying real estate investment opportunities through its network of long-term, strategic relationships.
Our approach is hands-on, targeting properties that we believe are undervalued, and where value can be created through focused operational and financial management. We seek smaller, more entrepreneurial transactions, typically between $20 million and $80 million, that are too large for individual investors but too small for the larger funds.

 Investment CriteriaOur investment process centers on “value enhancement” strategies. We target real estate investments that we believe possess cash flow potential and may benefit from the implementation of a rigorous, value-added asset management plan. This plan may involve capital improvements, expense reduction, proactive leasing, capital restructuring or asset repositioning.
We seek to invest in quality, mid-size ($20 million to $80 million), Class A and B office, multifamily, retail and industrial properties.
Our geographic focus is primary and secondary markets in the Mid-Atlantic, Southeast and Southwest regions of the United States, which possess diversified economies, meaningful population growth and strong employment growth.
