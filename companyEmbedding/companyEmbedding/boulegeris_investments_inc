About Us    
















Boulegeris Investments, Inc. conducts independent investment research, which includes fundamental analysis of a company, qualitative assessment of its management, and evaluation of a company's sector relevance at any given time. 

Portfolios are constructed to achieve appropriate diversification to modulate risk and to reflect the investment guidance provided by the client.

We seek companies with:

Proven management teams
Strong balance sheets
Constancy of earnings growthA competitive advantage in the marketplace

We view ourselves as prudent, long-term global investors. The firm is dedicated to maximizing total return by investing in companies with strong earnings growth and increasing dividends. We distinguish between the value of a company and the attractiveness of its stock at any given time. Though principally growth and income investors, we are equally committed to purchasing securities at appropriate valuations. 
While the primary focus of our management involves equity securities, fixed income securities are an integral component of retirement and other portfolios that must provide for required future cash flows.
We appreciate the dynamic nature of the capital markets and understand the necessity to constantly review and assess our investment decisions.

About Us    
















Throughout the year, Boulegeris Investments will provide commentary offering our view of market activity and outlook. Often a commentary will reinforce an important aspect of our investment philosophy.
Some recent commentaries:


Post-Election Market Outlook "Out over its skis" - November 18, 2016

Though many market mavens predicted otherwise, following the US election, the broad market surged upward, reflecting investors’ repositioning into and out of select industry groups. 


Discontinuities, Dividends and Two Little Engines That Could  - December 10, 2013

Market discontinuities derived from the ambiguity of the Federal Reserves tapering have created investment opportunities.

Dividends that Gleam Portfolios Bright - November 2, 2011

Qualitative dividends from our large, mid and small cap universe contribute to total return in a wide variety of market conditions.

Katrina Bonds Redux - June 23, 2011

We offer pragmatic solutions to address pressing national economic issues.

Harnessing Volatility through Dividends - June 23, 2010

By harnessing volatility and cultivating resilient income streams, investors can embrace with confidence an enduring strategy that offers a degree of certainty in an uncertain world.

Pheidippides, Dividends and Recovering Markets - August 4, 2009

The long-term impact of qualitative dividend income streams is analyzed. Generational investment opportunity is recognized in the midst of extreme market pessimism.

Azimuth North - March 22, 2009
At the trough of the third worst bear market in modern history, the case is made 
that the US equity markets would prove resilient, stabilize and record a positive year. 

Character is Destiny - December 30, 2008

In the midst of the global financial meltdown, we advocate for regulatory reform.

Please remember there's always the potential of losing money when you invest in securities. 
			
			Before you invest in a Section 529 plan, request the plan's official statement from your Financial Solutions Advisor and read it carefully. The official statement contains more complete information, including investment objectives, charges, expenses and risks of investing in the 529 plan, which you should consider carefully before investing. You should also consider whether your home state or your beneficiary's home state offers any state tax or other benefits that are only available for investments in such state's 529 plan. Section 529 plans are not guaranteed by any state or federal agency.

1 To be eligible for favorable tax treatment afforded to any earnings portion of withdrawals from Section 529 accounts, such withdrawals must be used for "qualified higher education expenses," as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. Any earnings withdrawn that are not used for such expenses are subject to federal income tax and may be subject to a 10% additional federal tax, as well as applicable state and local income taxes. 
			
2 Section 529 plans are established by various states and are offered to residents of all states. Depending on the laws of the customer's home state, favorable tax treatment for investing in a Section 529 plan may be limited to investments made in a Section 529 plan offered by the customer's home state. Neither Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated nor any of its subsidiaries are tax or legal advisors. We suggest you consult your personal tax or legal advisor before making tax or legal-related investment decisions.
