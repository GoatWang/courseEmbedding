History[edit]
Wilmington Trust was founded on July 8, 1903, by T. Coleman du Pont, then the president of DuPont, to manage the growing fortune of the duPont family.[2] DuPont opened the business in the dining room and parlor of a former private residence at 915 Market Street in Wilmington, Delaware, with a handful of investors and $500,000 in market capitalization.[3]
In 1907, the company moved to the DuPont Building at Tenth & Market Streets. It paid its first dividend (2.5%, $1.25 per share) on August 1, 1908. The company’s first merger occurred on July 15, 1912: the acquisitions of the First National Bank and the National Bank of Wilmington and Brandywine made it the largest bank on the East Coast. In 1971, it became one of the founding members of NASDAQ.[3] In 1999, it moved its listing to the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).[3]
On November 1, 2010, Wilmington Trust announced a merger with M&T Bank, of Buffalo, New York. The deal valued the 107-year-old company at $3.84 a share, or 46 percent less than its closing price on Oct. 29. Investors received 0.051 shares of Buffalo-based M&T for each Wilmington share.[4]
In 2011, it announced its intention to "voluntarily de-list" from the NYSE upon completion of its merger with M&T Bank.[3]
Wilmington Trust is one of the largest holders of fiduciary assets in the United States.[5]

Bailey & Glasser Files Suit against Wilmington Trust, National Association for Violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
Mar 16 17
Wilmington Trust, National Association announced that the company owes ESOP participants $30 million as result of a stock-purchase that violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. Bailey & Glasser represented the employee participants of the ESOP filed suit claiming the company caused the ESOP to purchase $200 million-plus of Constellis stock at an inflated price, violating federal pension law and trustee duties. Less than a year later, Constellis was sold and the ESOP was dissolved. United States District Court Judge, Leonie M. Brinkema ruled that the company engaged in a prohibited transaction by failing to ensure that the ESOP paid no more than adequate consideration for the stock in Constellis and, as a result, damaged the ESOP by agreeing to overpay $29,773,250.00 for the stock. Court found Wilmington liable for $29.8 million in damages for overpaying for the company stock.

NEWFIXED INCOME
Jobs report: The rebound is welcome, but the slowdown remains
The headline 287,000 jobs added in June is of course a welcome development after the disappointing figure for May. But the fact remains that we are seeing a slowdown in job growth well below the blistering pace set in 2014 and to a lesser extent 2015. As we have argued for quite some time, the slowdown is fully expected given the tightening of the labor market and lack of available workers.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

History[edit]
Wilmington Trust was founded on July 8, 1903, by T. Coleman du Pont, then the president of DuPont, to manage the growing fortune of the duPont family.[2] DuPont opened the business in the dining room and parlor of a former private residence at 915 Market Street in Wilmington, Delaware, with a handful of investors and $500,000 in market capitalization.[3]
In 1907, the company moved to the DuPont Building at Tenth & Market Streets. It paid its first dividend (2.5%, $1.25 per share) on August 1, 1908. The company’s first merger occurred on July 15, 1912: the acquisitions of the First National Bank and the National Bank of Wilmington and Brandywine made it the largest bank on the East Coast. In 1971, it became one of the founding members of NASDAQ.[3] In 1999, it moved its listing to the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).[3]
On November 1, 2010, Wilmington Trust announced a merger with M&T Bank, of Buffalo, New York. The deal valued the 107-year-old company at $3.84 a share, or 46 percent less than its closing price on Oct. 29. Investors received 0.051 shares of Buffalo-based M&T for each Wilmington share.[4]
In 2011, it announced its intention to "voluntarily de-list" from the NYSE upon completion of its merger with M&T Bank.[3]
Wilmington Trust is one of the largest holders of fiduciary assets in the United States.[5]
Offices[edit]

amount of Notes that may be authenticated and delivered under this
Indenture is initially limited to $650,000,000, subject to Section
2.03 and except for Notes authenticated and delivered upon
registration or transfer of, or in exchange for, or in lieu of
other Notes to the extent expressly permitted hereunder.

Section 2.02. Form and
Dating . (a) The Notes and the Trustee’s certificate
of authentication to be borne by such Notes shall be substantially
in the respective forms set forth in Exhibit A , the terms
and provisions of which shall constitute, and are hereby expressly
incorporated in and made a part of this Indenture. To the extent
applicable, the Company and the Trustee, by their execution and
delivery of this Indenture, expressly agree to such terms and
provisions and to be bound thereby.

Any Global Note may be endorsed with
or have incorporated in the text thereof such legends or recitals
or changes not inconsistent with the provisions of this Indenture
as may be required by the Notes Custodian or the Depositary, or as
may be required to comply with any applicable law or any regulation
thereunder or with the rules and regulations of any securities
exchange or automated quotation system upon which the Notes may be
listed or traded or designated for issuance or to conform with any
usage with respect thereto, or to indicate any special limitations
or restrictions to which any particular Notes are
subject.

Any of the Notes may have such
letters, numbers or other marks of identification and such
notations, legends or endorsements as the Officer executing the
same may approve (execution thereof to be conclusive evidence of
such approval) and as are not inconsistent with the provisions of
this Indenture, or as may be required to comply with any law or
with any rule or regulation made pursuant thereto or with any rule
or regulation of any securities exchange or automated quotation
system on which the Notes may be listed or designated for issuance,
or to conform to usage or to indicate any special limitations or
restrictions to which any particular Notes are subject.

Each Global Note shall represent
such principal amount of the outstanding Notes as shall be
specified therein and shall provide that it shall represent the
aggregate principal amount of outstanding Notes from time to time
endorsed thereon and that the aggregate principal amount of
outstanding Notes represented thereby may from time to time be
increased or reduced to reflect redemptions, repurchases,
cancellations, conversions, transfers or exchanges permitted
hereby. Any endorsement of a Global Note to reflect the amount of
any increase or decrease in the amount of outstanding Notes
represented thereby shall be made by the Trustee or the Notes
Custodian, at the direction of the Trustee, in such manner and upon
instructions given by the Holder of such Notes in accordance with
this Indenture. Payment of principal (including the Redemption
Price and the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price, if applicable)
of, and accrued and unpaid interest on, a Global Note shall be made
to the Holder of such Note on the date of payment, unless a record
date or other means of determining Holders eligible to receive
payment is provided for herein.

Section 2.03. Execution and
Authentication; Payments of Interest and Defaulted Amounts .
(a) The Notes shall be issuable only in registered form
without coupons and only in minimum denominations of $1,000
principal amount and any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess
thereof. Each Note shall be dated the date of its authentication
and shall bear interest from the date specified on the face of such
Note. An Officer shall sign the Notes for the Company by manual or
facsimile signature. Typographic and other minor errors or defects
in any such facsimile signature shall not affect the validity or
enforceability of any Note which has been authenticated and
delivered by the Trustee. If an Officer whose signature is on a
Note no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee
authenticates the Note, the Note shall
 
12


be valid nevertheless. A Note shall not be valid
until an authorized signatory of the Trustee manually signs the
certificate of authentication on the Note. The signature shall be
conclusive evidence that the Note has been authenticated under this
Indenture.

(b) The Trustee shall authenticate
and make available for delivery Notes for original issue in the
aggregate principal amount of up to $650,000,000 upon receipt of a
Company Order. The Company Order shall specify the amount of Notes
to be authenticated, shall provide that all such Notes will be
represented by a Global Note and the date on which each original
issue of Notes is to be authenticated. The Company at any time or
from time to time may, without the consent of the Holders, reopen
this Indenture and issue additional Notes with the same terms as
the Notes initially issued hereunder (other than differences in the
issue date, issue price, interest accrued prior to the issue date
of such additional Notes and, if applicable, transfer restrictions
on such notes) in an unlimited aggregate principal amount under
this Indenture; provided that if the additional Notes are
not fungible with the Notes initially issued hereunder for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, the additional Notes shall have a
separate CUSIP number. Such additional Notes shall, together with
the Notes initially issued hereunder, constitute a single series of
Notes under this Indenture, including without limitation in
determining the necessary Holders who may take the actions or
consent to the taking of actions as specified in this
Indenture.

(c) Accrued interest on the Notes
shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year composed of twelve
30-day months and, for partial months, on the basis of the number
of days actually elapsed in a 30-day month. The Person in whose
name any Note (or its predecessor) is registered on register of the
Registrar at the close of business on any Regular Record Date with
respect to any Interest Payment Date shall be entitled to receive
the interest payable on such Interest Payment Date. Interest shall
be payable at the office or agency of the Company maintained by the
Company for such purposes, which shall initially be the Corporate
Trust Office. The Company shall pay interest (i) on any
Certificated Notes (A) to Holders having an aggregate
principal amount of $5.0 million or less, by check mailed to the
Holders of these Notes at their address as it appears in the
register of the Registrar and (B) to Holders having an
aggregate principal amount of more than $5.0 million, either by
check mailed to the Holders of these Notes or upon application by a
Holder to the Registrar not later than the relevant Regular Record
Date, by wire transfer in immediately available funds to that
Holder’s account within the United States, which application
shall remain in effect until the Holder notifies, in writing, the
Registrar to the contrary or (ii) through the Paying Agent, on
any Global Note by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
the account of the Depositary or its nominee.

(d) Any Defaulted Amounts shall
forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the relevant payment
date by virtue of its having been such Holder but shall accrue
interest per annum at the rate borne by the Notes, subject to the
enforceability thereof under applicable law, from, and including,
such relevant payment date to, but excluding, the date on which
such Defaulted Amounts shall have been paid by the Company, at its
election in each case, as provided in subsection (i) or (ii)
below:

(i) The Company may elect to make
payment of any Defaulted Amounts to the Persons in whose names the
Notes (or their respective predecessor Notes) are
 
13



registered at the close of business
on a special record date for the payment of such Defaulted Amounts,
which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall
notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of the Defaulted
Amounts proposed to be paid on each Note and the date of the
proposed payment (which shall be not less than 25 days after the
receipt by the Trustee of such notice, unless the Trustee shall
consent to an earlier date), and at the same time the Company shall
deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate
amount to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Amounts or shall
make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit on
or prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when
deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons
entitled to such Defaulted Amounts as in this clause provided.
Thereupon the Company shall fix a special record date for the
payment of such Defaulted Amounts which shall be not more than 15
days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed
payment, and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee
of the notice of the proposed payment. The Company shall promptly
notify the Trustee of such special record date at least five
(5) Business Days before such notice is to be delivered to the
Holders, and the Trustee, in the name and at the expense of the
Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such
Defaulted Amounts and the special record date therefor to be sent
to each Holder at its address as it appears in the register of the
Registrar, not less than 10 days prior to such special record date.
Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Amounts and the
special record date therefor having been so sent, such Defaulted
Amounts shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Notes (or
their respective predecessor Notes) are registered at the close of
business on such special record date and shall no longer be payable
pursuant to the following subsection (ii) of this Section
2.03(d).

(ii) The Company may make payment of
any Defaulted Amounts in any other lawful manner not inconsistent
with the requirements of any securities exchange or automated
quotation system on which the Notes may be listed or designated for
issuance, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange
or automated quotation system, if, after notice given by the
Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this
clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the
Trustee.

Section 2.04. Registrar,
Paying Agent and Conversion Agent . The Company shall maintain
one or more offices or agencies where Notes may be presented for
registration of transfer or for exchange (each, a “
Registrar ”), one or more offices or agencies where
Notes may be presented for payment (each, a “ Paying
Agent ”), one or more offices or agencies where Notes may
be presented for conversion (each, a “ Conversion
Agent ”) and one or more offices or agencies where
notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Notes
and this Indenture may be made. The Company will at all times
maintain a Paying Agent, Conversion Agent, Registrar and an office
or agency where notices and demands to or upon the Company in
respect of the Notes and this Indenture may be made; provided
however, that under no circumstances shall the Corporate Trust
Office be an office or agency of the Company for the purpose of
service of legal process on the Company. The Registrar shall keep a
register of the Notes and of their registration of transfer and
exchange. The
 
14


Company shall give prompt written notice to the
Trustee of the location, and any change in the location, of such
office or agency.

The Company shall enter into an
appropriate agency agreement with any Agent not a party to this
Indenture. The agreement shall implement the provisions of this
Indenture that relate to such Agent. The Company shall give prompt
written notice to the Trustee of the name and address of any Agent
not a party to this Indenture. If the Company fails to maintain a
Registrar, Paying Agent, Conversion Agent or agent for service of
notices and demands in any place required by this Indenture, or
fails to give the foregoing notice, the Trustee shall act as such.
The Company or any Affiliate of the Company may act as Paying Agent
(except for the purposes of Article 9). Upon the occurrence of any
Event of Default under Section 7.01(i) or Section 7.01(j), the
Trustee shall automatically be the Paying Agent.

The Company hereby initially
designates the Trustee as Paying Agent, Registrar, Notes Custodian
and Conversion Agent and the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee
as an office or agency of the Company for each of the aforesaid
purposes. The Company may, however, change the Paying Agent or
Registrar without prior notice to the Holders but shall promptly
notify the Holders through the Trustee following any such change,
and may act as Paying Agent or Registrar.

Section 2.05. Paying Agent
to Hold Money in Trust . Prior to 11:00 a.m., New York City
time, on each due date of the principal of or interest on any Notes
(including the Redemption Price and the Fundamental Change
Repurchase Price, if any), the Company shall deposit with a Paying
Agent a sum sufficient to pay such principal or interest (including
the Redemption Price and the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price,
if any) so becoming due. A Paying Agent shall hold in trust for the
benefit of the Holders or the Trustee all money held by the Paying
Agent for the payment of principal of or interest on the Notes
(including the Redemption Price and the Fundamental Change
Repurchase Price, if any), and shall notify the Trustee of any
default by the Company (or any other obligor on the Notes) in
making any such payment. The Paying Agent shall apply the deposited
money in accordance with this Indenture and the Notes to the
payment of the principal of, and interest on, the Notes (including
the Redemption Price and the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price,
if any); provided that such money need not be segregated
from other funds except to the extent required by law. If the
Company or an Affiliate of the Company acts as Paying Agent, it
shall, before 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on each due date of
the principal of or interest on any Notes (including the Redemption
Price and the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price, if any),
segregate the money and hold it as a separate trust fund for the
benefit of the Holders. The Company at any time may require a
Paying Agent to pay all money held by it to the Trustee, and the
Trustee may at any time during the continuance of any default, upon
written request to a Paying Agent, require such Paying Agent to pay
forthwith to the Trustee all sums so held in trust by such Paying
Agent. Upon doing so, the Paying Agent (other than the Company)
shall have no further liability for the money.

Section 2.06. Transfer and
Exchange; Restrictions on Transfer; Depositary . (a) The
register of Holders maintained by the Registrar shall be in written
form or in any form capable of being converted into written form
within a reasonable period of time. Upon surrender for registration
of transfer of any Note to the Registrar, and satisfaction of the
requirements for
 
15


such transfer set forth in this Section 2.06,
the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and
deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees,
one or more new Notes of any authorized denominations and of a like
aggregate principal amount and bearing such restrictive legends as
may be required by this Indenture.

Notes may be exchanged for other
Notes of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate
principal amount, upon surrender of the Notes to be exchanged at
any such office or agency maintained by the Company pursuant to
Section 2.04. Whenever any Notes are so surrendered for exchange,
the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and
deliver, the Notes that the Holder making the exchange is entitled
to receive, bearing registration numbers not contemporaneously
outstanding.

All Notes presented or surrendered
for registration of transfer or for exchange, repurchase or
conversion shall (if so required by the Company, the Trustee or the
Registrar) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written
instrument or instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the
Company and duly executed, by the Holder thereof or its
attorney-in-fact duly authorized in writing.

No service charge shall be imposed
by the Company, the Trustee, the Registrar or the Paying Agent for
any exchange or registration of transfer of Notes, but the Company
may require a Holder to pay a sum sufficient to cover any
documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer tax required in
connection therewith as a result of the name of the Holder of new
Notes issued upon such exchange or registration of transfer being
different from the name of the Holder of the old Notes surrendered
for exchange or registration of transfer.

None of the Company, the Trustee or
the Registrar shall be required to exchange or register a transfer
of (i) any Notes surrendered for conversion or, if a portion
of any Note is surrendered for conversion, such portion thereof
surrendered for conversion, (ii) any Notes, or a portion of
any Note, surrendered for repurchase (and not withdrawn) in
accordance with Article 3 or (iii) any Notes selected for
redemption in accordance with Section 3.01, except the unredeemed
portion of any Note being redeemed in part.

All Notes issued upon any
registration of transfer or exchange of Notes in accordance with
this Indenture shall be the valid obligations of the Company,
evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under
this Indenture as the Notes surrendered upon such registration of
transfer or exchange.

(b) So long as the Notes are
eligible for book-entry settlement with the Depositary, unless
otherwise required by law, subject to the fourth paragraph from the
end of Section 2.06(c) all Notes shall be represented by one or
more Notes in global form (each, a “ Global Note
”) registered in the name of the Depositary or the nominee of
the Depositary. The transfer and exchange of beneficial interests
in a Global Note that does not involve the issuance of a
Certificated Note shall be effected through the Depositary (but not
the Trustee or the Notes Custodian) in accordance with this
Indenture (including the restrictions on transfer set forth herein)
and the procedures of the Depositary therefor.
 
16

required under this Section 2.06(c) to bear the legend set forth in
this Section 2.06(c) (together with any Common Stock issued upon

forth in Section 2.06(d), collectively, the “ Restricted
Securities ”) shall be subject to the restrictions on
transfer set forth in this Section 2.06(c) (including the legend
set forth below), unless such restrictions on transfer shall be
eliminated or otherwise waived by written consent of the Company,
and the Holder of each such Restricted Security, by such
Holder’s acceptance thereof, agrees to be bound by all such
restrictions on transfer. As used in this Section 2.06(c) and
Section 2.06(d), the term “ transfer ”
encompasses any sale, pledge, transfer or other disposition
whatsoever of any Restricted Security.

Until the date (the “
Resale Restriction Termination Date ”) that is the
later of (1) the date that is one year after the last date of
original issuance of the Notes, or such shorter period of time as
permitted by Rule 144 or any successor provision thereto, and

law, any certificate evidencing such Note (and all securities
issued in exchange therefor or substitution thereof, other than
Common Stock, if any, issued upon conversion thereof, which shall
bear the legend set forth in Section 2.06(d), if applicable) shall
bear a legend in substantially the following form (unless such
Notes have been transferred pursuant to a registration statement
that has become or been declared effective under the Securities Act
and that continues to be effective at the time of such transfer, or
sold pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Rule
144 or any similar provision then in force under the Securities
Act, or unless otherwise agreed by the Company in writing, with

SECURITIES ACT.

PRIOR TO THE REGISTRATION OF ANY
TRANSFER IN ACCORDANCE WITH CLAUSE (2)(D) ABOVE, THE COMPANY
AND THE REGISTRAR RESERVE THE RIGHT TO REQUIRE THE DELIVERY OF SUCH
LEGAL OPINIONS, CERTIFICATIONS OR OTHER EVIDENCE AS MAY REASONABLY
BE REQUIRED IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THAT THE PROPOSED TRANSFER IS
BEING MADE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE SECURITIES ACT AND APPLICABLE
STATE SECURITIES LAWS. NO REPRESENTATION IS MADE AS TO THE
AVAILABILITY OF ANY EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF
THE SECURITIES ACT.

No transfer of any Note prior to the
Resale Restriction Termination Date will be registered by the
Registrar unless the applicable box on the Form of Assignment and
Transfer has been checked.

Any Note (or security issued in
exchange or substitution therefor) (i) as to which such
restrictions on transfer shall have expired in accordance with
their terms, (ii) that has been transferred pursuant to a
registration statement that has become effective or been declared
effective under the Securities Act and that continues to be
effective at the time of such transfer or (iii) that has been
sold pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Rule
144 or any similar provision then in force under the Securities
Act, may, upon surrender of such Note for exchange to the Registrar
in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.06, be
exchanged for a new Note or Notes, of like tenor and aggregate
principal amount, which shall not bear the restrictive legend
required by this Section 2.06(c) and shall not be assigned a
restricted CUSIP number. The Company shall be entitled to instruct
the Notes Custodian in writing to so surrender any Global Note as
to which any of the conditions set forth in clause (i) through
(iii) of the immediately preceding sentence have been
satisfied, and, upon such instruction, the Notes Custodian shall so
surrender such Global Note for exchange in accordance with the
Applicable Procedures; and any new Global Note so exchanged
therefor shall not bear the restrictive legend specified in this
Section 2.06(c) and shall not be assigned a restricted CUSIP
number. The Company shall promptly notify the Trustee in writing
upon the occurrence of the Resale Restriction Termination Date and
promptly after a registration statement, if any, with respect to
the Notes or any Common Stock issued upon conversion of the Notes
has been declared effective under the Securities Act.

Notwithstanding any other provisions
of this Indenture (other than the provisions set forth in this
Section 2.06(c)), a Global Note may not be transferred as a whole
or in part
 
18


except (i) by the Depositary to a nominee
of the Depositary or by a nominee of the Depositary to the
Depositary or another nominee of the Depositary or by the
Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary or a
nominee of such successor Depositary and (ii) for exchange of
a Global Note or a portion thereof for one or more Certificated
Notes in accordance with the second immediately succeeding
paragraph.

The Depositary shall be a clearing
agency registered under the Exchange Act. The Company initially
appoints DTC to act as Depositary with respect to each Global Note.
Initially, each Global Note shall be issued to the Depositary,
registered in the name of Cede & Co., as the nominee of
the Depositary, and deposited with the Trustee as custodian for
Cede & Co.

If (i) the Depositary notifies
the Company at any time that the Depositary is unwilling or unable
to continue as depositary for the Global Notes and a successor
depositary is not appointed within 90 days, (ii) the
Depositary ceases to be registered as a clearing agency under the
Exchange Act and a successor depositary is not appointed within 90
days or (iii) an Event of Default with respect to the Notes
has occurred and is continuing and a beneficial owner of any Note
requests that its beneficial interest therein be issued as a
Certificated Note, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee, upon
receipt of an Officers’ Certificate and a Company Order for
the authentication and delivery of Notes, shall authenticate and
deliver (x) in the case of clause (iii), a Certificated Note
to such beneficial owner in a principal amount equal to the
principal amount of such Note corresponding to such beneficial
owner’s beneficial interest and (y) in the case of
clause (i) or (ii), Certificated Notes to each beneficial
owner of the related Global Notes (or a portion thereof) in an
aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount
of such Global Notes in exchange for such Global Notes, and upon
delivery of the Global Notes to the Trustee such Global Notes shall
be canceled.

Certificated Notes issued in
exchange for all or a part of the Global Note pursuant to this
Section 2.06(c) shall be registered in such names and in such
authorized denominations as the Depositary, pursuant to
instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise,
or, in the case of clause (iii) of the immediately preceding
paragraph, the relevant beneficial owner, shall instruct the
Trustee. Upon execution and authentication, the Trustee shall
deliver such Certificated Notes to the Persons in whose names such
Certificated Notes are so registered.

At such time as all interests in a
Global Note have been converted, canceled, repurchased, redeemed or
transferred, such Global Note shall be, upon receipt thereof,
canceled by the Trustee in accordance with standing procedures and
existing instructions between the Depositary and the Notes
Custodian. At any time prior to such cancellation, if any interest
in a Global Note is exchanged for Certificated Notes, converted,
canceled, repurchased, redeemed or transferred to a transferee who
receives Certificated Notes therefor or any Certificated Note is
exchanged or transferred for part of such Global Note, the
principal amount of such Global Note shall, in accordance with the
standing procedures and instructions existing between the
Depositary and the Notes Custodian, be appropriately reduced or
increased, as the case may be, and an endorsement shall be made on
such Global
 
19


Note, by the Trustee or the Notes Custodian, at
the direction of the Trustee, to reflect such reduction or
increase.

None of the Company, the Trustee,
any Agent or any agent of the Company, the Trustee or any Agent
shall have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the
records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial
ownership interests of a Global Note or maintaining, supervising or
reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership
interests.

(d) Until the Resale Restriction
Termination Date, any stock certificate representing Common Stock
issued upon conversion of a Note shall bear a legend in
substantially the following form (unless such Common Stock has been
transferred pursuant to a registration statement that has become or
been declared effective under the Securities Act and that continues
to be effective at the time of such transfer, or pursuant to the
exemption from registration provided by Rule 144 or any similar
provision then in force under the Securities Act, or such Common
Stock has been issued upon conversion of a Note that has
transferred pursuant to a registration statement that has become or
been declared effective under the Securities Act and that continues
to be effective at the time of such transfer, or pursuant to the
exemption from registration provided by Rule 144 or any similar
provision then in force under the Securities Act, or unless
otherwise agreed by the Company with written notice thereof to the
Trustee and any transfer agent for the Common Stock):

THIS SECURITY HAS NOT BEEN
REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE
“ SECURITIES ACT ”), AND MAY NOT BE OFFERED,
SOLD, PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT IN ACCORDANCE WITH
THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE. BY ITS ACQUISITION HEREOF OR OF A
BENEFICIAL INTEREST HEREIN, THE ACQUIRER:

(1) REPRESENTS THAT IT AND ANY
ACCOUNT FOR WHICH IT IS ACTING IS A “QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL
BUYER” (WITHIN THE MEANING OF RULE 144A UNDER THE SECURITIES
ACT) AND THAT IT EXERCISES SOLE INVESTMENT DISCRETION WITH RESPECT
TO EACH SUCH ACCOUNT, AND

(2) AGREES FOR THE BENEFIT OF
NUVASIVE, INC. (THE “COMPANY”) THAT IT WILL NOT OFFER,
SELL, PLEDGE OR OTHERWISE TRANSFER THIS SECURITY OR ANY BENEFICIAL
INTEREST HEREIN PRIOR TO THE DATE THAT IS THE LATER OF (X) ONE
YEAR AFTER THE LAST ORIGINAL ISSUE DATE OF THE SERIES OF NOTES UPON
THE CONVERSION OF WHICH THIS SECURITY WAS ISSUED OR SUCH SHORTER
PERIOD OF TIME AS PERMITTED BY RULE 144 UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR
ANY SUCCESSOR PROVISION THERETO AND (Y) SUCH LATER DATE, IF
ANY, AS MAY BE REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EXCEPT:

(A) TO THE COMPANY OR ANY SUBSIDIARY
THEREOF, OR

(B) PURSUANT TO A REGISTRATION
STATEMENT WHICH HAS BECOME EFFECTIVE UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT,
OR
 
20



(C) TO A QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL
BUYER IN COMPLIANCE WITH RULE 144A UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT,
OR

(D) PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION FROM
REGISTRATION PROVIDED BY RULE 144 UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR ANY
OTHER AVAILABLE EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE
SECURITIES ACT.

PRIOR TO THE REGISTRATION OF ANY
TRANSFER IN ACCORDANCE WITH CLAUSE (2)(D) ABOVE, THE COMPANY
AND THE TRANSFER AGENT FOR THE COMPANY’S COMMON STOCK RESERVE
THE RIGHT TO REQUIRE THE DELIVERY OF SUCH LEGAL OPINIONS,
CERTIFICATIONS OR OTHER EVIDENCE AS MAY REASONABLY BE REQUIRED IN
ORDER TO DETERMINE THAT THE PROPOSED TRANSFER IS BEING MADE IN
COMPLIANCE WITH THE SECURITIES ACT AND APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES
LAWS. NO REPRESENTATION IS MADE AS TO THE AVAILABILITY OF ANY
EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES
ACT.

Any such Common Stock (i) as to
which such restrictions on transfer shall have expired in
accordance with their terms, (ii) that has been transferred
pursuant to a registration statement that has become or been
declared effective under the Securities Act and that continues to
be effective at the time of such transfer or (iii) that has
been sold pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by
Rule 144 or any similar provision then in force under the
Securities Act, may, upon surrender of the certificates
representing such shares of Common Stock for exchange in accordance
with the procedures of the transfer agent for the Common Stock, be
exchanged for a new certificate or certificates for a like
aggregate number of shares of Common Stock, which shall not bear
the restrictive legend required by this Section 2.06(d).

(e) Any Note or Common Stock issued
upon the conversion or exchange of a Note that is repurchased or
owned by any Affiliate of the Company (or any Person who was an
Affiliate of the Company at any time during the three months
preceding) may not be resold by such Affiliate (or such Person, as
the case may be) unless registered under the Securities Act or
resold pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements
of the Securities Act in a transaction that results in such Note or
Common Stock, as the case may be, no longer being a
“restricted security” (as defined under Rule 144). The
Company shall cause any Note that is repurchased or owned by it to
be surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation in accordance with
Section 2.11.

Section 2.07. Replacement
Notes . If any mutilated Note is surrendered to the Company, a
Registrar or the Trustee, or the Trustee receives evidence to its
satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Note, and
there is delivered to the Company, the applicable Registrar and the
Trustee such security or indemnity as will be required by them to
save each of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the
Company, such Registrar or the Trustee that such Note has been
acquired by a protected purchaser, the Company shall execute, and
upon its written request the Trustee shall authenticate and
deliver, in exchange for any such
 
21


mutilated Note or in lieu of any such destroyed,
lost or stolen Note, a new Note of like tenor and principal amount,
bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.

In case the principal amount of any
such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Note has become due and
payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a
new Note, pay all amounts due on such Note.

Upon the issuance of any new Notes
under this Section 2.07, the Company may require the payment of a
sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that
may be imposed in relation thereto and any other reasonable
expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses of the Trustee
or the Registrar) in connection therewith.

Every new Note issued pursuant to
this Section 2.07 in lieu of any mutilated, destroyed, lost or
stolen Note shall constitute an original additional contractual
obligation of the Company, whether or not the mutilated, destroyed,
lost or stolen Note shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and
shall be entitled to all benefits of this Indenture equally and
proportionately with any and all other Notes duly issued
hereunder.

The provisions of this Section 2.07
are (to the extent lawful) exclusive and shall preclude (to the
extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the
replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen
Notes.

Section 2.08. Outstanding
Notes . Notes outstanding at any time are all Notes
authenticated by the Trustee, except for those canceled by it,
those converted pursuant to Article 4, those delivered to it for
cancellation or surrendered for transfer or exchange, those
described in this Section 2.08 as not outstanding, those redeemed
by the Company pursuant to Section 3.02 and those repurchased by
the Company pursuant to the second paragraph of Section
2.11.

If a Note is replaced pursuant to
Section 2.07, it ceases to be outstanding unless the Trustee
receives proof satisfactory to it that the replaced Note is held by
a protected purchaser.

If a Paying Agent (other than the
Company or an Affiliate of the Company) holds on the Maturity Date
money sufficient to pay the principal of and accrued interest on
Notes (or portions thereof) payable on that date, then on and after
such Maturity Date such Notes (or portions thereof, as the case may
be) shall cease to be outstanding and interest on them shall cease
to accrue, subject to Section 9.04.

Section 2.09. Treasury
Notes . In determining whether the Holders of the required
principal amount of Notes have concurred in any notice, direction,
waiver or consent, Notes owned by the Company or any other obligor
on the Notes or by any Affiliate of the Company or of such other
obligor shall be disregarded, except that, for purposes of
determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on
any such notice, direction, waiver or consent, only Notes that a
Responsible Officer of the Trustee actually knows are so owned
shall be so disregarded. Notes so owned that have been pledged in
good faith shall not be disregarded if the pledgee establishes to
the satisfaction of the Trustee the pledgee’s right so to act
with
 
22


respect to the Notes and that the pledgee is not
the Company or any other obligor on the Notes or any Affiliate of
the Company or of such other obligor.

Section 2.10. Temporary
Notes . Until definitive Notes are ready for delivery, the
Company may prepare and execute, and, upon receipt of a Company
Order, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Notes.
Temporary Notes shall be substantially in the form of Certificated
Notes but may have variations that the Company considers
appropriate for temporary Notes and as shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Trustee. Without unreasonable delay, the Company
shall prepare and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order,
shall authenticate and deliver definitive Notes in exchange for
temporary Notes. Holders of temporary Notes shall be entitled to
all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with
any and all other Notes duly issued hereunder.

Section 2.11. Cancellation;
Repurchase . The Company shall cause all Notes surrendered for
the purpose of payment, redemption, repurchase (including as
described in the following paragraph), registration of transfer or
exchange or conversion, if surrendered to any Person other than the
Trustee (including any of the Company’s agents, Subsidiaries
or Affiliates), to be delivered to the Trustee for cancellation.
The Registrar, the Paying Agent and the Conversion Agent shall
forward to the Trustee or its agent any Notes surrendered to them
for registration of transfer, exchange, payment or conversion. The
Trustee and no one else shall promptly cancel, in accordance with
its customary procedures, all Notes surrendered for the purpose of
payment, repurchase, redemption, registration of transfer,
exchange, conversion or cancellation and shall dispose of canceled
Notes (subject to the record retention requirements of the Exchange
Act), in accordance with its standard procedures, and no Notes
shall be authenticated in exchange thereof except as expressly
permitted by any of the provisions of this Indenture. The Company
may not hold or resell such Notes or issue new Notes to replace
Notes that it has purchased or otherwise acquired or that have been
delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (other than issuing new
Notes as expressly permitted by this Indenture in respect of Notes
that have been surrendered to the Company for the purpose of
registration of transfer or exchange or, in the case of a partial
conversion, redemption or repurchase upon a Fundamental Change, in
respect of the portion thereof that is not so converted or
repurchased).

The Company may, to the extent
permitted by law, and directly or indirectly (regardless of whether
such Notes are surrendered to the Company), repurchase Notes in the
open market or otherwise, whether by the Company or its
Subsidiaries or through a private or public tender or exchange
offer or through counterparties to private agreements, including by
cash-settled swaps or other derivatives. The Company shall cause
any Notes so repurchased (other than Notes repurchased pursuant to
cash-settled swaps or other cash-settled derivatives) to be
surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation in accordance with this
Section 2.11.

Section 2.12. CUSIP
Numbers . The Company in issuing the Notes may use one or more
“CUSIP” numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so,
the Trustee shall use “CUSIP” numbers in notices as a
convenience to Holders; provided that any such notice may
state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such
numbers either as printed on the Notes or as contained in any
notice and that reliance may be placed only on the other
identification numbers printed on the Notes, and any such notice or
related action by the Company
 
23


contemplated thereby shall not be affected by
any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company will
promptly notify the Trustee of any change in the
“CUSIP” numbers.

Section 3.01. Optional
Redemption .

(a) No sinking fund is provided for
the Notes. The Notes shall not be redeemable by the Company prior
to March 20, 2019. On or after March 20, 2019 until the
close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding
September 15, 2020, the Company may redeem (an “
Optional Redemption ”) for cash all or part of the
Notes, at the Redemption Price, if the Last Reported Sale Price of
the Common Stock has been at least 130% of the Conversion Price
then in effect for at least 20 Trading Days (whether or not
consecutive) during any 30 consecutive Trading Day period
(including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and
including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the date on which
the Company provides the Redemption Notice in accordance with
Section 3.01(b).

(b) In case the Company exercises
its Optional Redemption right to redeem all or, as the case may be,
any part of the Notes pursuant to Section 3.01(a), it shall fix a
date for redemption (each, a “ Redemption Date
”) and it or, at its written request received by the Trustee
not less than five (5) Business Days before such notice is to
be sent (or such shorter period of time as may be acceptable to the
Trustee), the Trustee, in the name of and at the expense of the
Company, shall send or cause to be sent a written notice of such
Optional Redemption (a “ Redemption Notice ”)
not less than 95 nor more than 120 calendar days prior to the
Redemption Date to each Holder of Notes so to be redeemed as a
whole or in part at its last address as the same appears on the
register of the Registrar; provided, however, that, if the Company
shall give such notice, it shall also give written notice of the
Redemption Date to the Trustee. The Redemption Date must be a
Business Day.

(c) The Redemption Notice, if sent
in the manner herein provided, shall be conclusively presumed to
have been duly given, whether or not the Holder receives such
notice. In any case, failure to send such Redemption Notice or any
defect in the Redemption Notice to the Holder of any Note
designated for redemption as a whole or in part shall not affect
the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other
Note.

(d) Each Redemption Notice shall
specify:

(i) the Redemption Date;

(ii) the Redemption
Price;

(iii) that on the Redemption Date,
the Redemption Price will become due and payable upon each Note to
be redeemed, and that interest thereon, if any, shall cease to
accrue on and after the Redemption Date;
 
24



(iv) the place or places where such
Notes are to be surrendered for payment of the Redemption
Price;

(v) that Holders may surrender their
Notes for conversion at any time prior to the close of business on
the Scheduled Trading Day immediately preceding the Redemption
Date;

(vi) the procedures a converting
Holder must follow to convert its Notes;

(vii) the Conversion Rate and, if
applicable, the number of Additional Shares added to the Conversion
Rate in accordance with Section 4.04;

(viii) the CUSIP, ISIN or other
similar numbers, if any, assigned to such Notes; and

(ix) in case any Note is to be
redeemed in part only, the portion of the principal amount thereof
to be redeemed and on and after the Redemption Date, upon surrender
of such Note, a new Note in principal amount equal to the
unredeemed portion thereof shall be issued.

A Redemption Notice shall be
irrevocable.

(e) If fewer than all of the
outstanding Notes are to be redeemed, the Trustee shall select the
Notes or portions thereof of a Global Note or the Notes in
certificated form to be redeemed (in principal amounts of $1,000 or
multiples thereof) by lot, on a pro rata basis or by another method
the Trustee considers to be fair and appropriate and in the case of
Global Notes, in accordance with the Applicable Procedures. If any
Note selected for partial redemption is submitted for conversion in
part after such selection, the portion of the Note submitted for
conversion shall be deemed (so far as may be possible) to be the
portion selected for redemption.

(f) If any Redemption Notice has
been given in respect of the Notes in accordance with Section
3.01(b), the Notes shall become due and payable on the Redemption
Date at the place or places stated in the Redemption Notice and at
the applicable Redemption Price. On presentation and surrender of
the Notes at the place or places stated in the Redemption Notice,
the Notes shall be paid and redeemed by the Company at the
applicable Redemption Price.

(g) Prior to the open of business on
the Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit with the Paying
Agent or, if the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company is acting
as the Paying Agent, shall segregate and hold in trust as provided
in Section 2.05 an amount of cash in U.S. Dollars (in immediately
available funds if deposited on the Redemption Date), sufficient to
pay the Redemption Price of all of the Notes to be redeemed on such
Redemption Date. Subject to receipt of funds by the Paying Agent,
payment for the Notes to be redeemed shall be made on the
Redemption Date for such Notes. The Paying Agent shall, promptly
after such payment and upon written demand by the Company, return
to the Company any funds in excess of the Redemption
Price.
 
25



(h) The Company may not redeem any
Notes on any date if the principal amount of the Notes has been
accelerated in accordance with the terms of this Indenture, and
such acceleration has not been rescinded, on or prior to the
Redemption Date (except in the case of an acceleration resulting
from a Default by the Company in the payment of the Redemption
Price with respect to such Notes).

Section 3.02. Repurchase At
Option of The Holder Upon A Fundamental Change .
(a) Subject to the satisfaction of the requirements of this
Article 3, if a Fundamental Change occurs at any time, each Holder
shall have the right, at its option, to require the Company to
repurchase all of its Notes, or any portion of the principal amount
thereof that is equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,
on a date (the “ Fundamental Change Repurchase Date
”) of the Company’s choosing that is not less than 15
nor more than 35 days after the date of the Fundamental Change
Repurchase Right Notice. The Fundamental Change repurchase price
the Company is required to pay (the “ Fundamental Change
Repurchase Price ”) is equal to 100% of the principal
amount of the Notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to, but not including, the Fundamental Change
Repurchase Date; provided that if the Fundamental Change
Repurchase Date falls after a Regular Record Date and on or prior
to the Interest Payment Date to which it relates, the Company shall
instead pay the full amount of accrued and unpaid interest to the
Holder of record at the close of business on such Regular Record
Date, and the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price shall be equal to
100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased. Any
Notes so repurchased by the Company shall be paid for in
cash.

(b) In addition to any notice
obligation the Company may have under Section 4.01(e) or Section
4.04(a), after the occurrence of a Fundamental Change, but on or
before the 15th day following such occurrence, the Company shall
notify all Holders of the Notes and the Trustee and Conversion
Agent (if other than the Trustee) and the Paying Agent, in writing,
of the occurrence of the Fundamental Change and of the resulting
repurchase right, if any (the “ Fundamental Change
Repurchase Right Notice ”). Such Fundamental Change
Repurchase Right Notice shall state:

(i) the events causing the
Fundamental Change;

(ii) the date of the Fundamental
Change;

(iii) the last date on which a
Holder may exercise the repurchase right, if applicable;

(iv) the Fundamental Change
Repurchase Price, if applicable;

(v) the Fundamental Change
Repurchase Date, if applicable;

(vi) the name and address of the
Paying Agent and the Conversion Agent, if applicable;

(vii) the applicable Conversion Rate
and any adjustments to the applicable Conversion Rate;
 
26



(viii) that the Notes with respect
to which a Repurchase Notice has been delivered by a Holder may be
converted only if the Holder withdraws the Repurchase Notice as
described in Section 3.02(d); and

(ix) the procedures that Holders
must follow to require the Company to repurchase their Notes, if
applicable.

Simultaneously with providing such
Fundamental Change Repurchase Right Notice, the Company shall
publish such information on the Company’s website or through
such other public medium as the Company may use at that
time.

(c) To exercise the right to cause
the Company to repurchase its Notes pursuant to this Article 3, a
Holder must deliver, on or before the Business Day prior to the
Fundamental Change Repurchase Date, the Notes to be repurchased. If
the Notes are Global Notes, such delivery (and the related
Repurchase Notice) must comply with all Applicable Procedures. If
the Notes are Certificated Notes, such Notes must be duly endorsed
for transfer, and must be delivered by the Holder together with a
written Repurchase Notice exercising such Holder’s right to
require the Company to repurchase its Notes or a portion thereof,
substantially in the form included in Exhibit A hereto, duly
completed, to the Paying Agent. The “ Repurchase
Notice ” must state:

(i) if the Notes are Certificated
Notes, the certificate numbers of the Notes to be delivered for
repurchase;

(ii) the portion of the principal
amount of the Notes to be repurchased, which must be a minimum of
$1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof;
and

(iii) that the Notes are to be
repurchased by the Company pursuant to the applicable provisions of
the Notes and this Indenture.

(d) A Holder may withdraw any
Repurchase Notice delivered pursuant to Section 3.02(c), in whole
or in part, by a written notice of withdrawal delivered to the
Paying Agent prior to the close of business on the Business Day
immediately preceding the relevant Fundamental Change Repurchase
Date. The notice of withdrawal shall state:

(i) the principal amount of the
Notes for which the Repurchase Notice has been
withdrawn;

(ii) if the Notes are Certificated
Notes, the certificate numbers of the withdrawn Notes;
and

(iii) the principal amount, if any,
which remains subject to the Repurchase Notice;

provided that if the Notes are Global Notes, such
withdrawal notice must comply with Applicable
Procedures.
 
27



(e) Holders who have surrendered
their Notes for repurchase upon a Fundamental Change in accordance
with Section 3.02(c) shall receive payment of the Fundamental
Change Repurchase Price promptly following the later of
(x) the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date or (y) the
time of book-entry transfer or the delivery of the Notes, as
applicable. Subject to Section 9.04 and the right of the Holder of
record as of the close of business on the relevant Regular Record
Date to receive the relevant interest payment on the related
Interest Payment Date where the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date
falls between such Regular Record Date and such related Interest
Payment Date, if the Paying Agent or the Trustee holds money
sufficient to pay the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price for the
Notes that have been surrendered for repurchase, pursuant to
Section 3.02(c), on the Business Day following the Fundamental
Change Repurchase Date, then:

(i) such Notes shall cease to be
outstanding and interest shall cease to accrue whether or not
book-entry transfer of such Notes is made or whether or not such
Notes are delivered to the Paying Agent; and

(ii) all other rights of the Holders
of such Notes shall terminate other than the right to receive the
Fundamental Change Repurchase Price including any accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, upon delivery or transfer of the
Notes.

Section 3.03. Compliance
With Securities Laws Upon Purchase of Notes . In connection
with any offer to purchase the Notes upon a Fundamental Change
under Section 3.02, the Company shall (a) comply with the
provisions of Rule 13e-4 and Rule 14e-l and any other tender offer
rules under the Exchange Act that may then be applicable and
(b) otherwise comply with all applicable federal and state
securities laws.

Section 3.04. No Repurchase
Upon Acceleration . No Notes may be repurchased on any date at
the option of Holders upon a Fundamental Change if the principal
amount of the Notes has been accelerated, and such acceleration has
not been rescinded, on or prior to such date. The Paying Agent will
promptly return to the respective Holders thereof any Certificated
Notes held by it following the acceleration of the Notes, and any
instructions for book-entry transfer of the Notes in compliance
with the Applicable Procedures shall be deemed to have been
cancelled, and, upon such return or cancellation, as the case may
be, the Repurchase Notice with respect thereto shall be deemed to
have been withdrawn.

Section 3.05. Repayment to
the Company . To the extent that the aggregate amount of cash
deposited by the Company pursuant to Section 3.02 exceeds the
aggregate Fundamental Change Repurchase Price of the Notes or
portions thereof that the Company is obligated to purchase, then
promptly after the payment of the Fundamental Change Repurchase
Price, the Trustee or a Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall
return any such excess cash to the Company.

Section 3.06. Partial
Repurchase . Upon surrender of a Note that is to be repurchased
in part pursuant to Section 3.02, the Company shall execute and the
Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder a new Note in
an authorized denomination equal in principal amount to the
unrepurchased portion of the Note surrendered.

ARTICLE 4

C ONVERSION

Section 4.01. Conversion
Rights . (a) Subject to and upon compliance with the
provisions of this Article 4, each Holder of a Note shall have the
right, at such Holder’s option, to convert all or any portion
(if the portion to be converted is $1,000 principal amount or an
integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of such Note
(i) subject to satisfaction of one or more of the conditions
described in subsections (b) through (f) of this Section 4.01,
at any time prior to the close of business on the Business Day
immediately preceding September 15, 2020 under the
circumstances and during the periods set forth in subsections (b)
through (f) of this Section 4.01, and (ii) irrespective
of the conditions set forth in subsections (b) through (f) of
this Section 4.01, on or after September 15, 2020 and prior to
the close of business on the second Scheduled Trading Day
immediately preceding the Maturity Date, in each case, at an
initial conversion rate of 16.7158 shares of Common Stock (subject
to adjustment as provided in Section 4.04 and Section 4.05, the
“ Conversion Rate ”) per $1,000 principal amount
of Notes (subject to the settlement provisions of Section 4.02, the
“ Conversion Obligation ”).

(b) Prior to the close of business
on the Business Day immediately preceding September 15, 2020,
a Holder may surrender all or a portion of its Notes for conversion
during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter
ending on June 30, 2016 (and only during such calendar
quarter), if the Last Reported Sale Price of Common Stock for at
least 20 Trading Days (whether or not consecutive) during the
period of 30 consecutive Trading Days ending on the last Trading
Day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than
or equal to 130% of the Conversion Price on each applicable Trading
Day. The Company shall determine at the beginning of each calendar
quarter commencing after June 30, 2016 if the Notes have
become convertible pursuant to this Section 4.01(b), in which case
the Company shall so notify in writing the Conversion Agent, the
Holders and the Trustee within five Business Days of the Notes
becoming convertible pursuant to this Section 4.01(b).

(c) Prior to the close of business
on the Business Day immediately preceding September 15, 2020,
a Holder of the Notes may surrender its Notes for conversion during
the five Business Day period after any five consecutive Trading Day
period (the “ Measurement Period ”) in which the
Trading Price per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes, as
determined following a request by a Holder of the Notes in
accordance with the procedures described below and in the
definition of “Trading Price” in Section 1.01, for each
Trading Day of the Measurement Period was less than 98% of the
product of the Last Reported Sale Price of Common Stock and the
Conversion Rate on such Trading Day (the “ Trading Price
Condition ”). The Bid Solicitation Agent shall have no
obligation to determine the Trading Price per $1,000 principal
amount of the Notes unless the Company has requested such
determination; and the Company shall have no obligation to make
such request unless a Holder provides the Company with reasonable
evidence that the Trading Price per $1,000 principal amount of the
Notes would be less than 98% of the product of the Last Reported
Sale Price of Common Stock and the Conversion Rate. At such time,
the Company shall instruct the Bid Solicitation Agent to determine
the Trading Price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes beginning on
the next Trading Day and on each successive Trading Day until
the
 
29


Trading Price per $1,000 principal amount of
Notes is greater than or equal to 98% of the product of the Last
Reported Sale Price of Common Stock and the Conversion Rate. At
such time as the Company directs the Bid Solicitation Agent in
writing to solicit bid quotations, the Company will provide the Bid
Solicitation Agent with the names and contact details of three
independent nationally recognized securities dealers selected by
the Company, and the Company will direct those security dealers to
provide bids to the Bid Solicitation Agent. The Company will
determine the Trading Price in accordance with the bids it receives
from the Bid Solicitation Agent. If the Trading Price Condition has
been met, the Company shall so notify the Holders, the Trustee and
the Conversion Agent (if other than the Trustee) in writing within
one Business Day. If, at any time after the Trading Price Condition
has been met, the Trading Price per $1,000 principal amount of
Notes is greater than or equal to 98% of the product of the Last
Reported Sale Price of Common Stock and the Conversion Rate for
such date, the Company shall notify the Holders, the Trustee and
the Conversion Agent (if other than the Trustee) in writing within
one Business Day.

(d) If, prior to the close of
business on the Business Day immediately preceding
September 15, 2020, the Company elects to:

(i) issue to all or substantially
all holders of Common Stock any rights, options or warrants
entitling them, for a period of not more than 45 calendar days
after the announcement date of such issuance, to subscribe for or
purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share that is less
than the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common
Stock for the 10 consecutive Trading Day period ending on, and
including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the date of
announcement of such issuance; or

(ii) distribute to all or
substantially all holders of Common Stock the Company’s
assets, debt securities or rights to purchase the Company’s
securities, which distribution has a per share value, as reasonably
determined by the Board of Directors, exceeding 10% of the Last
Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day
preceding the date of announcement of such distribution,

then, in either case, the Company
shall notify the Holders of the Notes, the Trustee and the
Conversion Agent (if other than the Trustee) in writing at least 55
Scheduled Trading Days prior to the Ex-Dividend Date for such
issuance or distribution. Once the Company has given such notice,
Holders may surrender their Notes for conversion at any time until
the earlier of the close of business on the Business Day
immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Date for such issuance or
distribution and the Company’s announcement that such
issuance or distribution will not take place, even if the Notes are
not otherwise convertible at such time.

(e) If a transaction or event that
constitutes a Fundamental Change or a Make-Whole Fundamental Change
occurs prior to the close of business on the Business Day
immediately preceding September 15, 2020, regardless of
whether a Holder of the Notes has the right to require the Company
to repurchase the Notes pursuant to Section 3.02, or if the Company
is a party to a consolidation, merger, binding share exchange, or
transfer or lease of all or substantially all of the
Company’s assets, pursuant to which the Common Stock would be
converted into cash, securities or other assets, the Notes may be
surrendered for conversion
 
30


at any time until 35 Trading Days after the
actual effective date of such transaction or, if such transaction
also constitutes a Fundamental Change, until the related
Fundamental Change Repurchase Date. The Company shall notify the
Holders, the Trustee and the Conversion Agent (if other than the
Trustee) in writing as promptly as practicable following the date
the Company publicly announces such anticipated transaction;
provided , that the Company will deliver such notice, to the
extent practicable, at least 75 Scheduled Trading Days prior to the
anticipated effective date of such transaction, or, if the Company
does not have knowledge of such transaction at least 75 Scheduled
Trading Days prior to the anticipated effective date of such
transaction, then within one Business Day of the date upon which
the Company receives notice, or otherwise becomes aware, of such
transaction, but in no event later than the actual effective date
of such transaction.

(f) If the Company calls any or all
of the Notes for redemption pursuant to Section 3.01 prior to the
close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding
September 15, 2020, then a Holder may surrender all or any
portion of its Notes for conversion at any time prior to the close
of business on the second Scheduled Trading Day prior to the
Redemption Date, even if the Notes are not otherwise convertible at
such time. After that time, the right to convert shall expire,
unless the Company defaults in the payment of the Redemption Price,
in which case a Holder of Notes may convert its Notes until the
Redemption Price has been paid or duly provided for.

Section 4.02. Settlement
Upon Conversion; Conversion Procedures . (a) Upon
conversion of a Note, the Company shall, subject to this Section
4.02, Section 4.04(b) and Section 4.07, pay or deliver, as the case
may be, to the converting Holder, in respect of each $1,000
principal amount of such Note being converted, cash (“
Cash Settlement ”), shares of Common Stock, together
with cash, if applicable, in lieu of any fractional share of Common
Stock in accordance with subsection (i) of this Section 4.02
(“ Physical Settlement ”) or a combination of
cash and shares of Common Stock (“ Combination
Settlement ”), at its election, as set forth in this
Section 4.02.

(i) All conversions occurring on or
after September 15, 2020 to the close of business on the
second Scheduled Trading Day immediately preceding the Maturity
Date, and all conversions for which the relevant Conversion Date
occurs after the Company’s issuance of a Redemption Notice
with respect to Notes and prior to the Redemption Date, shall be
settled using the same Settlement Method. Except for any
conversions described in the preceding sentence, the Company shall
use the same Settlement Method for all conversions occurring on the
same Conversion Date, but the Company shall not have any obligation
to use the same Settlement Method with respect to conversions that
occur on different Conversion Dates. If the Company elects a
Settlement Method, the Company shall notify the converting Holders,
through the Trustee and the Conversion Agent (if other than the
Trustee) in writing, of the Settlement Method it has selected no
later than the close of business on the Trading Day immediately
following the related Conversion Date (or in the case of any
conversions (A) for which the relevant Conversion Date occurs
after the date of a Redemption Notice and prior to the related
Redemption Date, in such Redemption Notice, or (B) occurring
on or after September 15, 2020 to the close of business on the
second Scheduled Trading Day immediately preceding the Maturity
Date, no later
 
31



than the close of business on the
Business Day immediately preceding September 15, 2020) (in
either case, the “ Settlement Method Election Date
”). If the Company does not elect a Settlement Method prior
to the deadline set forth in the immediately preceding sentence the
Company shall no longer have the right to elect Cash Settlement or
Physical Settlement, and shall be deemed to have elected
Combination Settlement in respect of the Conversion Obligation
pursuant to Section 4.02(a), and the Specified Dollar Amount per
$1,000 principal amount of Notes shall be equal to $1,000. If the
Company elects Combination Settlement but does not notify
converting Holders, the Trustee and the Conversion Agent (if other
than the Trustee) in writing prior to the deadline set forth in
this Section 4.02(a)(i) of the Specified Dollar Amount per $1,000,
such Specified Dollar Amount shall be deemed to be
$1,000.

(ii) Settlement amounts upon a
conversion of Notes shall be computed as follows:

(A) if the Company elects to satisfy
its Conversion Obligation in respect of such conversion by Physical
Settlement, the Company shall deliver to the converting Holder in
respect of each $1,000 principal amount of Notes being converted a
number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate,
subject to Section 4.02(i);

(B) if the Company elects (or is
deemed to have elected) to satisfy its Conversion Obligation in
respect of such conversion by Cash Settlement, the Company shall
pay to the converting Holder in respect of each $1,000 principal
amount of Notes being converted cash in an amount equal to the sum
of the Daily Conversion Values for each of the 60 consecutive
Trading Days during the related Observation Period; and

(C) if the Company elects (or is
deemed to have elected) to satisfy its Conversion Obligation in
respect of such conversion by Combination Settlement, the Company
shall pay or deliver, as the case may be, to the converting Holder
in respect of each $1,000 principal amount of Notes being
converted, a settlement amount equal to the sum of the Daily
Settlement Amounts for each of the 60 consecutive Trading Days
during the related Observation Period, subject to
Section 4.02(i).

(iii) The Daily Settlement Amounts
(if applicable) and the Daily Conversion Values (if applicable)
shall be determined by the Company promptly following the last day
of the Observation Period. Promptly after such determination of the
Daily Settlement Amounts or the Daily Conversion Values, as the
case may be, and the amount of cash payable in lieu of any
fractional share, the Company shall notify the Trustee and the
Conversion Agent (if other than the Trustee) in writing of the
Daily Settlement Amounts or the Daily Conversion Values, as the
case may be, and the amount of cash payable in lieu of fractional
shares of Common Stock.

(b) Subject to Section 4.02(e),
before any Holder of a Note shall be entitled to convert a Note as
set forth above, such Holder shall (i) in the case of a
Certificated Note (A)
 
32


complete and manually sign an irrevocable notice
to the Conversion Agent as set forth in the Form of Conversion
Notice attached to the Form of Note set forth in Exhibit A
hereto (a “ Conversion Notice ”) and state in
writing therein the principal amount of Notes to be converted and
the name or names (with addresses) in which such Holder wishes the
certificate or certificates for any shares of Common Stock to be
delivered upon settlement of the Conversion Obligation to be
registered and deliver such Conversion Notice to the Conversion
Agent, (B) deliver such Conversion Notice and Note, duly
endorsed to the Company or in blank (and accompanied by appropriate
endorsement and transfer documents), to the Conversion Agent and
(C) if required, pay funds equal to interest payable on the
next Interest Payment Date to which such Holder is not entitled as
set forth in subsection (g) of this Section 4.02 and (ii) in
the case of a Global Note, comply with the Applicable Procedures
for converting a beneficial interest in a Global Note and, if
required, pay funds equal to interest payable on the next Interest
Payment Date to which such Holder is not entitled as set forth in
subsection (g) of this Section 4.02. The Conversion Agent shall
notify the Company of any conversion pursuant to this Article 4 on
the Conversion Date for such conversion. No Conversion Notice with
respect to any Notes may be surrendered by a Holder thereof if such
Holder has also delivered a Repurchase Notice to the Company in
respect of such Notes and not validly withdrawn such Repurchase
Notice in accordance with Section 3.02(c).

If more than one Note shall be
surrendered for conversion at one time by the same Holder, the
Conversion Obligation with respect to such Notes shall be computed
on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes (or
specified portions thereof to the extent permitted hereby) so
surrendered.

(c) A Note shall be deemed to have
been converted immediately prior to the close of business on the
date (the “ Conversion Date ”) that the Holder
has complied with the requirements set forth in subsection (b)
above. If the Company elects Physical Settlement with respect to
any conversion of Notes, the Company shall deliver the
consideration due in respect of conversion on the third Business
Day immediately following the relevant Conversion Date. If the
Company elects (or is deemed to have elected) Cash Settlement or
Combination Settlement with respect to any conversion of Notes,
except as set forth in Section 4.04(b) and Section 4.07(a), the
Company shall deliver the consideration due in respect of
conversion on the third Business Day immediately following the last
Trading Day of the relevant Observation Period. If any shares of
Common Stock are due to converting Holders, the Company shall issue
or cause to be issued, and deliver to such Holder, or such
Holder’s nominee or nominees, certificates or a book-entry
transfer through the Depositary for the full number of shares of
Common Stock to which such Holder shall be entitled in satisfaction
of the Company’s Conversion Obligation.

(d) In case any Note shall be
surrendered for partial conversion, the Company shall execute and
the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to or upon the written
order of the Holder of the Note so surrendered a new Note or Notes
in authorized denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal
to the unconverted portion of the surrendered Note, without payment
of any service charge by the converting Holder but, if required by
the Company or Trustee, with payment of a sum sufficient to cover
any transfer tax or similar governmental charge required by law or
that may be imposed in connection therewith as a result of the
name
 
33


of the Holder of the new Notes issued upon such
conversion being different from the name of the Holder of the old
Notes surrendered for such conversion.

(e) If a Holder submits a Note for
conversion, the Company shall pay any documentary, stamp or similar
issue or transfer tax due on the issuance of any shares of Common
Stock upon conversion of such Note, unless the tax is due because
the Holder requests such shares to be issued in a name other than
the Holder’s name, in which case the Holder shall pay that
tax. The Company or its stock transfer agent may refuse to deliver
the certificates representing the shares of Common Stock being
issued in a name other than the Holder’s name until the
Company or its representative receives a sum sufficient to pay any
tax that is due by such Holder in accordance with the immediately
preceding sentence.

(f) Upon the conversion of an
interest in a Global Note, the Trustee, or the Notes Custodian at
the direction of the Trustee, shall make a notation on such Global
Note as to the reduction in the principal amount represented
thereby. On the Conversion Date, the Company shall notify the
Trustee in writing of any conversion of Notes effected through any
Conversion Agent other than the Trustee.

(g) Except as described below, the
Company shall not make any separate cash payment for accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, upon conversion of Notes. Upon conversion
of a Note, the Company’s settlement of the Conversion
Obligation in respect of such conversion shall be deemed to satisfy
in full its obligation to pay the principal amount of such Note and
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, attributable to the period
from, and including, March 16, 2016 or the most recent date to
which interest has been paid or provided for to, but not including,
the Conversion Date. As a result, accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, to, but not including, the Conversion Date shall be deemed to
be paid in full rather than cancelled, extinguished or forfeited.
Upon conversion of a Note into a combination of cash and shares of
Common Stock, accrued and unpaid interest shall be deemed to be
paid first out of the cash paid upon such conversion.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Note is submitted for
conversion after the close of business on a Regular Record Date,
the Holder of such Note as of the close of business on such Regular
Record Date shall receive the full amount of interest payable on
such Note on the corresponding Interest Payment Date
notwithstanding the conversion. A Note surrendered for conversion
during the period from the close of business on any Regular Record
Date to the open of business on the immediately following Interest
Payment Date must be accompanied by funds equal to the amount of
interest payable on the principal amount of the Note so converted;
provided that no such payment need be made:

(i) for conversions following the
Regular Record Date immediately preceding the Maturity
Date;

(ii) if the Company has specified a
Redemption Date that is after a Regular Record Date and on or prior
to the corresponding Interest Payment Date;

(iii) if the Company has specified a
Fundamental Change Repurchase Date that is after a Regular Record
Date and on or prior to the corresponding Interest Payment Date;
or
 
34



(iv) to the extent of any overdue
interest, if any overdue interest exists at the time of conversion
with respect to such Note.

(h) Each conversion shall be deemed
to have been effected as to any Note surrendered for conversion on
the Conversion Date; provided that the Person in whose name
the certificate for any shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion is registered shall be treated as the holder of record
of such shares as of the close of business on the relevant
Conversion Date (if the Company elects to satisfy the related
Conversion Obligation by Physical Settlement) or the last Trading
Day of the relevant Observation Period (if the Company elects, or
is deemed to have elected, to satisfy the related Conversion
Obligation by Combination Settlement), as the case may be. Upon the
conversion of a Note, the Person who surrendered such Note for
conversion shall no longer be a Holder of such Note surrendered for
conversion; provided that (x) if such Note was
converted after the close of business on a Regular Record Date, the
Holder of such Note as of the close of business on such Regular
Record Date shall have the right to receive the interest payable on
such Note on the related Interest Payment Date in accordance with
Section 4.02(g) and (y) the converting Holder shall have the
right to receive the consideration due upon conversion of such Note
in accordance with this Section 4.02.

(i) The Company shall not issue any
fractional share of Common Stock upon conversion of the Notes and
shall instead pay cash in lieu of any fractional share of Common
Stock that would otherwise be issuable upon conversion based on the
Daily VWAP on the relevant Conversion Date (in the case of Physical
Settlement) or based on the Daily VWAP on the last Trading Day of
the relevant Observation Period (in the case of Combination
Settlement). For each Note surrendered for conversion, if the
Company has elected (or is deemed to have elected) Combination
Settlement, the full number of shares that shall be issued upon
conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate
Daily Settlement Amounts for the applicable Observation Period and
any fractional shares remaining after such computation shall be
paid in cash.

Section 4.03. Company to
Provide Stock . The Company shall, prior to issuance of any
Notes hereunder, reserve a sufficient number of shares of Common
Stock to permit the conversion of all outstanding Notes into shares
of Common Stock (x) assuming that at the time of computation
of such number of shares, all such Notes would be converted by a
single Holder and that Physical Settlement is applicable and
(y) giving effect to the increase in the Conversion Rate that
would result from the occurrence of a Make-Whole Fundamental Change
with a Make-Whole Reference Date of the date of determination and a
Stock Price equal to the Minimum Stock Price.

All shares of Common Stock delivered
upon conversion of the Notes shall be newly issued shares, shall be
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and
shall be free from preemptive rights and free of any lien or
adverse claim.

The Company shall promptly comply
with all federal and state securities laws regulating the offer and
delivery of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of Notes, if
any, and will list or cause to have quoted such shares of Common
Stock on each national securities exchange, over-the-counter market
or such other market on which the Common
 
35


Stock is then listed or quoted; provided,
however , that if rules of such automated quotation system or
exchange permit the Company to defer the listing of such Common
Stock until the first conversion of the Notes into Common Stock in
accordance with the provisions of this Indenture, the Company
covenants to list such Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the
Notes in accordance with the requirements of such automated
quotation system or exchange at such time.

Section 4.04. Adjustment to
Conversion Rate Upon a Make-Whole Fundamental Change .
(a) If a Holder elects to convert its Notes in connection with
a Make-Whole Fundamental Change, the Conversion Rate shall, under
certain circumstances, be increased by a number of additional
shares (the “ Additional Shares ”), as described
below. A conversion shall be deemed to be in connection with a
Make-Whole Fundamental Change if such conversion occurs on or after
the Make-Whole Reference Date for such Make-Whole Fundamental
Change and prior to the close of business on the Business Day
immediately prior to the related Fundamental Change Repurchase Date
(or in the case of a Make-Whole Fundamental Change that does not
constitute a Fundamental Change, the 35th Trading Day immediately
following the applicable Make-Whole Reference Date). The Company
shall notify Holders, the Trustee and the Conversion Agent (if
other than the Trustee) in writing of the Make-Whole Reference Date
for any Make-Whole Fundamental Change, and issue a press release,
on such Make-Whole Reference Date.

(b) Upon surrender of Notes for
conversion in connection with a Make-Whole Fundamental Change, the
Company shall pay or deliver, as the case may be, the consideration
due in respect of such converted Notes, based on the Conversion
Rate as increased to reflect the Additional Shares, if any,
pursuant to the table set forth in clause (e) below in
accordance with Section 4.02. However, if the consideration for the
Common Stock in any Make-Whole Fundamental Change described in
clause (b) of the definition of Fundamental Change is composed
entirely of cash, for any conversion of the Notes following the
relevant Make-Whole Reference Date, the Conversion Obligation shall
be calculated based solely on the Stock Price for the transaction
and the consideration due upon conversion shall be deemed to be an
amount in cash per $1,000 principal amount of converted Notes equal
to the Conversion Rate (including any adjustment described in this
Section 4.04), multiplied by such Stock Price. In such event, the
Conversion Obligation shall be determined and paid to Holders in
cash on the third Business Day following the Conversion
Date.

(c) The number of Additional Shares,
if any, by which the Conversion Rate shall be increased for
conversions in connection with a Make-Whole Fundamental Change
shall be determined by reference to the table set forth in clause
(e) below, based on the date on which such Make-Whole
Fundamental Change occurs or becomes effective (the “
Make-Whole Reference Date ”) and the price (the
“ Stock Price ”) paid or deemed paid per share
of Common Stock in such Make-Whole Fundamental Change. If holders
of Common Stock receive only cash consideration for their shares of
Common Stock in connection with a Fundamental Change described in
clause (b) of the definition of Fundamental Change, the Stock
Price shall be the cash amount paid per share of Common Stock.
Otherwise, the Stock Price shall be the average of the Last
Reported Sale Prices of Common Stock over the 10 Trading Day Period
ending on the Trading Day preceding the Make-Whole Reference
Date.
 
36



(d) The Stock Prices set forth in
the first column of the table in clause (e) below (i.e., the
row headers) shall be adjusted as of any date on which the
Conversion Rate is adjusted pursuant to Section 4.05. The adjusted
Stock Prices shall equal the Stock Prices applicable immediately
prior to such adjustment, multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the applicable Conversion Rate in effect
immediately prior to the adjustment giving rise to the Stock Price
adjustment and the denominator of which is the applicable
Conversion Rate as so adjusted. The number of Additional Shares
will be adjusted in the same manner, at the same time and for the
same events as the Conversion Rate as set forth in Section
4.05.

(e) The following table sets forth
the increase, if any, to the Conversion Rate, expressed as number
of Additional Shares per $1,000 in principal amount of Notes, for
conversions in connection with a Make-Whole Fundamental
Change:

The exact Stock Prices and
Make-Whole Reference Dates may not be set forth in the table above,
in which case:

(i) if the Stock Price is between
two Stock Price amounts in the table or the Make-Whole Reference
Date is between two dates in the table, the number of Additional
Shares shall be determined by a straight-line interpolation between
the number of Additional Shares set forth for the higher and lower
Stock Price amounts and the two dates, as applicable, based on a
365-day year;

(ii) if the Stock Price is greater
than $150.00 per share, subject to adjustment in the same manner as
the Stock Prices set forth in the row headers of the table above,
no increase shall be made to the Conversion Rate; and

(iii) if the Stock Price is less
than $45.15 per share, subject to adjustment in the same manner as
the Stock Prices set forth in the row headers of the table above
(the “ Minimum Stock Price ”), no increase shall
be made to the Conversion Rate.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no
event shall the Conversion Rate exceed 22.1483 shares of Common
Stock per $1,000 in principal amount of Notes, subject to
adjustments in the same manner as the Conversion Rate as set forth
in Section 4.05.

Section 4.05. Conversion
Rate Adjustments . The Conversion Rate shall be adjusted, from
time to time by the Company, upon the occurrence of any of the
following events, except that the Company shall not make any
adjustments to the Conversion Rate if Holders of the Notes have the
right to participate (other than in the case of a share split or
share combination), at the same time and upon the same terms as
holders of Common Stock and solely as a result of holding the
Notes, in any of the transactions described in this Section 4.05,
without having to convert their Notes as if they held a number of
shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate, multiplied
by the principal amount (expressed in thousands) of Notes held
by such Holder.

(a) If the Company exclusively
issues shares of Common Stock as a dividend or distribution on
shares of its Common Stock, or if the Company effects a share split
or share combination, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based
on the following formula:
 
















 


CR
1 = CR 0


  


×


  




OS 1



  





 


  


  



OS 0


  






where,
 











CR

=


  


the Conversion
Rate in effect immediately prior to the open of business on the
Ex-Dividend Date of such dividend or distribution, or immediately
prior to the open of business on the effective date of such share
split or share combination, as applicable;









CR

=


  


the Conversion
Rate in effect immediately after the open of business on such
Ex-Dividend Date or effective date;









OS

=


  


the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the open of
business on such Ex-Dividend Date or effective date; and









OS
1


  


=


  


the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect
to such dividend, distribution, share split or share
combination.





Any adjustment made under this
Section 4.05(a) shall become effective immediately after the open
of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or
distribution, or immediately after the open of business on the
effective date for such share split or share combination, as
applicable. If any dividend or distribution of the type described
in this Section 4.05(a) is declared but not so paid or made, the
Conversion Rate shall be immediately readjusted, effective as of
the date the Board of Directors determines not to pay such dividend
or distribution, to the Conversion Rate that would then be in
effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. The
Company shall not pay any dividend or make any distribution on its
Common Stock held in treasury, if any.
 
38



(b) If the Company issues to all or
substantially all holders of its Common Stock any rights, options
or warrants entitling them, for a period of not more than 45
calendar days after the announcement date of such issuance, to
subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per
share that is less than the average of the Last Reported Sale
Prices of the Common Stock for the 10 consecutive Trading Day
period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately
preceding the date of announcement of such issuance, the Conversion
Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
 
















 


CR
1 = CR 0


  


×


  




OS 0 +

OS 0 +

where,

Rate in effect immediately prior to the open of business on the
Ex-Dividend Date for such issuance;









CR

the Conversion
Rate in effect immediately after the open of business on such
Ex-Dividend Date;









OS

=


  


the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the open of
business on such Ex-Dividend Date;

=


  


the total
number of shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to such rights,
options or warrants; and









Y


  


=


  


the number of
shares of Common Stock equal to the aggregate price payable to
exercise such rights, options or warrants, divided by the average
of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock over the 10
consecutive Trading Day period ending on, and including, the
Trading Day immediately preceding the date of announcement of the
issuance of such rights, options or warrants.





Any increase made under this Section
4.05(b) shall be made successively whenever any such rights,
options or warrants are issued and shall become effective
immediately after the open of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for
such issuance. To the extent that shares of the Common Stock are
not delivered after the expiration of such rights, options or
warrants, the Conversion Rate shall be decreased to the Conversion
Rate that woul

full board of directors or by resolution of a majority of the shareholders at any annual or special meeting thereof. Each director shall own common or preferred stock of the association or of a holding company owning the association, with an
aggregate par, fair market or equity value $1,000. Determination of these values may be based as of either (i) the date of purchase or (ii) the date the person became a director, whichever value is greater. Any combination of common or
preferred stock of the association or holding company may be used.  Any vacancy in the board of directors may be filled by
action of a majority of the remaining directors between meetings of shareholders. The board of directors may not increase the number of directors between meetings of shareholders to a number which: 
(1) exceeds by more than two the number of directors last elected by shareholders where the number was 15 or less; or 
(2) exceeds by more than four the number of directors last elected by shareholders where the number was 16 or more, but in no event shall
the number of directors exceed 25, unless the OCC has exempted the bank from the 25-member limit.  Directors shall be elected
for terms of one year and until their successors are elected and qualified. Terms of directors, including directors selected to fill vacancies, shall expire at the next regular meeting of shareholders at which directors are elected, unless the
directors resign or are removed from office. Despite the expiration of a directors term, the director shall continue to serve until his or her successor is elected and qualifies or until there is a decrease in the number of directors and his
or her position is eliminated. 


Honorary or advisory members of the board of directors, without voting power or power of
final decision in matters concerning the business of the association, may be appointed by resolution of a majority of the full board of directors, or by resolution of shareholders at any annual or special meeting. Honorary or advisory directors
shall not be counted to determine the number of directors of the association or the presence of a quorum in connection with any board action, and shall not be required to own qualifying shares. 
FOURTH. There shall be an annual meeting of the shareholders to elect directors and transact whatever other business may be brought
before the meeting. It shall be held at the main office or any other convenient place the board of directors may designate, on the day of each year specified therefor in the bylaws, or, if that day falls on a legal holiday in the state in which the
association is located, on the next following banking day. If no election is held on the day fixed, or in the event of a legal holiday on the following banking day, an election may be held on any subsequent day within 60 days of the day fixed, to be
designated by the board of directors, or, if the directors fail to fix the day, by shareholders representing two-thirds of the shares issued and outstanding. In all cases at least 10 days advance notice of the time, place and purpose of a
shareholders meeting shall be given to the shareholders by first class mail, unless the OCC determines that an emergency circumstance exists. The sole shareholder of the bank is permitted to waive notice of the shareholders meeting.
 In all elections of directors, the number of votes each common shareholder may cast will be determined by multiplying the
number of shares such shareholder owns by the number of directors to be elected. Those votes may be cumulated and cast for a single candidate or may be distributed among two or more candidates in the manner selected by the shareholder. If, after the
first ballot, subsequent ballots are necessary to elect directors, a shareholder may not vote shares that he or she has already fully cumulated and voted in favor of a successful candidate. On all other questions, each common shareholder shall be
entitled to one vote for each share of stock held by him or her.  Nominations for election to the board of directors may be
made by the board of directors or by any stockholder of any outstanding class of capital stock of the association entitled to vote for election of directors. Nominations other than those made by or on behalf of the existing management shall be made
in writing and be delivered or mailed to the president of the association not less than 14 days nor more than 50 days prior to any meeting of shareholders called for the election of directors; provided, however, that if less than 21 days notice of
the meeting is given to shareholders, such nominations shall be mailed or delivered to the president of the association not later than the close of business on the seventh day following the day on which the notice of meeting was mailed. Such
notification shall contain the following information to the extent known to the notifying shareholder:   


 
(1)
The name and address of each proposed nominee.   


 
(2)
The principal occupation of each proposed nominee.   


 
(3)
The total number of shares of capital stock of the association that will be voted for each proposed nominee. 
 


 
(4)
The name and residence address of the notifying shareholder.   


 
(5)
The number of shares of capital stock of the association owned by the notifying shareholder. 


Nominations not made in accordance herewith may, in his/her discretion, be disregarded by
the chairperson of the meeting, and the vote tellers may disregard all votes cast for each such nominee. No bylaw may unreasonably restrict the nomination of directors by shareholders. 
A director may resign at any time by delivering written notice to the board of directors, its chairperson, or to the association, which
resignation shall be effective when the notice is delivered unless the notice specifies a later effective date.  A director
may be removed by shareholders at a meeting called to remove the director, when notice of the meeting stating that the purpose or one of the purposes is to remove the director is provided, if there is a failure to fulfill one of the affirmative
requirements for qualification, or for cause; provided, however, that a director may not be removed if the number of votes sufficient to elect the director under cumulative voting is voted against the directors removal. 
FIFTH. The authorized amount of capital stock of this association shall be three million (3,000,000) shares of common stock of the
par value of one dollar ($1.00) each; but said capital stock may be increased or decreased from time to time, according to the provisions of the laws of the United States.  No holder of shares of the capital stock of any class of the association shall have any preemptive or preferential right of subscription to any shares of any class of stock of the association, whether now
or hereafter authorized, or to any obligations convertible into stock of the association, issued, or sold, nor any right of subscription to any thereof other than such, if any, as the board of directors, in its discretion, may from time to time
determine and at such price as the board of directors may from time to time fix. Preemptive rights also must be approved by a vote of holders of two-thirds of the banks outstanding voting shares. 
Unless otherwise specified in these articles of association or required by law, (1) all matters requiring shareholder action,
including amendments to the articles of association, must be approved by shareholders owning a majority voting interest in the outstanding voting stock, and (2) each shareholder shall be entitled to one vote per share. 
Unless otherwise specified in these articles of association or required by law, all shares of voting stock shall be voted together as a
class, on any matters requiring shareholder approval. If a proposed amendment would affect two or more classes or series in the same or a substantially similar way, all the classes or series so affected must vote together as a single voting group on
the proposed amendment.  Shares of one class or series may be issued as a dividend for shares of the same class or series on a
pro rata basis and without consideration. Shares of one class or series may be issued as share dividends for a different class or series of stock if approved by a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the class or series to be issued, unless
there are no outstanding shares of the class or series to be issued. Unless otherwise provided by the board of directors, the record date for determining shareholders entitled to a share dividend shall be the date authorized by the board of
directors for the share dividend. 


Unless otherwise provided in the bylaws, the record date for determining shareholders
entitled to notice of and to vote at any meeting is the close of business on the day before the first notice is mailed or otherwise sent to the shareholders, provided that in no event may a record date be more than 70 days before the meeting.
 If a shareholder is entitled to fractional shares pursuant to a stock dividend, consolidation or merger, reverse stock split
or otherwise, the association may: (a) issue fractional shares; (b) in lieu of the issuance of fractional shares, issue script or warrants entitling the holder to receive a full share upon surrendering enough script or warrants to equal a
full share; (c) if there is an established and active market in the associations stock, make reasonable arrangements to provide the shareholder with an opportunity to realize a fair price through sale of the fraction, or purchase of the
additional fraction required for a full share; (d) remit the cash equivalent of the fraction to the shareholder; or (e) sell full shares representing all the fractions at public auction or to the highest bidder after having solicited and
received sealed bids from at least three licensed stock brokers; and distribute the proceeds pro rata to shareholders who otherwise would be entitled to the fractional shares. The holder of a fractional share is entitled to exercise the rights for
shareholder, including the right to vote, to receive dividends, and to participate in the assets of the association upon liquidation, in proportion to the fractional interest. The holder of script or warrants is not entitled to any of these rights
unless the script or warrants explicitly provide for such rights. The script or warrants may be subject to such additional conditions as: (1) that the script or warrants will become void if not exchanged for full shares before a specified date;
and (2) that the shares for which the script or warrants are exchangeable may be sold at the option of the association and the proceeds paid to scriptholders.  The association, at any time and from time to time, may authorize and issue debt obligations, whether or not subordinated, without the approval of the shareholders. Obligations classified as debt, whether
or not subordinated, which may be issued by the association without the approval of shareholders, do not carry voting rights on any issue, including an increase or decrease in the aggregate number of the securities, or the exchange or
reclassification of all or part of securities into securities of another class or series.  SIXTH. The board of directors shall
appoint one of its members president of this association, and one of its members chairperson of the board and shall have the power to appoint one or more vice presidents, a secretary who shall keep minutes of the directors and
shareholders meetings and be responsible for authenticating the records of the association, and such other officers and employees as may be required to transact the business of this association. A duly appointed officer may appoint one or more
officers or assistant officers if authorized by the board of directors in accordance with the bylaws.  The board of directors
shall have the power to:   


 
(1)
Define the duties of the officers, employees, and agents of the association. 
 


 
(2)
Delegate the performance of its duties, but not the responsibility for its duties, to the officers, employees, and agents of the association. 




 
(3)
Fix the compensation and enter into employment contracts with its officers and employees upon reasonable terms and conditions consistent with applicable law.
  


 
(4)
Dismiss officers and employees.   


 
(5)
Require bonds from officers and employees and to fix the penalty thereof.   


 
(6)
Ratify written policies authorized by the associations management or committees of the board. 
 


 
(7)
Regulate the manner in which any increase or decrease of the capital of the association shall be made, provided that nothing herein shall restrict the power of
shareholders to increase or decrease the capital of the association in accordance with law, and nothing shall raise or lower from two-thirds the percentage required for shareholder approval to increase or reduce the capital.
  


 
(8)
Manage and administer the business and affairs of the association.   


 
(9)
Adopt initial bylaws, not inconsistent with law or the articles of association, for managing the business and regulating the affairs of the association.
  


 
(10)
Amend or repeal bylaws, except to the extent that the articles of association reserve this power in whole or in part to shareholders. 
 


 
(11)
Make contracts.   


 
(12)
Generally perform all acts that are legal for a board of directors to perform.  SEVENTH. The board of directors shall have the power to change the location of the main office to any other place within the limits of Wilmington, Delaware, without the approval of the shareholders, or
with a vote of shareholders owning two-thirds of the stock of such association for a relocation outside such limits and upon receipt of a certificate of approval from the Comptroller of the Currency, to any other location within or outside the
limits of Wilmington Delaware, but not more than 30 miles beyond such limits. The board of directors shall have the power to establish or change the location of any branch or branches of the association to any other location permitted under
applicable law, without approval of shareholders, subject to approval by the Comptroller of the Currency.  EIGHTH. The
corporate existence of this association shall continue until termination according to the laws of the United States.  NINTH.
The board of directors of this association, or any one or more shareholders owning, in the aggregate, not less than 50 percent of the stock of this association, may call a special meeting of shareholders at any time. Unless otherwise provided by the
bylaws or the laws of the United States, a notice of the time, place, and purpose of every annual and special 



meeting of the shareholders shall be given at least 10 days prior to the meeting by first-class mail, unless the OCC determines that an emergency circumstance exists. If the association is a
wholly-owned subsidiary, the sole shareholder may waive notice of the shareholders meeting. Unless otherwise provided by the bylaws or these articles, any action requiring approval of shareholders must be effected at a duly called annual or
special meeting.  TENTH. For purposes of this Article Tenth, the term institution-affiliated party shall mean any
institution-affiliated party of the association as such term is defined in 12 U.S.C. 1813(u).  Any institution-affiliated
party (or his or her heirs, executors or administrators) may be indemnified or reimbursed by the association for reasonable expenses actually incurred in connection with any threatened, pending or completed actions or proceedings and appeals
therein, whether civil, criminal, governmental, administrative or investigative, in accordance with and to the fullest extent permitted by law, as such law now or hereafter exists; provided, however, that when an administrative proceeding or action
instituted by a federal banking agency results in a final order or settlement pursuant to which such person: (i) is assessed a civil money penalty, (ii) is removed from office or prohibited from participating in the conduct of the affairs
of the association, or (iii) is required to cease and desist from or to take any affirmative action described in 12 U.S.C. 1818(b) with respect to the association, then the association shall require the repayment of all legal fees and expenses
advanced pursuant to the next succeeding paragraph and may not indemnify such institution-affiliated parties (or their heirs, executors or administrators) for expenses, including expenses for legal fees, penalties or other payments incurred. The
association shall provide indemnification in connection with an action or proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by an institution-affiliated party (or by his or her heirs, executors or administrators) only if such action or proceeding (or part
thereof) was authorized by the board of directors.  Expenses incurred by an institution-affiliated party (or by his or her
heirs, executors or administrators) in connection with any action or proceeding under 12 U.S.C. 164 or 1818 may be paid by the association in advance of the final disposition of such action or proceeding upon (a) a determination by the board of
directors acting by a quorum consisting of directors who are not parties to such action or proceeding that the institution-affiliated party (or his or her heirs, executors or administrators) has a reasonable basis for prevailing on the merits,
(b) a determination that the indemnified individual (or his or her heirs, executors or administrators) will have the financial capacity to reimburse the bank in the event he or she does not prevail, (c) a determination that the payment of
expenses and fees by the association will not adversely affect the safety and soundness of the association, and (d) receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such institution-affiliated party (or by his or her heirs, executors or
administrators) to repay such advancement in the event of a final order or settlement pursuant to which such person: (i) is assessed a civil money penalty, (ii) is removed from office or prohibited from participating in the conduct of the
affairs of the association, or (iii) is required to cease and desist from or to take any affirmative action described in 12 U.S.C. 1818(b) with respect to the association. In all other instances, expenses incurred by an institution-affiliated
party (or by his or her heirs, executors or administrators) in connection with any action or proceeding as to which indemnification may be given under these articles of association may be paid by the association in advance of the final disposition
of such action or proceeding upon (a) receipt of an 



undertaking by or on behalf of such institution-affiliated party (or by or on behalf of his or her heirs, executors or administrators) to repay such advancement in the event that such institution
affiliated party (or his or her heirs, executors or administrators) is ultimately found not to be entitled to indemnification as authorized by these articles of association and (b) approval by the board of directors acting by a quorum
consisting of directors who are not parties to such action or proceeding or, if such a quorum is not obtainable, then approval by stockholders. To the extent permitted by law, the board of directors or, if applicable, the stockholders, shall not be
required to find that the institution-affiliated party has met the applicable standard of conduct provided by law for indemnification in connection with such action or proceeding. 
In the event that a majority of the members of the board of directors are named as respondents in an administrative proceeding or civil
action and request indemnification, the remaining members of the board may authorize independent legal counsel to review the indemnification request and provide the remaining members of the board with a written opinion of counsel as to whether the
conditions delineated in the first four paragraphs of this Article Tenth have been met. If independent legal counsel opines that said conditions have been met, the remaining members of the board of directors may rely on such opinion in authorizing
the requested indemnification.  In the event that all of the members of the board of directors are named as respondents in an
administrative proceeding or civil action and request indemnification, the board shall authorize independent legal counsel to review the indemnification request and provide the board with a written opinion of counsel as to whether the conditions
delineated in the first four paragraphs of this Article Tenth have been met. If legal counsel opines that said conditions have been met, the board of directors may rely on such opinion in authorizing the requested indemnification. 
To the extent permitted under applicable law, the rights of indemnification and to the advancement of expenses provided in these articles
of association (a) shall be available with respect to events occurring prior to the adoption of these articles of association, (b) shall continue to exist after any restrictive amendment of these articles of association with respect to
events occurring prior to such amendment, (c) may be interpreted on the basis of applicable law in effect at the time of the occurrence of the event or events giving rise to the action or proceeding, or on the basis of applicable law in effect
at the time such rights are claimed, and (d) are in the nature of contract rights which may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction as if the association and the institution-affiliated party (or his or her heirs, executors or
administrators) for whom such rights are sought were parties to a separate written agreement.  The rights of indemnification
and to the advancement of expenses provided in these articles of association shall not, to the extent permitted under applicable law, be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which any such institution affiliated party (or his or her heirs,
executors or administrators) may now or hereafter be otherwise entitled whether contained in these articles of association, the bylaws, a resolution of stockholders, a resolution of the board of directors, or an agreement providing such
indemnification, the creation of such other rights being hereby expressly authorized. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the rights of indemnification and to the advancement of expenses provided in these articles of association shall
not be deemed exclusive of any rights, pursuant to statute or otherwise, of any such 



institution-affiliated party (or of his or her heirs, executors or administrators) in any such action or proceeding to have assessed or allowed in his or her favor, against the association or
otherwise, his or her costs and expenses incurred therein or in connection therewith or any part thereof.  If this Article
Tenth or any part hereof shall be held unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, it shall be deemed modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable, and the remainder of this Article Tenth shall remain fully
enforceable.  The association may, upon affirmative vote of a majority of its board of directors, purchase insurance to
indemnify its institution-affiliated parties to the extent that such indemnification is allowed in these articles of association; provided, however, that no such insurance shall include coverage to pay or reimburse any institution-affiliated party
for the cost of any judgment or civil money penalty assessed against such person in an administrative proceeding or civil action commenced by any federal banking agency. Such insurance may, but need not, be for the benefit of all
institution-affiliated parties.  ELEVENTH. These articles of association may be amended at any regular or special meeting of
the shareholders by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the stock of this association, unless the vote of the holders of a greater amount of stock is required by law, and in that case by the vote of the holders of such greater
amount. The associations board of directors may propose one or more amendments to the articles of association for submission to the shareholders.

association a notice stating the purpose of the meeting.  The board of directors may fix a record date for determining

first shareholder signs a demand for the meeting describing the purpose or purposes for which it is to be held.  A special

quorum is present, the board of directors may take action through the vote of a majority of the directors who are in attendance. 


Section 7. Meetings by Conference Telephone. Any one or more members of the
board of directors or any committee thereof may participate in a meeting of such board or committees by means of a conference telephone or similar communications equipment allowing all persons participating in the meeting to hear each other at the

Removal of Directors. Any director may be removed for cause, at any meeting of stockholders notice of which shall have referred to the proposed action, by vote of the stockholders.
Any director may be removed without cause, at any meeting of stockholders notice of which shall have referred to the proposed action, by the vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of the Corporation entitled to vote. Any director may be
removed for cause, at any meeting of the directors notice of which shall have referred to the proposed action, by vote of a majority of the entire Board of Directors.  Section 10. Vacancies.

director to fill such vacancy at any regular meeting of the board of directors, or at a special meeting called for that purpose at which a quorum is present, or if the directors remaining in office constitute fewer than a quorum of the board of
directors, by the affirmative vote of a majority of all the directors remaining in office, or by shareholders at a special meeting called for 



that purpose in conformance with Section 2 of Article I. At any such shareholder meeting, each shareholder entitled to vote shall have the right to multiply the number of votes he or she is
entitled to cast by the number of vacancies being filled and cast the product for a single candidate or distribute the product among two or more candidates. A vacancy that will occur at a specific later date (by reason of a resignation effective at
a later date) may be filled before the vacancy occurs but the new director may not take office until the vacancy occurs. 
ARTICLE III  Committees of the Board  The board of directors has power over and
is solely responsible for the management, supervision, and administration of the association. The board of directors may delegate its power, but none of its responsibilities, to such persons or committees as the board may determine. 
The board of directors must formally ratify written policies authorized by committees of the board of directors before such policies
become effective. Each committee must have one or more member(s), and who may be an officer of the association or an officer or director of any affiliate of the association, who serve at the pleasure of the board of directors. Provisions of the
articles of association and these bylaws governing place of meetings, notice of meeting, quorum and voting requirements of the board of directors, apply to committees and their members as well. The creation of a committee and appointment of members
to it must be approved by the board of directors.

Section 5. Indemnification. 
For purposes of this Section 5 of Article VIII, the term institution-affiliated party shall mean any institution-affiliated party of the
association as such term is defined in 12 U.S.C. 1813(u).  Any institution-affiliated party (or his or her heirs, executors or
administrators) may be indemnified or reimbursed by the association for reasonable expenses actually incurred in connection with any threatened, pending or completed actions or proceedings and appeals therein, whether civil, criminal, governmental,
administrative or investigative, in accordance with and to the fullest extent permitted by law, as such law now or hereafter exists; provided, however, that when an administrative proceeding or action instituted by a federal banking agency results
in a final order or settlement pursuant to which such person: (i) is assessed a civil money penalty, (ii) is removed from office or prohibited from participating in the conduct of the affairs of the association, or (iii) is required
to cease and desist from or to take any affirmative action described in 12 U.S.C. 1818(b) with respect to the association, then the association shall require the repayment of all legal fees and expenses advanced pursuant to the next succeeding
paragraph and may not indemnify such institution-affiliated parties (or their heirs, executors or administrators) for expenses, including expenses for legal fees, penalties or other payments incurred. The association shall provide indemnification in
connection with an action or proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by an institution-affiliated party (or by his or her heirs, executors or administrators) only if such action or proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the board of
directors. 


Expenses incurred by an institution-affiliated party (or by his or her heirs, executors or
administrators) in connection with any action or proceeding under 12 U.S.C. 164 or 1818 may be paid by the association in advance of the final disposition of such action or proceeding upon (a) a determination by the board of directors acting by
a quorum consisting of directors who are not parties to such action or proceeding that the institution-affiliated party (or his or her heirs, executors or administrators) has a reasonable basis for prevailing on the merits, (b) a determination
that the indemnified individual (or his or her heirs, executors or administrators) will have the financial capacity to reimburse the bank in the event he or she does not prevail, (c) a determination that the payment of expenses and fees by the
association will not adversely affect the safety and soundness of the association, and (d) receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such institution-affiliated party (or by his or her heirs, executors or administrators) to repay such
advancement in the event of a final order or settlement pursuant to which such person: (i) is assessed a civil money penalty, (ii) is removed from office or prohibited from participating in the conduct of the affairs of the association, or
(iii) is required to cease and desist from or to take any affirmative action described in 12 U.S.C. 1818(b) with respect to the association. In all other instances, expenses incurred by an institution-affiliated party (or by his or her heirs,
executors or administrators) in connection with any action or proceeding as to which indemnification may be given under these articles of association may be paid by the association in advance of the final disposition of such action or proceeding
upon (a) receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such institution-affiliated party (or by or on behalf of his or her heirs, executors or administrators) to repay such advancement in the event that such institution affiliated party (or his
or her heirs, executors or administrators) is ultimately found not to be entitled to indemnification as authorized by these bylaws and (b) approval by the board of 



directors acting by a quorum consisting of directors who are not parties to such action or proceeding or, if such a quorum is not obtainable, then approval by stockholders. To the extent
permitted by law, the board of directors or, if applicable, the stockholders, shall not be required to find that the institution-affiliated party has met the applicable standard of conduct provided by law for indemnification in connection with such
action or proceeding.  In the event that a majority of the members of the board of directors are named as respondents in an
administrative proceeding or civil action and request indemnification, the remaining members of the board may authorize independent legal counsel to review the indemnification request and provide the remaining members of the board with a written
opinion of counsel as to whether the conditions delineated in the first four paragraphs of this Section 5 of Article VIII have been met. If independent legal counsel opines that said conditions have been met, the remaining members of the board
of directors may rely on such opinion in authorizing the requested indemnification.  In the event that all of the members of
the board of directors are named as respondents in an administrative proceeding or civil action and request indemnification, the board shall authorize independent legal counsel to review the indemnification request and provide the board with a
written opinion of counsel as to whether the conditions delineated in the first four paragraphs of this Section 5 of Article VIII have been met. If legal counsel opines that said conditions have been met, the board of directors may rely on such
opinion in authorizing the requested indemnification. 


To the extent permitted under applicable law, the rights of indemnification and to the
advancement of expenses provided in these articles of association (a) shall be available with respect to events occurring prior to the adoption of these bylaws, (b) shall continue to exist after any restrictive amendment of these bylaws
with respect to events occurring prior to such amendment, (c) may be interpreted on the basis of applicable law in effect at the time of the occurrence of the event or events giving rise to the action or proceeding, or on the basis of
applicable law in effect at the time such rights are claimed, and (d) are in the nature of contract rights which may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction as if the association and the institution-affiliated party (or his or her
heirs, executors or administrators) for whom such rights are sought were parties to a separate written agreement.  The rights
of indemnification and to the advancement of expenses provided in these bylaws shall not, to the extent permitted under applicable law, be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which any such institution-affiliated party (or his or her heirs,
executors or administrators) may now or hereafter be otherwise entitled whether contained in the associations articles of association, these bylaws, a resolution of stockholders, a resolution of the board of directors, or an agreement
providing such indemnification, the creation of such other rights being hereby expressly authorized. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the rights of indemnification and to the advancement of expenses provided in these bylaws shall
not be deemed exclusive of any rights, pursuant to statute or otherwise, of any such institution-affiliated party (or of his or her heirs, executors or administrators) in any such action or proceeding to have assessed or allowed in his or her favor,
against the association or otherwise, his or her costs and expenses incurred therein or in connection therewith or any part thereof. 


If this Section 5 of Article VIII or any part hereof shall be held unenforceable in
any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, it shall be deemed modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable, and the remainder of this Section 5 of Article VIII shall remain fully enforceable. 
The association may, upon affirmative vote of a majority of its board of directors, purchase insurance to indemnify its
institution-affiliated parties to the extent that such indemnification is allowed in these bylaws; provided, however, that no such insurance shall include coverage for a final order assessing civil money penalties against such persons by a bank
regulatory agency. Such insurance may, but need not, be for the benefit of all institution affiliated parties.  ARTICLE IX
 Inspection and Amendments  Section 1. Inspection. A copy of the bylaws of the association, with all amendments, shall at all times be kept in a convenient place at the main office of the association, and shall be open
for inspection to all shareholders during banking hours.  Section 2. Amendments. The bylaws of the association may
be amended, altered or repealed, at any regular meeting of the board of directors, by a vote of a majority of the total number of the directors except as provided below, and provided that the following language accompany any such change. 


I,                    , certify that:
(1) I am the duly constituted (secretary or treasurer) of                             and secretary of
its board of directors, and as such officer am the official custodian of its records; (2) the foregoing bylaws are the bylaws of the association, and all of them are now lawfully in force and effect. 
I have hereunto affixed my official signature on this     day of
                .   




  

(Secretary or Treasurer)
 The associations shareholders may amend or repeal the bylaws even though the bylaws also may be
amended or repealed by the board of directors.
