 Educational Background



MS in Industrial Administration 
Class of 1962 


Carnegie Mellon University

                  Carnegie Mellon University challenges the curious and passionate to imagine and deliver work that matters. A private, global research university, Carnegie Mellon stands among the world's most renowned educational institutions, and sets its own course.With cutting-edge brain science, path-breaking performances, innovative start-ups, driverless cars, big data, big ambitions, Nobel and Turing prizes, hands-on learning, and a whole lot of robots, CMU doesn't imagine the future, they create it.                





 Career History



Co-Founder & Managing Director

                                    1995 - Current                


Kirr, Marbach & Co. LLC


                  Kirr Marbach & Co. (KM) is a value investor. They look for companies with solid business prospects, sound financial structures and strong shareholder-oriented management teams. They invest in stocks that are selling for 50 cents on the dollar. KM also looks for stocks with limited institutional recognition or sponsorship or that are otherwise out of favor. The firm employs powerful database screening tools to find stocks of companies with specific financial and/or valuation characteristics.KM uses a fundamental bottom-up approach along with an economic overview. Their valuation criteria include price/earnings, price/sales, price/market value and enterprise value/free cash flow. For financial strength criteria, the firm considers leverage, returns on invested capital, free cash flow generation and external financing needs.KM's All-Cap Value Equity Product (as represented by KM's Equity Composite) seeks to invest in stocks trading at a significant discount to the firm's estimation of intrinsic value, without regard to market capitalization or whether a stock is typically labeled value or growth. When constructing a portfolio, KM does not try to mimic a benchmark index and they do not purchase unattractive stocks just for the purposes of diversification.The firm's Balanced product utilizes a blend of the All-Cap Equity product with a fixed-income component to provide income and reduce volatility. Balanced accounts typically range from an equally-balanced 50/50 blend to a more equity-oriented 90/10 mix.
