Doing Business with UsWe know it can be difficult - and sometimes downright frustrating - to understand how to work with large organizations. At Battelle, we never want our clients, prospective clients or those we partner with as suppliers to feel that way about our company. Learn more below about how you can do business with Battelle.




 




Government ClientsFrom homeland security to public health, Battelle works with agencies in all sectors of the U.S. government - including the Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Energy, Environmental Protection Agency, National Institutes of Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Food and Drug Administration - as well as local and state agencies. View the full list of our contract vehicles.





Commercial ClientsThrough our innovative research and scientific rigor, Battelle helps commercial clients across a wide range of industries solve the challenges of today and tomorrow. Whether you are in manufacturing, a healthcare provider, a financial institution or a power company, we can offer innovative technology solutions that help your company grow. Contact us today to see how our cross-functional teams can help with your commercial challenges.

 






 




SuppliersWhether you are a small or disadvantaged business or a General Services Administration (GSA) contractor, Battelle aims to put together teams that can deliver outstanding results to our clients. Together, we can compete for projects we might not qualify for individually. Our clients benefit by being able to purchase a total solution and avoiding multiple contract vehicles with disparate contractors. Visit the Suppliers page for details on everything from invoicing to registration in our database.

We are valued for our independence and ability to innovate.








Our Vision, Mission & Values
Battelle's vision is to be a major force in science and technology discovery and in the translation of knowledge into innovative applications that have significant societal and economic impacts.

Steel industrialist Gordon Battelle provided for the Battelle Memorial Institute in his 1923 last will and testament after a career devoted to the idea that science and research can solve problems in business and society as a whole. His vision became our mission when we opened our doors six years later.


Translate scientific discovery and technology advances into societal benefits ". . . for the purpose of education in connection with and the encouragement of creative and research work in the making of discoveries and inventions . . . to do the greatest good for humanity . . ."  
- Gordon Battelle's last will and testament






Our Solvers

At Battelle, we consider ourselves very fortunate to have some of the brightest and most creative minds walking our hallways and working in our labs. Our employees – called “Solvers” for the solutions they provide to difficult challenges – are the glue that holds our company together and why we’re still here after more than 85 years. 


Visit the Careers page to see how you can become a Battelle solver.








 

In the Community

Giving back to the communities where we live and work is in our company’s DNA. Whether it’s through charitable giving – both from employees and our corporate dollars – or the numerous hours volunteered, Battelle is making a difference.

Battelle Innovation: Yesterday & Today

Much has changed in the world in the last 80+ years. But what has remained the same since Battelle opened its doors in 1929 is our commitment to solving the world’s most pressing issues with groundbreaking science and technology, and our focus on giving back to the communities where we live and work.
