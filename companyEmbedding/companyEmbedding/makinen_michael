Marita brings insight, clarity, and “unbelievable attention to detail” (Chambers) to her transactional work for some of the world’s best-known brands. Her deals—whether buy-side or sell-side—frequently involve highly complex capital structures, intricate management incentives, talent retention issues, and protection of intellectual property. Marita’s ability to identify the impact of these issues while anticipating short- and long-term complications has led to a steady stream of significant transactions. Concentrating on acquisitions and divestitures by public and growth-stage private companies, Marita counsels tech and consumer clients on a broad spectrum of corporate and securities issues. Clients value her long-term approach to relationships, describing her as a “company-focused” lawyer who sees each transaction within a larger strategic context. For public companies, Marita advises in the areas of corporate governance and reporting obligations. Known for her astute interpretation of SEC rules and regulations, she provides practical disclosure advice grounded in a solid understanding of her clients’ business objectives. She advises on both routine public reporting matters and complex restatements and stock exchange rule compliance issues. Marita is consistently recognized by Chambers USA and The Legal 500 (U.S.) as a leading corporate and M&A attorney. She recently represented Diligent Corporation in its cross-border take-private by Insight Venture Partners, and The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. in several global acquisitions. 
Her principal areas of focus include: 

Mergers and acquisitions  
Minority and control investments 
Governance 
Securities law and public reporting requirements
