Pear Therapeutics Closes Financing



Share Article


















Funding round led by 5AM Ventures allows growing eHealth startup to build its portfolio of eFormulations for mental and behavioral health.








We were very impressed by early data for eFormulations™ in tackling mental health issues and Pear’s approach provides an opportunity to elevate the standard of care for disorders going well beyond the brain.


Boston, MA (PRWEB)
March 19, 2015
 Pear Therapeutics, the creator of prescription pharmaceutical-software combination products called eFormulations™, announced today that it has successfully closed on additional financing. The funding round was led by 5AM Ventures, with several undisclosed additional investors contributing capital. The investment will allow Pear to build a portfolio of eFormulationsTM. Concurrently, Andrew J. Schwab, Founding Managing Partner of 5AM Ventures, has been appointed to the Pear Therapeutics Board of Directors.
Pear is developing digital health interventions to enhance the efficacy of pharmaceutical preparations. While its proprietary approach has broad clinical application, the company is initially focused on disorders of the brain, many of which impose large societal costs and yet still have limited treatment options. “From mobile applications, to virtual reality simulations, to predictive analytics, our technology directly boosts medication efficacy in incredibly significant ways, well beyond enhanced compliance. Our team has pulled together the pieces required to deliver these products to patients,” said Corey McCann, President and CEO of Pear.
“Brain-related disorders represent a significant healthcare problem that today’s pharmaceutical pipeline is ill-equipped to address. We were very impressed by early data for eFormulations™ in tackling mental health issues and Pear’s approach provides an opportunity to elevate the standard of care for disorders going well beyond the brain,” said Andrew J. Schwab.

Boston and San Francisco-based Pear Therapeutics, a maker of digital therapies, has raised $20 million in funding. 5AM Ventures, Arboretum Ventures and JAZZ Venture Partners led the round with participation from other investors that included Bridge Builders Collaborative.
PRESS RELEASE
BOSTON, MA AND SAN FRANCISCO, CA (PRWEB) FEBRUARY 03, 2016
Pear Therapeutics (PEAR), the creator of prescription digital therapies called eFormulations™, announced today that it has successfully closed on a $20M equity financing. 5AM Ventures, Arboretum Ventures, and JAZZ Venture Partners led the round, with participation from Bridge Builders Collaborative and several additional investors. The investment will allow PEAR to build and launch a portfolio of eFormulations, including reSET™ and reSET-O™, PEAR’s digital therapies for treating Substance Use Disorder (SUD).
“PEAR is at the forefront of a new field in medicine, digital therapeutics, and we are looking forward to working with the PEAR team, along with our syndicate partners, to pave the way forward for patients globally,” said Andy Schwab, Co-Founder and Managing Partner, at 5AM Ventures.
PEAR is developing digital therapies, called eFormulations, to treat disease and enhance the efficacy of pharmaceuticals. PEAR validates the efficacy of these digital therapies by conducting randomized clinical trials, and ultimately submitting the products for FDA approval. “By combining novel digital interventions with drugs, PEAR has demonstrated the ability to enhance efficacy well beyond anything that is commercially available or in clinical development. eFormulations have the ability to quickly elevate the standard of care for many of the disorders of the brain and beyond,” said Corey McCann, President and CEO of PEAR. 





“From mobile applications, to virtual reality, to predictive analytics, PEAR’s digital therapeutics platform directly boosts medication efficacy, well beyond enhanced compliance. The proof is ultimately in the clinical data, and we are incredibly excited to back the PEAR team as they push toward FDA approval, and the delivery of these products to patients,” said Zack Lynch, General Partner at JAZZ Venture Partners.
PEAR’s first products, reSET and reSET-O, are proprietary digital therapies comprised of a patient-facing smartphone application and a clinician-facing web interface that treat SUD. reSET and reSET-O have been tested and validated in 6 randomized clinical studies involving more than 1500 patients with SUD. In a pivotal randomized trial, 399 patients seeking treatment for SUD related to cocaine, alcohol, cannabis, and stimulants across 10 treatment centers received either face-to-face therapy or reSET in lieu of therapist time. Patients receiving reSET in lieu of therapist time demonstrated significantly higher rates of abstinence and higher rates of retention in treatment than patients receiving face-to-face therapy alone. The Company plans to submit the digital therapeutic, reSET, for FDA approval in the first half of 2016. PEAR has also developed reSET-O, an eFormulation that combines the reSET modules with pharmacotherapy for Opiate Dependence. In three separate randomized clinical trials involving over 465 patients, reSET-O has shown the ability to enhance abstinence, enhance retention in treatment, and reduce required clinician intervention time in Opiate Dependence. 





“Given the dearth of treatment options for patients suffering from SUD, we are excited to launch reSET and reSET-O. These products have demonstrated clinical data supporting enhanced abstinence, enhanced retention in treatment, enhanced quality measures like Addiction Severity Index (ASI), and significantly reduced clinician intervention time. Enhancing efficacy while reducing costs is the holy grail for healthcare technology,” said Tim Petersen, Managing Director at Arboretum Ventures.
In addition to PEAR’s addiction products, the Company is launching on its platform a pipeline of eFormulations for treating many of the disorders of the brain. The Company’s product targeting schizophrenia has already demonstrated patient usability and clinical efficacy in combination with multiple medications, and is currently being examined in multiple large-scale clinical trials involving patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and bipolar disorder. PEAR has also developed products enhancing medications for treating chronic pain, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), general anxiety disorder (GAD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and insomnia. These products integrate into the PEAR Platform, a modular and secure cloud-based platform for pushing patient-facing interventions and collecting and displaying data to providers and payors.

The Company develops digital therapies to address a broad range of severe conditions including addiction, schizophrenia, pain, post­-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression, and sleep.

About Substance Use Disorder (SUD)
SUD is a chronic, relapsing disease, impacting more than 21.6 million US individuals over the age of 12. Every year, SUD results in over 200,000 deaths worldwide, and the downstream consequences of SUD are estimated to cost society more than $400 billion. Only 11% of individuals with SUD in the US receive treatment, with lack of access cited as a major barrier to receiving treatment; more than 96% of US counties lack qualified clinicians to treat SUD. For patients who do receive care, there is significant variability in quality, frequency, and utilization of evidence-based therapies across providers as well as discrepancies between research and real-world adherence to guidelines.

Pear Therapeutics Closes $20 Million Financing

February 3, 2016 

BOSTON, MA and SAN FRANCISCO, CA – Pear Therapeutics (PEAR), the creator of prescription digital therapies called eFormulationsTM, announced today that it has successfully closed on a $20M equity financing. 5AM Ventures, Arboretum Ventures, and JAZZ Venture Partners led the round, with participation from Bridge Builders Collaborative and several additional investors. The investment will allow PEAR to build and launch a portfolio of eFormulations, including reSETTM and reSET-OTM, PEAR’s digital therapies for treating Substance Use Disorder (SUD).
“PEAR is at the forefront of a new field in medicine, digital therapeutics, and we are looking forward to working with the PEAR team, along with our syndicate partners, to pave the way forward for patients globally,” said Andy Schwab, Co-Founder and Managing Partner, at 5AM Ventures.
