BBB Reason for Ratings


        BBB rating is based on 13 factors: Get the details about the factors considered.










BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned









                        BBB reports when mail sent to the business was returned by the Postal Service.

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        Build.com has received 4.1 out of 5 stars based on 38 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

Why don't we show the price?

					Like many retailers, FaucetDirect.com can choose to set its own prices independently. And even though manufacturers require FaucetDirect.com and other retailers to display a product's "minimum advertised price" (or MAP), the retailer can choose to sell for less than that. But the price must be conveyed in other ways, and each individual manufacturer's MAP policy determines where the price can be seen.
				

					To see the price for this product at FaucetDirect.com, you'll need to place it in your shopping cart, and maybe even proceed to final checkout. If you're not ready to buy the product, simply remove it from the cart.
				

					FaucetDirect.com apologizes for any inconvenience. We'd just like to offer you the chance to save extra money while we adhere to manufacturers' MAP policies. FaucetDirect.com is also working to educate manufacturers on how their policies impact customers and their buying behavior.

MaterialThere are many materials to choose from, each with their own attributes.  Some of the more common materials used in Faucets and Accessories are Brass, Stainless Steel, Metal and Zinc Alloys. These offer excellent corrosion and tarnish resistance while allowing many finish options.

Others found in many fixtures such as Sinks, Tubs, and Toilets are various materials such as Vitreous China, Enameled Steel, Cast Iron, and various Acrylics. A few examples are of materials you will find on FaucetDirect:

-Brass is derived from alloys of copper and zinc in 
a solid solution. In comparison to bronze which 
is principally an alloy of copper and tin. Despite this 
distinction, some types of brasses are called bronzes.

-Stainless Steel is one of the most hygienic surfaces and very easy to clean. The unique surface is non-porous which will not harbor dirt, grime or bacteria. Stainless Steel has a high tolerance to corrosion while offering a useful life expectancy of over 100 years!

-Vitreous China offers a long lasting, sparkling surface that resists scratches, fading, and will provide a long lasting finish.

-Enameled Steel is less expensive but very durable and easy to clean. Enameled Steel is the choice when economy is required.

-Various Acrylics are used for most specialty baths. for its forgiving nature and flexibility. The non-rusting surface also allows the inclusion of whirlpool or therapeutic jets as the material can be easily modified.

Management Team
Jeffrey J. Kraws
Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer

Well known and respected on Wall Street, Mr. Kraws has received some of the most prestigious awards in the industry, including being consistently ranked among the Top Ten Analysts for pharmaceutical stock performance in the world for almost two decades as well as ranked as the Number One Stock Picker in the world for pharmaceuticals by Starmine and for estimates by Zacks. Additionally, Mr. Kraws has been 5-Star-ranked for top biotechnology stock performance by Starmine.
Prior to founding Crystal Research Associates, Mr. Kraws served as co-president of The Investor Relations Group (IRG); managing director of healthcare research for Ryan Beck & Co.; and director of research/senior pharmaceutical analyst and managing director at Gruntal & Co., LLC (prior to its merger with Ryan Beck & Company). Mr. Kraws has also served as managing director of the healthcare research group and senior pharmaceutical analyst at First Union Securities (formerly EVEREN Securities); as senior U.S. pharmaceutical analyst for the Swedish-Swiss conglomerate Asea Brown Boveri; and as managing director and president of the brokerage/investment banking operation of ABB Aros Securities, Inc. He has been senior pharmaceutical analyst at Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities, BT Alex Brown & Sons, and Buckingham Research. Mr. Kraws has also served as head of competitive analysis within the treasury group at Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, a position which has given him a unique perspective on the inner workings of major healthcare companies.
In addition to serving as CEO of Crystal Research Associates, Mr. Kraws is currently chairman of Synthetic Biologics Inc., a NYSE-listed biotechnology company, and a partner and co-founder of TopHat Capital, LLC. Through his years of experience, Mr. Kraws has cultivated a wealth of industry knowledge and a level of credible, insightful equity analysis that few share. As a result, he has provided guest commentary for many network news programs, including Bloomberg, FOX Business, and CNBC, among others, and has become a valuable resource for financial journalists from the New York Times, Forbes, Bloomberg, CBS MarketWatch, and MedAdNews, among other publications. 
Mr. Kraws holds an MBA from Cornell University and a B.S. from State University of New York-Buffalo. 
 
Karen B. Goldfarb
Co-Founder and President

Ms. Goldfarb brings over two decades of Wall Street experience and a formidable background in the research industry. Throughout her tenure at Crystal Research Associates, she has spearheaded coverage for hundreds of corporations across an array of industries, increasing the visibility of innovative and growing private and public companies that represent extraordinary investment opportunities.
Ms. Goldfarb has previously served as associate director of competitive analysis for IRG, and as vice president within the healthcare research group at Gruntal & Co., LLC (prior to its merger with Ryan Beck & Company), where she covered large-capitalization pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical, generic, drug delivery, biopharmaceutical, and medical technology companies. Prior to joining Gruntal, Ms. Goldfarb served as pharmaceutical associate at First Union Securities (formerly EVEREN Securities), and as a researcher for Merrill Lynch in New York City, specializing in the paper and forest products sector. 
Ms. Goldfarb holds a B.A. degree in Economics from Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ.

BBB Reason for Ratings


        BBB rating is based on 13 factors: Get the details about the factors considered.










BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned









                        BBB reports when mail sent to the business was returned by the Postal Service.

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        Build.com has received 4.1 out of 5 stars based on 38 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.
