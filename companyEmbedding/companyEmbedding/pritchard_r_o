Are there differences in the frequency with which proficient, bilingual readers of Spanish and English use particular strategies when reading these passages? Are there patterns in the manner in which the subjects use the strategies to construct interpretations of the passages? If so, do the patterns vary across passages?A three-phase data analysis revealed that, whether reading Spanish or English texts, subjects drew upon an array of strategic processes to establish connections and integrate understandings. And, when they ran into difficulty, their use of metacognitive strategies often allowed the subjects to continue constructing meaning.
