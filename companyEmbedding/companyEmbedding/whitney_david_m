History and Construction[edit]




The Whitney House, c. 1905


The David Whitney House was built between 1890 and 1894 by the famous lumber baron David Whitney Jr., who was considered not only one of Detroit's wealthiest personalities, but also one of Michigan's wealthiest citizens.[5] The house is estimated to cost $400,000 (approximately $10,500,000 in today's economy)[6] and was featured in several newspapers of that time. The exterior is constructed using pink jasper from South Dakota.[5] It is measured to be 21,000-square-foot (2,000 m2) and has 52 rooms (including 10 bathrooms), 218 windows, 20 fireplaces, and a secret vault in the dining room, an elevator, and numerous Tiffany glass windows. The Tiffany glass windows have been estimated to be worth more than the house itself.[7] The window designs often feature themes oriented around the purpose of the rooms they are located in. For example, the music room's windows are themed towards elements of music as well as images of Saint Cecilia, the patron saint of music. The grand staircase features a massive stained glass window portraying a knight, paying homage to the various members of the Whitney family who were knighted, as well as their lineage to Royal blood line in England. The house was the first residential home in Detroit to have a functioning elevator for personal use.
David Whitney Jr.[edit]




David Whitney Jr, c. 1891


David Whitney Jr. was born in 1830 in Watertown, Massachusetts.[8] Whitney made his millions in Massachusetts as a lumber baron. He moved to Detroit from Lowell (where he had established himself as a lumber baron) in 1857, at the young age of twenty-seven. Starting a joint venture with his brother Charles, he continued to expand his vastly successful lumber business into Ohio, Indiana, and Pennsylvania.
Upon arriving in Detroit, he surrounded himself by the community's wealthiest and most respectable families. Whitney soon earned the nickname of "Mr. Woodward Avenue", due to his keen interest in real estate around the Detroit area. He soon began investing in numerous buildings; in 1915 he built the David Whitney Building, in what is today the Grand Circus Park Historic District.
Whitney Jr. was always fascinated by the Detroit Athletic Club (DAC). Ever since the DAC's establishment in the 1887, it has been revered as "one of the finest private clubs in the country, an elite organization deeply committed to upholding the traditions and elegance of its glorious pasts."[9] Part of the DAC's grounds is now under the possession of Wayne State University. Included among the elite members of the original DAC, were Whitney and his son David C. Whitney. This influenced his choice for the location of the Whitney House as it overlooked the grounds of the DAC. The Whitney mansion was built between 1890 and 1894, and estimated to have cost approximately $400,000. After David Whitney's death in 1900, his family continued to reside in the mansion until 1920. It was converted into an upscale restaurant in 1986.[10][11] Today, many of the members of the Whitney family reside in the Grosse Pointe area.
Hauntings[edit]
Dating back to the renovations in the mid-1980s, there have been rumored occurrences of supernatural activities on all three floors of the Whitney house. The causes of these events have been linked to the story of David Whitney Jr. and his wife both dying inside the mansion.[12] To this day, some people believe that the ghost of David Whitney Jr. haunts the Whitney mansion. One of the most haunted areas in the house appears to be the elevator.[12][13] There are reports of the elevator moving on its own between the floors without any passengers. Other unexplained apparitions have been reported on the second and third floors. One evening at closing, a staff member witnessed an older gentleman gazing out of the second floor dining room window; when he was asked to leave, the figure simply vanished into the floor.[14] Reports by the mansion's staff members of sounds of utensils being stacked and table settings being moved all on their own, have only added to the mystery of the Whitney mansion.[12]

History and Construction[edit]




The Whitney House, c. 1905


The David Whitney House was built between 1890 and 1894 by the famous lumber baron David Whitney Jr., who was considered not only one of Detroit's wealthiest personalities, but also one of Michigan's wealthiest citizens.[5] The house is estimated to cost $400,000 (approximately $10,500,000 in today's economy)[6] and was featured in several newspapers of that time. The exterior is constructed using pink jasper from South Dakota.[5] It is measured to be 21,000-square-foot (2,000 m2) and has 52 rooms (including 10 bathrooms), 218 windows, 20 fireplaces, and a secret vault in the dining room, an elevator, and numerous Tiffany glass windows. The Tiffany glass windows have been estimated to be worth more than the house itself.[7] The window designs often feature themes oriented around the purpose of the rooms they are located in. For example, the music room's windows are themed towards elements of music as well as images of Saint Cecilia, the patron saint of music. The grand staircase features a massive stained glass window portraying a knight, paying homage to the various members of the Whitney family who were knighted, as well as their lineage to Royal blood line in England. The house was the first residential home in Detroit to have a functioning elevator for personal use.
David Whitney Jr.[edit]




David Whitney Jr, c. 1891


David Whitney Jr. was born in 1830 in Watertown, Massachusetts.[8] Whitney made his millions in Massachusetts as a lumber baron. He moved to Detroit from Lowell (where he had established himself as a lumber baron) in 1857, at the young age of twenty-seven. Starting a joint venture with his brother Charles, he continued to expand his vastly successful lumber business into Ohio, Indiana, and Pennsylvania.
Upon arriving in Detroit, he surrounded himself by the community's wealthiest and most respectable families. Whitney soon earned the nickname of "Mr. Woodward Avenue", due to his keen interest in real estate around the Detroit area. He soon began investing in numerous buildings; in 1915 he built the David Whitney Building, in what is today the Grand Circus Park Historic District.
Whitney Jr. was always fascinated by the Detroit Athletic Club (DAC). Ever since the DAC's establishment in the 1887, it has been revered as "one of the finest private clubs in the country, an elite organization deeply committed to upholding the traditions and elegance of its glorious pasts."[9] Part of the DAC's grounds is now under the possession of Wayne State University. Included among the elite members of the original DAC, were Whitney and his son David C. Whitney. This influenced his choice for the location of the Whitney House as it overlooked the grounds of the DAC. The Whitney mansion was built between 1890 and 1894, and estimated to have cost approximately $400,000. After David Whitney's death in 1900, his family continued to reside in the mansion until 1920. It was converted into an upscale restaurant in 1986.[10][11] Today, many of the members of the Whitney family reside in the Grosse Pointe area.
Hauntings[edit]
Dating back to the renovations in the mid-1980s, there have been rumored occurrences of supernatural activities on all three floors of the Whitney house. The causes of these events have been linked to the story of David Whitney Jr. and his wife both dying inside the mansion.[12] To this day, some people believe that the ghost of David Whitney Jr. haunts the Whitney mansion. One of the most haunted areas in the house appears to be the elevator.[12][13] There are reports of the elevator moving on its own between the floors without any passengers. Other unexplained apparitions have been reported on the second and third floors. One evening at closing, a staff member witnessed an older gentleman gazing out of the second floor dining room window; when he was asked to leave, the figure simply vanished into the floor.[14] Reports by the mansion's staff members of sounds of utensils being stacked and table settings being moved all on their own, have only added to the mystery of the Whitney mansion.[12]

The David Whitney House was built between 1890 and 1894 by the famous lumber baron David Whitney Jr., who was considered not only one of Detroit's wealthiest personalities, but also one of Michigan's wealthiest citizens.[5] The house is estimated to cost $400,000 (approximately $10,500,000 in today's economy)[6] and was featured in several newspapers of that time. The exterior is constructed using pink jasper from South Dakota.[5] It is measured to be 21,000-square-foot (2,000 m2) and has 52 rooms (including 10 bathrooms), 218 windows, 20 fireplaces, and a secret vault in the dining room, an elevator, and numerous Tiffany glass windows. The Tiffany glass windows have been estimated to be worth more than the house itself.[7] The window designs often feature themes oriented around the purpose of the rooms they are located in. For example, the music room's windows are themed towards elements of music as well as images of Saint Cecilia, the patron saint of music. The grand staircase features a massive stained glass window portraying a knight, paying homage to the various members of the Whitney family who were knighted, as well as their lineage to Royal blood line in England. The house was the first residential home in Detroit to have a functioning elevator for personal use.
David Whitney Jr.[edit]




David Whitney Jr, c. 1891


David Whitney Jr. was born in 1830 in Watertown, Massachusetts.[8] Whitney made his millions in Massachusetts as a lumber baron. He moved to Detroit from Lowell (where he had established himself as a lumber baron) in 1857, at the young age of twenty-seven. Starting a joint venture with his brother Charles, he continued to expand his vastly successful lumber business into Ohio, Indiana, and Pennsylvania.
Upon arriving in Detroit, he surrounded himself by the community's wealthiest and most respectable families. Whitney soon earned the nickname of "Mr. Woodward Avenue", due to his keen interest in real estate around the Detroit area. He soon began investing in numerous buildings; in 1915 he built the David Whitney Building, in what is today the Grand Circus Park Historic District.
Whitney Jr. was always fascinated by the Detroit Athletic Club (DAC). Ever since the DAC's establishment in the 1887, it has been revered as "one of the finest private clubs in the country, an elite organization deeply committed to upholding the traditions and elegance of its glorious pasts."[9] Part of the DAC's grounds is now under the possession of Wayne State University. Included among the elite members of the original DAC, were Whitney and his son David C. Whitney. This influenced his choice for the location of the Whitney House as it overlooked the grounds of the DAC. The Whitney mansion was built between 1890 and 1894, and estimated to have cost approximately $400,000. After David Whitney's death in 1900, his family continued to reside in the mansion until 1920. It was converted into an upscale restaurant in 1986.[10][11] Today, many of the members of the Whitney family reside in the Grosse Pointe area.
Hauntings[edit]
Dating back to the renovations in the mid-1980s, there have been rumored occurrences of supernatural activities on all three floors of the Whitney house. The causes of these events have been linked to the story of David Whitney Jr. and his wife both dying inside the mansion.[12] To this day, some people believe that the ghost of David Whitney Jr. haunts the Whitney mansion. One of the most haunted areas in the house appears to be the elevator.[12][13] There are reports of the elevator moving on its own between the floors without any passengers. Other unexplained apparitions have been reported on the second and third floors. One evening at closing, a staff member witnessed an older gentleman gazing out of the second floor dining room window; when he was asked to leave, the figure simply vanished into the floor.[14] Reports by the mansion's staff members of sounds of utensils being stacked and table settings being moved all on their own, have only added to the mystery of the Whitney mansion.[12]

ABOUT








I am a UX designer, and my work spans from on-screen interactions to complex services. I get obsessed with designing experiences that are immediately clear to customers and useful to employees. I want to know what is broken, what doesn’t work about the current system, and how I can make life easier. I also have a background in strategy and received my MBA from MIT Sloan.  As a career changer, I am in a unique position to be valuable to a design firm: I have the fresh enthusiasm and training of someone new to the field as well as the judgment and practicality of someone with 10 years of work experience. My industry experience includes quick serve restaurants, automotive, retail, hospitality, government, non-profit, and pharmaceutical.I currently live, work, and eat in Brooklyn, NY.  If you would like to see additional case studies or work samples, please get in touch! 

I have never met a more dedicated, hard-working, and generous professional in the service and UX design field than Whitney.

Pratt & Whitney Replaces Its Head Of Commercial Engines

Pratt & Whitney promotes engine executive, as its head of commercial engines leaves the company




The head of commercial engines at Pratt & Whitney left his post Thursday in the middle of what has been a mixed roll-out for the company's latest product.East Hartford's Pratt & Whitney said in a statement that David M. Brantner, 47, decided to leave the company, effective immediately. An industry source said that Brantner is leaving Pratt & Whitney to take another high-level position in the aerospace industry.He will be replaced by Gregory H. Gernhardt, a vice president for larger models of the company's PurePower commercial engine. Gernhardt will report to Pratt & Whitney President Paul Adams and be responsible for management, sales and marketing of all its commercial engines. His title will be president of commercial engines.The change in leadership comes mid-stride for Pratt & Whitney as it brings its PurePower geared turbofan engine to market, a process that has gone smoothly in some cases and been a challenge in others. So far, two airframe companies have flown the engines.In May, a PurePower engine on a test aircraft grounded Bombardier's C Series for months. Reports said the failure ejected debris from the engine that damaged the airframe. Bombardier, a Canadian company, said last month it and Pratt & Whitney have taken adequate measures to fix the problem, which included modifications to the engine's lubrication system.Airbus, by far the largest customer for the new Pratt & Whitney engine, flew the PurePower model for the first time last week on its A320neo. Pratt & Whitney has orders or commitments for more than 6,000 engines from five companies that also include Embraer, Irkut and Mitsubishi.Gernhardt, 49, led the Airbus and Irkut models of PurePower engine for the last five years, and was "instrumental to advancing it through a number of key milestones," Pratt President Adams said in a written statement.

"During this time, Greg developed important relationships with customers across our commercial engine business, playing a pivotal role in sales campaigns and contributing to the extensive PurePower order portfolio we enjoy today," Adams said.

Healthgrades also receives sanction and malpractice data throughout the year, depending on how frequently the state medical boards release updates. We remove a newly sanctioned doctor from the Recognized Doctor list as soon as we receive the information. However, it is important to note that malpractice information is publically available in only 14 states.Media & PublicationsDr. Whitney has no media or publications listed.Background Check 0 Malpractice ClaimsNo malpractice history found for Illinois.What is medical malpracticeWhat is medical malpractice?Medical malpractice is issued when negligence by a doctor causes injury to a patient. For example, a doctor may improperly diagnose, treat or medicate outside the standard of medical care. The three types of malpractice are: a settlement, an arbitration award, or a judgment.If my doctor has malpractice history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact the quality of care you receive. Claim settlements and arbitration awards may occur for a variety of reasons, which should not necessarily reflect negatively on the doctor's professional competence or conduct.You may want to use this information to start a discussion with the doctor about his or her history and specific ability to provide healthcare for you.How far back does Healthgrades malpractice history go?Healthgrades reports details of a doctor’s malpractice history when the doctor has at least one closed medical malpractice claim within the last five years, even if he or she no longer practices in that state.For which states does Healthgrades collect malpractice history?Healthgrades collects malpractice information from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia. If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact your quality of care. Sometimes multiple states report the same claim. If a provider practices in a state where data is unavailable, please reach out to your local state legislature to help make this data publicly available.0SanctionsNo sanctions history found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What is a sanction or disciplinary actionWhat is a sanction or disciplinary action?A sanction, also known as a disciplinary action, is an action taken to punish or restrict a doctor who has demonstrated professional misconduct. Sanctions may be imposed by a state medical board, professional medical licensing organization, or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.If my doctor has sanction history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a sanction, it does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor-quality doctor. Some sanctions are not related to medical care, and involve a doctor’s finances or administrative activities. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, we recommend that you evaluate the doctor’s sanction information and determine how severe or relevant you think the sanction cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades sanction history go?Healthgrades reports state and federal sanctions from the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect sanction history?Healthgrades collects sanction history from all 50 U.S. states. Physicians with a disciplinary action in one state may move to another state where they have a clean record. Since Healthgrades painstakingly compiles disciplinary action information from all 50 states, Healthgrades website will show if a physician has a disciplinary action in more than one state.0Board ActionsNo board actions found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What are board actionsWhat are board actions?Board actions are non-disciplinary actions imposed upon a doctor based on a complaint investigation. A patient or medical colleague may file a complaint with that state medical board or professional licensing organization, which then investigates the complaint. Board actions are intended to ensure that a doctor is able to perform safe medical and health care tasks.Types of non-disciplinary actions include an advisory letter, a corrective action agreement, a limitation or restriction on the medical or healthcare tasks a doctor can perform, or a voluntary agreement by the doctor not to practice. A board action can also include a termination of a corrective action agreement or voluntary agreement, which allows the doctor to return to full practice.If my doctor has a board action, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a board action, it means he or she has had a non-disciplinary action imposed upon him or her. It does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor quality doctor. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, evaluate the doctor's board action information and determine how severe or relevant you think the cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades non-disciplinary board action history go?Healthgrades reports non-disciplinary board action history from for the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect non-disciplinary board actions?Healthgrades collects non-disciplinary board actions from all 50 U.S. states.Board CertificationsWhy It Matters: Dr. Whitney's Board CertificationsBoard certification should be one of your top considerations when choosing a doctor.

More Why It Matters: Dr. Whitney's Board CertificationsBoard certification should be one of your top considerations when choosing a doctor. Board certification is an official recognition given to doctors who have met specific requirements set by national medical specialty boards in the United States.Board certification indicates that a doctor is highly qualified in the medical field in which he or she practices.
