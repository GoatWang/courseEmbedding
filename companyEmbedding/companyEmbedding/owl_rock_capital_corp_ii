Business Development Companies (BDCs)


Created by Congress in 1980, BDCs were established to encourage the flow of capital to small- and medium-size companies to help them grow. They provide investors with exposure to investments in predominantly private companies, which are typically hard to invest in directly. BDCs may help to provide diversification when added to an overall portfolio.


Attributes of Business Development Companies

Allows “pass through” tax treatment if at least 90% of income and capital gains are distributed to shareholders annually










GOVERNANCE








Regulated by the Investment Company Act of 1940 Act; Board of Directors with majority independent directors










TRANSPARENCY








Required to file quarterly 10-Qs and annual 10-K (audited financial statements) and detailed disclosure of each investment included in a schedule of investments










VALUATION








Quarterly valuation of each investment by an independent third party










INVESTING








At least 70% of portfolio must be invested in private U.S. companies or public U.S. companies that have a market capitalization of less than $250 million; within BDC portfolios, position concentration restrictions can promote diversification

The rules of some arbitration forums may impose time limits for bringing a claim in arbitration.  In some cases, a claim that is ineligible for arbitration may be brought in court.
The rules of the arbitration forum in which the claim is filed, and any agreements thereto, shall be incorporated into these Terms.

Arbitration shall be conducted (i) for claims required to be arbitrated as specified in FINRA rules, that FINRA Dispute Resolution decides to hear, before FINRA Dispute Resolution at the New York FINRA District Office, (ii) in all other cases, in New York, NY in accordance with the arbitration rules then in force by the American Arbitration Association, or (iii) in either case, at another mutually agreed upon site under mutually agreed upon rules,.  The award of the arbitrator shall be final, and judgment upon the award rendered may be entered in any court, state or federal, having jurisdiction. 
No person shall bring a putative or certified class action to arbitration, or seek to enforce any pre-dispute arbitration agreement against any person who has initiated in court a putative class action or who is a member of a putative class who has not opted out of the class with respect to any claims encompassed by the putative class action, until (a) the class certification is denied; or (b) the class is decertified. 
Such forbearance to enforce an agreement to arbitrate shall not constitute a waiver of any rights under these Terms except to the extent stated herein.

A new fund backed by George Soros and Michael Dell is off to a stellar start

  Lipschultz, Owl Rock Capital Partners cofounder and former global
  head of energy and infrastructure at KKR.

  Owl Rock Capital Partners, a credit fund started by private
  equity veterans Marc Lipschultz and Doug Ostrover, has raised
  almost $1 billion.


  The firm aims to lend to small and medium businesses through Owl
  Rock Capital Corp., and has attracted investors including George
  Soros, Michael Dell, and Alibaba Group cofounder Joseph Tsai,
  
  Bloomberg first reported.


  Big banks are 
  retreating from the lending space amid tougher regulations in
  the wake of the financial crisis, and alternative lenders like
  Owl Rock, 
  Apollo Global Management, and 
  Oaktree Capital Group are eager to fill the void.


  In an April filing, Owl Rock said there are nearly 200,000
  middle-market companies in need of "access ... to refinance
  existing debt, support growth and finance acquisitions."


  Owl Rock's credit investments will range from $20 million to $250
  million with maturities between three and 10 years, the filing
  shows.


  The firm's dealmaking team features strong talents from Wall
  Street banks and alternative-investment giants. Lipschultz is a
  former head of energy and infrastructure investing at KKR, while
  Ostrover is an ex-Blackstone Group credit executive. Craig
  Packer, a former senior leveraged-finance banker at Goldman
  Sachs, joined as a cofounder in February and became CEO of Owl
  Rock Capital Corp.
