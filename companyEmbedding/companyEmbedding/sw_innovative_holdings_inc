     OTC PINK CURRENT: SWIH               Everybody's Phone Company is a new alternative to the large phone providers. Texans now have a better choice. Here's how . . . We lease the lines from local phone companies. Then we offer prepaid services to folks like you who've been denied services. Or to anybody who is fed up with their current company. Prepaid home telephone service means no deposit requirements, no credit checks, no ID and no social security questions. No hassels for sure.          SW Innovative Holdings, Inc is a holding company with the goal of acquiring controlling interests in profitable small businesses. Its existing operations sells prepaid, unlimited local (dial tone) telephone service to the residential market, primarily in greater Houston, Texas under its DBA, Everybody's Phone Company. The Company is fully licensed by the Texas Public Utility Commission to resell telephone services throughout the State [Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority (SPCOA) No. 60785]. Once EVPH achieves critical mass in Texas, the Company plans to expand its prepaid telecommunications product offerings nationwide.

Targets the Fastest Growing Sector of the Texas Population 				Nov 16, 2015              Company News  SW Innovative Holdings, Inc. Corporate Update    HOUSTON, TX -- (Marketwired) -- 03/09/17 -- SW Innovative Holdings, Inc. d.b.a. Everybody's Phone Company, Inc. (OTC PINK: SWHI), a provider of landline prepaid telephone services, today announced company details. SW Innovative Holdings, Inc. (SWHI) is considered a development stage company focusing on marketing plain old fashioned telephone service (POTS) to consumers in Texas. Norman George, President said 2016 was spent reorganizing the corporation. On or about October 2016 there was a reverse stock split, on or about December 28, 2016 registration of shares utilizing the Reg-A registration was deemed qualified by the commission allowing the corporation to raise up to $500,000 in fresh capital from the sale of common shares over the next twelve (12) months. The proceeds from the sale of the registered stock will be used to implement our marketing plan to increase revenue and achieve profitability within the next twelve (12) months. The names of the buyers will be disclosed in our quarterly and annual reports filed with OTC Markets. The company has spent considerable time beta-testing its marketing plan to a specific consumer base who lives paycheck to paycheck -- and developing its internal back-office automated software to allow the company to manage its business with low overhead costs. We have discovered specific zip codes where our target market lives so we can utilize target guerrilla marketing to achieve critical mass of subscribers. Once we achieve profits from revenue we will begin to expand our marketing to other markets in adjacent states beyond fiscal year 2017. About SW Innovative Holdings, Inc. SW Innovative Holdings, Inc. d.b.a. Everybody's Phone Company, sells prepaid, unlimited local (dial tone) telephone service to the residential market, primarily in greater Houston.

Details Business StrategyMarketwiredApril 10, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareHOUSTON, TX--(Marketwired - April 10, 2017) - SW Innovative Holdings, Inc. d.b.a. Everybody's Phone Company, Inc. (OTC PINK: SWHI), a provider of landline prepaid telephone services, today announced company details.When considering which type of company to make an investment in; there are two types of companies the razor or the razor blade. Let me explain the razor is a company that manufactures products and the razor blade is a company with reoccurring sales. The subscriber purchases the service over and over hence reoccurring revenue.Norman George, President of SW Innovative Holdings, Inc., said our business model is the reoccurring revenue model company where a subscriber prepays in advance for access to the plain old telephone service (POTS) and pays for this service month after month. We purchase access at wholesale rates and sell the monthly service at a small premium because we do not require a credit check or social security number; it is prepaid; if you do not pay the next month we interrupt or disconnect service.SW Innovative Holdings, Inc. has spent the past couple of years beta-testing the market and our internal software and procedures to ensure a market exists and we can bill and collect revenues from subscribers. We have concluded the beta testing phase and we are ready to rapidly grow revenues in Texas and then analyze expansion of opportunities.About SW Innovative Holdings, Inc.SW Innovative Holdings, Inc. d.b.a.
