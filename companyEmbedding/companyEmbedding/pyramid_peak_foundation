  ×   The old saying, “You can’t judge a book by its cover,” doesn’t mean as much in these digital times (when covers are oftentimes invisible on Kindles and other electronic-reading devices), but it certainly remains true in the world of charitable giving, where it’s sometimes impossible to tell what’s nonprofitable about “nonprofits.” Organizations that qualify for nonprofit status with the IRS range from truly grassroots organizations that depend entirely upon a handful of volunteers to pseudo-corporations that generate tens of millions of dollars in revenue, organizations whose intentions are oftentimes anything but charitable.  Take this particular nonprofit organization’s self-description on its 2013 tax return: “A trade association promoting the interests of its 32 member clubs.” So are these a bunch of blue-collar guys in ball caps and leather jackets drinking beer and slapping backs in a fraternal hall? Or kids gathered in a clubhouse to learn life lessons from a kindly leader in a khaki uniform and Smokey the Bear hat?  Not exactly. This particular trade association is the National Football League and the 32 member clubs mentioned are the NFL’s 32 teams. Buying a “club” these days costs a half billion dollars or more, and the organization’s leader, Commissioner Roger Goodell, is paid $35 million a year for his trouble. Nothing better illustrates how meaningless the term “nonprofit” has become at a time when the IRS approves hundreds more of them every week. Putting “nonprofit” and “charity” in the same sentence or headline, as often happens, makes things even more confusing. That’s because “nonprofit” is a generic tax designation that applies to, among others, private foundations, public charities, hospitals and universities, the NFL (until it gave up its nonprofit status this past April), Habitat for Humanity, the Memphis Country Club, and volunteer organizations that meet for a cup of coffee every so often.  This story is about nine of the biggest nonprofits in Memphis that focus their attention on the Mid-South. It includes six private foundations that have one main funding source and do not solicit contributions from the public: Assisi, Hyde, Plough, Poplar, Pyramid Peak, and the Urban Child Institute. We’ve also included three major public foundations that act as bankers, investors, marketers, and back-office managers for all kinds of donors: the Community Foundation of Greater Memphis, the Hope Christian Community Foundation, and the United Way of the Mid-South.  We do not include ALSAC St. Jude because, although its headquarters is in Memphis, its focus is global. Nor does this report include local hospitals, universities, or college football bowl-game organizations, because the variety of circumstances needing to describe them would fill up the pages of this entire magazine. Sure, each one must submit a detailed Form 990 to the IRS, but their budgets range from the tens of millions annually to mom-and-pops dependent almost entirely on volunteer labor. Just about every case is different. Influencing public policy is one of the primary goals of the six single-source private nonprofits listed here, which is why we consider them the cornerstones of our local philanthropic scene. And at a time when city and county budgets are strained, philanthropy here is booming, thanks to a rising stock market, tax incentives, and a spirit of giving among wealthy Memphians, some of whom go to great lengths to do their good works as anonymously as possible.  These days “data-driven giving” is the mantra. Some of our local foundations use the consulting services of another nonprofit, the Boston-based The Bridgespan Group (“achieve breakthrough results”) for just this purpose. Bridgespan’s clients include the Tennessee Achievement School District, the Salvation Army, 100 Black Men, Arts Memphis, the Pyramid Peak Foundation, and Youth Villages.  The biggest impact of data-driven giving here, perhaps, has been in education. “School reform” is in the eyes of the beholder, but the emergence of charter schools and Teach For America as forces in urban education would not have been possible without the financial support of the Hyde foundations. Faith-based outreach to impoverished areas is the forte of the Hope Foundation. The Pyramid Peak and Poplar Foundations, funded by Southeastern Asset Management founders O. Mason Hawkins and G. Staley Cates, respectively, have given more than $100 million to causes ranging from youth athletics to Soulsville to leafy bike paths that now extend across the county. And the conservancies that manage Shelby Farms and Overton Park and the Memphis Riverfront Development Corporation are products of twenty-first-century philanthropy being used to leverage public dollars.  Nonprofits have changed our perceptions of “public” salaries because the bigger nonprofits now pay their executives so much more than similar positions in city or county government. In 1994, when the Memphis Flyer, our sister publication, did its first survey of 40 local nonprofits, the top salaries in the nonprofit sector were around $300,000 for the leaders of Methodist Hospital and Rhodes College. These would be mid-level executive salaries at many top nonprofits today. Hospital system CEOs now make $2 million or $3 million. An experienced private-school leader can make over $500,000, nearly twice as much as Shelby County Schools Superintendent Dorsey Hopson and three times as much as the mayors of Memphis and Shelby County. And the head of the Urban Child Institute makes four times as much as the outgoing director of the Shelby County Health Department. A final factor worth mentioning is the increased scrutiny of nonprofits in the digital age. Form 990 tax returns, in theory at least, have always been open to public inspection, but getting them in the pre-internet era meant battling lawyers, secretaries, PR firms, and nonprofit CEOs themselves, always with mixed results.  Today, most of this information is readily available at free web sites such as Guidestar, ProPublica, Charity Navigator, GiveWell, and the National Center for Charitable Statistics. There are many recent books about how-to-give and how-to-get, as well as those dedicated to the specifics of small-donor investing, venture philanthropy, social investing, saving the children, saving the elderly, saving young black men, Christian philanthropy, Jewish philanthropy, compassionate conservatives, and equally compassionate liberals. If there isn’t already a book about how to panhandle effectively at road intersections with a cardboard sign, there probably soon will be.  Two good books for those starting to look into the subject are Ken Stern’s Who Really Cares (2013) — a readable take on the Salvation Army’s Kroc Centers, Chess In Schools, bowl games, the Gates Foundation, “charity” hospitals, the Human Fund (really), and Bartlett-based Youth Villages — and Arthur C. Brooks’ With Charity for All: Why Charities Are Failing and a Better Way To Give (2007). More recently, The New York Times weighed in with an op-ed piece, “Who Will Watch the Charities?” by David Callahan, whose premise was that “philanthropies are dangerously opaque.” His piece concluded with a call for a new federal bureau to police charities.  But policing wouldn’t be all that necessary if local media outlets would spend a fraction as much energy reporting on nonprofits as they do on sports, food, and murder and mayhem, and if the foundations and charities themselves would provide better information in useful and more timely fashion. Hopefully, this column will stimulate more local reporting on the subject. Hence this modest report on some of Memphis’ most important major philanthropic nonprofits. The information here is from each individual foundation’s most recent IRS Form 990.    The Community Foundations Note: Community foundations (there are 750 of them in the U.S.) are designated “public charities” rather than “private foundations” by the IRS, because they raise a significant portion of their resources from a broad cross-section of the public each year. The Community Foundation of Greater Memphis cfgm.org CEO: Robert Fockler (2014) Salary: $220,000 Assets: $264 million Income: $96 million  Grants: $74 million Source of funds: Donors, mainly in the Greater Memphis area.  Mission: Administer +1,000 donor-advised funds, from those with multimillion-dollar assets to much smaller ones who participate in its “GIVE 365” program. Provides a variety of business services for the funds CFGM represents. Notable: Founded in 1969 with a $1 million gift from Abe Plough; rated four stars (highest) by Charity Navigator. About 50 percent of its grants go to education. “We can basically act as a donor’s personal research team,” CEO Fockler explains. Hope Christian Community Foundation hopememphis.com CEO: Run by President Michael Harris and 26-member board.  Salary: $140,000 (2014) Assets: $121 million Income: $66 million Grants: $28 million Source of funds: 402 donor-advised funds; donors can start funds with as little as $2,500.  Mission: “Build God’s Kingdom by serving donors in the Mid-South.” Notable: Founded in 1998 by Christian evangelical Larry Lloyd, who also founded the Memphis Leadership Foundation in 1987, as “an inner-city ministry endowment.” A former president of Crichton College, Lloyd is the author of Recovering from Racism: City Ministry in Post-Racial America. United Way of the Mid-South uwmidsouth.org CEO: Rev. Kenneth Robinson, M.D.  Salary: $310,000 (From 2014 Form 990; Robinson took over in 2015.) Assets: $18 million Income: $25 million Grants: $18 million Source of funds: Corporate campaigns, individuals. Mission: Support nonprofits in eight counties in Tennessee, Mississippi, and Arkansas. Notable: Our local United Way program is an affiliate of the national organization founded in 1887. New CEO Robinson replaced Bryce Haugsdahl. Income has declined from $27 million in 2009. Rated two stars (out of four) by Charity Navigator. Founded in 1923, and for decades the only game in town; competition for donor dollars has increased.      The Private Foundations Note: Private foundations do not make donations to individuals. So if you are a genius, you must bring your music, your art, or your sheer brilliance into the framework of a charitable organization, or else, like Pip in Great Expectations, look for your personal Miss Havisham.  The Assisi Foundation of Memphis assisifoundation.org CEO: Jan Young (2013) Salary: $238,000 Assets: $228 million Income: $18 million Grants: $10 million Source of funds: The sale of St. Francis Hospital to Tenet Health Care by the Catholic Sisters of St. Francis in 1994. Mission: “Inspired by the legacy of St. Francis of Assisi,” Assisi is devoted to serving “the poor and the suffering” in the Memphis area. Notable: Charities include the Memphis Zoo, National Civil Rights Museum, Ballet Memphis, and a wide variety (63 in 2013) of local community, education, and health-care organizations services.  J.R. Hyde III Family Foundation  hydefoundation.org CEO: Teresa Sloyan Salary: $289,000 (2013) Assets: $99 million Income: $30 million Grants: $10 million Source of funds: J.R.

STATUS

Built











YEAR

2017











SIZE

10,000 sqft - 25,000 sqft











BUDGET

$1M - 5M














Two Memphis philanthropic foundations teamed up to share new office spaces within a recently renovated Sears distribution facility, previously vacant for 20 years. Each tenant space is primarily made up of private office and meeting rooms.A central mass of shared common spaces divide the tenants for selective privacy while allowing for shared resources. This primary organizing element is a “bow-tie” shaped mass that was developed to obscure the dominant and rigid column grid within the existing space. The bow-tie is comprised of a common conference room, hoteling office, storage and wet bar. The bow-tie also delineates separate entry sequences and offers the capability for dual reception when needed.As a method to establish a level of refinement for both tenants, the bow-tie component is clad with sequenced, stained oak panels. The mass is carved out by the existing column grid and capitals, rendering the emphatic grid less obvious. Thin staggered planes further obscure the column grid and bound offices. Their thinness and lack of materiality contrast the mass and rich texture of the bow-tie. Mechanical crossovers bridging the bow-tie and offices conceal the exposed building systems that are typically present throughout the existing space.

About This Data
Nonprofit Explorer includes summary data for nonprofit tax returns and PDFs of full Form 990 documents.
The summary data contains information processed by the IRS during the 2012-2016 calendar years; this generally consists of filings for the 2011-2015 fiscal years, but may include older records. This data release includes only a subset of what can be found in the full Form 990s.
In addition to the raw summary data, we link to PDFs of full Form 990 documents wherever possible. This consists of a separate release by the IRS of Form 990 documents processed by the agency through June 2016; these documents may contain filings as recent as the 2015 fiscal year.
Which Organizations Are Here?
Every organization that has been recognized as tax exempt by the IRS has to file Form 990 every year, unless they make less than $200,000 in revenue and have less than $500,000 in assets, in which case they have to file form 990-EZ. Organizations making less than $50,000 don’t have to file either form but do have to let the IRS they’re still in business via a Form 990N "e-Postcard."
Nonprofit Explorer has organizations claiming tax exemption in each of the 27 subsections of the 501(c) section of the tax code, and which have filed a Form 990, Form 990EZ or Form 990PF. Taxable trusts and private foundations that are required to file a form 990PF are also included. Small organizations filing a Form 990N "e-Postcard" are not included in this data.
Types of Nonprofits
There are 27 nonprofit designations based on the numbered subsections of section 501(c) of the tax code. See the list »
