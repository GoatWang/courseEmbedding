Tripwire replaces president after one year


Comment

Two Tripwire executives are leaving the Portland company, including President Gus Malezis, who is exiting after just 13 months in the top job. His last day was Friday and he's been replaced by a veteran executive from Tripwire's parent company, Belden.
Tripwire sold for $710 million in December 2014 to Belden, a publicly traded Midwestern company that makes communications networking hardware. The Portland company's longtime chief executive, Jim Johnson, retired last summer.
The changes appear to indicate that Tripwire is being more tightly integrated into Belden as the Portland company works to expand beyond its traditional market protecting commercial activity online and adds safeguards for industrial equipment, too.
Malezis joined Tripwire in 2013, when it acquired a San Francisco network security company called nCircle. He became Tripwire's vice president of sales immediately following that deal, and Belden promoted him to president after Johnson retired. Malezis lives in Canada and had been running the Portland business from there.
"Gus, I think, wanted to be a CEO on his own. Being a president as a part of another company is just different," said Dwayne Melancon, Tripwire's chief technology officer.
Tripwire's new president is Dhrupad Trivedi, who has been a Belden executive since 2011 - for the past three years as president of industrial technology and cybersecurity. Trivedi was the Belden executive who led the Tripwire acquisition, and Melancon said having him in charge of the Portland company will give the business added heft within Belden.
Trivedi lives in the Bay Area and won't be moving to Portland, Melancon said, but will be a regular visitor. And he said plans call for keeping Tripwire's headquarters in Oregon.
Another top Tripwire executive, product management vice president Rod Murchison, is also leaving the company. Melancon said he believes Murchison is going to pursue "another cybersecurity opportunity." Murchison also lives in California.
Tripwire recorded $167.1 million in sales last year, according to Belden's financial filings, and $44.6 million in earnings before interest, taxes and some accounting costs. Sales in the first six months of 2016 totaled $80.8 million, up 5.3 percent from a year earlier.
Tripwire is among Portland's largest high-tech employers. It had 450 workers at the time of its sale, 250 of them at its headquarters downtown, and Melancon said numbers are roughly the same today.

Dave Dickison
Vice President, Worldwide Sales
Dave has an extensive background in sales, starting his career in 1983 after earning a B.S. in Computer Management and Finance from Eastern Illinois University. Dave worked for McAfee Inc., in a number of roles, including Vice President of Sales and the Senior Vice President of North American Channel Sales. His ability to drive sales productivity and develop profitable strategies for sales teams took him to Wind River, where he served as Vice President of Global Accounts, and then to VMware Inc., where he was Area Vice President. In 2014, Dave began his tenure with the senior sales leadership team at Tripwire.
Dave loves the reward of being part of high performance sales teams like the one Tripwire has built. He thrives on being a trusted advisor and building strong customer relationships that solve real business problems. He has a competitive spirit and is willing to try new approaches and methods because winning ultimately makes our customers successful.
Dave spent his youth as an accomplished equestrian hunter and jumper; he started riding horses competitively at the age of six. One of his early jobs was a hot walker and exercise boy at Arlington Park. Although he would like to be a golfer, Dave’s free time is usually spent at his kids’ sporting events or as a competitive 5K runner – he typically finishes local runs in his hometown in the top five or six in his age category. He also loves to travel and hopes to eventually visit all of the National Parks.
Dave strongly prefers his hotdogs and hamburgers sans any condiments, so if you invite him to a cookout, be sure to serve his burger perfectly plain.














Rekha Shenoy
Vice President, Marketing and General Manager Industrial Cyber Security
With a B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering from Bangalore University in India and an M.B.A. from Rice University, Rekha started her career at Compaq. She also spent 10 years at BMC, where she served in a variety of roles, including product management for performance management, database management and mainframe products, marketing, corporate development and acquisitions.
Rekha joined Tripwire ten years ago, initially to run product management and strategy. After launching the expansion of Tripwire Enterprise, she took over marketing and successfully led the team through several major transitions. She then led corporate development at Tripwire where she created the technology alliance program, drove two acquisitions and served as the lead in the sale of Tripwire to Belden. She currently runs the Industrial Cyber Security Business Unit at Belden, which includes the GarrettCom and Tofino products, in addition to leading marketing at Tripwire.
Rekha is a world traveler and a polyglot - she speaks five languages, and she likes to memorize the maps of cities she visits so that she can more fully experience the local culture. So far, she’s navigated the likes of London, Paris, Edinburgh, Amsterdam, Munich and Prague, among others.
In her free time, Rekha attacks puzzles with the same aggressive style that has made her successful professionally.














David Meltzer
Chief Technology Officer
David began building commercial security products in 1996, in the middle of the eight years it took him to get a B.S. in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University. He has a strong entrepreneurial focus, having founded two venture-funded technology companies, and served as Founder, Chief Technology Officer and Chief Executive Officer at both those firms. This included Cambia Security, where he built the software that became Tripwire’s CCM. Cambia was acquired by nCircle, where he continued as Vice President of Engineering and CTO, and he has continued to hold senior leadership positions at Tripwire since its acquisition of nCircle in 2013.
David is laser-focused on innovation. He enjoys taking an idea and working through the entire process required to take it from concept to a commercial product. At Tripwire he has focused his unique talent for building products from soup to nuts on solutions that address the most sophisticated cybersecurity challenges facing the company’s diverse customer base.
David is a home theater nut who admits to researching and buying many new electronic devices that he loses interest in soon after he owns them. His local UPS driver has ranked his house the #1 Amazon delivery destination in his neighborhood. He is a huge Atlanta Hawks fan, but because he spends most of the season going to visit Tripwire customers and speaking at industry events, he misses most of the home games.
David’s early start in programming – he started writing software at age 10 – did come at a cost. He is the least handy person you will ever meet. He once broke a light fixture attempting to change the bulb, and the first and last time he attempted to power wash something, he stripped away all of the wood from his deck.














Jeff Simon
Vice President, Customer Services
Throughout Jeff’s career his top priority and focus has been on helping customers be successful with technology solutions. At Tripwire, Jeff leads the global customer services department comprised of highly talented individuals that play a key role in understanding the challenges customers face and delivering innovative solutions. Prior to joining Tripwire, Jeff held executive positions with InfoQuest Solutions, Serena Software, Zoho, and International Game Technology.
Jeff views customers as partners and believes no request, is too large or small. Many of Tripwire’s innovative solutions are born and developed through strong, collaborative customer relationships and are then developed and nurtured by his customer services team. Jeff’s most satisfying moments at Tripwire involve receiving unsolicited calls or emails from customers lauding his team members for specific contributions to their success.
Jeff spends most off his free time with his children and says there is nothing more satisfying than watching them learn and grow. He also enjoys golf, water sports, snowboarding, cycling, and pursuing the making of the perfect pizza. Jeff owns a couple of guitars, and hopes to learn how to play them well one of these days. When he does, he won’t be singing along as his children (and dog) have made it clear this is not one of his talents.














Ambyr O'Donnell
Vice President, General Counsel
Ambyr has dedicated her career to advising technology companies. She has led teams beyond the in-house legal function, guiding them on human resources, compliance functions and facilities. In 2013, she was named one of the Association of Corporate Counsel’s “Top 10 30-Somethings.” Additionally, she has served as a chair of the Business Law Section of the Oregon State Bar and on other executive committees and law school boards. Prior to joining Tripwire, Ambyr was senior corporate counsel for Coverity, Inc., which was later acquired by Synopsys, and Mentor Graphics Corporation.
Ambyr finds her work at Tripwire rewarding because of the organization’s innovation, competitive spirit and dedication to customer success. Her intellectual curiosity has led her to explore many areas of the business beyond the traditional corporate law function. By understanding the opportunities and challenges facing Tripwire, she is able to be more proactive and effective in her services.
In her personal life, Ambyr enjoys being an early adopter of disruptive technology. She also loves oil painting – more for the process and experience than the end result – and kickboxing to let off steam. Ambyr admits she is not a good cook but makes up for it by surrounding herself with family and friends, who happen to be both amazing chefs and wonderful hosts. It also helps to be in a ‘foodie’ city like Portland.














Ian Williams
Vice President, Human Resources
Ian Williams has 25 years of experience in HR and 15 of those have been in the software industry including stints with CA and Symantec.
Ian believes Tripwire’s culture has the perfect combination of attributes for growth because employees consistently comment on the amazingly talented people they work with and the supportive and caring environment. In his role as head of HR, Ian realizes that no one is perfectly rounded so he focuses on helping people maximize their best qualities.
A Welshman, Ian relocated to the US from the UK 5 years ago. He is very happy in Portland given the fantastic beer and food available at every turn. Ian finds humor in most situations, no matter how difficult they appear. This is fortunate since he also loves traveling, even though he is notoriously bad at navigation. In fact, he has been known to use GPS to get himself home from the office on occasion.
