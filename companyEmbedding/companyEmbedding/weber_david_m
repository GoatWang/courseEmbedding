THE BEST BBQ MEMORIES ARE MADE BY SHARING WONDERFUL MEALS

Inspired by his passion for grilling the best steaks for family and friends, Weber’s founder, George Stephen, invented the revolutionary kettle grill in 1952.
George knew that a rounded cooking bowl with a lid was the key to success. He added three legs to the bottom, a handle to the top, and the rest is history.
