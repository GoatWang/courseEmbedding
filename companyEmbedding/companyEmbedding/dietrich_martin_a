  "Taking the city to it's pure essence: Clearly fascinated by minimalism and abstraction, Martin’s view on urbanity reveals unfamiliar impressions of familiar environments"www.neoprime.de  

































AbstractWhat fascinates me about abstraction was the possibility to implement visions that my surroundings actually weren’t suitable for, yet inappropriate.MinimalFor me, minimalism is – to keep it short but reasonable accurate – the reduction of the displayed subject to it’s essence or to certain, exciting aspects.UrbanLiving in a city like Frankfurt for so long, urbanity is something that always fascinated me. Urban themes just feel so familiar and versatile to me.
