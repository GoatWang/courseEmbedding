			Mr. Taylor has served as our Chief Executive Officer and President since May 2016 and as a director since June 2016. Mr. Taylor has more than 20 years of experience in the commercial real estate industry. From 2012 until joining Brixmor, he was Executive Vice President-Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer for Federal Realty Investment Trust, a real estate investment trust, and a member of Federal Realty's executive and investment committees. At Federal Realty, he was also responsible for sourcing and evaluating business development opportunities for its east coast portfolio, as well as for operational oversight of its southeast portfolio. From 1998 to 2012, Mr. Taylor was a Senior Managing Director and the head of real estate investment banking at Eastdil Secured / Wells Fargo where he successfully completed over $100 billion of public debt and equity offerings, M&A transactions, asset and portfolio sales, private equity placements, mortgage financings and bank loans for his real estate clients. Prior to joining Eastdil Secured, Mr. Taylor practiced corporate and securities law at the law firm Hunton & Williams, with a focus on equity REITs, and also worked as a senior accountant for the accounting firm Price Waterhouse in Washington, D.C. He is a member of the Urban Land Institute (ULI). He received a B.S. and J.D. from the University of Virginia. In determining that he should serve as a director, our Board considered Mr. Taylor's extensive experience over more than 20 years in the commercial real estate industry and his knowledge of our business and portfolio as our chief executive officer.

Learn about Dr. Taylor JrCare PhilosophyIn the "good old days", physicians were the primary source of medical information for most patients. In today's world of exploding information technology the physician's role has fundamentally changed, but is still vital. We are the guides and translators for patients. Our job is to help determine the recurrence of vast amounts of data as it applies to the individual and family medicine accomplishes this through long-term personal relationship with patients....Read MoreDr. Taylor Jr's Experience0%ExperienceMatchDr. Taylor Jr's experience matches your search based on the following criteria:Based on total number of patients treated over the last 12 monthsSpecializes in Family MedicineBoard certified in Family PracticeNo sanctions foundNo board actions found1SpecialtiesFamily Medicine1Board CertificationsWhy it matters: Dr. Taylor Jr's Board CertificationsFamily PracticeAccredited by: American Board of Family Medicine** This information is proprietary data maintained in a copyrighted database compilation owned by the American Board of Medical Specialties. Copyright 2017 American Board of Medical Specialties. All rights reserved.Board CertificationsWhy It Matters: Dr. Taylor Jr's Board CertificationsBoard certification should be one of your top considerations when choosing a doctor. Board certification is an official recognition given to doctors who have met specific requirements set by national medical specialty boards in the United States.Board certification indicates that a doctor is highly qualified in the medical field in which he or she practices. A board-certified doctor is more likely than a non-board-certified doctor to have the most current skills and knowledge about how to treat your medical condition.15Conditions TreatedAnxietyArthritisAsthmaChronic SinusitisDepressionDiabetesEmphysemaHigh CholesterolHypertensionInfectious DiseasesInjuriesOsteoarthritisOsteoporosisPneumoniaSleep Apnea9ProceduresAbscess Incision and DrainageBiopsyElectrocardiogram (EKG)ImmunizationInjection TherapyPap SmearPhysical ExaminationSkin BiopsyVaccinationBackground CheckMalpractice Claims not availableWhat is medical malpractice?Healthgrades does not collect malpractice information for Louisiana.Background CheckWhat is medical malpractice?Medical malpractice is issued when negligence by a doctor causes injury to a patient. For example, a doctor may improperly diagnose, treat or medicate outside the standard of medical care. The three types of malpractice are: a settlement, an arbitration award, or a judgment.If my doctor has malpractice history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact the quality of care you receive. Claim settlements and arbitration awards may occur for a variety of reasons, which should not necessarily reflect negatively on the doctor's professional competence or conduct.You may want to use this information to start a discussion with the doctor about his or her history and specific ability to provide healthcare for you.How far back does Healthgrades malpractice history go?Healthgrades reports details of a doctor’s malpractice history when the doctor has at least one closed medical malpractice claim within the last five years, even if he or she no longer practices in that state.For which states does Healthgrades collect malpractice history?Healthgrades collects malpractice information from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, and West Virginia. If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact your quality of care. Sometimes multiple states report the same claim. If a provider practices in a state where data is unavailable, please reach out to your local state legislature to help make this data publicly available.0 SanctionsWhat is a sanction or disciplinary action?No sanctions history found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.Background CheckWhat is a sanction or disciplinary action?A sanction, also known as a disciplinary action, is an action taken to punish or restrict a doctor who has demonstrated professional misconduct. Sanctions may be imposed by a state medical board, professional medical licensing organization, or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.If my doctor has sanction history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a sanction, it does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor-quality doctor. Some sanctions are not related to medical care, and involve a doctor’s finances or administrative activities. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, we recommend that you evaluate the doctor’s sanction information and determine how severe or relevant you think the sanction cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades sanction history go?Healthgrades reports state and federal sanctions from the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect sanction history?Healthgrades collects sanction history from all 50 U.S. states. Physicians with a disciplinary action in one state may move to another state where they have a clean record. Since Healthgrades painstakingly compiles disciplinary action information from all 50 states, Healthgrades website will show if a physician has a disciplinary action in more than one state.0 Board ActionsWhat are board actions?No board actions found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.Background CheckWhat are board actions?Board actions are non-disciplinary actions imposed upon a doctor based on a complaint investigation. A patient or medical colleague may file a complaint with that state medical board or professional licensing organization, which then investigates the complaint. Board actions are intended to ensure that a doctor is able to perform safe medical and health care tasks.Types of non-disciplinary actions include an advisory letter, a corrective action agreement, a limitation or restriction on the medical or healthcare tasks a doctor can perform, or a voluntary agreement by the doctor not to practice. A board action can also include a termination of a corrective action agreement or voluntary agreement, which allows the doctor to return to full practice.If my doctor has a board action, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a board action, it means he or she has had a non-disciplinary action imposed upon him or her. It does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor quality doctor. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, evaluate the doctor's board action information and determine how severe or relevant you think the cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades non-disciplinary board action history go?Healthgrades reports non-disciplinary board action history from for the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered.
