      TransEnterix, Inc. Announces Loan Agreement with Innovatus Capital 
      Partners, LLC
    



Term Loans Support Commercialization in Europe and U.S. Regulatory 
      Clearance and Market Development






May 10, 2017 04:02 PM Eastern Daylight Time



RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--TransEnterix, Inc. (NYSE MKT:TRXC) (the “Company”), a medical device 
      company that is pioneering the use of robotics to improve minimally 
      invasive surgery, today announced that it has entered into a debt 
      financing agreement with an affiliate of Innovatus Capital Partners, LLC 
      ("Innovatus") to provide the Company with up to $17.0 million in term 
      loans.
    


      "We are pleased to partner with Innovatus for our debt financing needs," 
      said Todd M. Pope, President and Chief Executive Officer of 
      TransEnterix. "In conjunction with our recently completed equity 
      transaction, this capital will allow us to continue our 
      commercialization efforts in Europe, focus on the Senhance 510(k) 
      clearance process and expand our U.S. market development efforts. 
      Innovatus has proven to be a flexible and committed capital provider at 
      this critical stage of growth."
    

      On May 10, 2017, the Company entered into a loan and security agreement 
      (the "Loan Agreement") with Innovatus pursuant to which Innovatus has 
      agreed to make certain term loans in the aggregate principal amount of 
      up to $17.0 million, with the funding of the first $14.0 million tranche 
      expected to occur upon satisfaction of customary funding conditions. The 
      Company will be eligible to draw on the second tranche of $3,000,000 
      upon achievement of certain milestones, including clearance for 
      commercialization of Senhance by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
      (“Senhance Clearance”). The Company is entitled to make interest-only 
      payments for twenty-four months so long as it meets certain milestones, 
      including Senhance Clearance by May 30, 2018. The loans will mature on 
      the earlier of (i) the fourth anniversary of the initial funding date 
      and (ii) twenty-four (24) months following the failure to achieve such 
      interest-only milestones. The Loan Agreement includes customary warrant 
      coverage and is secured by all of the Company’s, and its domestic and 
      material foreign subsidiaries’, assets. The Company fully repaid its 
      term loans with Silicon Valley Bank and Oxford Finance LLC on May 10, 
      2017. Proceeds will be used for general corporate and working capital 
      purposes.
    

      "Innovatus is excited about the participation of TransEnterix in the 
      future use of robotics in the medical field with the Senhance Surgical 
      Robotic System," said Andrew Dym, co-founder and President of Innovatus. 
      "Providing capital to such a pioneering and innovative company is a 
      strategic priority for Innovatus and we look forward to continuing our 
      relationship for years to come."
    

      Additional details regarding the Company's financing are included in the 
      Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K which is expected to be filed on or 
      about May 10, 2017 with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Biogest finalizes EUR 5.3 million biogas power plant with BCR loan

From:Taiwan Trade Center,Bucharest
Date:February 18, 2016
First Biogaz SRL, a member of Biogest Austria, completed a biogas station in Ardud, Satu-Mare County, using a loan obtained from the Romanian Commercial Bank (BCR), shows a press release from energynomics.ro.
“The biogas station – an investment worth about EUR5.3 million – has an installed capacity of 1.5 MW and the electricity generated can cover energy needs for approximately 4,500 households. From the leadership of the banking system in Romania, BCR confirms its strategy to support the local economy, including the renewable energy sector, especially since the investment in biogas and biomass are in line with the new directions of development of the renewable industry set by the relevant authorities,” said Ioana Gheorghiade, executive director for public sector and infrastructure financing branch of BCR.
Biogas is a renewable energy source that offers technological, environmental and economic advantages. The energy can be generated 365 days a year at any time of day or night, ideal for the growing electricity demand. This availability of biogas gives it an important role in the energy mix from renewable sources such as water, sun and wind. At the same time, it contributes to the objectives of environmental protection and reduces the dependency on energy imports.
Biogest is an international manufacturer of biogas plants, based in Austria, also present in UK, Italy, Serbia and the Czech Republic. The main activity of Biogest varies from project development, planning, financing, construction and operation of turnkey power plants with an installed power between 100 kW and 3.5 MW. So far, the company has completed more than 90 biogas plant projects in Europe.
This biogas plant, which is built based on the Biogest PowerRing technology, tested and confirmed in numerous occasions, reaps the benefits of energy efficiency and reliability, while saving space through its modular design. For the first time, the installation from Ardud will not only use energy crops, but will draw extensively on secondary agricultural products such as corn stalks.
Research and development activities carried out at Biogest focus on exploring the potential for exploitation of alternative raw materials in order to reduce costs with the substrate and create a perfect symbiosis between food and energy production. Ardud will experiment and use some perennials substrate plants, thereby converting this facility into a flagship center for the region.
Given the general economic situation and considerable available agricultural resources, Romania is an important target for renewable energy investments on biogas, the statement concludes.
