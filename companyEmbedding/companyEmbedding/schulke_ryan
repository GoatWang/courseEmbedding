Fluent - Company























































Skip to content


















Thank You!

	    We’ll be in touch shortly.
	  

OK













We are powerful, precise and adaptable. We are Fluent.







Fluent is transforming acquisition marketing by fusing hardcore data science with human interaction in remarkable—and measurable—new ways. We’ve assembled a team of proven builders, connectors and innovators who love what they do and love playing together as a team.









LEADERSHIP



Ryan Schulke
Chief Executive Officer




Ryan Schulke co-founded Fluent with long-time friend Matt Conlin. He is responsible for Fluent’s corporate vision and strategy, ensuring that the company’s digital advertising solutions are both scalable and sustainable, and expanding its leadership in the ad technology space.
Throughout his career, Ryan has held senior roles in the performance marketing, direct response and database marketing industries. Before Fluent, he worked as Media Director for Clash Media, where he helped grow the company’s U.S. business. Earlier in his career, he held positions at MediaWhiz Holdings, and Innovation Ads.
When not holding the fort down at Fluent, Ryan can be found exploiting all that New York City has to offer with his wife, and other family and friends. He is an avid Jets and St. John’s basketball fan, and loves to squeeze in a little world travel when he can.







Matt Conlin
President




Matt Conlin co-founded Fluent with Ryan Schulke, with a vision for changing the digital world through new technology and advertising solutions. With responsibility for the company’s sales, marketing, and partner development strategies, Matt has played a central role in leading Fluent to become the highest volume customer acquisition technology platform and ad network in the nation.
Matt’s leadership skills were immediately recognized by MMC Ventures as he was selected to launch the US division of Clash Media at the age of 23. Prior to that, he worked at CoregMedia, and Innovation Ads.
Outside of work, you can find Matt cheering on his hometown Michigan Wolverines and globetrotting with his wife in his authentic pair of lederhosen.







Sean Cullen
EVP, Product & Technology




Sean spearheads the development of Fluent’s visionary product and technology roadmap, and oversees the execution of it through the management of the engineering, design, project management, and performance teams. The combined efforts of Sean’s teams enable customer engagement, drive superior results, and provide actionable insights for Fluent’s advertisers and publishers. Before Fluent, Sean worked at Clash Media as Media Director and Campaign Manager. He also worked at Sanky Communications.
When Sean isn’t in the Fluent offices, you might be able to spot him at one of NYC’s best Austin-style BBQ spots, or can track him down through his influx of posts of his son, Teddy, on Instagram. He enjoys traveling to far-flung countries such as Kazakhstan with his lovely wife, and is an advocate of all things Delaware.







Matt Koncz
EVP, Media and Distribution




Matt Koncz is responsible for managing Fluent’s proprietary and third-party distribution network. His primary functions are to set and attain annual volume, spend, and margin targets as well as lead new media discovery efforts. The team he manages is responsible for publisher development as well as the retention and growth of the current publisher network. He has been with Fluent since its inception, and is a lead generation and monetization wizard. Matt formerly worked at Clash Media and Venture Direct, where he focused on media buying and publisher partnerships. You can find Matt spending time with his family, playing golf with friends, or rooting for the Dallas Cowboys, which he considers more of a hardship than a leisurely activity.







Jordan Cohen
Chief Marketing Officer




Jordan Cohen is a well-known industry veteran and frequent speaker, author, and media spokesman on a wide variety of digital marketing topics. As Chief Marketing Officer for Fluent, he is responsible for the company’s strategic marketing, branding, demand generation, communications, and channel partnership programs.
Prior to joining Fluent, Jordan served as VP of Marketing for real-time email technology innovator Movable Ink, VP of Business Development for mobile ad startup Pontiflex, and earlier in his career held senior marketing roles at Unica, Goodmail Systems, Epsilon, and the DMA.
Jordan enjoys traveling as often as possible to Maine with his wife, wrestling with his friend’s Wheaton Terrier, Micheluzzo, and indulging at his favorite Manhattan restaurant, Flex Mussels.







Daryl Colwell
Senior VP of Sales




Daryl Colwell is Senior Vice President of Sales for Fluent, the industry leader in people-based digital marketing and customer acquisition. An industry veteran with over 15 years of experience, Colwell previously served as Senior Vice President of Sales and Business Development at Matomy Media Group. Before Matomy, he held senior management and sales roles at Relevance-X, the online behavioral and life-stage targeting division of Acxiom, and digital advertising agency SilverCarrot. Colwell is a well-known industry thought leader and frequent speaker at industry conferences including Affiliate Summit, LeadsCon, Search Marketing Expo, OMMA Global, and PubCon. He also served as an expert industry panelist at the Federal Trade Commission’s 2015 “Follow the Lead: An FTC Workshop about Online Lead Generation.” Colwell’s insights have been featured in a number of leading publications including The Wall Street Journal, MarketWatch, Advertising Age, Direct Marketing News and MediaPost.







Dan Barsky
General Counsel




Dan “The Bulldog” Barsky is Fluent’s General Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer. He handles all of Fluent’s legal needs, overseeing risk management and compliance. He also manages the company’s customer service department, and works closely with the product and creative teams to ensure that Fluent’s proprietary products are legally compliant and in-line with industry best practices. Dan previously served on the senior management teams at Snackable Media, Hanover Direct, and other high growth media and ad tech companies. While not managing the fine print, Dan can be found skiing the mountains in Colorado with his family, biking the streets of Manhattan, and relaxing in Fire Island.







Ryan Perfit
VP, Finance




As VP of Finance, Ryan Perfit ties Fluent’s strategic objectives to financial forecasts, models, and budgets. He oversees the company’s accounting and commercial reporting and analysis departments. With over 14 years of experience in finance and business operations, Ryan has played a crucial role in driving Fluent’s rapid revenue growth. Prior to working at Fluent, Ryan worked in Latin America for several US-based companies. He was the Director of Finance at Blue Parallel, and also worked at SkyOnline, Viva Transcription Corp, FTI Consulting, and PricewaterhouseCoopers. Ryan has a green thumb that is hard to come by in the concrete jungle of New York. He is also an urban biker, and an avid sneakerhead.







Ariana Levine
Head of People




Ariana Levine oversees Fluent’s Human Resources department, and is responsible for all talent acquisition, employee development, and benefits programs. Largely as a result of her efforts, Fluent has been named one of the best places to work in New York City for the past three consecutive years by Crain’s NY Business magazine. Prior to working at Fluent, Ariana held a number of HR and employee relations positions at Barney’s New York. She has a Masters in Organizational Psychology from Columbia University. While not in the Fluent offices, you can find Ariana cheering on the Wisconsin Badgers with her husband Ross and two adorable daughters Marlowe and Wesley. They enjoy traveling and spending time on the beach in Long Island.
