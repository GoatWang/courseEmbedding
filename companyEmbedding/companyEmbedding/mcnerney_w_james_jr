Executive Biography of W. James McNerney, Jr.









W. James McNerney, Jr.Boeing, 2005 – 2016
President, Chief Executive Officer, Chairman of the Board




W. James (Jim) McNerney, Jr., joined Boeing as chairman, president and CEO on July 1, 2005. He served as president until December 2013, CEO until July 2015     and chairman until March 2016.
During his tenure, the company recaptured the global lead in commercial airplane deliveries with steady increases in production and a comprehensive update     of its product line; maintained a strong position in defense markets despite a downturn in U.S. military spending; restored Boeing's historic leadership in     human spaceflight with major new program wins; and expanded its engineering and manufacturing footprint inside and outside the United States.
Also, with a relentless focus on internal productivity to fund investments in innovation and growth, Boeing's financial performance steadily improved under     McNerney, with revenue rising 73 percent to a record $90.8 billion in 2014 from $52.5 billion in 2004, the year before he became CEO.

He joined 3M in 2000 after 19 years at the General     Electric Company.
McNerney joined General Electric in 1982. There, he held top executive positions including president and CEO of GE Aircraft Engines and GE Lighting;     president of GE Asia-Pacific; president and CEO of GE Electrical Distribution and Control; executive vice president of GE Capital, one of the world's     largest financial service companies; and president, GE Information Services. Prior to joining GE, McNerney worked at Procter & Gamble and McKinsey     & Co., Inc.
In addition, McNerney was named the 2015 CEO of the Year by Chief Executive magazine and the 2008 National Management Association’s Executive of     the Year. He received the Juran Medal from the American Society for Quality (ASQ), the Wilson Center’s Woodrow Wilson Award for Corporate Citizenship, the     inaugural Turning Point Award from the U.S. Army War College Foundation, the Semper Fidelis Award from the Marine Corps Scholarship Foundation, the John W.     Dixon Award from the Association of the U.S. Army and an honorary Doctor of Science degree from Cranfield University.

      Sidelights
    

      Business executive W. James McNerney spent many years at General Electric
      (GE), before serving as chief executive officer (CEO) and chairman of the
      board first at 3M and then Boeing. He took the job at 3M after being
      passed over for the chairman of the board position at GE. While McNerney
      reorganized 3M and increased the company's profitability, he
      decided to take an offer from Boeing, a company best known as the
      manufacturer of aviation technology. McNerney hoped to have the same
      success at Boeing that he had at 3M.
    

      McNerney was born in 1949 in Providence, Rhode Island. He and his four
      younger siblings were raised in Ann Arbor, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and
      Chicago, Illinois. His father, Walter McNerney, Sr., was a professor of
      health policy as well as a president of Blue Cross and Blue Shield
      Association. After graduating from Chicago's New Trier Township
      High School, McNerney entered Yale University, where he played baseball
      with future president 
       George W. Bush. He earned his B.A. in American Studies from Yale in 1971.
      He then spent some time teaching sailing on Lake Michigan, working on a
      ranch in Colorado, and holding an insurance position in London, England.
      McNerney later returned to the classroom, earning his M.B.A. from Harvard
      University in 1975.
    

      With M.B.A. in hand, McNerney began his professional career at Procter
      & Gamble. He spent twoand-a-half years as a brand manager, in
      charge of several consumer products including Coast soap, Bounce fabric
      softener sheets, and Downy liquid fabric softener. In 1978, McNerney
      joined the consulting firm McKinsey & Co., Inc., in Chicago,
      Illinois, as a senior manager. He spent the next few years taking care of
      high technology interests for international markets, primarily from the
      company's offices in Germany.
    

      McNerney joined GE in 1982 as vice president of GE Information Services, a
      supplier of network computer services. He was promoted to senior vice
      president then moved to another position in GE in 1986. McNerney was next
      named the manager of GE Mobile Communications business. In 1988, he
      returned to Information Services as president. A year later, McNerney
      moved again, this time to become executive vice president of GE Capital,
      the company's financial services unit and one of the largest such
      companies in the world. He built business relationships with retailers,
      operators of rail cars, and auto fleets for GE Capital, as well as acted
      as supervisor of the Genstar Container business.
    

      In 1991, McNerney was promoted to president and chief executive officer of
      GE Electrical Distribution and Control, a business worth $1.7 billion. In
      this position, he dealt with a number of different kind of products,
      including industrial equipment like circuit breakers, switches, and
      transformers. McNerney then moved into several more executive positions,
      gaining more experience in the variety of businesses run by GE. In 1992,
      he was named president of GE Asia-Pacific. McNerney spent the next three
      years based in Hong Kong. He returned to the United States in 1995 when he
      was selected to be the president and CEO of GE Lighting, based in
      Cleveland, Ohio. He did well in this post, seeking out new markets for the
      high-tech lamps and light bulbs produced by this division.
    

      McNerney's last position at GE began in 1997 when he was named
      president and CEO of GE Aircraft Engines. This division, based in
      Cincinnati, Ohio, made engines for commercial and military planes. Under
      his leadership, the division became number one in the aerospace industry,
      replacing former number one Pratt & Whitney. It landed big
      contracts and handled important customers, including a deal with Boeing to
      provide the GE90 engine for its 777 jet. McNerney also greatly increased
      the sales and profitability of this division. In 1999, annual sales
      reached nearly $11 billion, up from $6.3 billion in 1996. Profits in the
      same time period increased from $1.2 billion to $2.1 billion. McNerney
      made GE Aircraft Engines one of the best performing units at GE, producing
      the second-most profits in GE.
    

      By the time McNerney was moved to GE Aircraft Engines, observers believed
      that he was being groomed to take over as chairman of GE. After two
      decades at helm, legendary chairman John F. Welch announced his intention
      to retire in 2000, with the actual event occurring in 2001. McNerney
      seemed like an ideal candidate to replace Welch because of his vast
      experience in the company and because the company wanted to promote
      someone from a manufacturing or equipment business in GE. Mc-Nerney was
      already being pursued by other companies for executive positions. He even
      had an offer to become the chief operating officer at Microsoft, but
      turned it down. McNerney wanted to remain at GE, though there were
      concerns about his age and charisma as a potential candidate to replace
      Welch. However, McNarney had two competitors for the job, Robert L.
      Nardelli and Jeffrey R. Immelt. Mc-Nerney decided to leave GE in late 2000
      when it became clear he would not be chosen to replace Welch. Instead,
      Immelt was named GE's new CEO.
    

      McNerney had been heavily recruited by other companies by this time.
      Though he had a similar offer from Lucent, McNerney decided to leave GE
      for 3M (or Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Co.) as chief executive
      officer and chairman of the board. McNerney's position began
      January 1, 2001, replacing L.D. "Desi" DeSimone who was
      being forced into mandatory retirement at the age of 65. 3M was a $20
      billion technology company which produced a variety of consumer products,
      office supplies, health care products, safety products, electronics,
      telecommunications, and industrial products. Some of its more well-known
      goods included Post-It Notes, Scotch Tape, Scotchguard, and Thinsulate. 3M
      had customers in 200 countries, with operations in 60 of them.
    

      The hiring of McNerney by 3M was considered an unusual move. It marked the
      first time in the company's history that an outsider was selected
      to run 3M. However, it was believed that one reason he was brought aboard
      was that he fit into the corporate 
       culture at 3M, with a pleasant though determined personality. McNerney
      was also expected to bring some of GE's success-driven corporate
      culture to 3M. The companies were similar in that they were both quite
      large and did business in a number of different areas. Of McNerney,
      outgoing CEO DeSimone told Josh L. Dickey of the Associated Press State
      & Local Wire, "He understands the diverse business
      circumstances here, he has worked internationally, and he has a personal
      style that will fit very, very well with 3M. I don't see the
      hurdles you might expect [for a newcomer]."
    

      While 3M was performing well financially when McNerney was hired, he was
      expected to help the company get the most value out of its products and
      assets by improving productivity. He wanted to get either get rid of or
      fix any product lines that were underproducing and control costs across
      the board. McNerney intended to make 3M's products number one or
      number two in their markets, eliminate unnecessary management layers, and
      demand more accountability among its employees. Wall Street believed in
      McNerney as a leader. Upon his announcement that he intended to act
      aggressively as CEO, stock prices jumped more than eleven dollars in one
      day alone.
    

      McNerney had a rough first couple of years at 3M in part because of the
      poor world economy in 2001 and 2002, as well as the negative effects on
      business caused by the terrorist attacks on the United States on September
      11, 2001. Though sales and revenues were down in 2001, especially in
      3M's telecommunication business, McNerney helped control profit
      loss by cutting costs. He eliminated about 6, 500 jobs, limited budgets
      for office supplies and travel, cut inventories, and limited accounts
      receivable. By the end of 2001, values of shares had climbed nearly 20
      percent since the announcement that he had been hired. McNerney wanted to
      improve the culture at 3M and did so by adding a leadership development
      center.
    

      One area of particular concern for some 3M employees was its research and
      development (R&D) budget. While McNerney left the billion dollar
      budget in place, he added some uniform performance standards and
      centralized some operations. Previously, scientists and other researchers
      were given free rein as they developed new ideas for goods. Such a loose
      atmosphere had resulted in the development of many successful products for
      3M. Mc-Nerney wanted R&D to remain innovative, but only focus on
      products that truly had the potential to make it on the market. He also
      wanted products to reach the market faster, and for the scientists to
      think more like consumers as they came up with their new ideas. Many 3M
      employees generally embraced McNerney's vision as well as the end
      result. As McNerney told John S. McClenahen of 
      
        Industry Week
      
      , "Retaining our culture of innovation—and, in fact,
      nurturing it—is a big part of what I am trying to get done with my
      team here [at 3M]. And that directly supports the organic growth [of the
      company]."
    

      McNerney's reorganization of 3M paid off. While 3M faced many
      economic difficulties during his tenure, he had the support of Wall Street
      analysts who believed that the company, which had always been profitable
      would continue to be so. Noting the many successes of the health-care arm
      of the company, he wanted to add more treatments and other products to its
      line of pharmaceuticals, as well as grow the display and graphics
      division. McNerney hoped to expand 3M by acquisition, but only if the
      right business became available. In 2003, for example, he bought the
      precision lens business of Corning for $680 million. In 2004, 3M posted
      record sales of $4 billion and profits of $3 billion. McNerney was named
      one of the best managers of 2003 by 
      
        BusinessWeek
      
       and CEO of the year by 
      
        Industry Week
      
       in 2004.
    

      In addition to running 3M, McNerney served on the board of directors for
      several companies. He joined Boeing's board in 2001. The $52
      billion company produced commercial and military airplanes and jets as
      well as defense systems, electronic systems, missiles, satellites,
      information systems, and communications systems. By 2004, Boeing was
      considering McNerney as a potential CEO. McNerney was offered the job
      twice, but told the company he was not interested in leaving 3M. However,
      in the spring of 2005, McNerney had a sudden change of heart. He told Jeff
      Bailey of the 
      
        New York Times
      
      , "I realized that the job was about to go away, and I realized I
      did want it, and that 3M could live without me." McNerney left 3M
      and joined Boeing as its president, CEO, and chairman of the board in July
      of 2005.
    

      The job McNerney faced at Boeing was similar to that of 3M's in the
      beginning. The company was already profitable. In addition, it was
      generally on the right financial and strategic path in McNerney's
      opinion. McNerney had to fix the bureaucracy and a lingering negative
      corporate culture. The last CEO, Harry Stoneciper, had been forced out
      because of ethical questions, which also had to be addressed. In addition,
      Boeing had acquired three companies between 1996 and 2000 which had yet to
      be fully integrated.
    

      The move to Boeing also allowed McNerney to return to one of his childhood
      homes: Chicago. He did not plan to leave Boeing before retirement, telling
      Dominic Gates of the 
      
        Seattle Times
      
      , "I certainly view this as my last job." Regarding
      McNerney's hiring as Boeing's leader, outgoing Boeing
      chairman Lewis Platt told Stanley Holmes of 
      
        BusinessWeek Online
      
      , "Jim met all the board's criteria. He is, in the unanimous
      judgment of our board members, the ideal person to lead Boeing. Jim wins
      respect for his integrity, ethical leadership, and personal business style
      wherever he goes."

      ■ W. James McNerney was the first outsider to head 3M in the
      conglomerate's 100-year history. His success in this role cemented
      McNerney's reputation as one of America's most respected
      business leaders. An executive at General Electric since 1982 McNerney was
      one of CEO Jack Welch's leading protégés, a star of
      the highly vaunted GE leadership development system. McNerney's
      public profile soared in 2000, when he became one of the three contenders
      in the race to become CEO when Welch retired. When the position went to
      Jeffrey R. Immelt, McNerney accepted the offer to move to 3M.

      Some observers predicted that McNerney's desire to import GE
      methods into 3M would clash with the culture of innovation and
      independence that was 3M's hallmark. However, McNerney's
      managerial qualities enabled him to instigate profound changes in the
      company while largely maintaining the trust of employees. McNerney was
      widely praised by staff and analysts as a dynamic and effective leader.
    

      EARLY CAREER
    

      McNerney attended Yale University, where he was on the baseball team with
      George W. Bush, and then Harvard Business School. After graduation,
      McNerney's first position was with Procter & Gamble, a
      company famous for its consumer products such as Pampers disposable
      diapers and Tide laundry detergent. At Procter & Gamble, McNerney
      worked in brand
       management for Ivory soap. He then moved to the management consultancy
      firm McKinsey & Company for four years.
    

      GE TRAINING GROUND
    

      In 1982 McNerney joined GE as general manager of GE Mobile Communications.
      Over the next 18 years he held seven positions at GE. Such movement was
      typical of the GE leadership development model, whereby promising managers
      moved from job to job every two or three years. The aim was to provide
      managers with diverse experience and exposure. By the time McNerney was
      named president and CEO of GE Aircraft Engines in September 1997, it had
      become obvious to observers that he was being groomed as a possible
      successor to Welch. McNerney developed a reputation as a skilled team
      builder and proved his ability to grow the businesses with which he was
      involved at GE. In particular, during McNerney's time as CEO at GE
      Aircraft Engines, revenue increased from $6.3 billion, the 1996 figure, to
      $10.6 billion in 1999. Profits increased from $1.2 billion to $2.1
      billion. With McNerney at the helm, GE Aircraft Engines became the second
      largest profit-making division in GE, behind GE Capital. A major success
      during this time was restoration of the relationship between GE and
      Boeing, which led to a deal whereby GE90 engines were supplied to Boeing
      777 jets. Boeing executives cited McNerney's sincerity, focus, and
      decisive, hands-on style as key factors in his success. Although he likely
      received many lucrative offers from outside GE, McNerney was committed to
      staying in the race for the top job.
    

      OUTSIDER AT 3M
    

      When Immelt was named Welch's successor in November 2000, McNerney
      and the third candidate, Robert J. Nardelli, became the most hotly
      recruited executives in corporate America. As a star of the GE system,
      McNerney faced extreme expectations of success. The day McNerney was named
      3M's next CEO, replacing the retiring Livio D. DeSimone, the price
      of 3M shares jumped 11 percent. Some observers were skeptical about
      whether the GE "hotshots" could perform outside the confines
      of GE, and there were doubts about whether a company as insular as 3M
      would accept an outsider.
    

      3M, established in 1902 as the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company,
      had a long tradition of achieving innovation by allowing its researchers
      the independence to pursue their projects without interference from
      management. This approach had produced thousands of successful products,
      including household names such as Scotch tape, Scotchguard fabric
      protector, and Post-It notes. 3M leaders had always been chosen from
      within the company and were therefore largely committed to protecting the
      existing company culture. In the late 1990s, however, economic conditions
      changed. Although still a sound performer, 3M had been affected by
      weakening overseas markets, which had a negative effect on revenue. In
      particular, the 1997–1998 downturn in the Asian economies hurt 3M,
      as did the high value of the U.S. dollar in 1996–2000. The
      company's share price also slipped as the U.S. stock market came to
      the end of a 10-year growth period. In addition, analysts believed that
      the 3M leadership lacked dynamism and that the venerable company was
      underperforming.
    

      3M OR "3E"?
    

      McNerney's mandate when he arrived at 3M was to reinvigorate the
      company. In particular, he aimed to reestablish the company as a growth
      venture with double-digit growth figures, whereas 3M had been achieving
      approximately 5 percent. McNerney focused his strategy on initiatives in
      five key areas: sourcing, indirect costs, e-productivity, 3M Acceleration,
      and Six Sigma. McNerney faced the difficult task of increasing efficiency
      and discipline in business while not stifling the innovation for which 3M
      was famous. One of McNerney's first moves as CEO was to order a
      global restructuring that cost approximately six thousand jobs,
      approximately 7 percent of the total workforce. Because this approach
      seemed to mirror that of Welch, infamous for his job cuts at GE, there
      were fears that McNerney was trying to turn 3M into "3E."
      Another profound change that raised fears of a GE takeover was
      McNerney's drive to implement Six Sigma into 3M. Six Sigma was the
      management method developed at Motorola in the early 1980s to eliminate
      inefficiencies and errors. The process was adopted by Welch and expanded
      to all parts of GE. McNerney also imported the GE system of grading
      employees to identify and reward performance, a program quite alien to the
      3M culture. In addition, McNerney embarked on a major program of
      acquisitions as part of the aim of increasing sales growth at 3M. GE had
      been adept at integrating new business, but analysts questioned
      3M's lack of experience in this area.
    

      A crucial part of McNerney's strategy was his 3M Acceleration
      initiative, which targeted the research and development culture at 3M. In
      a company that prided itself on its independent and unconventional
      research culture, this program struck at the heart of the company's
      values. Before McNerney's arrival, research and development was
      spread equally across the various business divisions. This style was based
      on the premise that all divisions should be encouraged to innovate and
      grow and that great things could arise from the most unprepossessing
      beginnings. The purpose of the acceleration program was to focus resources
      on projects that looked promising and to cull projects that did not. Some
      observers and employees feared that in modifying 3M's eclectic
      approach to fostering innovation, McNerney risked destroying the very
      elements that had made 3M great.
    

      MANAGING CULTURAL CHANGE
    

      From the outset of his tenure as CEO at 3M, McNerney was careful to
      emphasize he was trying to improve the existing 3M culture, not replace it
      with the GE culture. In an article in 
      
        Fortune
      
      , McNerney was quoted as saying, "I'm not showing up at 3M
      with a cultural tool kit that I'm going to transplant"
      (January 8, 2001). Several factors in McNerney's management
      approach allayed fears of a GE takeover. He did not arrive at 3M with a
      band of GE executives in tow and instead emphasized the quality of the
      people already at 3M. As a result, 3M staff accepted the concept that they
      were the ones driving change. Many 3M managers noted that McNerney,
      instead of dictating changes, encouraged the managers to recognize
      3M's assets and identify opportunities. Some of the staff welcomed
      the accompanying sense of rejuvenation. As one senior employee said in an
      interview in 
      
        Fortune
      
      , "He's delivered a very consistent message. There's
      a sense of speed and a sense of urgency" (August 12, 2002). The
      ability to clearly communicate his vision for the company and empower his
      employees was McNerney's main asset during the initial period of
      transition at 3M. Many observers cited McNerney's low-key style and
      lack of arrogance as important factors in his success. In the age of the
      celebrity CEO, McNerney preferred to avoid the spotlight and instead
      concentrated on building relationships with those around him at 3M.
    

      By the beginning of 2004 McNerney had moved out of the shadow of Welch and
      GE. Financial indicators ensured general optimism about the success of
      McNerney's strategy at 3M. Revenue increased 11.6 percent, to $18.2
      billion in 2003, and net income increased 21.7 percent to $2.4 billion.
      The value of 3M stock increased 38 percent over 2003. In late 2003 rumors
      that McNerney would head Boeing were proved wrong when he announced he
      would be staying with 3M. Business analysts agreed that McNerney's
      work at 3M was not over, and most observers remained uncommitted about
      whether Six Sigma and 3M Acceleration had improved or detracted from
      3M's traditional strengths. Nevertheless, the initial success of
      McNerney's tenure at 3M resulted in his being held up as an example
      of the benefits of injecting new blood into long-established companies.
      McNerney's challenge in 2004 was to prove that his business
      strategy had improved 3M's organic growth rate—the growth in
      sales revenue from products developed within 3M as opposed to those
      acquired from outside businesses. The outcome would indicate whether
      McNerney's drive for efficiency and discipline was compatible with
      the 3M culture of innovation. In 2004 McNerney was on the boards of
      directors of Boeing, Procter & Gamble, and the Greater Twin Cities
      United Way.

"He's not afraid to do the hard things - cutting 
factories, reallocating resources from here to there. Those are decisions that 
have to be made...on an economic basis."
- Clay Hoes, a stock analyst at American Express 
			Financial Advisors in Minneapolis, in 2002.1
"3M people wake up every morning thinking 
			about what new product they can bring to market. Innovation is in 
			their DNA - and if I kill that entrepreneurial spirit I will have 
			failed. My job is to build on that strength, corral and focus it."
- James McNerney, the then CEO of 3M, in 2002.2
 "I could see him (Jim McNerney) doing 
			anything."
- Jack Welch, former CEO of the General Electric 
			Company, in 2004.3
3M's New CEO




In December 2005, 3M Company (3M) announced the appointment of George Buckley 
(Buckley)4 as its new CEO. Buckley took 
over from board member Robert Morrison, who had been acting as the interim CEO 
after his predecessor W. James McNerney Jr. (McNerney) left in July 2005 to 
become the CEO of the Boeing Company (Boeing).

When McNerney joined 3M in late 2000, he was the first outsider to become the 
CEO of the company in almost a century. Before joining 3M, McNerney had been the 
CEO of General Electric Company's (GE) Aircraft Engines division.


 




 At the end of his career at GE, McNerney had also been part of the three-way 
	race to succeed the company's legendary CEO Jack Welch, when the latter 
	retired in 2000. After losing to Jeffrey Immelt (Immelt) in the succession 
	race, McNerney accepted the offer made by 3M's board.






	3M was a diversified company known for its innovativeness. Over the years, 
	it had nurtured an egalitarian culture that valued creativity in its 
	employees. This was thought to be the main reason behind the company's 
	success in coming out with new products on a regular basis through the 
	years. However, by the 1990s, 3M's performance had started declining. 
	Although the company continued to introduce new products, few made an impact 
	on the market. Consequently, most of the company's earnings were coming from 
	tried and tested products that had been launched several years earlier. The 
	lack of new products soon became a matter of concern for 3M's top managers.

BREAKING NEWS SILVER MEDAL TIE FOR U.S. SHOW JUMPING AT CSIO5* AACHEN!!

  
 







USET Foundation Elects W. James McNerney, Jr., President and CEO and William H. Weeks, Jr., Vice President
Jan 24, 2017 | Events, Headlines
 

Wellington, Fla. – Jan. 24, 2017 – At the annual meeting of the United States Equestrian Team (USET) Foundation, Saturday, Jan. 21, in Wellington, Florida, the board of trustees elected W. James McNerney, Jr. as CEO and president and William H. Weeks, Jr. as vice president. These individuals will serve as officers of the corporation.
W. James McNerney, Jr. is the newly elected president and CEO of the USET Foundation.
W. James McNerney, Jr. – W. James (Jim) McNerney, Jr. served as the USET Foundation’s vice president prior to being elected president and is active in the equestrian community through his family’s long-standing involvement in show jumping. McNerney and his wife, Haity, have supported show jumping advancement and events, with a focus on young rider development. In addition, the McNerneys have owned young and grand prix-level mounts ridden by Kent Farrington. Their daughters Julia and Hilary are also active competitors in the hunter and jumper divisions.
McNerney joined Boeing as chairman, president and CEO on July 1, 2005. He served as president until December 2013, CEO until July 2015 and chairman until March 2016.
During his tenure, the company recaptured the global lead in commercial airplane deliveries with steady increases in production and a comprehensive update of its product line; maintained a strong position in defense markets despite a downturn in U.S. military spending; restored Boeing’s historic leadership in human spaceflight with major new program wins; and expanded its engineering and manufacturing footprint inside and outside the United States.
Also, with a relentless focus on internal productivity to fund investments in innovation and growth, Boeing’s financial performance steadily improved under McNerney, with revenue rising 73 percent to a record $90.8 billion in 2014 from $52.5 billion in 2004, the year before he became CEO. Backlog and earnings per share tripled over the period, also to record levels.
Before Boeing, McNerney served as chairman of the board and CEO of 3M, then a $20 billion global technology company with leading positions in electronics, telecommunications, industrial, consumer and office products, health care, safety and other businesses. He joined 3M in 2000 after 19 years at the General Electric Company.
McNerney joined General Electric (GE) in 1982. There, he held top executive positions including president and CEO of GE Aircraft Engines and GE Lighting; president of GE Asia-Pacific; president and CEO of GE Electrical Distribution and Control; executive vice president of GE Capital, one of the world’s largest financial service companies; and president of GE Information Services. Prior to joining GE, McNerney worked at Procter & Gamble and McKinsey & Co., Inc.
In addition, McNerney was named the 2015 CEO of the Year by Chief Executive magazine and the 2008 National Management Association’s Executive of the Year. He received the Juran Medal from the American Society for Quality (ASQ), the Wilson Center’s Woodrow Wilson Award for Corporate Citizenship, the inaugural Turning Point Award from the U.S. Army War College Foundation, the Semper Fidelis Award from the Marine Corps Scholarship Foundation, the John W. Dixon Award from the Association of the U.S. Army and an honorary doctor of science degree from Cranfield University.
By appointment of U.S. President Barack Obama, McNerney serves on the Kennedy Center board of trustees. He previously chaired the president’s Export Council and serves on the board of trustees of the Washington, D.C.-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, a bipartisan, nonprofit organization that seeks to advance global security and prosperity. He is a past chair and previous member of the executive committee of Business Roundtable, an association of chief executive officers of leading U.S. companies. He also is a past chair of the US-China Business Council.
McNerney is a director of Procter & Gamble, a director of IBM, a member of The Field Museum board of trustees in Chicago, a trustee of Northwestern University, the chair of the Northwestern Memorial HealthCare board and of the Kellogg School dean’s advisory board. He also is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and an honorary fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society.
A native of Providence, Rhode Island, McNerney earned a B.A. degree from Yale University in 1971 and an MBA from Harvard University in 1975. McNerney and his wife Haity reside in Lake Forest, Illinois, and Wellington, Florida.
William H. Weeks, Jr. is the newly elected vice president of the USET Foundation.
William H. Weeks, Jr. – Bill Weeks is a long-time horseman and owner of Sasco Creek Farm in Southport, Connecticut, and Wellington, Florida. Sasco Creek Farm is the home of grand prix mount Madison, a two-time Grand Prix Association Horse of the Year. Weeks has been a member of the board of trustees for the USET Foundation, serves as the second vice president on the National Horse Show’s executive board and is the director and chairman at Taylor Harris Insurance Services. Weeks’ wife and three daughters are all avid equestrians who compete on the national and international levels. Weeks also has years of experience as a successful businessman as the general partner of fresh fruit growers L&S Cranberry and director of Vermont Spirits, a premium vodka distillery.

Education[edit]
McNerney graduated from New Trier High School in Winnetka, Illinois in 1967.[6][7] He attended Yale University, receiving a B.A. degree in 1971. While at Yale, he was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon Fraternity. At Yale, he excelled in baseball and hockey. After graduating from Yale, he worked for a year at both British United Provident and G.D. Searle, LLC, then attended Harvard Business School, receiving a Master of Business Administration in 1975.[8]
Career[edit]
McNerney began his business career at Procter & Gamble in 1975, working in brand management.[9] He worked as a management consultant at McKinsey from 1978 to 1982.
McNerney joined General Electric in 1982. There, he held top executive positions including president and CEO of GE Aircraft Engines and GE Lighting; president of GE Asia-Pacific; president and CEO of GE Electrical Distribution and Control; executive vice president of GE Capital, one of the world's largest financial service companies; and president of GE Information Services. McNerney competed with Bob Nardelli and Jeff Immelt to succeed the retiring Jack Welch as chairman and CEO of General Electric. When Immelt won the three-way race, McNerney and Nardelli left GE (as was Welch's plan); McNerney was hired by 3M in 2001.
From 2001 to 2005, McNerney held the position as chairman of the board and CEO of 3M, a $20 billion global industrial company with leading positions in electronics, telecommunications, industrial, consumer and office products, health care, safety and other businesses.
Boeing[edit]
On June 30, 2005 The Boeing Company hired McNerney as the Chairman, President and CEO. McNerney oversaw the strategic direction of the Chicago-based, $61.5 billion aerospace company. With more than 160,500 employees, Boeing is the largest manufacturer of commercial airliners and military aircraft, with capabilities in aircraft, rotorcraft, electronic and defense systems, missiles, satellites and advanced information and communications systems.

Positions[edit]
McNerney had been a member of the Boeing board of directors since 2001. He is also a member of the board of directors of Procter & Gamble and IBM. He served as Chairman of The Business Council in 2007 and 2008.[15] He is a current member of the Northwestern University Board of Trustees, is a Trustee at the Center for Strategic and International Studies[16] and served as Chairman of the President's Export Council, appointed by President Barack Obama.[17]

Education[edit]
McNerney graduated from New Trier High School in Winnetka, Illinois in 1967.[6][7] He attended Yale University, receiving a B.A. degree in 1971. While at Yale, he was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon Fraternity. At Yale, he excelled in baseball and hockey. After graduating from Yale, he worked for a year at both British United Provident and G.D. Searle, LLC, then attended Harvard Business School, receiving a Master of Business Administration in 1975.[8]
Career[edit]
McNerney began his business career at Procter & Gamble in 1975, working in brand management.[9] He worked as a management consultant at McKinsey from 1978 to 1982.
McNerney joined General Electric in 1982. There, he held top executive positions including president and CEO of GE Aircraft Engines and GE Lighting; president of GE Asia-Pacific; president and CEO of GE Electrical Distribution and Control; executive vice president of GE Capital, one of the world's largest financial service companies; and president of GE Information Services. McNerney competed with Bob Nardelli and Jeff Immelt to succeed the retiring Jack Welch as chairman and CEO of General Electric. When Immelt won the three-way race, McNerney and Nardelli left GE (as was Welch's plan); McNerney was hired by 3M in 2001.
From 2001 to 2005, McNerney held the position as chairman of the board and CEO of 3M, a $20 billion global industrial company with leading positions in electronics, telecommunications, industrial, consumer and office products, health care, safety and other businesses.

More single-aisle, fewer regional and jumbo aircraft in Boeing's forecast | CAPALoading3-Sep-2010 4:12 PMMore single-aisle, fewer regional and jumbo aircraft in Boeing's forecastThe retirement of older, single-aisle and regional jets will drive the majority of aircraft purchases in North America, according to a forecast issued yesterday by Boeing. The manufacturer said that North American carriers – the US and Canada – will take delivery of about 7,300 new aircraft over the next two decades for a value of USD700 million.Not surprisingly, Boeing predicts a decline in demand for regional jets in North America and expects airlines to move to larger turboprops and single-aisle mainliners. It cited high fuel prices, intensified competition and the superior efficiencies of larger single-aisles as reason for the decline in regional aircraft demand. It expects regional aircraft will account for only 4%, or 800 aircraft, of total aircraft investment over the next 20 years, nearly all for replacement.
The North American fleet will rise from 6,590 aircraft today to about 9,000 by 2029 with single-aisle aircraft growing from 56% of the total North American fleet to 71% of the fleet. The main concerns of North American airlines centre on age, weight and fuel consumption as well as the impact on climate change. Large aircraft – 747 and larger – will not enjoy growing demand in the market with Boeing predicting demand for only about 40 units – 1% of total investment – all of which will be freighters.
"North America is a large, mature market, and we expect passenger traffic for the region to grow at a modest rate of 3.4 percent," said Boeing Commercial Airplanes Vice President of Marketing Randy Tinseth, who released the forecast in Montreal. "The fast-paced lifestyles in Canada and the US require rapid, frequent and reliable coast-to-coast and inter-regional transportation. Driven by this demand, nearly three-quarters of the new deliveries over the next 20 years will be single-aisle airplanes."
Tinseth reported the company sees improvement in airline focus on fleet renewal plans. Small and mid-sized twin-aisle aircraft will constitute 19% of the fleet by 2029 while twin-aisle fleets will continue expanding international point-to-point services to a wider range of airport pairs and frequencies. The company expects demand for 1,180 new twin aisles and suggests the sector will account for only 16% of the total aircraft demand in North America in the next 20 years. However, not unexpectedly, they will account for 37% of overall aircraft investment.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

The key to making acquisitions is being ready because you really never know when the right big one is going to come along.
James McNerney

Key



















I start with people's growth, my own growth included. I don't start with the company's strategy or products. I start with people's growth because I believe that if the people who are running and participating in a company grow, then the company's growth will in many respects take care of itself.

I was lucky to have a great dad.
James McNerney


Dad,
Great,
Lucky



















There was no question that in our house doing well, doing it the right way, school, sports - there was an expectation. One of the things I've taken away from that is that I'm unafraid to expect a fair amount from people. It makes them so much better - you're doing them a disservice if you don't.
James McNerney

My sports were team sports: ice hockey and baseball. The whole team dynamic is similar in business. Leadership is earned - the captain earns that role; it's not because he's the coach's son. These are all things we know, but in today's world, it's not a bad idea to remind ourselves.
