                Clover is the quickest way to judge what rep behaviors drive the best results on the phone, and where the reps are missing the mark. Using your call data, we automatically identify the winning behaviors your best reps use in successful deals, and help you spread those best practices to the rest of the team. All without you listening to a single phone call. 

Calls account for 70% of customer conversations globally, as compared to email which is only 10%. There are many multi billion dollar companies in the email optimization space, but nobody quite owns the voice space because until very recently NLP (specifically speech to text) and Machine Learning weren't there. With the recent advancements in both ML and NLP/NLU it is now possible to do what we're doing at scale....
