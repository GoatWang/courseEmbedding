History[edit]
W.R. Grace and Company was founded in 1854, in Peru, by William Russell Grace, who left Ireland due to the potato famine, and traveled to South America with his father and family. He went first to Peru to work as a ship's chandler for the firm of Bryce and Company, to the merchantmen harvesting guano (bird droppings), used as a fertilizer and gunpowder ingredient due to its high levels of phosphorus and nitrogen.
His brother Michael joined the business and in 1865 the company name was changed to Grace Brothers & Co. The company set up head office operations in New York City in 1865. Working in fertilizer and machinery, the company was formally chartered in 1872, and incorporated in 1895.[5]
Incorporation[edit]
There are two accounts of the incorporation date of W.R. Grace & Co. According to a New York Times account the company was incorporated, as part of estate and successor planning, in 1895. The three brothers consolidated most of their holdings into a new private company, incorporated in West Virginia, called W.R. Grace & Company. The consolidation involved W.R. Grace & Co. of New York, Grace Brothers & Co. of Lima, Peru, Grace & Co. of Valparaiso Chile, William R. Grace & Co. of London, and J. W. Grace & Co of San Francisco.[6]
According to its website, W.R. Grace & Co. was incorporated in Connecticut in 1899. The listed capital of $6 million did not include Grace Brothers & Co. Limited in London or its branches in San Francisco, Lima and Callao, Peru, nor in Valparaiso, Santiago, and Concepción, Chile.[7]
J. Louis Schaefer, who joined the company as a boy, would play a key role in not only W.R. Grace & Company, in which he became a vice president, but also as president of Grace National Bank. Schaefer would be a co-executor of the estate of Michael Grace with William's son and corporate successor, Joseph P. Grace. J. Louis Schaefer died in 1927.[8]
Shipping[edit]




Grace Line WWII poster


At one time, Grace's main business interest was in shipping. To get its products from Peru to North America and Europe, including guano and sugar, and noticing the need for other goods to be traded, William Grace founded a shipping division.[5] Grace Line began service in 1882,[9] with ports of call between Peru and New York. Regular steamship service was established in 1893, with a subsidiary called the New York & Pacific Steamship Co., that operated under the British flag. Ships built outside the United States prior to 1905 were banned from US registry. US-flag service began in 1912 with the Atlantic and Pacific Steamship Company. The activities of both companies and the parent firm were consolidated into the Grace Steamship Company beginning in 1916. The firm originally specialized in traffic to the west coast of South America; then later expanded into the Caribbean.
In 1916, Grace acquired a controlling interest in the Pacific Mail Steamship Company. In 1921, Pacific received five 535 ft. President class ships from the United States Shipping Board for transpacific operation. In 1923, the US Shipping board decided to place the five ships up for bid and Dollar Shipping Company won the bid. With no large ships for the transpacific operations Grace sold the Pacific Mail, its registered name, and goodwill to Dollar. Now without a transpacific service, Grace did not need the six intercoastal freighters and sold them off to the American Hawaiian Line. At this time Grace formed a new entity, the Panama Mail Steamship Company, to operate the smaller ships that were formerly owned and used by the Pacific Mail in the Central American trade. These ships were not involved in the sale to Dollar.[10]
On the death of William R. Grace in 1904, he was succeeded by William L. Sauders as company President followed by Joseph Peter Grace, Sr. (1872–1950) who became president in 1907. In 1938 the Colombian Line merged with Grace Line bringing an end to the Colombian Line.[11] During World War II Grace Lines operated numerous transports for the U.S. War Shipping Administration.[12]
J. Peter Grace, Jr. took over management of the company after his father suffered a stroke in 1945. After the war the Grace line operated 23 ships totaling 188,000 gross tons, and an additional 14 more on bareboat charters. In 1954 the company bought Davison Chemical Company (founded by William T. Davison as Davison, Kettlewell & Company in 1832), and the Dewey & Almy Chemical Company (founded in 1919 by Bradley Dewey and Charles Almy). In 1960 Grace Line, inspired by the pioneering efforts of Sea-Land Service, Matson Navigation, and Seatrain Lines, sought to begin containerizing its South American cargo operations by converting the conventional freighters Santa Eliana and Santa Leonor into fully cellular container ships. However, the effort was stymied by the opposition of longshoremen in New York and Venezuela and the ships were repeatedly laid up idle and were ultimately sold to the domestic container line Sea-Land Service in 1964.[13][14] In 1963 Grace made a second attempt to containerize its South American trade when it ordered the four M-class combination passenger-cargo ships Santa Magdalaena, Santa Maria, Santa Mariana and Santa Mercedes with partial cellular holds, but they were no more successful as mixing conventional break-bulk cargo and containers in the same ship negated the operating economies that full containerization promised.[15]
The company bought a 53% stake in Miller Brewing in 1966, for $36 million; Lorraine Mulberger sold the stake for religious reasons.[16] It sold the Miller stake in 1969 to Philip Morris for $130 million, topping a deal with PepsiCo for $120 million.[17][18][19] In 1969 Grace also exited the shipping business to concentrate on its chemical and diversification ventures. Grace Line was sold and merged into Prudential Line in 1970, which was renamed Prudential Grace Line, and was itself in turn taken over by Delta Lines in 1978, thereby extinguishing the name Grace in ocean shipping.[20] In 1987, by siting a can sealing plant in Shanghai, Grace became the first wholly foreign-owned company to do business in The People's Republic of China.
Airline[edit]
In 1928, Grace and Pan American Airways jointly formed Pan American-Grace Airways known as Panagra, establishing the first air link between the North and South America, that began operation in 1929.[21]
Headquarters[edit]
The company has its headquarters in Columbia, an unincorporated census-designated place in Howard County, Maryland.[22][23] Although W.R. Grace commissioned the Grace Building in New York City, built in 1971, the company no longer has any offices at that location.
Previously the company had its headquarters in Boca Raton, Florida.[24][25] Prior to its closing, the Boca Raton headquarters had about 130 employees. On January 27, 1999 it announced it was moving its administrative staff to the Columbia office and closing the Boca Raton headquarters.[26] About 40 of the employees went to Columbia, and some employees went to Cambridge, Massachusetts.[24] In 2014, the company emerged from a 13-year bankruptcy case stemming from asbestos claims, and immediately built a new 90,000sqft headquarters building on its 160-acre Columbia campus.[27]

Contamination incidents[edit]
W.R. Grace and Company has been involved in a number of controversial incidents of proven and alleged corporate crimes, including exposing workers and residents of an entire town to asbestos contamination in Libby[34] and Troy, Montana, water contamination (the basis of the book and film A Civil Action) in Woburn, Massachusetts, and an Acton, Massachusetts, Superfund site.
Asbestos[edit]
While Grace no longer makes asbestos-related products, W.R. Grace and Company has faced more than 270,000 asbestos-related lawsuits, of which 150,000 have been settled or dismissed and 120,000 remain.[35]
After asbestos injury claims unexpectedly nearly doubled in 2000, W.R. Grace & Company filed for bankruptcy protection in 2001. The United States Department of Justice alleged that Grace had transferred $4 to 5 billion to subsidiary companies that it had recently purchased, shortly before declaring bankruptcy. Justice Department attorneys alleged that this amounted to a fraudulent transfer of money in order to protect Grace from civil suits related to asbestos. The bankruptcy court ordered the companies to return nearly $1 billion to Grace, which will remain as part of the assets to consider in the bankruptcy hearings.
Asbestos court case[edit]
In 2005, the U.S. Department of Justice began criminal proceedings against W.R. Grace. On February 7, 2005, the department announced that a grand jury in Montana indicted W.R. Grace and seven current and former Grace executives for knowingly endangering residents of Libby, Montana, and concealing information about the health effects of its asbestos mining operations. According to the indictment, W.R. Grace and its executives, as far back as the 1970s, attempted to conceal information about the adverse health effects of the company’s vermiculite mining operations and distribution of vermiculite in the Libby, Montana, community. The defendants are also accused of obstructing the government’s cleanup efforts and wire fraud. To date, according to the indictment, approximately 1,200 residents of Libby area have been identified as suffering from some kind of asbestos-related abnormality.[36]
The criminal trial began in February 2009 after years of pretrial proceedings which reached the United States Supreme Court.[37] By the time the trial was set to begin, one of the defendants, Alan Stringer, had died of cancer. David Uhlmann, a former top environmental crimes prosecutor has been quoted as saying about W.R. Grace & Co.: "There's never been a case where so many people were sickened or killed by environmental crime." The W.R. Grace case long festered in the court system on a 10-count indictment including charges of wire fraud and obstruction of justice. W.R. Grace has voluntarily paid millions of dollars in medical bills for 900 Libby residents.[citation needed]
On Friday, May 8, 2009, W.R. Grace & Co. was acquitted of charges that it knowingly harmed the people of Libby, Montana. It was also acquitted of subsequently participating in any cover-up. Fred Festa, chairman, president and CEO said in a statement, "the company worked hard to keep the operations in compliance with the laws and standards of the day.[citation needed]
In popular culture[edit]

The movie A Civil Action, starring John Travolta, was based on the Grace groundwater contamination law suits in Woburn, MA.
The PBS television show P.O.V., which highlights independent films, in August 2007 premiered the movie Libby, Montana that documents the thousands of people in Libby, Montana, that have been exposed to and are suffering the effects of exposure to asbestos. The show also discusses the criminal indictments of many Grace executives for covering up the asbestos related illnesses and deaths.
PBS also aired "Dust to Dust", a documentary produced by Michael Brown Productions, Inc. in 2002. "Dust to Dust" reports on the more than 200 people who have died from asbestos exposure in Libby, Montana. The film focuses on the plights of several of these individuals and the damage done over almost 30 years while the mine was operated by W.R. Grace.
NPR ran a piece on their show All Things Considered discussing the criminal charges against W.R. Grace. A U.S. attorney general alleges that the company and managers of the mine in Libby, Montana, knew about the dangers of the asbestos they were dumping into the air for over 20 years.[38]
A University of Montana photojournalism master's thesis, Living with Grace, explored the ramifications of living with asbestosis, a disease associated with the vermiculite mine run by W.R. Grace.
On February 19, 2008, the radio show Here and Now broadcast a story about the film Libby, Montana, which details the asbestos contamination in the town of that name.[39]
On April 22, 2009, the television and radio program Democracy Now! broadcast two segments on the trial of W.R. Grace and some of its employees related to the asbestos contamination in Libby, Montana.[40][41] Democracy Now! also broadcast a follow-up interview on May 12, 2009 with activist Gayla Benefield and Andrea Peacock, a Montana independent political and environmental journalist.[42] This interview focused on reactions to the not-guilty verdict in the federal trial, where W.R. Grace and three former executives were acquitted on charges of knowingly exposing workers and townspeople to asbestos, and subsequently participating in a cover-up.

Neem patent[edit]
In 1995, the European Patent Office (EPO) granted a patent on an anti-fungal product derived from the neem tree to the United States Department of Agriculture and W. R. Grace.[43] The Indian government challenged the patent when it was granted, claiming that the process for which the patent had been granted had been in use in India for more than 2,000 years. In 2000, the EPO ruled in India's favour, but W. R. Grace appealed, claiming that prior art about the product had never been published in a scientific journal. On 8 March 2005, that appeal was lost and the EPO revoked the Neem patent.[43]

History[edit]
W.R. Grace and Company was founded in 1854, in Peru, by William Russell Grace, who left Ireland due to the potato famine, and traveled to South America with his father and family. He went first to Peru to work as a ship's chandler for the firm of Bryce and Company, to the merchantmen harvesting guano (bird droppings), used as a fertilizer and gunpowder ingredient due to its high levels of phosphorus and nitrogen.
His brother Michael joined the business and in 1865 the company name was changed to Grace Brothers & Co. The company set up head office operations in New York City in 1865. Working in fertilizer and machinery, the company was formally chartered in 1872, and incorporated in 1895.[5]
Incorporation[edit]
There are two accounts of the incorporation date of W.R. Grace & Co. According to a New York Times account the company was incorporated, as part of estate and successor planning, in 1895. The three brothers consolidated most of their holdings into a new private company, incorporated in West Virginia, called W.R. Grace & Company. The consolidation involved W.R. Grace & Co. of New York, Grace Brothers & Co. of Lima, Peru, Grace & Co. of Valparaiso Chile, William R. Grace & Co. of London, and J. W. Grace & Co of San Francisco.[6]
According to its website, W.R. Grace & Co. was incorporated in Connecticut in 1899. The listed capital of $6 million did not include Grace Brothers & Co. Limited in London or its branches in San Francisco, Lima and Callao, Peru, nor in Valparaiso, Santiago, and Concepción, Chile.[7]
J. Louis Schaefer, who joined the company as a boy, would play a key role in not only W.R. Grace & Company, in which he became a vice president, but also as president of Grace National Bank. Schaefer would be a co-executor of the estate of Michael Grace with William's son and corporate successor, Joseph P. Grace. J. Louis Schaefer died in 1927.[8]
Shipping[edit]




Grace Line WWII poster


At one time, Grace's main business interest was in shipping. To get its products from Peru to North America and Europe, including guano and sugar, and noticing the need for other goods to be traded, William Grace founded a shipping division.[5] Grace Line began service in 1882,[9] with ports of call between Peru and New York. Regular steamship service was established in 1893, with a subsidiary called the New York & Pacific Steamship Co., that operated under the British flag. Ships built outside the United States prior to 1905 were banned from US registry. US-flag service began in 1912 with the Atlantic and Pacific Steamship Company. The activities of both companies and the parent firm were consolidated into the Grace Steamship Company beginning in 1916. The firm originally specialized in traffic to the west coast of South America; then later expanded into the Caribbean.
In 1916, Grace acquired a controlling interest in the Pacific Mail Steamship Company. In 1921, Pacific received five 535 ft. President class ships from the United States Shipping Board for transpacific operation. In 1923, the US Shipping board decided to place the five ships up for bid and Dollar Shipping Company won the bid. With no large ships for the transpacific operations Grace sold the Pacific Mail, its registered name, and goodwill to Dollar. Now without a transpacific service, Grace did not need the six intercoastal freighters and sold them off to the American Hawaiian Line. At this time Grace formed a new entity, the Panama Mail Steamship Company, to operate the smaller ships that were formerly owned and used by the Pacific Mail in the Central American trade. These ships were not involved in the sale to Dollar.[10]
On the death of William R. Grace in 1904, he was succeeded by William L. Sauders as company President followed by Joseph Peter Grace, Sr. (1872–1950) who became president in 1907. In 1938 the Colombian Line merged with Grace Line bringing an end to the Colombian Line.[11] During World War II Grace Lines operated numerous transports for the U.S. War Shipping Administration.[12]
J. Peter Grace, Jr. took over management of the company after his father suffered a stroke in 1945. After the war the Grace line operated 23 ships totaling 188,000 gross tons, and an additional 14 more on bareboat charters. In 1954 the company bought Davison Chemical Company (founded by William T. Davison as Davison, Kettlewell & Company in 1832), and the Dewey & Almy Chemical Company (founded in 1919 by Bradley Dewey and Charles Almy). In 1960 Grace Line, inspired by the pioneering efforts of Sea-Land Service, Matson Navigation, and Seatrain Lines, sought to begin containerizing its South American cargo operations by converting the conventional freighters Santa Eliana and Santa Leonor into fully cellular container ships. However, the effort was stymied by the opposition of longshoremen in New York and Venezuela and the ships were repeatedly laid up idle and were ultimately sold to the domestic container line Sea-Land Service in 1964.[13][14] In 1963 Grace made a second attempt to containerize its South American trade when it ordered the four M-class combination passenger-cargo ships Santa Magdalaena, Santa Maria, Santa Mariana and Santa Mercedes with partial cellular holds, but they were no more successful as mixing conventional break-bulk cargo and containers in the same ship negated the operating economies that full containerization promised.[15]
The company bought a 53% stake in Miller Brewing in 1966, for $36 million; Lorraine Mulberger sold the stake for religious reasons.[16] It sold the Miller stake in 1969 to Philip Morris for $130 million, topping a deal with PepsiCo for $120 million.[17][18][19] In 1969 Grace also exited the shipping business to concentrate on its chemical and diversification ventures. Grace Line was sold and merged into Prudential Line in 1970, which was renamed Prudential Grace Line, and was itself in turn taken over by Delta Lines in 1978, thereby extinguishing the name Grace in ocean shipping.[20] In 1987, by siting a can sealing plant in Shanghai, Grace became the first wholly foreign-owned company to do business in The People's Republic of China.
Airline[edit]
In 1928, Grace and Pan American Airways jointly formed Pan American-Grace Airways known as Panagra, establishing the first air link between the North and South America, that began operation in 1929.[21]
Headquarters[edit]
The company has its headquarters in Columbia, an unincorporated census-designated place in Howard County, Maryland.[22][23] Although W.R. Grace commissioned the Grace Building in New York City, built in 1971, the company no longer has any offices at that location.
Previously the company had its headquarters in Boca Raton, Florida.[24][25] Prior to its closing, the Boca Raton headquarters had about 130 employees. On January 27, 1999 it announced it was moving its administrative staff to the Columbia office and closing the Boca Raton headquarters.[26] About 40 of the employees went to Columbia, and some employees went to Cambridge, Massachusetts.[24] In 2014, the company emerged from a 13-year bankruptcy case stemming from asbestos claims, and immediately built a new 90,000sqft headquarters building on its 160-acre Columbia campus.[27]

Contamination incidents[edit]
W.R. Grace and Company has been involved in a number of controversial incidents of proven and alleged corporate crimes, including exposing workers and residents of an entire town to asbestos contamination in Libby[34] and Troy, Montana, water contamination (the basis of the book and film A Civil Action) in Woburn, Massachusetts, and an Acton, Massachusetts, Superfund site.
Asbestos[edit]
While Grace no longer makes asbestos-related products, W.R. Grace and Company has faced more than 270,000 asbestos-related lawsuits, of which 150,000 have been settled or dismissed and 120,000 remain.[35]
After asbestos injury claims unexpectedly nearly doubled in 2000, W.R. Grace & Company filed for bankruptcy protection in 2001. The United States Department of Justice alleged that Grace had transferred $4 to 5 billion to subsidiary companies that it had recently purchased, shortly before declaring bankruptcy. Justice Department attorneys alleged that this amounted to a fraudulent transfer of money in order to protect Grace from civil suits related to asbestos. The bankruptcy court ordered the companies to return nearly $1 billion to Grace, which will remain as part of the assets to consider in the bankruptcy hearings.
Asbestos court case[edit]
In 2005, the U.S. Department of Justice began criminal proceedings against W.R. Grace. On February 7, 2005, the department announced that a grand jury in Montana indicted W.R. Grace and seven current and former Grace executives for knowingly endangering residents of Libby, Montana, and concealing information about the health effects of its asbestos mining operations. According to the indictment, W.R. Grace and its executives, as far back as the 1970s, attempted to conceal information about the adverse health effects of the company’s vermiculite mining operations and distribution of vermiculite in the Libby, Montana, community. The defendants are also accused of obstructing the government’s cleanup efforts and wire fraud. To date, according to the indictment, approximately 1,200 residents of Libby area have been identified as suffering from some kind of asbestos-related abnormality.[36]
The criminal trial began in February 2009 after years of pretrial proceedings which reached the United States Supreme Court.[37] By the time the trial was set to begin, one of the defendants, Alan Stringer, had died of cancer. David Uhlmann, a former top environmental crimes prosecutor has been quoted as saying about W.R. Grace & Co.: "There's never been a case where so many people were sickened or killed by environmental crime." The W.R. Grace case long festered in the court system on a 10-count indictment including charges of wire fraud and obstruction of justice. W.R. Grace has voluntarily paid millions of dollars in medical bills for 900 Libby residents.[citation needed]
On Friday, May 8, 2009, W.R. Grace & Co. was acquitted of charges that it knowingly harmed the people of Libby, Montana. It was also acquitted of subsequently participating in any cover-up. Fred Festa, chairman, president and CEO said in a statement, "the company worked hard to keep the operations in compliance with the laws and standards of the day.[citation needed]

History[edit]
W.R. Grace and Company was founded in 1854, in Peru, by William Russell Grace, who left Ireland due to the potato famine, and traveled to South America with his father and family. He went first to Peru to work as a ship's chandler for the firm of Bryce and Company, to the merchantmen harvesting guano (bird droppings), used as a fertilizer and gunpowder ingredient due to its high levels of phosphorus and nitrogen.
His brother Michael joined the business and in 1865 the company name was changed to Grace Brothers & Co. The company set up head office operations in New York City in 1865. Working in fertilizer and machinery, the company was formally chartered in 1872, and incorporated in 1895.[5]
Incorporation[edit]
There are two accounts of the incorporation date of W.R. Grace & Co. According to a New York Times account the company was incorporated, as part of estate and successor planning, in 1895. The three brothers consolidated most of their holdings into a new private company, incorporated in West Virginia, called W.R. Grace & Company. The consolidation involved W.R. Grace & Co. of New York, Grace Brothers & Co. of Lima, Peru, Grace & Co. of Valparaiso Chile, William R. Grace & Co. of London, and J. W. Grace & Co of San Francisco.[6]
According to its website, W.R. Grace & Co. was incorporated in Connecticut in 1899. The listed capital of $6 million did not include Grace Brothers & Co. Limited in London or its branches in San Francisco, Lima and Callao, Peru, nor in Valparaiso, Santiago, and Concepción, Chile.[7]
J. Louis Schaefer, who joined the company as a boy, would play a key role in not only W.R. Grace & Company, in which he became a vice president, but also as president of Grace National Bank. Schaefer would be a co-executor of the estate of Michael Grace with William's son and corporate successor, Joseph P. Grace. J. Louis Schaefer died in 1927.[8]
Shipping[edit]




Grace Line WWII poster


At one time, Grace's main business interest was in shipping. To get its products from Peru to North America and Europe, including guano and sugar, and noticing the need for other goods to be traded, William Grace founded a shipping division.[5] Grace Line began service in 1882,[9] with ports of call between Peru and New York. Regular steamship service was established in 1893, with a subsidiary called the New York & Pacific Steamship Co., that operated under the British flag. Ships built outside the United States prior to 1905 were banned from US registry. US-flag service began in 1912 with the Atlantic and Pacific Steamship Company. The activities of both companies and the parent firm were consolidated into the Grace Steamship Company beginning in 1916. The firm originally specialized in traffic to the west coast of South America; then later expanded into the Caribbean.
In 1916, Grace acquired a controlling interest in the Pacific Mail Steamship Company. In 1921, Pacific received five 535 ft. President class ships from the United States Shipping Board for transpacific operation. In 1923, the US Shipping board decided to place the five ships up for bid and Dollar Shipping Company won the bid. With no large ships for the transpacific operations Grace sold the Pacific Mail, its registered name, and goodwill to Dollar. Now without a transpacific service, Grace did not need the six intercoastal freighters and sold them off to the American Hawaiian Line. At this time Grace formed a new entity, the Panama Mail Steamship Company, to operate the smaller ships that were formerly owned and used by the Pacific Mail in the Central American trade. These ships were not involved in the sale to Dollar.[10]
On the death of William R. Grace in 1904, he was succeeded by William L. Sauders as company President followed by Joseph Peter Grace, Sr. (1872–1950) who became president in 1907. In 1938 the Colombian Line merged with Grace Line bringing an end to the Colombian Line.[11] During World War II Grace Lines operated numerous transports for the U.S. War Shipping Administration.[12]
J. Peter Grace, Jr. took over management of the company after his father suffered a stroke in 1945. After the war the Grace line operated 23 ships totaling 188,000 gross tons, and an additional 14 more on bareboat charters. In 1954 the company bought Davison Chemical Company (founded by William T. Davison as Davison, Kettlewell & Company in 1832), and the Dewey & Almy Chemical Company (founded in 1919 by Bradley Dewey and Charles Almy). In 1960 Grace Line, inspired by the pioneering efforts of Sea-Land Service, Matson Navigation, and Seatrain Lines, sought to begin containerizing its South American cargo operations by converting the conventional freighters Santa Eliana and Santa Leonor into fully cellular container ships. However, the effort was stymied by the opposition of longshoremen in New York and Venezuela and the ships were repeatedly laid up idle and were ultimately sold to the domestic container line Sea-Land Service in 1964.[13][14] In 1963 Grace made a second attempt to containerize its South American trade when it ordered the four M-class combination passenger-cargo ships Santa Magdalaena, Santa Maria, Santa Mariana and Santa Mercedes with partial cellular holds, but they were no more successful as mixing conventional break-bulk cargo and containers in the same ship negated the operating economies that full containerization promised.[15]
The company bought a 53% stake in Miller Brewing in 1966, for $36 million; Lorraine Mulberger sold the stake for religious reasons.[16] It sold the Miller stake in 1969 to Philip Morris for $130 million, topping a deal with PepsiCo for $120 million.[17][18][19] In 1969 Grace also exited the shipping business to concentrate on its chemical and diversification ventures. Grace Line was sold and merged into Prudential Line in 1970, which was renamed Prudential Grace Line, and was itself in turn taken over by Delta Lines in 1978, thereby extinguishing the name Grace in ocean shipping.[20] In 1987, by siting a can sealing plant in Shanghai, Grace became the first wholly foreign-owned company to do business in The People's Republic of China.
Airline[edit]
In 1928, Grace and Pan American Airways jointly formed Pan American-Grace Airways known as Panagra, establishing the first air link between the North and South America, that began operation in 1929.[21]
Headquarters[edit]
The company has its headquarters in Columbia, an unincorporated census-designated place in Howard County, Maryland.[22][23] Although W.R. Grace commissioned the Grace Building in New York City, built in 1971, the company no longer has any offices at that location.
Previously the company had its headquarters in Boca Raton, Florida.[24][25] Prior to its closing, the Boca Raton headquarters had about 130 employees. On January 27, 1999 it announced it was moving its administrative staff to the Columbia office and closing the Boca Raton headquarters.[26] About 40 of the employees went to Columbia, and some employees went to Cambridge, Massachusetts.[24] In 2014, the company emerged from a 13-year bankruptcy case stemming from asbestos claims, and immediately built a new 90,000sqft headquarters building on its 160-acre Columbia campus.[27]
Subsidiaries and products[edit]

Contamination incidents[edit]
W.R. Grace and Company has been involved in a number of controversial incidents of proven and alleged corporate crimes, including exposing workers and residents of an entire town to asbestos contamination in Libby[34] and Troy, Montana, water contamination (the basis of the book and film A Civil Action) in Woburn, Massachusetts, and an Acton, Massachusetts, Superfund site.
Asbestos[edit]
While Grace no longer makes asbestos-related products, W.R. Grace and Company has faced more than 270,000 asbestos-related lawsuits, of which 150,000 have been settled or dismissed and 120,000 remain.[35]
After asbestos injury claims unexpectedly nearly doubled in 2000, W.R. Grace & Company filed for bankruptcy protection in 2001. The United States Department of Justice alleged that Grace had transferred $4 to 5 billion to subsidiary companies that it had recently purchased, shortly before declaring bankruptcy. Justice Department attorneys alleged that this amounted to a fraudulent transfer of money in order to protect Grace from civil suits related to asbestos. The bankruptcy court ordered the companies to return nearly $1 billion to Grace, which will remain as part of the assets to consider in the bankruptcy hearings.
Asbestos court case[edit]
In 2005, the U.S. Department of Justice began criminal proceedings against W.R. Grace. On February 7, 2005, the department announced that a grand jury in Montana indicted W.R. Grace and seven current and former Grace executives for knowingly endangering residents of Libby, Montana, and concealing information about the health effects of its asbestos mining operations. According to the indictment, W.R. Grace and its executives, as far back as the 1970s, attempted to conceal information about the adverse health effects of the company’s vermiculite mining operations and distribution of vermiculite in the Libby, Montana, community. The defendants are also accused of obstructing the government’s cleanup efforts and wire fraud. To date, according to the indictment, approximately 1,200 residents of Libby area have been identified as suffering from some kind of asbestos-related abnormality.[36]
The criminal trial began in February 2009 after years of pretrial proceedings which reached the United States Supreme Court.[37] By the time the trial was set to begin, one of the defendants, Alan Stringer, had died of cancer. David Uhlmann, a former top environmental crimes prosecutor has been quoted as saying about W.R. Grace & Co.: "There's never been a case where so many people were sickened or killed by environmental crime." The W.R. Grace case long festered in the court system on a 10-count indictment including charges of wire fraud and obstruction of justice. W.R. Grace has voluntarily paid millions of dollars in medical bills for 900 Libby residents.[citation needed]
On Friday, May 8, 2009, W.R. Grace & Co. was acquitted of charges that it knowingly harmed the people of Libby, Montana. It was also acquitted of subsequently participating in any cover-up. Fred Festa, chairman, president and CEO said in a statement, "the company worked hard to keep the operations in compliance with the laws and standards of the day.[citation needed]
In popular culture[edit]

The movie A Civil Action, starring John Travolta, was based on the Grace groundwater contamination law suits in Woburn, MA.
The PBS television show P.O.V., which highlights independent films, in August 2007 premiered the movie Libby, Montana that documents the thousands of people in Libby, Montana, that have been exposed to and are suffering the effects of exposure to asbestos. The show also discusses the criminal indictments of many Grace executives for covering up the asbestos related illnesses and deaths.
PBS also aired "Dust to Dust", a documentary produced by Michael Brown Productions, Inc. in 2002. "Dust to Dust" reports on the more than 200 people who have died from asbestos exposure in Libby, Montana. The film focuses on the plights of several of these individuals and the damage done over almost 30 years while the mine was operated by W.R. Grace.
NPR ran a piece on their show All Things Considered discussing the criminal charges against W.R. Grace. A U.S. attorney general alleges that the company and managers of the mine in Libby, Montana, knew about the dangers of the asbestos they were dumping into the air for over 20 years.[38]
A University of Montana photojournalism master's thesis, Living with Grace, explored the ramifications of living with asbestosis, a disease associated with the vermiculite mine run by W.R. Grace.
On February 19, 2008, the radio show Here and Now broadcast a story about the film Libby, Montana, which details the asbestos contamination in the town of that name.[39]
On April 22, 2009, the television and radio program Democracy Now! broadcast two segments on the trial of W.R. Grace and some of its employees related to the asbestos contamination in Libby, Montana.[40][41] Democracy Now! also broadcast a follow-up interview on May 12, 2009 with activist Gayla Benefield and Andrea Peacock, a Montana independent political and environmental journalist.[42] This interview focused on reactions to the not-guilty verdict in the federal trial, where W.R. Grace and three former executives were acquitted on charges of knowingly exposing workers and townspeople to asbestos, and subsequently participating in a cover-up.

Neem patent[edit]
In 1995, the European Patent Office (EPO) granted a patent on an anti-fungal product derived from the neem tree to the United States Department of Agriculture and W. R. Grace.[43] The Indian government challenged the patent when it was granted, claiming that the process for which the patent had been granted had been in use in India for more than 2,000 years. In 2000, the EPO ruled in India's favour, but W. R. Grace appealed, claiming that prior art about the product had never been published in a scientific journal. On 8 March 2005, that appeal was lost and the EPO revoked the Neem patent.[43]

History[edit]
W.R. Grace and Company was founded in 1854, in Peru, by William Russell Grace, who left Ireland due to the potato famine, and traveled to South America with his father and family. He went first to Peru to work as a ship's chandler for the firm of Bryce and Company, to the merchantmen harvesting guano (bird droppings), used as a fertilizer and gunpowder ingredient due to its high levels of phosphorus and nitrogen.
His brother Michael joined the business and in 1865 the company name was changed to Grace Brothers & Co. The company set up head office operations in New York City in 1865. Working in fertilizer and machinery, the company was formally chartered in 1872, and incorporated in 1895.[5]
Incorporation[edit]
There are two accounts of the incorporation date of W.R. Grace & Co. According to a New York Times account the company was incorporated, as part of estate and successor planning, in 1895. The three brothers consolidated most of their holdings into a new private company, incorporated in West Virginia, called W.R. Grace & Company. The consolidation involved W.R. Grace & Co. of New York, Grace Brothers & Co. of Lima, Peru, Grace & Co. of Valparaiso Chile, William R. Grace & Co. of London, and J. W. Grace & Co of San Francisco.[6]
According to its website, W.R. Grace & Co. was incorporated in Connecticut in 1899. The listed capital of $6 million did not include Grace Brothers & Co. Limited in London or its branches in San Francisco, Lima and Callao, Peru, nor in Valparaiso, Santiago, and Concepción, Chile.[7]
J. Louis Schaefer, who joined the company as a boy, would play a key role in not only W.R. Grace & Company, in which he became a vice president, but also as president of Grace National Bank. Schaefer would be a co-executor of the estate of Michael Grace with William's son and corporate successor, Joseph P. Grace. J. Louis Schaefer died in 1927.[8]

These ships were not involved in the sale to Dollar.[10]
On the death of William R. Grace in 1904, he was succeeded by William L. Sauders as company President followed by Joseph Peter Grace, Sr. (1872–1950) who became president in 1907. In 1938 the Colombian Line merged with Grace Line bringing an end to the Colombian Line.[11] During World War II Grace Lines operated numerous transports for the U.S. War Shipping Administration.[12]
J. Peter Grace, Jr. took over management of the company after his father suffered a stroke in 1945. After the war the Grace line operated 23 ships totaling 188,000 gross tons, and an additional 14 more on bareboat charters. In 1954 the company bought Davison Chemical Company (founded by William T. Davison as Davison, Kettlewell & Company in 1832), and the Dewey & Almy Chemical Company (founded in 1919 by Bradley Dewey and Charles Almy). In 1960 Grace Line, inspired by the pioneering efforts of Sea-Land Service, Matson Navigation, and Seatrain Lines, sought to begin containerizing its South American cargo operations by converting the conventional freighters Santa Eliana and Santa Leonor into fully cellular container ships. However, the effort was stymied by the opposition of longshoremen in New York and Venezuela and the ships were repeatedly laid up idle and were ultimately sold to the domestic container line Sea-Land Service in 1964.[13][14] In 1963 Grace made a second attempt to containerize its South American trade when it ordered the four M-class combination passenger-cargo ships Santa Magdalaena, Santa Maria, Santa Mariana and Santa Mercedes with partial cellular holds, but they were no more successful as mixing conventional break-bulk cargo and containers in the same ship negated the operating economies that full containerization promised.[15]
The company bought a 53% stake in Miller Brewing in 1966, for $36 million; Lorraine Mulberger sold the stake for religious reasons.[16] It sold the Miller stake in 1969 to Philip Morris for $130 million, topping a deal with PepsiCo for $120 million.[17][18][19] In 1969 Grace also exited the shipping business to concentrate on its chemical and diversification ventures. Grace Line was sold and merged into Prudential Line in 1970, which was renamed Prudential Grace Line, and was itself in turn taken over by Delta Lines in 1978, thereby extinguishing the name Grace in ocean shipping.[20] In 1987, by siting a can sealing plant in Shanghai, Grace became the first wholly foreign-owned company to do business in The People's Republic of China.
Airline[edit]
In 1928, Grace and Pan American Airways jointly formed Pan American-Grace Airways known as Panagra, establishing the first air link between the North and South America, that began operation in 1929.[21]
Headquarters[edit]
The company has its headquarters in Columbia, an unincorporated census-designated place in Howard County, Maryland.[22][23] Although W.R. Grace commissioned the Grace Building in New York City, built in 1971, the company no longer has any offices at that location.
Previously the company had its headquarters in Boca Raton, Florida.[24][25] Prior to its closing, the Boca Raton headquarters had about 130 employees. On January 27, 1999 it announced it was moving its administrative staff to the Columbia office and closing the Boca Raton headquarters.[26] About 40 of the employees went to Columbia, and some employees went to Cambridge, Massachusetts.[24] In 2014, the company emerged from a 13-year bankruptcy case stemming from asbestos claims, and immediately built a new 90,000sqft headquarters building on its 160-acre Columbia campus.[27]

Contamination incidents[edit]
W.R. Grace and Company has been involved in a number of controversial incidents of proven and alleged corporate crimes, including exposing workers and residents of an entire town to asbestos contamination in Libby[34] and Troy, Montana, water contamination (the basis of the book and film A Civil Action) in Woburn, Massachusetts, and an Acton, Massachusetts, Superfund site.
Asbestos[edit]
While Grace no longer makes asbestos-related products, W.R. Grace and Company has faced more than 270,000 asbestos-related lawsuits, of which 150,000 have been settled or dismissed and 120,000 remain.[35]
After asbestos injury claims unexpectedly nearly doubled in 2000, W.R. Grace & Company filed for bankruptcy protection in 2001. The United States Department of Justice alleged that Grace had transferred $4 to 5 billion to subsidiary companies that it had recently purchased, shortly before declaring bankruptcy. Justice Department attorneys alleged that this amounted to a fraudulent transfer of money in order to protect Grace from civil suits related to asbestos. The bankruptcy court ordered the companies to return nearly $1 billion to Grace, which will remain as part of the assets to consider in the bankruptcy hearings.
Asbestos court case[edit]
In 2005, the U.S. Department of Justice began criminal proceedings against W.R. Grace. On February 7, 2005, the department announced that a grand jury in Montana indicted W.R. Grace and seven current and former Grace executives for knowingly endangering residents of Libby, Montana, and concealing information about the health effects of its asbestos mining operations. According to the indictment, W.R. Grace and its executives, as far back as the 1970s, attempted to conceal information about the adverse health effects of the company’s vermiculite mining operations and distribution of vermiculite in the Libby, Montana, community. The defendants are also accused of obstructing the government’s cleanup efforts and wire fraud. To date, according to the indictment, approximately 1,200 residents of Libby area have been identified as suffering from some kind of asbestos-related abnormality.[36]
The criminal trial began in February 2009 after years of pretrial proceedings which reached the United States Supreme Court.[37] By the time the trial was set to begin, one of the defendants, Alan Stringer, had died of cancer. David Uhlmann, a former top environmental crimes prosecutor has been quoted as saying about W.R. Grace & Co.: "There's never been a case where so many people were sickened or killed by environmental crime." The W.R. Grace case long festered in the court system on a 10-count indictment including charges of wire fraud and obstruction of justice. W.R. Grace has voluntarily paid millions of dollars in medical bills for 900 Libby residents.[citation needed]
On Friday, May 8, 2009, W.R. Grace & Co. was acquitted of charges that it knowingly harmed the people of Libby, Montana. It was also acquitted of subsequently participating in any cover-up. Fred Festa, chairman, president and CEO said in a statement, "the company worked hard to keep the operations in compliance with the laws and standards of the day.[citation needed]
In popular culture[edit]

The movie A Civil Action, starring John Travolta, was based on the Grace groundwater contamination law suits in Woburn, MA.
The PBS television show P.O.V., which highlights independent films, in August 2007 premiered the movie Libby, Montana that documents the thousands of people in Libby, Montana, that have been exposed to and are suffering the effects of exposure to asbestos. The show also discusses the criminal indictments of many Grace executives for covering up the asbestos related illnesses and deaths.
PBS also aired "Dust to Dust", a documentary produced by Michael Brown Productions, Inc. in 2002. "Dust to Dust" reports on the more than 200 people who have died from asbestos exposure in Libby, Montana. The film focuses on the plights of several of these individuals and the damage done over almost 30 years while the mine was operated by W.R. Grace.
NPR ran a piece on their show All Things Considered discussing the criminal charges against W.R. Grace. A U.S. attorney general alleges that the company and managers of the mine in Libby, Montana, knew about the dangers of the asbestos they were dumping into the air for over 20 years.[38]
A University of Montana photojournalism master's thesis, Living with Grace, explored the ramifications of living with asbestosis, a disease associated with the vermiculite mine run by W.R. Grace.
On February 19, 2008, the radio show Here and Now broadcast a story about the film Libby, Montana, which details the asbestos contamination in the town of that name.[39]
On April 22, 2009, the television and radio program Democracy Now! broadcast two segments on the trial of W.R. Grace and some of its employees related to the asbestos contamination in Libby, Montana.[40][41] Democracy Now! also broadcast a follow-up interview on May 12, 2009 with activist Gayla Benefield and Andrea Peacock, a Montana independent political and environmental journalist.[42] This interview focused on reactions to the not-guilty verdict in the federal trial, where W.R. Grace and three former executives were acquitted on charges of knowingly exposing workers and townspeople to asbestos, and subsequently participating in a cover-up.

Neem patent[edit]
In 1995, the European Patent Office (EPO) granted a patent on an anti-fungal product derived from the neem tree to the United States Department of Agriculture and W. R. Grace.[43] The Indian government challenged the patent when it was granted, claiming that the process for which the patent had been granted had been in use in India for more than 2,000 years. In 2000, the EPO ruled in India's favour, but W. R. Grace appealed, claiming that prior art about the product had never been published in a scientific journal. On 8 March 2005, that appeal was lost and the EPO revoked the Neem patent.[43]

History[edit]
W.R. Grace and Company was founded in 1854, in Peru, by William Russell Grace, who left Ireland due to the potato famine, and traveled to South America with his father and family. He went first to Peru to work as a ship's chandler for the firm of Bryce and Company, to the merchantmen harvesting guano (bird droppings), used as a fertilizer and gunpowder ingredient due to its high levels of phosphorus and nitrogen.
His brother Michael joined the business and in 1865 the company name was changed to Grace Brothers & Co. The company set up head office operations in New York City in 1865. Working in fertilizer and machinery, the company was formally chartered in 1872, and incorporated in 1895.[5]
Incorporation[edit]
There are two accounts of the incorporation date of W.R. Grace & Co. According to a New York Times account the company was incorporated, as part of estate and successor planning, in 1895. The three brothers consolidated most of their holdings into a new private company, incorporated in West Virginia, called W.R. Grace & Company. The consolidation involved W.R. Grace & Co. of New York, Grace Brothers & Co. of Lima, Peru, Grace & Co. of Valparaiso Chile, William R. Grace & Co. of London, and J. W. Grace & Co of San Francisco.[6]
According to its website, W.R. Grace & Co. was incorporated in Connecticut in 1899. The listed capital of $6 million did not include Grace Brothers & Co. Limited in London or its branches in San Francisco, Lima and Callao, Peru, nor in Valparaiso, Santiago, and Concepción, Chile.[7]
J. Louis Schaefer, who joined the company as a boy, would play a key role in not only W.R. Grace & Company, in which he became a vice president, but also as president of Grace National Bank. Schaefer would be a co-executor of the estate of Michael Grace with William's son and corporate successor, Joseph P. Grace. J. Louis Schaefer died in 1927.[8]
Shipping[edit]




Grace Line WWII poster


At one time, Grace's main business interest was in shipping. To get its products from Peru to North America and Europe, including guano and sugar, and noticing the need for other goods to be traded, William Grace founded a shipping division.[5] Grace Line began service in 1882,[9] with ports of call between Peru and New York. Regular steamship service was established in 1893, with a subsidiary called the New York & Pacific Steamship Co., that operated under the British flag. Ships built outside the United States prior to 1905 were banned from US registry. US-flag service began in 1912 with the Atlantic and Pacific Steamship Company. The activities of both companies and the parent firm were consolidated into the Grace Steamship Company beginning in 1916. The firm originally specialized in traffic to the west coast of South America; then later expanded into the Caribbean.
In 1916, Grace acquired a controlling interest in the Pacific Mail Steamship Company. In 1921, Pacific received five 535 ft. President class ships from the United States Shipping Board for transpacific operation. In 1923, the US Shipping board decided to place the five ships up for bid and Dollar Shipping Company won the bid. With no large ships for the transpacific operations Grace sold the Pacific Mail, its registered name, and goodwill to Dollar. Now without a transpacific service, Grace did not need the six intercoastal freighters and sold them off to the American Hawaiian Line. At this time Grace formed a new entity, the Panama Mail Steamship Company, to operate the smaller ships that were formerly owned and used by the Pacific Mail in the Central American trade. These ships were not involved in the sale to Dollar.[10]
On the death of William R. Grace in 1904, he was succeeded by William L. Sauders as company President followed by Joseph Peter Grace, Sr. (1872–1950) who became president in 1907. In 1938 the Colombian Line merged with Grace Line bringing an end to the Colombian Line.[11] During World War II Grace Lines operated numerous transports for the U.S. War Shipping Administration.[12]
J. Peter Grace, Jr. took over management of the company after his father suffered a stroke in 1945. After the war the Grace line operated 23 ships totaling 188,000 gross tons, and an additional 14 more on bareboat charters. In 1954 the company bought Davison Chemical Company (founded by William T. Davison as Davison, Kettlewell & Company in 1832), and the Dewey & Almy Chemical Company (founded in 1919 by Bradley Dewey and Charles Almy). In 1960 Grace Line, inspired by the pioneering efforts of Sea-Land Service, Matson Navigation, and Seatrain Lines, sought to begin containerizing its South American cargo operations by converting the conventional freighters Santa Eliana and Santa Leonor into fully cellular container ships. However, the effort was stymied by the opposition of longshoremen in New York and Venezuela and the ships were repeatedly laid up idle and were ultimately sold to the domestic container line Sea-Land Service in 1964.[13][14] In 1963 Grace made a second attempt to containerize its South American trade when it ordered the four M-class combination passenger-cargo ships Santa Magdalaena, Santa Maria, Santa Mariana and Santa Mercedes with partial cellular holds, but they were no more successful as mixing conventional break-bulk cargo and containers in the same ship negated the operating economies that full containerization promised.[15]
The company bought a 53% stake in Miller Brewing in 1966, for $36 million; Lorraine Mulberger sold the stake for religious reasons.[16] It sold the Miller stake in 1969 to Philip Morris for $130 million, topping a deal with PepsiCo for $120 million.[17][18][19] In 1969 Grace also exited the shipping business to concentrate on its chemical and diversification ventures. Grace Line was sold and merged into Prudential Line in 1970, which was renamed Prudential Grace Line, and was itself in turn taken over by Delta Lines in 1978, thereby extinguishing the name Grace in ocean shipping.[20] In 1987, by siting a can sealing plant in Shanghai, Grace became the first wholly foreign-owned company to do business in The People's Republic of China.
Airline[edit]
In 1928, Grace and Pan American Airways jointly formed Pan American-Grace Airways known as Panagra, establishing the first air link between the North and South America, that began operation in 1929.[21]
Headquarters[edit]
The company has its headquarters in Columbia, an unincorporated census-designated place in Howard County, Maryland.[22][23] Although W.R. Grace commissioned the Grace Building in New York City, built in 1971, the company no longer has any offices at that location.
Previously the company had its headquarters in Boca Raton, Florida.[24][25] Prior to its closing, the Boca Raton headquarters had about 130 employees. On January 27, 1999 it announced it was moving its administrative staff to the Columbia office and closing the Boca Raton headquarters.[26] About 40 of the employees went to Columbia, and some employees went to Cambridge, Massachusetts.[24] In 2014, the company emerged from a 13-year bankruptcy case stemming from asbestos claims, and immediately built a new 90,000sqft headquarters building on its 160-acre Columbia campus.[27]

Contamination incidents[edit]
W.R. Grace and Company has been involved in a number of controversial incidents of proven and alleged corporate crimes, including exposing workers and residents of an entire town to asbestos contamination in Libby[34] and Troy, Montana, water contamination (the basis of the book and film A Civil Action) in Woburn, Massachusetts, and an Acton, Massachusetts, Superfund site.
Asbestos[edit]
While Grace no longer makes asbestos-related products, W.R. Grace and Company has faced more than 270,000 asbestos-related lawsuits, of which 150,000 have been settled or dismissed and 120,000 remain.[35]
After asbestos injury claims unexpectedly nearly doubled in 2000, W.R. Grace & Company filed for bankruptcy protection in 2001. The United States Department of Justice alleged that Grace had transferred $4 to 5 billion to subsidiary companies that it had recently purchased, shortly before declaring bankruptcy. Justice Department attorneys alleged that this amounted to a fraudulent transfer of money in order to protect Grace from civil suits related to asbestos. The bankruptcy court ordered the companies to return nearly $1 billion to Grace, which will remain as part of the assets to consider in the bankruptcy hearings.
Asbestos court case[edit]
In 2005, the U.S. Department of Justice began criminal proceedings against W.R. Grace. On February 7, 2005, the department announced that a grand jury in Montana indicted W.R. Grace and seven current and former Grace executives for knowingly endangering residents of Libby, Montana, and concealing information about the health effects of its asbestos mining operations. According to the indictment, W.R. Grace and its executives, as far back as the 1970s, attempted to conceal information about the adverse health effects of the company’s vermiculite mining operations and distribution of vermiculite in the Libby, Montana, community. The defendants are also accused of obstructing the government’s cleanup efforts and wire fraud. To date, according to the indictment, approximately 1,200 residents of Libby area have been identified as suffering from some kind of asbestos-related abnormality.[36]
The criminal trial began in February 2009 after years of pretrial proceedings which reached the United States Supreme Court.[37] By the time the trial was set to begin, one of the defendants, Alan Stringer, had died of cancer. David Uhlmann, a former top environmental crimes prosecutor has been quoted as saying about W.R. Grace & Co.: "There's never been a case where so many people were sickened or killed by environmental crime." The W.R. Grace case long festered in the court system on a 10-count indictment including charges of wire fraud and obstruction of justice. W.R. Grace has voluntarily paid millions of dollars in medical bills for 900 Libby residents.[citation needed]
On Friday, May 8, 2009, W.R. Grace & Co. was acquitted of charges that it knowingly harmed the people of Libby, Montana. It was also acquitted of subsequently participating in any cover-up. Fred Festa, chairman, president and CEO said in a statement, "the company worked hard to keep the operations in compliance with the laws and standards of the day.[citation needed]

On April 22, 2009, the television and radio program Democracy Now! broadcast two segments on the trial of W.R. Grace and some of its employees related to the asbestos contamination in Libby, Montana.[40][41] Democracy Now! also broadcast a follow-up interview on May 12, 2009 with activist Gayla Benefield and Andrea Peacock, a Montana independent political and environmental journalist.[42] This interview focused on reactions to the not-guilty verdict in the federal trial, where W.R. Grace and three former executives were acquitted on charges of knowingly exposing workers and townspeople to asbestos, and subsequently participating in a cover-up.

Neem patent[edit]
In 1995, the European Patent Office (EPO) granted a patent on an anti-fungal product derived from the neem tree to the United States Department of Agriculture and W. R. Grace.[43] The Indian government challenged the patent when it was granted, claiming that the process for which the patent had been granted had been in use in India for more than 2,000 years. In 2000, the EPO ruled in India's favour, but W. R. Grace appealed, claiming that prior art about the product had never been published in a scientific journal. On 8 March 2005, that appeal was lost and the EPO revoked the Neem patent.[43]

History of W.R. Grace & Co.
W.R. Grace & Co. is associated with the one of the largest asbestos contaminations in American history. The company purchased vermiculite asbestos mines and a processing mill in Libby, Montana, in 1963 and operated them until 1990. Vermiculite is a naturally occurring mineral that is mined from raw ore deposits in a method very similar to asbestos mining.
Employing up to 200 people, Grace & Co. produced up to 200,000 tons of vermiculite a year. Its Zonolite Mountain mine was shut down in 1990 after large quantities of airborne asbestos fibers were discovered. From that discovery began a steady stream of asbestos-related lawsuits against W.R. Grace.
The vermiculite found in the mines was used for a variety of common construction projects. Unfortunately, vermiculite mines were often a source of asbestos fibers, which posed a health hazard to anyone working or living nearby. The life expectancy of many residents began to be severely compromised.
More than 400 of Libby's residents died from exposure to the asbestos in the Grace mines, and at least half of the town's population of 3,000 is currently ill. Grace has faced more than 250,000 asbestos-related lawsuits, and it declared bankruptcy in 2001.

W.R. Grace & Co.’s Asbestos Products
Many of the asbestos-containing products manufactured by Grace were intended for use in the construction industry. Aside from specialty building materials, the asbestos-containing products manufactured by the company also included fireproofing materials, plaster, and roofing and deck materials, as well as additives for concrete and cement.
Many of the products the company manufactured were destined to be exported, taking advantage of the company’s wide-ranging interests around the globe.
Grace founded, bought and sold a number of businesses, ranging from banks, western apparel outlets, wholesale book distributors, airlines and restaurants. In 1865, company founder William Grace established a steamship line in Peru to trade guano (used in fertilizer and gunpowder) with the Americas before moving to New York. In New York, Grace established shipping routes that linked Europe, New York and South America in the trading of fabric, fertilizer, machinery and other products. The 20th century was a period of tremendous diversification for Grace.
Examples of asbestos-containing products manufactured by W.R. Grace include:

Econo-White
Ez Tex
High Temperature Insulating Cement
Monokote Cement
Monokote Fireproofing
Perltex Spray Surfacer
Perltex Super-40 Perlite
Zono-Coustic
Zonolite Acoustical Plastic/Plaster
Zonolite Cement
Zonolite Fireproofing
Zonolite Plaster
Zonolite Spra-Tex
Z-Tex

W.R. Grace & Co. and Asbestos Lawsuits
Many of the asbestos-related lawsuits Grace faced in the 1990s involved plaintiffs who worked or lived at or near the Libby vermiculite mine. Other suits were filed by construction workers and homeowners who contracted asbestos-related diseases after exposure to W.R. Grace’s popular Zonolite insulation or other asbestos-containing products.
Criminal proceedings against W.R. Grace & Co. began in 2001, and the case is now considered one of the largest asbestos-related environmental cleanup lawsuits in the country. The U.S. government charged the company and seven of its top executives with concealing information about ongoing health problems caused by exposure to their asbestos-contaminated vermiculite mine in Libby.
Records obtained from the company revealed that as far back as the 1970s executives had been aware that the asbestos found in the vermiculite mine was not only sickening employees, but also the residents of the nearby community. Grace was additionally charged with obstructing Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) cleanup efforts at the site.
As a result of the 2009 trial, W.R. Grace & Co. was ordered to pay the U.S. government more than $54 million to cover cleanup costs related to the vermiculite mine that Grace operated near Libby. Now a designated Superfund site, the mine disturbed a vast area of asbestos that contaminated individual residences, schools and businesses in the town of Libby, as well as the water and soil in the area. More than $5 million of the fine was earmarked for medical testing and mortality analyses of Libby residents who had perished after mining operations began.
In June 2009, the EPA declared a Public Health Emergency in the towns of Libby and Troy, Montana. Incidence of asbestosis among the residents of these small communities was “staggeringly higher than the national average for the period from 1979-1998,” according to the EPA.
Grace’s reorganization plan was confirmed in 2011.

Asbestos Exposure

Asbestos Exposure
Asbestos exposure can lead to a myriad of serious health problems, including asbestosis, lung cancer and mesothelioma, a rare, aggressive and incurable cancer. 
Asbestos exposure can happen wherever asbestos is present: At home, a public building such as a school or government office, a war fought on foreign soil or on the job.




Click to expand

In fact, occupational exposure is the No. 1 cause of asbestos disease. That means roofers, carpenters, electricians, plumbers, firefighters, auto mechanics, insulators, factory workers and many others are at a high risk of exposure.
Those who worked in construction, shipyards, power plants, oil refineries and steel mills also faced the likelihood of high asbestos exposure on the job.
U.S. military veterans were the most vulnerable of all — accounting for almost a third of all cases — because of the military’s past reliance on asbestos products, especially on Navy ships.
For much of the 20th century, until its long-term toxicity became well known, thousands of everyday products used asbestos because it was coveted for its heat resistance, versatility and tensile strength.

How Exposure Happens
Asbestos disease starts with the unknowing inhalation or ingestion of microscopic asbestos fibers. While no level of asbestos exposure is considered safe, most problems arise after repeated and long-term exposures to the carcinogen. 
Environmental and secondhand exposure to asbestos is rarer, but it still happens regularly. Most everyone in their lifetime has inhaled some quantity of asbestos, but these trace amounts rarely cause health problems.







"Asbestos-related disease is 100 percent preventable. That fact motivates me. It should motivate all of us. If we stopped using asbestos, by definition, we could stop asbestos disease." — Dr. Ken Takahashi, director of the Asbestos Diseases Research Institute


Harmful exposures occur in a wide range of occupational settings. Home and commercial renovation or remodeling can be especially hazardous because many common building materials already contain asbestos. When asbestos products start to deteriorate or are cut, sanded, drilled or disturbed in any way, microscopic fibers enter the air.
For example, the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (ADEC) took issue with the sandblasting practices of Alaska-based shipbuilding and repair facility Seward Ship's Drydock. The ADEC issued Seward a notice of violation for uncontrolled "fugitive particulate emissions" at its sandblasting operations.
If workers sandblasted asbestos-containing materials, such as paint, insulation or joint compounds, off of a vessel, the asbestos fibers released would no longer be confined to the sandblasted area, and people elsewhere in the shipyard could inhale them.
Fibers can remain airborne for hours, placing anyone nearby in danger. Once inhaled, they can become trapped in the respiratory tract, where they may stay for life.
Health Risks of Exposure
Once inhaled, asbestos fibers can become lodged in the thin lining surrounding the lungs and cause inflammation, making breathing increasingly difficult.
They eventually will cause scarring, which can lead to genetic mutations and cancer. In the early stages, symptoms of these diseases often mirror those of less serious illnesses and may not be diagnosed until 20 to 50 years after the initial exposure.
Each year, approximately 2,000 to 3,000 Americans are diagnosed with mesothelioma, a rare cancer caused almost exclusively by asbestos exposure. An estimated 10,000 Americans die annually from an asbestos-related disease. 
Currently, an estimated 200,000 people in the country are diagnosed with some form of asbestos-related illness.

Pleural plaques: These are the most common indication of asbestos exposure. They are characterized by fibrous thickening of the lining around the lungs.
Asbestosis: Asbestosis is characterized by inflammation and scarring of the lung tissue, which prevents the lungs from expanding and relaxing normally.
COPD: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is not directly caused by asbestos, but exposure increases the risk of developing the disease.
Mesothelioma: This is a rare, aggressive and incurable asbestos-caused cancer.
Lung Cancer: Asbestos-related lung cancer accounts for approximately 4 percent of all lung cancer cases. Asbestos exposure also increases the chances of developing lung cancer. 

Where Exposure Occurs
Exposure can occur while living near job sites or contaminated environments, using asbestos-containing products or working in certain occupations, including the U.S. military. Exposure can also occur during natural or manmade disasters.


Military
Every branch of the U.S. Armed Forces incorporated asbestos. People on U.S. Navy ships and operators of military vehicles and aircraft from the early 1900s to the 1970s were most at risk. Since that time, thousands of veterans who worked in the following vessels have suffered illnesses related to asbestos exposure during their service.

Battleships
Aircraft Carriers
Cruisers
Auxiliary Vessels
Submarines
Destroyers
Frigates

Learn more about veterans and mesothelioma


Products
Thousands of products were manufactured using asbestos fibers. Asbestos may be found in insulation, drywall, ceiling and floor tiles, cements, paint and more. Most homes and commercial buildings built before 1980 contain asbestos products.
Search our asbestos products index


Occupations
Workers from practically all trades were likely exposed to asbestos fibers while on the job. Drywall tapers, electricians, firefighters, auto mechanics and many other occupations may be at risk. While asbestos regulation was more relaxed in the past, today the law requires all employers to protect workers from asbestos and other job-related health risks.
See if your occupation was at risk for exposure


Job Sites
Asbestos exposure may occur while on the job. Many workplaces utilized the mineral in their products and facilities, placing millions of workers at risk for exposure.

Shipyards
Power Plants
Metal Works
Schools
Chemical Plants
Oil Refineries



Environmental exposure occurs when asbestos fibers are released into the air through mining, the disturbance of a natural asbestos deposit or the result of natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes and earthquakes.
In 2016, the Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health published a study that showed occupational exposure to asbestos has declined in recent years, but there has been a rise in environmental exposure in specific geographic areas. 
The study also used the findings to explain why the percentage of women and younger patients with asbestos disease has been rising.
Researchers at the University of Hawaii Cancer Center conducted a similar study in 2015 that highlighted the need to be more aware of environmental exposure in Nevada.
Northern California is also home to some of the largest naturally occurring deposits of asbestos. 
9/11 Attack on the World Trade Center
The terrorist attack at the World Trade Center in New York City on Sept. 11, 2001, released more than 2,000 tons of asbestos into the air, causing a sudden and very serious exposure problem for rescue, recovery and cleanup workers who remained at the site for months.
According to a 2002 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, about 70 percent of those workers suffered new or worsened respiratory problems. It found that 28 percent of workers tested had abnormal lung function tests. Researchers continue to closely monitor those who worked in the rubble, along with nearby residents, for long-term health consequences related to asbestos and other toxic building materials.

Risks from Nearby Asbestos Operations
Job sites where workers mined, handled or processed asbestos often contaminated the outside air with airborne fibers. As a result, people in nearby communities may face environmental exposures that increase the risk for serious health complications.

Read About the Asbestos Cover Up



A 2009 study tested the effects of environmental exposure in a population living near an asbestos manufacturing plant. The study examined rates of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) and other asbestos-related conditions in Shubra El-Kheima, Egypt, an industrial city containing the Sigwart Company asbestos plant. It compared disease rates in individuals working in the plant, those living near the plant and those in a control group with no known asbestos exposure. In total, the study had more than 4,000 participants.
The rate of MPM was highest in the group with environmental asbestos exposure, with 2.8 percent of this group having the cancer. The group with occupational exposure had a strikingly lower rate of only 0.8 percent. As expected, the control group had the fewest incidences, with a rate of 0.1 percent.
These rates varied for other illnesses such as diffuse pleural thickening. Overall, the study found a slightly higher, but still comparable, rate of asbestos-related illnesses in asbestos workers than in nearby residents.
Improper Abatement
If asbestos materials are removed from a home or structure, there is a high risk of exposure to airborne fibers if proper abatement procedures are not followed. It is important to adhere to federal safety regulations regarding the removal and disposal of the materials to minimize health risks.
Secondhand Exposure
People can get an asbestos-related disease without ever working with or around the toxic mineral. Secondhand exposure, or indirect exposure, can be just as dangerous as firsthand exposure.
While any kind of exposure is much less common today than even 20 years ago, women faced an increased risk for secondhand exposure when asbestos use was high during the mid-20th century.
At that time, men comprised the majority of the industrial working class. The occupations within these industrial settings often required workers to handle asbestos-containing products. Workers returning home might carry fibers on their hair, skin and clothes and indirectly expose their families and others living with them.
Occurrences of Secondhand Exposure
Secondhand exposure is the cause for a significant portion of mesothelioma cases among women and children. If children are exposed to asbestos indirectly at an early age, they may develop an asbestos-related disease in their adult years. There are four common forms of secondhand asbestos exposure.



Laundry
The clothing of workers who handled asbestos products provided a significant risk for secondhand exposure. Because of the jagged structure of the fibers, the microscopic particles could easily attach to clothing. Anyone handling or washing these work clothes likely experienced indirect exposure.





Furniture
If a worker didn’t change out of asbestos contaminated clothing before returning home, fibers could have become embedded in the couch, chairs, carpet, bed and other pieces of furniture.





Hugs
If a worker came home with fibers attached to their hair, skin or clothes and later hugged their children or spouse, family members were likely indirectly exposed to the carcinogen. Some mesothelioma cases have developed from children sitting on the lap of their father or grandfather after he came home from work.
While family members didn't have any direct contact with asbestos-containing products, the amount of dust brought home was enough to cause mesothelioma or a related disease later in life.
Between 1941 and 1954, researchers at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City studied the health of 679 family members from the 1,664 workers employed at a factory in Patterson, New Jersey. Researchers discovered five cases of mesothelioma among factory workers' family members. Sources of asbestos dust were also found in the homes of former Patterson factory workers 20 years after the factory shut down.

Legal Claims for Secondhand Exposure 
Like plaintiffs who are directly exposed to asbestos, claimants indirectly injured by asbestos may be eligible for compensation. In order to bring a successful legal claim, they must be able to trace their exposure to a defendant who is liable for failure to warn or protect against the dangers. This usually involves investigating the work history of a family member who was exposed on the job.


John Panza Jr., diagnosed with mesothelioma in 2012.

For example, John Panza Jr., a 40-year-old English professor, was diagnosed with mesothelioma in 2012. For more than 30 years, his father worked at a brake plant where National Friction Products Corp. products were drilled and abraded. As a child, Panza helped his father wash his work clothes. In 2012, Panza filed a lawsuit against National Friction alleging he inhaled fibers from the company's products that contaminated his father's clothes.
In 2013, an Ohio jury found National Friction liable for Panza's illness. It ordered the company to pay Panza and his wife $27.5 million. The award included $515,000 in economic damages, $12 million in noneconomic damages and $15 million for the wife's loss of consortium claim. 
Protecting Yourself and Loved Ones
Despite the continued presence of asbestos in the workplace and in everyday life, people can protect themselves by being vigilant. 
Workers should use protective equipment provided by employers. It is important to follow proper safety procedures and workplace practices. Approved respirators should be worn when working around asbestos fibers.
It also is important to take precautions against bringing home any asbestos from work and endangering a family. Any clothing or shoes worn on the job should be left and cleaned at the job site. Showers should be taken before returning home.
Safety equipment and good practices today protect you against future asbestos exposure problems.
If you think your work conditions are unsafe or your employer isn’t adequately protecting you from asbestos, file an anonymous complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).

Asbestos Products Manufacturers
Even with cries to ban the mining and production of asbestos resounding across the world, the industry continues to thrive. Concerns about the diseases caused by asbestos exposure prompted more than 50 nations — including the entire European Union — to ban or severely restrict asbestos use. Strict U.S. regulations took hold in the 1970s. Yet countries like Russia, China, Brazil and Kazakhstan still mine and sell massive quantities of the toxic mineral on a global scale.

At the heart of this disparity is the industry’s notion that corporate profits outweigh good health and the value of life. Since the late 1800s, American companies like the Johns Manville Corporation amassed great wealth by mining, manufacturing and selling asbestos-containing products. Centuries later, medical evidence revealed Johns Manville and numerous other companies not only knew about the potentially deadly effects of exposure but also went to great lengths to conceal the information from workers and consumers.
In decades past, asbestos use was far more pervasive in the United States. Contaminated materials were prevalent in industries like shipbuilding, construction, power generation and heavy manufacturing. Since an initial wave of personal injury claims emerged in the 1970s, asbestos liabilities drove hundreds of companies to bankruptcy. In many cases, companies overwhelmed by these claims establish mesothelioma and asbestos trust funds to cover the costs of current and future lawsuits.

While medical evidence indicates that even brief exposure to asbestos can cause life-threatening respiratory illnesses such as lung cancer, asbestosis and mesothelioma, the consumption of contaminated products in the United States and many other countries continues. According to a 2011 inventory of more than 60,000 asbestos-laden products, approximately 600 companies and suppliers operated worldwide that year.

Fast Fact: In 1963, Crown Cork & Seal acquired Mundet Cork, inheriting more than $700 million current and future asbestos liabilities.

History of Manufacturing

Although asbestos mining existed for thousands of years, it was only during the Industrial Revolution of the late 1800s that the industry flourished. A natural resistance to heat, chemicals and electricity made the fiber desirable for innumerable industrial applications. Soon enough, manufacturers incorporated asbestos insulation into steam engines, piping and locomotives. Thousands of other uses later emerged, and manufacturers began putting it in products like boilers, gaskets, cement, roofing materials and automotive brake pads.


By the early 20th century, some companies realized that their primary source of income was severely injuring employees and consumers. But rather than making efforts to improve workplace safety standards, some companies chose to ignore or bury information that would undoubtedly damage their business and reputation. Internal documents indicate that Johns Manville executives were aware of the risks as early as 1934. The company conducted private medical studies around this time, and the negative results remained confidential for decades.


Asbestos use increased throughout World War II, largely because of military shipbuilding contracts. The U.S. government required asbestos insulation be used in U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard vessels. For several decades after the war, hundreds of companies grew and prospered by incorporating asbestos materials into thousands of industrial and household products.

In addition to Johns Manville, other leading asbestos manufacturers include:

Owens Corning/Fibreboard Corp.
Raybestos-Manhattan Co.
National Gypsum Corporation
W.R. Grace & Co.
Celotex Corp.


By the 1960s, scientists had gathered ample evidence of asbestos's harmful effects. One landmark occupational study conducted by Dr. Irving Selikoff in 1964 showed a clear link between the mineral and various cancers. Results indicated that between 1943 and 1962, an excessive number of insulation workers died of asbestosis and cancer, including lung cancer, mesothelioma, stomach cancer and colorectal cancer. Selikoff's findings were bolstered by medical evidence gathered in the wake of a subsequent decline in asbestos use. The result was a significant downturn for America's asbestos industry.


The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) dealt another blow to the industry with the Clean Air Act of 1970. It established the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP), which placed stringent restrictions on the use of asbestos and other harmful airborne contaminants. Several new regulations directly affected the industry, specifically companies that milled, sprayed or disposed of asbestos materials. By the late 1970s, many companies began phasing the mineral out of their products.


Although the U.S. Geological Survey asserts that U.S. asbestos use has fallen 99.9 percent since 1973, it is not yet banned in the United States. Limited amounts of chrysotile asbestos remain in brake pads and other friction materials, building materials like cement and in various textiles.

Fast Fact: A C & S stated it would no longer use materials made with friable asbestos in 1974, but bankruptcy documents revealed it may have been used for at least another decade.

Products

During the peak era of asbestos consumption, it was incorporated into approximately 3,000 types of products. One of the most common commercial applications was within insulation products, a use that spanned industries including construction, shipbuilding and industrial manufacturing.


Countless other types of building materials were manufactured with asbestos, including ceiling tiles, joint compounds, cement, drywall and roofing materials. These products have a high potential to expose workers during building renovations and demolitions, as many related activities release toxic fibers into the air.


The toxic fibers have also been spun into various textile products such as rope, cloth and garments. Shipyard workers who installed tainted insulation often wore protective gloves and aprons that also contained the dangerous ingredient.


Another leading sector that continues to use asbestos materials is the automotive industry. Many car parts that withstand high temperatures and friction, such as gaskets and brake pads, contained some percentage of asbestos.

Industries & Occupations

According to the World Health Organization, about 125 million people experience workplace exposure worldwide. By far, the most dangerous occupations involved mining and processing the mineral. These activities released massive amounts of toxic fibers into the air.


Another industry at high risk for exposure is that of construction. While drywall hangers and insulation workers faced constant exposure risks, many other professions in carpentry may have been exposed simply by working on the same project.


Shipyard workers, especially during the World War II era, experienced heavy exposure as well. Tainted insulation was once a staple aboard seafaring vessels, and cramped working conditions made its installation especially hazardous. Also at risk were pipefitters, boiler workers and electricians who serviced U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard ships.


Litigation & Specific Lawsuits


A staggering number of related lawsuits surfaced over the past four decades, jeopardizing assets of any company associated with asbestos. According to one litigation report from 2002, an estimated 730,000 people filed related claims against at least 8,400 corporations.


Some mesothelioma lawsuits resulted in multimillion-dollar verdicts or out-of-court settlements. When courts find companies liable for a person’s injury or death, they must provide compensatory damages including pain and suffering, medical expenses, lost income and loss of consortium. Many times courts also demand additional punitive damages from companies for their wrongdoings.


In one standout 2005 case, U.S. Steel was ordered to pay $250 million to Roby Whittington, the wife of a former U.S. Steel employee who died of mesothelioma. Several other manufacturers defended the case, but U.S. Steel was found 100 percent liable for Whittington’s death. Georgia-Pacific settled out of court for an undisclosed amount, and the jury awarded Mrs. Whittington $50 million in damages and $200 million in punitive damages.


A San Francisco jury awarded another landmark verdict to Alfred Todak, holding more than 25 firms liable for his mesothelioma diagnosis. A former electrician, Todak was exposed while servicing boilers aboard Navy vessels from 1960 to 1976. Eighteen firms settled with Todak out of court for a total of $4.2 million, and Foster Wheeler Ltd. contributed 30 percent of the jury’s $22.7 million verdict. Todak’s wife also received $11 million for related losses.


More recently, a 2011 lawsuit ended with a combined verdict of $22 million for two steamfitters exposed to asbestos gaskets. The gasket manufacturers, Goodyear Tire and Rubber and Goodyear Canada, were found partially liable for the lung cancer deaths of Walter Koczur and Eugene McCarthy, despite both being longtime smokers.

Fast Fact: Pittsburgh Corning announced in 2009 that it would pay out $825 million in cash over the next 15 years to cover asbestos-related claims.


Trust Funds


With multibillion-dollar liabilities looming, many companies chose to file for bankruptcy to help defer the uncertain, yet steadily rising, costs of legal compensation. The U.S. government estimates that more than 100 companies filed for bankruptcy because of asbestos litigation, including industry giants like National Gypsum, Dana Corporation and EaglePicher Industries.


As part of their reorganization plans, companies often create personal injury trusts. Forming a trust prevents claimants from taking a company to court, designating the trust as the company’s only source for providing compensation. Bankrupt companies funnel their remaining assets into these trusts to fund current and future liabilities.


Since Johns Manville created the first trust in 1987, nearly every major asbestos manufacturer has declared bankruptcy and established a personal injury trust. By 2011, these trusts had awarded a total of $17.5 billion. Some of the largest trusts include:

Columbia-based chemicals company W.R. Grace will split into two.




Columbia-based specialty chemicals giant W.R. Grace & Co. announced Thursday that it would split into two independent companies, one focused on construction products and one focused on other materials and chemicals.Grace officials said the split, in which both companies would be publicly traded, would simplify operating structures and enhance focus. The company expects to complete the split in one year."The time is right to create two strong, independent companies that will benefit from improved strategic focus, simplified operating structures and more efficient capital allocation," Fred Festa, Grace's chairman and CEO, said in a statement.Word of the decision, which is expected to boost value for shareholders, sent Grace shares up more than 12 percent Thursday to close at $102.32 on the New York Stock Exchange.

Such a split is not uncommon for companies with two different types of business, said Karyl Leggio, a finance professor at Loyola University Maryland. The stock price might not reflect the full value of a company with two distinct businesses, she said."It's like if you owned a utility company or a manufacturing firm and you owned a higher-tech Internet company," Leggio said. "Their returns are very different; their risk profiles are very different. Often shareholders like a different type of company."By splitting, you allow shareholders to invest in the company they're most comfortable with. Each business will stay focused on its core strength. You're typically more efficient when you do this."While the chemical business will remain based at Grace's Columbia campus, the construction products business will be headquartered in Cambridge, Mass., said Grace spokesman Rich Badmington. The company has most of its construction operations there, while the silica and catalyst businesses are mostly concentrated in the Baltimore area, he said.

No layoffs are planned as a result of the split, Badmington said. "The goal here for both companies is growth."Formal names for the two companies will be announced before the split is complete. For now, "New Grace" will consist of Grace's production of process catalysts and specialty silicas, with estimated annual sales of $1.8 billion. "New GCP" will consist of construction products and the Darex can sealant and coating business, with estimated annual sales of $1.5 billion.The split will be done as a tax-free spin-off to Grace shareholders for federal income tax purposes. Festa will lead "New Grace," while Greg Poling, now the president and COO of Grace, will lead "New GCP."Grace said the "New Grace" will seek to acquire other companies and will be focused on expansion. "New GCP" might also pursue acquisitions and grow organically."We have a world-class team of talented people who have worked hard to transform Grace into a high-performing company," Festa said. "Those efforts allow us to take this next important step in our evolution."The decision to break up comes one year after the 160-year-old company spent nearly 13 years in bankruptcy, dogged by asbestos claims. Asbestos fibers can cause cancer and other deadly illnesses, and Grace used them in its products before the Environmental Protection Agency banned it in 1973.A naturally occurring asbestos in a Grace-owned vermiculite mine in Libby, Mont., spread throughout the small community, sickening residents. Grace settled with the Environmental Protection Agency and the Justice Department, contributing $250 million to cleanup efforts. The federal government charged the company and former executives criminally over the mine, alleging that they knowingly endangered residents. The case ended in acquittal.The company set up a $4 billion asbestos trust and began paying claimants after emerging from bankruptcy.Separately, Grace reported Thursday that its earnings in 2014 rose 7.9 percent over the year before, to $276.3 million. Annual sales grew 6 percent, to $3.2 billion. In the three-month period ending in December, earnings were $15.5 million, down by nearly half of what they were a year prior.The company employs about 1,100 in Maryland and makes specialty chemicals and materials around the world. Its headquarters have been in Columbia since 1999. The company's products include can liners and catalysts used in refining oil and shale gas.cwells@baltsun.com

History[edit]
W.R. Grace and Company was founded in 1854, in Peru, by William Russell Grace, who left Ireland due to the potato famine, and traveled to South America with his father and family. He went first to Peru to work as a ship's chandler for the firm of Bryce and Company, to the merchantmen harvesting guano (bird droppings), used as a fertilizer and gunpowder ingredient due to its high levels of phosphorus and nitrogen.
His brother Michael joined the business and in 1865 the company name was changed to Grace Brothers & Co. The company set up head office operations in New York City in 1865. Working in fertilizer and machinery, the company was formally chartered in 1872, and incorporated in 1895.[5]
Incorporation[edit]
There are two accounts of the incorporation date of W.R. Grace & Co. According to a New York Times account the company was incorporated, as part of estate and successor planning, in 1895. The three brothers consolidated most of their holdings into a new private company, incorporated in West Virginia, called W.R. Grace & Company. The consolidation involved W.R. Grace & Co. of New York, Grace Brothers & Co. of Lima, Peru, Grace & Co. of Valparaiso Chile, William R. Grace & Co. of London, and J. W. Grace & Co of San Francisco.[6]
According to its website, W.R. Grace & Co. was incorporated in Connecticut in 1899. The listed capital of $6 million did not include Grace Brothers & Co. Limited in London or its branches in San Francisco, Lima and Callao, Peru, nor in Valparaiso, Santiago, and Concepción, Chile.[7]
J. Louis Schaefer, who joined the company as a boy, would play a key role in not only W.R. Grace & Company, in which he became a vice president, but also as president of Grace National Bank. Schaefer would be a co-executor of the estate of Michael Grace with William's son and corporate successor, Joseph P. Grace. J. Louis Schaefer died in 1927.[8]
Shipping[edit]




Grace Line WWII poster


At one time, Grace's main business interest was in shipping. To get its products from Peru to North America and Europe, including guano and sugar, and noticing the need for other goods to be traded, William Grace founded a shipping division.[5] Grace Line began service in 1882,[9] with ports of call between Peru and New York. Regular steamship service was established in 1893, with a subsidiary called the New York & Pacific Steamship Co., that operated under the British flag. Ships built outside the United States prior to 1905 were banned from US registry. US-flag service began in 1912 with the Atlantic and Pacific Steamship Company. The activities of both companies and the parent firm were consolidated into the Grace Steamship Company beginning in 1916. The firm originally specialized in traffic to the west coast of South America; then later expanded into the Caribbean.
In 1916, Grace acquired a controlling interest in the Pacific Mail Steamship Company. In 1921, Pacific received five 535 ft. President class ships from the United States Shipping Board for transpacific operation. In 1923, the US Shipping board decided to place the five ships up for bid and Dollar Shipping Company won the bid. With no large ships for the transpacific operations Grace sold the Pacific Mail, its registered name, and goodwill to Dollar. Now without a transpacific service, Grace did not need the six intercoastal freighters and sold them off to the American Hawaiian Line. At this time Grace formed a new entity, the Panama Mail Steamship Company, to operate the smaller ships that were formerly owned and used by the Pacific Mail in the Central American trade. These ships were not involved in the sale to Dollar.[10]
On the death of William R. Grace in 1904, he was succeeded by William L. Sauders as company President followed by Joseph Peter Grace, Sr. (1872–1950) who became president in 1907. In 1938 the Colombian Line merged with Grace Line bringing an end to the Colombian Line.[11] During World War II Grace Lines operated numerous transports for the U.S. War Shipping Administration.[12]
J. Peter Grace, Jr. took over management of the company after his father suffered a stroke in 1945. After the war the Grace line operated 23 ships totaling 188,000 gross tons, and an additional 14 more on bareboat charters. In 1954 the company bought Davison Chemical Company (founded by William T. Davison as Davison, Kettlewell & Company in 1832), and the Dewey & Almy Chemical Company (founded in 1919 by Bradley Dewey and Charles Almy). In 1960 Grace Line, inspired by the pioneering efforts of Sea-Land Service, Matson Navigation, and Seatrain Lines, sought to begin containerizing its South American cargo operations by converting the conventional freighters Santa Eliana and Santa Leonor into fully cellular container ships. However, the effort was stymied by the opposition of longshoremen in New York and Venezuela and the ships were repeatedly laid up idle and were ultimately sold to the domestic container line Sea-Land Service in 1964.[13][14] In 1963 Grace made a second attempt to containerize its South American trade when it ordered the four M-class combination passenger-cargo ships Santa Magdalaena, Santa Maria, Santa Mariana and Santa Mercedes with partial cellular holds, but they were no more successful as mixing conventional break-bulk cargo and containers in the same ship negated the operating economies that full containerization promised.[15]
The company bought a 53% stake in Miller Brewing in 1966, for $36 million; Lorraine Mulberger sold the stake for religious reasons.[16] It sold the Miller stake in 1969 to Philip Morris for $130 million, topping a deal with PepsiCo for $120 million.[17][18][19] In 1969 Grace also exited the shipping business to concentrate on its chemical and diversification ventures. Grace Line was sold and merged into Prudential Line in 1970, which was renamed Prudential Grace Line, and was itself in turn taken over by Delta Lines in 1978, thereby extinguishing the name Grace in ocean shipping.[20] In 1987, by siting a can sealing plant in Shanghai, Grace became the first wholly foreign-owned company to do business in The People's Republic of China.
Airline[edit]
In 1928, Grace and Pan American Airways jointly formed Pan American-Grace Airways known as Panagra, establishing the first air link between the North and South America, that began operation in 1929.[21]
Headquarters[edit]
The company has its headquarters in Columbia, an unincorporated census-designated place in Howard County, Maryland.[22][23] Although W.R. Grace commissioned the Grace Building in New York City, built in 1971, the company no longer has any offices at that location.
Previously the company had its headquarters in Boca Raton, Florida.[24][25] Prior to its closing, the Boca Raton headquarters had about 130 employees. On January 27, 1999 it announced it was moving its administrative staff to the Columbia office and closing the Boca Raton headquarters.[26] About 40 of the employees went to Columbia, and some employees went to Cambridge, Massachusetts.[24] In 2014, the company emerged from a 13-year bankruptcy case stemming from asbestos claims, and immediately built a new 90,000sqft headquarters building on its 160-acre Columbia campus.[27]

Contamination incidents[edit]
W.R. Grace and Company has been involved in a number of controversial incidents of proven and alleged corporate crimes, including exposing workers and residents of an entire town to asbestos contamination in Libby[34] and Troy, Montana, water contamination (the basis of the book and film A Civil Action) in Woburn, Massachusetts, and an Acton, Massachusetts, Superfund site.
Asbestos[edit]
While Grace no longer makes asbestos-related products, W.R. Grace and Company has faced more than 270,000 asbestos-related lawsuits, of which 150,000 have been settled or dismissed and 120,000 remain.[35]
After asbestos injury claims unexpectedly nearly doubled in 2000, W.R. Grace & Company filed for bankruptcy protection in 2001. The United States Department of Justice alleged that Grace had transferred $4 to 5 billion to subsidiary companies that it had recently purchased, shortly before declaring bankruptcy. Justice Department attorneys alleged that this amounted to a fraudulent transfer of money in order to protect Grace from civil suits related to asbestos. The bankruptcy court ordered the companies to return nearly $1 billion to Grace, which will remain as part of the assets to consider in the bankruptcy hearings.
Asbestos court case[edit]
In 2005, the U.S. Department of Justice began criminal proceedings against W.R. Grace. On February 7, 2005, the department announced that a grand jury in Montana indicted W.R. Grace and seven current and former Grace executives for knowingly endangering residents of Libby, Montana, and concealing information about the health effects of its asbestos mining operations. According to the indictment, W.R. Grace and its executives, as far back as the 1970s, attempted to conceal information about the adverse health effects of the company’s vermiculite mining operations and distribution of vermiculite in the Libby, Montana, community. The defendants are also accused of obstructing the government’s cleanup efforts and wire fraud. To date, according to the indictment, approximately 1,200 residents of Libby area have been identified as suffering from some kind of asbestos-related abnormality.[36]
The criminal trial began in February 2009 after years of pretrial proceedings which reached the United States Supreme Court.[37] By the time the trial was set to begin, one of the defendants, Alan Stringer, had died of cancer. David Uhlmann, a former top environmental crimes prosecutor has been quoted as saying about W.R. Grace & Co.: "There's never been a case where so many people were sickened or killed by environmental crime." The W.R. Grace case long festered in the court system on a 10-count indictment including charges of wire fraud and obstruction of justice. W.R. Grace has voluntarily paid millions of dollars in medical bills for 900 Libby residents.[citation needed]
On Friday, May 8, 2009, W.R. Grace & Co. was acquitted of charges that it knowingly harmed the people of Libby, Montana. It was also acquitted of subsequently participating in any cover-up. Fred Festa, chairman, president and CEO said in a statement, "the company worked hard to keep the operations in compliance with the laws and standards of the day.[citation needed]
In popular culture[edit]

The movie A Civil Action, starring John Travolta, was based on the Grace groundwater contamination law suits in Woburn, MA.
The PBS television show P.O.V., which highlights independent films, in August 2007 premiered the movie Libby, Montana that documents the thousands of people in Libby, Montana, that have been exposed to and are suffering the effects of exposure to asbestos. The show also discusses the criminal indictments of many Grace executives for covering up the asbestos related illnesses and deaths.
PBS also aired "Dust to Dust", a documentary produced by Michael Brown Productions, Inc. in 2002. "Dust to Dust" reports on the more than 200 people who have died from asbestos exposure in Libby, Montana. The film focuses on the plights of several of these individuals and the damage done over almost 30 years while the mine was operated by W.R. Grace.
NPR ran a piece on their show All Things Considered discussing the criminal charges against W.R. Grace. A U.S. attorney general alleges that the company and managers of the mine in Libby, Montana, knew about the dangers of the asbestos they were dumping into the air for over 20 years.[38]
A University of Montana photojournalism master's thesis, Living with Grace, explored the ramifications of living with asbestosis, a disease associated with the vermiculite mine run by W.R. Grace.
On February 19, 2008, the radio show Here and Now broadcast a story about the film Libby, Montana, which details the asbestos contamination in the town of that name.[39]
On April 22, 2009, the television and radio program Democracy Now! broadcast two segments on the trial of W.R. Grace and some of its employees related to the asbestos contamination in Libby, Montana.[40][41] Democracy Now! also broadcast a follow-up interview on May 12, 2009 with activist Gayla Benefield and Andrea Peacock, a Montana independent political and environmental journalist.[42] This interview focused on reactions to the not-guilty verdict in the federal trial, where W.R. Grace and three former executives were acquitted on charges of knowingly exposing workers and townspeople to asbestos, and subsequently participating in a cover-up.

Neem patent[edit]
In 1995, the European Patent Office (EPO) granted a patent on an anti-fungal product derived from the neem tree to the United States Department of Agriculture and W. R. Grace.[43] The Indian government challenged the patent when it was granted, claiming that the process for which the patent had been granted had been in use in India for more than 2,000 years. In 2000, the EPO ruled in India's favour, but W. R. Grace appealed, claiming that prior art about the product had never been published in a scientific journal. On 8 March 2005, that appeal was lost and the EPO revoked the Neem patent.[43]

History[edit]
W.R. Grace and Company was founded in 1854, in Peru, by William Russell Grace, who left Ireland due to the potato famine, and traveled to South America with his father and family. He went first to Peru to work as a ship's chandler for the firm of Bryce and Company, to the merchantmen harvesting guano (bird droppings), used as a fertilizer and gunpowder ingredient due to its high levels of phosphorus and nitrogen.
His brother Michael joined the business and in 1865 the company name was changed to Grace Brothers & Co. The company set up head office operations in New York City in 1865. Working in fertilizer and machinery, the company was formally chartered in 1872, and incorporated in 1895.[5]
Incorporation[edit]
There are two accounts of the incorporation date of W.R. Grace & Co. According to a New York Times account the company was incorporated, as part of estate and successor planning, in 1895. The three brothers consolidated most of their holdings into a new private company, incorporated in West Virginia, called W.R. Grace & Company. The consolidation involved W.R. Grace & Co. of New York, Grace Brothers & Co. of Lima, Peru, Grace & Co. of Valparaiso Chile, William R. Grace & Co. of London, and J. W. Grace & Co of San Francisco.[6]
According to its website, W.R. Grace & Co. was incorporated in Connecticut in 1899. The listed capital of $6 million did not include Grace Brothers & Co. Limited in London or its branches in San Francisco, Lima and Callao, Peru, nor in Valparaiso, Santiago, and Concepción, Chile.[7]
J. Louis Schaefer, who joined the company as a boy, would play a key role in not only W.R. Grace & Company, in which he became a vice president, but also as president of Grace National Bank. Schaefer would be a co-executor of the estate of Michael Grace with William's son and corporate successor, Joseph P. Grace. J. Louis Schaefer died in 1927.[8]
Shipping[edit]




Grace Line WWII poster


At one time, Grace's main business interest was in shipping. To get its products from Peru to North America and Europe, including guano and sugar, and noticing the need for other goods to be traded, William Grace founded a shipping division.[5] Grace Line began service in 1882,[9] with ports of call between Peru and New York. Regular steamship service was established in 1893, with a subsidiary called the New York & Pacific Steamship Co., that operated under the British flag. Ships built outside the United States prior to 1905 were banned from US registry. US-flag service began in 1912 with the Atlantic and Pacific Steamship Company. The activities of both companies and the parent firm were consolidated into the Grace Steamship Company beginning in 1916. The firm originally specialized in traffic to the west coast of South America; then later expanded into the Caribbean.
In 1916, Grace acquired a controlling interest in the Pacific Mail Steamship Company. In 1921, Pacific received five 535 ft. President class ships from the United States Shipping Board for transpacific operation. In 1923, the US Shipping board decided to place the five ships up for bid and Dollar Shipping Company won the bid. With no large ships for the transpacific operations Grace sold the Pacific Mail, its registered name, and goodwill to Dollar. Now without a transpacific service, Grace did not need the six intercoastal freighters and sold them off to the American Hawaiian Line. At this time Grace formed a new entity, the Panama Mail Steamship Company, to operate the smaller ships that were formerly owned and used by the Pacific Mail in the Central American trade. These ships were not involved in the sale to Dollar.[10]
On the death of William R. Grace in 1904, he was succeeded by William L. Sauders as company President followed by Joseph Peter Grace, Sr. (1872–1950) who became president in 1907. In 1938 the Colombian Line merged with Grace Line bringing an end to the Colombian Line.[11] During World War II Grace Lines operated numerous transports for the U.S. War Shipping Administration.[12]
J. Peter Grace, Jr. took over management of the company after his father suffered a stroke in 1945. After the war the Grace line operated 23 ships totaling 188,000 gross tons, and an additional 14 more on bareboat charters. In 1954 the company bought Davison Chemical Company (founded by William T. Davison as Davison, Kettlewell & Company in 1832), and the Dewey & Almy Chemical Company (founded in 1919 by Bradley Dewey and Charles Almy). In 1960 Grace Line, inspired by the pioneering efforts of Sea-Land Service, Matson Navigation, and Seatrain Lines, sought to begin containerizing its South American cargo operations by converting the conventional freighters Santa Eliana and Santa Leonor into fully cellular container ships. However, the effort was stymied by the opposition of longshoremen in New York and Venezuela and the ships were repeatedly laid up idle and were ultimately sold to the domestic container line Sea-Land Service in 1964.[13][14] In 1963 Grace made a second attempt to containerize its South American trade when it ordered the four M-class combination passenger-cargo ships Santa Magdalaena, Santa Maria, Santa Mariana and Santa Mercedes with partial cellular holds, but they were no more successful as mixing conventional break-bulk cargo and containers in the same ship negated the operating economies that full containerization promised.[15]
The company bought a 53% stake in Miller Brewing in 1966, for $36 million; Lorraine Mulberger sold the stake for religious reasons.[16] It sold the Miller stake in 1969 to Philip Morris for $130 million, topping a deal with PepsiCo for $120 million.[17][18][19] In 1969 Grace also exited the shipping business to concentrate on its chemical and diversification ventures. Grace Line was sold and merged into Prudential Line in 1970, which was renamed Prudential Grace Line, and was itself in turn taken over by Delta Lines in 1978, thereby extinguishing the name Grace in ocean shipping.[20] In 1987, by siting a can sealing plant in Shanghai, Grace became the first wholly foreign-owned company to do business in The People's Republic of China.
Airline[edit]
In 1928, Grace and Pan American Airways jointly formed Pan American-Grace Airways known as Panagra, establishing the first air link between the North and South America, that began operation in 1929.[21]
Headquarters[edit]
The company has its headquarters in Columbia, an unincorporated census-designated place in Howard County, Maryland.[22][23] Although W.R. Grace commissioned the Grace Building in New York City, built in 1971, the company no longer has any offices at that location.
Previously the company had its headquarters in Boca Raton, Florida.[24][25] Prior to its closing, the Boca Raton headquarters had about 130 employees. On January 27, 1999 it announced it was moving its administrative staff to the Columbia office and closing the Boca Raton headquarters.[26] About 40 of the employees went to Columbia, and some employees went to Cambridge, Massachusetts.[24] In 2014, the company emerged from a 13-year bankruptcy case stemming from asbestos claims, and immediately built a new 90,000sqft headquarters building on its 160-acre Columbia campus.[27]

Contamination incidents[edit]
W.R. Grace and Company has been involved in a number of controversial incidents of proven and alleged corporate crimes, including exposing workers and residents of an entire town to asbestos contamination in Libby[34] and Troy, Montana, water contamination (the basis of the book and film A Civil Action) in Woburn, Massachusetts, and an Acton, Massachusetts, Superfund site.
Asbestos[edit]
While Grace no longer makes asbestos-related products, W.R. Grace and Company has faced more than 270,000 asbestos-related lawsuits, of which 150,000 have been settled or dismissed and 120,000 remain.[35]
After asbestos injury claims unexpectedly nearly doubled in 2000, W.R. Grace & Company filed for bankruptcy protection in 2001. The United States Department of Justice alleged that Grace had transferred $4 to 5 billion to subsidiary companies that it had recently purchased, shortly before declaring bankruptcy. Justice Department attorneys alleged that this amounted to a fraudulent transfer of money in order to protect Grace from civil suits related to asbestos. The bankruptcy court ordered the companies to return nearly $1 billion to Grace, which will remain as part of the assets to consider in the bankruptcy hearings.
Asbestos court case[edit]
In 2005, the U.S. Department of Justice began criminal proceedings against W.R. Grace. On February 7, 2005, the department announced that a grand jury in Montana indicted W.R. Grace and seven current and former Grace executives for knowingly endangering residents of Libby, Montana, and concealing information about the health effects of its asbestos mining operations. According to the indictment, W.R. Grace and its executives, as far back as the 1970s, attempted to conceal information about the adverse health effects of the company’s vermiculite mining operations and distribution of vermiculite in the Libby, Montana, community. The defendants are also accused of obstructing the government’s cleanup efforts and wire fraud. To date, according to the indictment, approximately 1,200 residents of Libby area have been identified as suffering from some kind of asbestos-related abnormality.[36]
The criminal trial began in February 2009 after years of pretrial proceedings which reached the United States Supreme Court.[37] By the time the trial was set to begin, one of the defendants, Alan Stringer, had died of cancer. David Uhlmann, a former top environmental crimes prosecutor has been quoted as saying about W.R. Grace & Co.: "There's never been a case where so many people were sickened or killed by environmental crime." The W.R. Grace case long festered in the court system on a 10-count indictment including charges of wire fraud and obstruction of justice. W.R. Grace has voluntarily paid millions of dollars in medical bills for 900 Libby residents.[citation needed]
On Friday, May 8, 2009, W.R. Grace & Co. was acquitted of charges that it knowingly harmed the people of Libby, Montana. It was also acquitted of subsequently participating in any cover-up. Fred Festa, chairman, president and CEO said in a statement, "the company worked hard to keep the operations in compliance with the laws and standards of the day.[citation needed]
In popular culture[edit]

The movie A Civil Action, starring John Travolta, was based on the Grace groundwater contamination law suits in Woburn, MA.
The PBS television show P.O.V., which highlights independent films, in August 2007 premiered the movie Libby, Montana that documents the thousands of people in Libby, Montana, that have been exposed to and are suffering the effects of exposure to asbestos. The show also discusses the criminal indictments of many Grace executives for covering up the asbestos related illnesses and deaths.
PBS also aired "Dust to Dust", a documentary produced by Michael Brown Productions, Inc. in 2002. "Dust to Dust" reports on the more than 200 people who have died from asbestos exposure in Libby, Montana. The film focuses on the plights of several of these individuals and the damage done over almost 30 years while the mine was operated by W.R. Grace.
NPR ran a piece on their show All Things Considered discussing the criminal charges against W.R. Grace. A U.S. attorney general alleges that the company and managers of the mine in Libby, Montana, knew about the dangers of the asbestos they were dumping into the air for over 20 years.[38]
A University of Montana photojournalism master's thesis, Living with Grace, explored the ramifications of living with asbestosis, a disease associated with the vermiculite mine run by W.R. Grace.
On February 19, 2008, the radio show Here and Now broadcast a story about the film Libby, Montana, which details the asbestos contamination in the town of that name.[39]
On April 22, 2009, the television and radio program Democracy Now! broadcast two segments on the trial of W.R. Grace and some of its employees related to the asbestos contamination in Libby, Montana.[40][41] Democracy Now! also broadcast a follow-up interview on May 12, 2009 with activist Gayla Benefield and Andrea Peacock, a Montana independent political and environmental journalist.[42] This interview focused on reactions to the not-guilty verdict in the federal trial, where W.R. Grace and three former executives were acquitted on charges of knowingly exposing workers and townspeople to asbestos, and subsequently participating in a cover-up.

Neem patent[edit]
In 1995, the European Patent Office (EPO) granted a patent on an anti-fungal product derived from the neem tree to the United States Department of Agriculture and W. R. Grace.[43] The Indian government challenged the patent when it was granted, claiming that the process for which the patent had been granted had been in use in India for more than 2,000 years. In 2000, the EPO ruled in India's favour, but W. R. Grace appealed, claiming that prior art about the product had never been published in a scientific journal. On 8 March 2005, that appeal was lost and the EPO revoked the Neem patent.[43]

History[edit]
W.R. Grace and Company was founded in 1854, in Peru, by William Russell Grace, who left Ireland due to the potato famine, and traveled to South America with his father and family. He went first to Peru to work as a ship's chandler for the firm of Bryce and Company, to the merchantmen harvesting guano (bird droppings), used as a fertilizer and gunpowder ingredient due to its high levels of phosphorus and nitrogen.
His brother Michael joined the business and in 1865 the company name was changed to Grace Brothers & Co. The company set up head office operations in New York City in 1865. Working in fertilizer and machinery, the company was formally chartered in 1872, and incorporated in 1895.[5]
Incorporation[edit]
There are two accounts of the incorporation date of W.R. Grace & Co. According to a New York Times account the company was incorporated, as part of estate and successor planning, in 1895. The three brothers consolidated most of their holdings into a new private company, incorporated in West Virginia, called W.R. Grace & Company. The consolidation involved W.R. Grace & Co. of New York, Grace Brothers & Co. of Lima, Peru, Grace & Co. of Valparaiso Chile, William R. Grace & Co. of London, and J. W. Grace & Co of San Francisco.[6]
According to its website, W.R. Grace & Co. was incorporated in Connecticut in 1899. The listed capital of $6 million did not include Grace Brothers & Co. Limited in London or its branches in San Francisco, Lima and Callao, Peru, nor in Valparaiso, Santiago, and Concepción, Chile.[7]
J. Louis Schaefer, who joined the company as a boy, would play a key role in not only W.R. Grace & Company, in which he became a vice president, but also as president of Grace National Bank. Schaefer would be a co-executor of the estate of Michael Grace with William's son and corporate successor, Joseph P. Grace. J. Louis Schaefer died in 1927.[8]
Shipping[edit]




Grace Line WWII poster


At one time, Grace's main business interest was in shipping. To get its products from Peru to North America and Europe, including guano and sugar, and noticing the need for other goods to be traded, William Grace founded a shipping division.[5] Grace Line began service in 1882,[9] with ports of call between Peru and New York. Regular steamship service was established in 1893, with a subsidiary called the New York & Pacific Steamship Co., that operated under the British flag. Ships built outside the United States prior to 1905 were banned from US registry. US-flag service began in 1912 with the Atlantic and Pacific Steamship Company. The activities of both companies and the parent firm were consolidated into the Grace Steamship Company beginning in 1916. The firm originally specialized in traffic to the west coast of South America; then later expanded into the Caribbean.
In 1916, Grace acquired a controlling interest in the Pacific Mail Steamship Company. In 1921, Pacific received five 535 ft. President class ships from the United States Shipping Board for transpacific operation. In 1923, the US Shipping board decided to place the five ships up for bid and Dollar Shipping Company won the bid. With no large ships for the transpacific operations Grace sold the Pacific Mail, its registered name, and goodwill to Dollar. Now without a transpacific service, Grace did not need the six intercoastal freighters and sold them off to the American Hawaiian Line. At this time Grace formed a new entity, the Panama Mail Steamship Company, to operate the smaller ships that were formerly owned and used by the Pacific Mail in the Central American trade. These ships were not involved in the sale to Dollar.[10]
On the death of William R. Grace in 1904, he was succeeded by William L. Sauders as company President followed by Joseph Peter Grace, Sr. (1872–1950) who became president in 1907. In 1938 the Colombian Line merged with Grace Line bringing an end to the Colombian Line.[11] During World War II Grace Lines operated numerous transports for the U.S. War Shipping Administration.[12]
J. Peter Grace, Jr. took over management of the company after his father suffered a stroke in 1945. After the war the Grace line operated 23 ships totaling 188,000 gross tons, and an additional 14 more on bareboat charters. In 1954 the company bought Davison Chemical Company (founded by William T. Davison as Davison, Kettlewell & Company in 1832), and the Dewey & Almy Chemical Company (founded in 1919 by Bradley Dewey and Charles Almy). In 1960 Grace Line, inspired by the pioneering efforts of Sea-Land Service, Matson Navigation, and Seatrain Lines, sought to begin containerizing its South American cargo operations by converting the conventional freighters Santa Eliana and Santa Leonor into fully cellular container ships. However, the effort was stymied by the opposition of longshoremen in New York and Venezuela and the ships were repeatedly laid up idle and were ultimately sold to the domestic container line Sea-Land Service in 1964.[13][14] In 1963 Grace made a second attempt to containerize its South American trade when it ordered the four M-class combination passenger-cargo ships Santa Magdalaena, Santa Maria, Santa Mariana and Santa Mercedes with partial cellular holds, but they were no more successful as mixing conventional break-bulk cargo and containers in the same ship negated the operating economies that full containerization promised.[15]
The company bought a 53% stake in Miller Brewing in 1966, for $36 million; Lorraine Mulberger sold the stake for religious reasons.[16] It sold the Miller stake in 1969 to Philip Morris for $130 million, topping a deal with PepsiCo for $120 million.[17][18][19] In 1969 Grace also exited the shipping business to concentrate on its chemical and diversification ventures. Grace Line was sold and merged into Prudential Line in 1970, which was renamed Prudential Grace Line, and was itself in turn taken over by Delta Lines in 1978, thereby extinguishing the name Grace in ocean shipping.[20] In 1987, by siting a can sealing plant in Shanghai, Grace became the first wholly foreign-owned company to do business in The People's Republic of China.
Airline[edit]
In 1928, Grace and Pan American Airways jointly formed Pan American-Grace Airways known as Panagra, establishing the first air link between the North and South America, that began operation in 1929.[21]
Headquarters[edit]
The company has its headquarters in Columbia, an unincorporated census-designated place in Howard County, Maryland.[22][23] Although W.R. Grace commissioned the Grace Building in New York City, built in 1971, the company no longer has any offices at that location.
Previously the company had its headquarters in Boca Raton, Florida.[24][25] Prior to its closing, the Boca Raton headquarters had about 130 employees. On January 27, 1999 it announced it was moving its administrative staff to the Columbia office and closing the Boca Raton headquarters.[26] About 40 of the employees went to Columbia, and some employees went to Cambridge, Massachusetts.[24] In 2014, the company emerged from a 13-year bankruptcy case stemming from asbestos claims, and immediately built a new 90,000sqft headquarters building on its 160-acre Columbia campus.[27]
Subsidiaries and products[edit]

Contamination incidents[edit]
W.R. Grace and Company has been involved in a number of controversial incidents of proven and alleged corporate crimes, including exposing workers and residents of an entire town to asbestos contamination in Libby[34] and Troy, Montana, water contamination (the basis of the book and film A Civil Action) in Woburn, Massachusetts, and an Acton, Massachusetts, Superfund site.
Asbestos[edit]
While Grace no longer makes asbestos-related products, W.R. Grace and Company has faced more than 270,000 asbestos-related lawsuits, of which 150,000 have been settled or dismissed and 120,000 remain.[35]
After asbestos injury claims unexpectedly nearly doubled in 2000, W.R. Grace & Company filed for bankruptcy protection in 2001. The United States Department of Justice alleged that Grace had transferred $4 to 5 billion to subsidiary companies that it had recently purchased, shortly before declaring bankruptcy. Justice Department attorneys alleged that this amounted to a fraudulent transfer of money in order to protect Grace from civil suits related to asbestos. The bankruptcy court ordered the companies to return nearly $1 billion to Grace, which will remain as part of the assets to consider in the bankruptcy hearings.
Asbestos court case[edit]
In 2005, the U.S. Department of Justice began criminal proceedings against W.R. Grace. On February 7, 2005, the department announced that a grand jury in Montana indicted W.R. Grace and seven current and former Grace executives for knowingly endangering residents of Libby, Montana, and concealing information about the health effects of its asbestos mining operations. According to the indictment, W.R. Grace and its executives, as far back as the 1970s, attempted to conceal information about the adverse health effects of the company’s vermiculite mining operations and distribution of vermiculite in the Libby, Montana, community. The defendants are also accused of obstructing the government’s cleanup efforts and wire fraud. To date, according to the indictment, approximately 1,200 residents of Libby area have been identified as suffering from some kind of asbestos-related abnormality.[36]
The criminal trial began in February 2009 after years of pretrial proceedings which reached the United States Supreme Court.[37] By the time the trial was set to begin, one of the defendants, Alan Stringer, had died of cancer. David Uhlmann, a former top environmental crimes prosecutor has been quoted as saying about W.R. Grace & Co.: "There's never been a case where so many people were sickened or killed by environmental crime." The W.R. Grace case long festered in the court system on a 10-count indictment including charges of wire fraud and obstruction of justice. W.R. Grace has voluntarily paid millions of dollars in medical bills for 900 Libby residents.[citation needed]
On Friday, May 8, 2009, W.R. Grace & Co. was acquitted of charges that it knowingly harmed the people of Libby, Montana. It was also acquitted of subsequently participating in any cover-up. Fred Festa, chairman, president and CEO said in a statement, "the company worked hard to keep the operations in compliance with the laws and standards of the day.[citation needed]
In popular culture[edit]

The movie A Civil Action, starring John Travolta, was based on the Grace groundwater contamination law suits in Woburn, MA.
The PBS television show P.O.V., which highlights independent films, in August 2007 premiered the movie Libby, Montana that documents the thousands of people in Libby, Montana, that have been exposed to and are suffering the effects of exposure to asbestos. The show also discusses the criminal indictments of many Grace executives for covering up the asbestos related illnesses and deaths.
PBS also aired "Dust to Dust", a documentary produced by Michael Brown Productions, Inc. in 2002. "Dust to Dust" reports on the more than 200 people who have died from asbestos exposure in Libby, Montana. The film focuses on the plights of several of these individuals and the damage done over almost 30 years while the mine was operated by W.R. Grace.
NPR ran a piece on their show All Things Considered discussing the criminal charges against W.R. Grace. A U.S. attorney general alleges that the company and managers of the mine in Libby, Montana, knew about the dangers of the asbestos they were dumping into the air for over 20 years.[38]
A University of Montana photojournalism master's thesis, Living with Grace, explored the ramifications of living with asbestosis, a disease associated with the vermiculite mine run by W.R. Grace.
On February 19, 2008, the radio show Here and Now broadcast a story about the film Libby, Montana, which details the asbestos contamination in the town of that name.[39]
On April 22, 2009, the television and radio program Democracy Now! broadcast two segments on the trial of W.R. Grace and some of its employees related to the asbestos contamination in Libby, Montana.[40][41] Democracy Now! also broadcast a follow-up interview on May 12, 2009 with activist Gayla Benefield and Andrea Peacock, a Montana independent political and environmental journalist.[42] This interview focused on reactions to the not-guilty verdict in the federal trial, where W.R. Grace and three former executives were acquitted on charges of knowingly exposing workers and townspeople to asbestos, and subsequently participating in a cover-up.

Neem patent[edit]
In 1995, the European Patent Office (EPO) granted a patent on an anti-fungal product derived from the neem tree to the United States Department of Agriculture and W. R. Grace.[43] The Indian government challenged the patent when it was granted, claiming that the process for which the patent had been granted had been in use in India for more than 2,000 years. In 2000, the EPO ruled in India's favour, but W. R. Grace appealed, claiming that prior art about the product had never been published in a scientific journal. On 8 March 2005, that appeal was lost and the EPO revoked the Neem patent.[43]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
