Why Repair?
By repairing your own household appliances and electronics, you are giving them a second chance and saving them from the landfill. You'll also reduce the amount of waste, power and gas it requires to manufacture and deliver new products.


 



							How to Locate Your Murray Model Number						



							If you’re reading this, you probably need some help finding the model number on your Murray product. Murray prints their model number on a sticker or etched plate. So you’ll want to start by trying to find that. If you've already found that, you’re ready to take your model number and start ordering parts. If not, check out some of our suggestions on finding the nameplate below:

If you have a Murray riding lawnmower, then look under the seat for the nameplate. 

If you have a walk-behind mower, check the mower’s deck, usually they place the nameplate in the center of it.

Our Customer Service team is always happy to help you search for your model number, so feel free to call us at (866) 802-6383 if you have trouble finding your tool’s information.







							Need a Hand with Your Murray Repair?						

							Our great relationship with Murray means that you’ll get the best quality OEM parts from our warehouse and the best expert advice from our technicians. So if you need a little help replacing the lawn mower blade on your Murray 30503x11A or repairing an auger shaft on a Murray 1694997, we have you covered with both a big stock of replacement parts and expert advice. 

We encourage visitors to browse our parts lists and Repair Forum to see what we can offer you. We’re confident that with our resources, we can help you through even the toughest situation.

					If you’ve ever owned a Murray product, you’ll understand why they  continue growing into one of the largest power equipment companies in the world. Simply put, their machines get the job done, no matter how tough it is. 

Their association with Briggs and Stratton makes their quality unmatched. So if you’re sick of spending hours shoveling snow or pushing a lawnmower, upgrade with a Murray and see why they are the choice for so many professionals.
