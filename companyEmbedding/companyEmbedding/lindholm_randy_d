Sanarus Medical Inc. Appoints Randy D. Lindholm to Board of Directors  











Tweet








3/27/2007 12:03:19 PM



    PLEASANTON, Calif., March 27 /PRNewswire/ -- Sanarus Medical, Inc., a leading developer of minimally invasive medical devices for diagnosing and treating breast disease, announced today that Randy D. Lindholm, was elected to the Sanarus board of directors.
    "Randy's many years of strategic and operational experience in the medical device industry make him a valuable addition to Sanarus's board of directors," said John Howe, President and Chief Executive Officer of Sanarus. "We look forward to his contributions as Sanarus continues to focus its efforts on commercializing innovative cryotechnology products for treating breast disease."
    Mr. Lindholm is the former Chairman, President and CEO of VidaMed, Inc., a medical device company that specialized in RF energy based urological systems for the treatment of benign prostate enlargement. VidaMed was sold to Medtronic in 2002 for $326 million. Prior to VidaMed, Mr. Lindholm held senior sales and marketing positions at Nellcor Puritan Bennett, and began his career at GE Medical Systems, where he held many senior sales and field marketing positions. Mr. Lindholm also currently sits on the board of directors of publicly held Omnicell, as well as privately held Barrx Medical and Hoana Medical. In addition, he has previously served on the board of directors of Rita Medical, Microvention and Metrika.
    "The Sanarus technology is truly changing the way breast disease is managed and treated," said Mr. Lindholm. "Sanarus is offering patients new options for diagnosing and addressing breast tumors in the physicians' office, rather than a hospital setting. I'm excited to be working with John and the Sanarus board."
    About Sanarus Medical
    Sanarus Medical, Inc., headquartered in Pleasanton, California, is dedicated to advancing women's health by providing a full line of minimally invasive products for the diagnosis and treatment of breast disease. The company is founded in innovative proprietary cryo-technologies uniquely designed for breast biopsy, tumor localization and ablation. The Sanarus cryoablation technology enables a safe and effective office-based procedure at reduced cost.  This provides an important alternative for women that currently have to undergo an operating room based, surgically intensive procedure. Privately held, Sanarus Medical is funded by leading healthcare venture capital investors, including U.S. Venture Partners, Forward Ventures, Federated Kaufman Funds, Alta Partners, Pequot Ventures, Easton Capital Partners, Mosaix Ventures, Industry Ventures, and CHANNEL Medical Partners.
