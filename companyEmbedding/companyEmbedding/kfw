KFW SeriesWaterproof Foil Strain Gages





Summary
The KFW seres foil strain gages have the surface covered with a special resin for waterproofing. The waterproof structure enables these gages to serve for outdoor or underwater measurement merely by being bonded to measuring objects. The insulation resistance shows virtually no deterioration even after 100 hours of use under underwater pressure of approximately 10 MPa. In addition, the covering resin is flexible enough to enable easy bonding to curved surfaces.Click here for the [Strain Gages with Pre-attached Lead Cables]

The KfW, formerly KfW Bankengruppe (banking group), is a German government-owned development bank, based in Frankfurt. Its name originally comes from Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau ("Reconstruction Credit Institute"). It was formed in 1948 after World War II as part of the Marshall Plan.
It is owned by the Federal Republic of Germany (80 percent) and the States of Germany (20 percent).[4] It is led by a six-member Managing Board headed by Ulrich Schröder, which in turn reports to a 37 member Supervisory Board. The chair of the Supervisory Board changes annually between the German Federal Ministers of Finance and Economic Affairs. The chairman for 2015 is Wolfgang Schäuble.
In 2009, Caisse des Dépots, Cassa Depositi e Prestiti, KfW and European Investment Bank founded the Long-Term Investors Club.[5]

Operations[edit]
KfW banking group covers over 90% of its borrowing needs in the capital markets, mainly through bonds that are guaranteed by the federal government. This allows KfW to raise funds at advantageous conditions. Its exemption from having to pay corporate taxes due to its legal status as a public agency and unremunerated equity provided by its public shareholders allow KfW to provide loans for purposes prescribed by the KfW law at lower rates than commercial banks. KfW is not allowed to compete with commercial banks, but it facilitates their business in areas within its mandate. KfW banking group has three business units with distinct functions, as well as several subsidiaries.
Lending by KfW group’s two main business units, accounting for more than 90% of total lending, is in Germany and, to a limited extent, in other European countries. However, its largest subsidiary, KfW IPEX Bank GmbH, predominantly lends internationally. A smaller subsidiary, the German Investment Corporation (DEG), and one of the group’s smaller business units, KfW Development Bank, are exclusively active in the international arena, each within their particular business areas.
Subsidiaries and group units[edit]
Housing and environment[edit]
KfW Förderbank (KfW promotional Bank), the largest business unit of the group, committed €47.6 billion in 2014, mostly for housing and environmental protection in Germany.[6] It is especially active in promoting energy-efficient housing for owner-occupied houses as well as for landlords, both for new houses and refurbishments.[7] Its energy efficiency standards for houses (KfW-60 and KfW-40) have become accepted standards in Germany. Concerning environmental protection, it promotes, among others, photovoltaic energy (solar cells) which has in turn received massive indirect subsidies through feed-in tariffs[8] under the Renewable Energy Law of 2000. It also invests in municipal infrastructure such as public transport and sanitation through a sub-unit called KfW Kommunalbank (KfW municipal bank). More recently,[when?] it has also engaged in education where it provides student loans.
Small and medium enterprises[edit]
KfW Mittelstandsbank (which roughly translates as KfW small and medium enterprises bank), the second largest business unit of the group, provides assistance to German small and medium enterprises (SMEs) including individual entrepreneurs and start-ups. In addition to loans it also provides equity and mezzanine financing. Its financing totaled €20.4 billion in 2015. [9]
KfW has been very active in securitization before this market collapsed during the subprime mortgage crisis. Through securitization it helped commercial banks to transfer risks from their housing and SME portfolios to the capital market. KfW also provides loans to European commercial banks to help them finance SMEs, housing and infrastructure (so-called global loans).
Development aid[edit]
KfW Entwicklungsbank (KfW Development Bank) provides financing to governments, public enterprises and commercial banks engaged in microfinance and SME promotion in developing countries. It does so through loans close to market terms using its own resources ("promotional loans"), soft loans that blend KfW resources with support from the federal government's aid budget ("development loans"), as well as highly subsidized loans and grants, the latter two coming entirely from the federal aid budget. Different country groups are offered different financing conditions depending mainly on their per capita income. All these financing instruments are part of what is officially called development cooperation and is more commonly called "development aid".
In German aid, the work of KfW Development Bank is called "financial cooperation" which is complemented by "technical cooperation" by GIZ and other public agencies. The main sectors of financial cooperation are water supply and sanitation, renewable energy and energy efficiency, as well as the development of the financial sector. KfW development bank also works, among other sectors, in health, education, agriculture, forestry, solid waste management. It provided €7.4 billion in loans and grants in 2014.[6]
Export and project finance[edit]
The largest subsidiary of KfW banking group is KfW IPEX-Bank. KfW IPEX-Bank is active in project finance and corporate finance related to German or European exports. It also promotes foreign investments in Germany. Unlike KfW, it competes directly with commercial banks. Therefore, and in response to concerns voiced by the European Commission concerning unfair competition, KfW IPEX-Bank has become legally and financially independent in 2008. KfW IPEX-Bank's main sectors of activity are ports, airports, toll roads, bridges and tunnels, railways, ships, planes, telecommunications, energy, and manufacturing. In 2014 the balance sheet total of KfW IPEX-Bank amounted to €26.3 billion.[6]
Another subsidiary of KfW banking group, the German Investment Corporation (DEG), takes minority equity stakes and provides loans to private companies investing in developing countries. It pursues a business model broadly similar to that of the International Finance Corporation of the World Bank Group. Its main sectors of activity are banking, agro-business, renewable energy, telecommunications and manufacturing. It lent 1.2 billion[clarification needed] in 2008.[6] In September 2008, as investors were scrambling to get their funds out of Lehman Brothers, KfW wired 426 million[clarification needed] to Lehman. Germany's largest circulation newspaper, Bild, subsequently called KfW "Germany's Dumbest Bank".[10]
Collaboration with IDBI Bank[edit]
IDBI Bank Ltd, through its DIFC Branch in Dubai, has signed a loan agreement for USD 340 million with KfW, Germany. The loan has a maturity of 10 years and carries a competitive rate of interest. Shri Melwyn Rego, Deputy Managing Director of IDBI Bank Ltd. represented IDBI Bank Ltd. and Dr. Norbert Kloppenburg, Member of the Executive Board of KfW represented KfW at the signing ceremony held in New Delhi.The loan would be availed by IDBI Bank Ltd. for funding loans to the micro-, smalland medium-sized enterprises (MSME) directly or indirectly through Microfinance Institutions (MFI’s) and Non Banking Finance Companies (NBFC’s). Part of the loan is dedicated for selected infrastructure projects to support municipalities and communities to improve health and living conditions.[11]
Awards[edit]
The magazine Global Finance rated KfW as the safest bank in the world in its "World's 50 Safest Banks 2014" rating. The rating was based on long-term foreign currency ratings from Fitch Ratings and Standard and Poor's and the long-term bank deposit ratings from Moody's Investors Service.[12]

Operations[edit]
KfW banking group covers over 90% of its borrowing needs in the capital markets, mainly through bonds that are guaranteed by the federal government. This allows KfW to raise funds at advantageous conditions. Its exemption from having to pay corporate taxes due to its legal status as a public agency and unremunerated equity provided by its public shareholders allow KfW to provide loans for purposes prescribed by the KfW law at lower rates than commercial banks. KfW is not allowed to compete with commercial banks, but it facilitates their business in areas within its mandate. KfW banking group has three business units with distinct functions, as well as several subsidiaries.
Lending by KfW group’s two main business units, accounting for more than 90% of total lending, is in Germany and, to a limited extent, in other European countries. However, its largest subsidiary, KfW IPEX Bank GmbH, predominantly lends internationally. A smaller subsidiary, the German Investment Corporation (DEG), and one of the group’s smaller business units, KfW Development Bank, are exclusively active in the international arena, each within their particular business areas.
Subsidiaries and group units[edit]
Housing and environment[edit]
KfW Förderbank (KfW promotional Bank), the largest business unit of the group, committed €47.6 billion in 2014, mostly for housing and environmental protection in Germany.[6] It is especially active in promoting energy-efficient housing for owner-occupied houses as well as for landlords, both for new houses and refurbishments.[7] Its energy efficiency standards for houses (KfW-60 and KfW-40) have become accepted standards in Germany. Concerning environmental protection, it promotes, among others, photovoltaic energy (solar cells) which has in turn received massive indirect subsidies through feed-in tariffs[8] under the Renewable Energy Law of 2000. It also invests in municipal infrastructure such as public transport and sanitation through a sub-unit called KfW Kommunalbank (KfW municipal bank). More recently,[when?] it has also engaged in education where it provides student loans.
Small and medium enterprises[edit]
KfW Mittelstandsbank (which roughly translates as KfW small and medium enterprises bank), the second largest business unit of the group, provides assistance to German small and medium enterprises (SMEs) including individual entrepreneurs and start-ups. In addition to loans it also provides equity and mezzanine financing. Its financing totaled €20.4 billion in 2015. [9]
KfW has been very active in securitization before this market collapsed during the subprime mortgage crisis. Through securitization it helped commercial banks to transfer risks from their housing and SME portfolios to the capital market. KfW also provides loans to European commercial banks to help them finance SMEs, housing and infrastructure (so-called global loans).
Development aid[edit]
KfW Entwicklungsbank (KfW Development Bank) provides financing to governments, public enterprises and commercial banks engaged in microfinance and SME promotion in developing countries. It does so through loans close to market terms using its own resources ("promotional loans"), soft loans that blend KfW resources with support from the federal government's aid budget ("development loans"), as well as highly subsidized loans and grants, the latter two coming entirely from the federal aid budget. Different country groups are offered different financing conditions depending mainly on their per capita income. All these financing instruments are part of what is officially called development cooperation and is more commonly called "development aid".
In German aid, the work of KfW Development Bank is called "financial cooperation" which is complemented by "technical cooperation" by GIZ and other public agencies. The main sectors of financial cooperation are water supply and sanitation, renewable energy and energy efficiency, as well as the development of the financial sector. KfW development bank also works, among other sectors, in health, education, agriculture, forestry, solid waste management. It provided €7.4 billion in loans and grants in 2014.[6]
Export and project finance[edit]
The largest subsidiary of KfW banking group is KfW IPEX-Bank. KfW IPEX-Bank is active in project finance and corporate finance related to German or European exports. It also promotes foreign investments in Germany. Unlike KfW, it competes directly with commercial banks. Therefore, and in response to concerns voiced by the European Commission concerning unfair competition, KfW IPEX-Bank has become legally and financially independent in 2008. KfW IPEX-Bank's main sectors of activity are ports, airports, toll roads, bridges and tunnels, railways, ships, planes, telecommunications, energy, and manufacturing. In 2014 the balance sheet total of KfW IPEX-Bank amounted to €26.3 billion.[6]
Another subsidiary of KfW banking group, the German Investment Corporation (DEG), takes minority equity stakes and provides loans to private companies investing in developing countries. It pursues a business model broadly similar to that of the International Finance Corporation of the World Bank Group. Its main sectors of activity are banking, agro-business, renewable energy, telecommunications and manufacturing. It lent 1.2 billion[clarification needed] in 2008.[6] In September 2008, as investors were scrambling to get their funds out of Lehman Brothers, KfW wired 426 million[clarification needed] to Lehman. Germany's largest circulation newspaper, Bild, subsequently called KfW "Germany's Dumbest Bank".[10]
Collaboration with IDBI Bank[edit]
IDBI Bank Ltd, through its DIFC Branch in Dubai, has signed a loan agreement for USD 340 million with KfW, Germany. The loan has a maturity of 10 years and carries a competitive rate of interest. Shri Melwyn Rego, Deputy Managing Director of IDBI Bank Ltd. represented IDBI Bank Ltd. and Dr. Norbert Kloppenburg, Member of the Executive Board of KfW represented KfW at the signing ceremony held in New Delhi.The loan would be availed by IDBI Bank Ltd. for funding loans to the micro-, smalland medium-sized enterprises (MSME) directly or indirectly through Microfinance Institutions (MFI’s) and Non Banking Finance Companies (NBFC’s). Part of the loan is dedicated for selected infrastructure projects to support municipalities and communities to improve health and living conditions.[11]
Awards[edit]
The magazine Global Finance rated KfW as the safest bank in the world in its "World's 50 Safest Banks 2014" rating. The rating was based on long-term foreign currency ratings from Fitch Ratings and Standard and Poor's and the long-term bank deposit ratings from Moody's Investors Service.[12]

KfW strengthens Germany's technological competitiveness with new venture capital product
Press Release from 2015-05-19 / Group



  Investments in venture capital fund of up to EUR 400 million over the next five years  First funds invested in Forbion FCF III life sciences fund  KfW, in collaboration with the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi), is improving financing for technology start-ups and young, innovative companies with its new promotional instrument "ERP Venture Capital Fund Investments". KfW is participating in selected venture capital funds in Germany and Europe. Venture capital funds make direct investments in young, growth-oriented technology companies, thereby strengthening their equity capital. With this new promotional instrument, KfW aims to help close the gap in the supply of follow-up financing for young technology companies during the start-up and growth phase."We will invest up to EUR 400 million over the next five years under the ERP Venture Capital Fund Investments, thus leveraging a fund volume of around EUR 2 billion for the venture capital market. This will provide considerable impetus for improving the supply of venture capital for technology start-ups and young, growth-oriented enterprises in Germany. We are strengthening the financial base for new, forward-thinking technology solutions in Germany," emphasised Dr Ingrid Hengster, Member of the KfW Executive Board.With this new product, KfW can invest in established funds as well as first time teams, i.e. newly formed fund companies and participate in first closings, thereby considerably stimulating the acquisition of further domestic and foreign institutional investors. The plan is for KfW to also act as an anchor investor to support the acquisition of private investors in VC funds.In addition to industries such as e-commerce and IT which enjoy a high level of public interest, funds that focus on, e.g. biotech, life sciences, medtech or cleantech, also rank high for KfW as a promotional bank; in other words, industries that impact Germany as a technology centre over the long run.KfW invested its first funds in the FCF III fund of Forbion Capital Partners, a life sciences venture capital company that is headquartered in the Netherlands and has an office in Munich. Forbion Capital Partners, which currently manages approx. EUR 540 million, invests venture capital exclusively in the life sciences sector (pharmaceuticals and medtech/diagnostics companies), primarily in Europe. "We are pleased to have acquired KfW as a strong and competent investor from Germany for our new fund. Germany offers excellent investment opportunities for us in all sectors of the life sciences industry. Over the last few weeks, the new FCF III fund already invested in 3 innovative companies, two of which are located in Germany," said Dr Holger Reithinger, general partner and head of the Munich office.

Our financial products
						


KfW Development Bank's support is adapted to the various requirements and conditions in the respective partner country. The funding model opted for depends on the size of a country's debt, its economic output and level of development, the performance capacity of the project partner as well as the type of project. The funding models include pure grants and loans from budget funds, but also loans that combine budget funds and KfW's own funds. The conditions for these kinds of loans are particularly favourable (interest, term). KfW also grants loans which are only comprised of KfW's own funds at terms and conditions commensurate to risk.






				
				Grants
			




Under German Financial Cooperation grants funded from the German Federal Government's budget are mainly allocated to poor and poorly developed countries. The funds are not repaid. However, to be eligible to receive this funding, development policy criteria must be met including the partner country's ownership and commitment. We mainly deploy grants and very low-interest standard loans in poor and poorly developed countries: in 2014, 39 % of the German Federal Government's budget funds were dedicated to Sub-Saharan Africa. More developed countries are also eligible for grants for projects that contribute directly to reducing poverty or to protecting global public goods such as, e. g., tropical rainforests.









				
				Development loans
			




In the case of development loans, KfW combines budget funds of the German Federal Government with own funds that it raises at favourable terms on the capital market. When our own funds are used, partner countries benefit from the cheap refinancing options available to KfW thanks to its AAA rating and a partial risk assumption by the German Federal Government. The development loans were created in collaboration with the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) to increase the funding volume for the projects and programmes in the partner countries. The terms and conditions are structured to ensure that the projects are able to bear the costs and that the loans comply with the international agreements for Official Development Assistance (ODA). Even though the terms of the development loans are higher than pure budget funds, they are significantly below market level.Development loans are generally structured as reduced-interest loans: only KfW's own funds, which are partially secured by a guarantee line from the German Federal Government, are deployed for the loans. We then lower the loan interest rates with grants from budget funds. The result is that the projects can be financed for the partners and the loans meet the ODA criteria for public development cooperation.









				
				Promotional loans
			




Promotional loans are loans to partners in developing countries and emerging economies commissioned by the government that are 100 % funded by KfW on the capital market. The loans are deployed for projects that are effective when it comes to development policy and viable in economic terms for which, however, funding is not available from the commercial banking sector (e. g. due to long financing terms required).The FC promotional loans aim to fill the gap between FC development loans and commercial bank loans and give German Financial Cooperation more flexible options for action. By granting promotional loans, KfW can provide more funding for eligible development projects without burdening the budget.
