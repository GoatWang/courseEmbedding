Company Website: http://chinapanocean.com/   Pan Ocean Container Supplies Co. Ltd.   (SYMBOL: PAOC)   According to Department of Homeland Security, there are more than 108 million containers worldwide and it is estimated that there are approximately 200 million shipboard trips annually among seaports around the world.  The maritime container shipping industry increases at an annual rate of about 10%. Almost 90% of the world’s manufactured goods are moved by container, and roughly 40% arriving by ship. In the USA alone there are more than 95% of non-North American trade arrives by ship, most of which is transported in maritime shipping containers. These containers consist of large and sturdy metal boxes, typically 8 ft wide by 8.5 ft high and 20-40 ft in length. Containers are moved frequently, being transferred often between ships, railroad cars and highway tractor-trailers.      Pan Ocean Container Supplies Co. Ltd   Pan Ocean Container Supplies Co. Ltd. (OTCBB: PAOC) utilizes innovative solutions to build industry-leading shipping and multipurpose containers. In order to execute a carefully engineered design concept, Pan Ocean is dedicated to manufacturing secure, green, intelligent, and lightweight containers. Recognized for its high industry standards, Pan Ocean was awarded its International Organization for Standardization (ISO) certification in January 2014. Manufacturing companies that meet ISO standards and are granted its seal of approval are regarded highly in the container manufacturing industry and to date the company offers five individualized containers.    Pan Ocean was founded in July 2012 and initiated production in July 2013. Based in Jiaxing, Zhejiang Province, Pan Ocean has become China’s leading enterprise in container manufacturing. Currently, the Company has a registered capital of $50 million dollars, with a total investment of $98 million dollars. The entire project requisition of land is 190,000 square meters (2.1M square feet), 80,000 square meters (861k square feet) of which is allocated to the building area and 11,000 square meters (118k square feet) is allocated to the container yard. The expected annual output is 180,000 TEU (twenty-foot equivalent unit).   There are four individual production plants: cold work fabrication, subassembly, main assembly and painting, respectively. Pan Ocean’s collaboration of advanced technology and expertise enables the company to produce secure, high quality, high-yield cargo containers in a cost-effective manner.     Market Opportunity  The Wall St. Journal cites that China's container ports have registered some of their biggest gains in port-handling volumes this year as a result of US economic growth and European economic recovery.  After analyzing the last month of the third quarter, 2014, WSJ found that “traffic at Chinese coastal container ports, which number more than a dozen, grew 6% in September.  According to analyst, Helane Becker, an increase in global GDP leads to container demand growth by two or three times. Global gross domestic product is a key indicator for global economy, which combines all individual economies worldwide. When looking at the gross domestic product / GDP of selected global regions, it is obvious that GDP is highest in industrialized countries.    Global GDP for 2014 according to Statista is at 4.13% up from 2013’s 3.6% and nearly an entire percentage point higher than that of 2012 (3.3%).  These figures support the potential growth containerized trade should see into the coming year. In addition to this, the competitive advantage for Pan Ocean stems from an successful mix of several key factors including:      Quality-certified with worldwide distribution capabilities  Well-established relationships with leading international shipping, leasing, and container trading companies  Clear strategy and design concept Advanced equipment to produce a high-yield Latest welding techniques to ensure the highest quality Cost efficient production processes  Situated in close proximity to major airports, ports and railways    Additional Opportunities for Pan Ocean Outside of Shipping   Pan Ocean represents a tremendous opportunity for the container manufacturing industry. In addition to a strategic alignment with major shipping, leasing, and container trading companies, PAOC has new product and expansion initiatives in the works. The new product comes in the form of shipping container homes. These eco-friendly, custom homes incorporate the latest technology of building architecture with shipping container. Therefore this ideal material will allow PAOC to build the homes efficiently and at a low cost.   More and more architects, builders, and prospective home owners are seeing the potential of shipping containers as modular building components in architecture and green prefab home building designs.  The ISO shipping container has been designed to stringent standards, not only to withstand the extreme weather conditions on sea voyages, but also to withstand the stacking of 9 fully laden containers makes it an ideal construction medium.     New Geography estimates that America will have to house some 100 million more people by 2040 so the demand for humane, affordable, sustainable housing is going to escalate dramatically in the coming years.  For most Americans, particularly millennials, the demand for affordable homes near workplaces will be paramount. Shipping crates have been used in construction for thousands of years but today the old practice is being revived with entrepreneurial, innovative, outside-the-box thinking.    These containers can be cut, fabricated, re-modeled, and turned into a basic home structure for approximately $25-$27 a square foot compared to the US median list price per square foot $120 according to Zillow. This puts a whole new industry in front of shipping container manufacturers and even if global shipping were to decline dramatically, these companies could still benefit from the increased demand for affordable housing solutions.     Opportunity To Capitalize On Value Proposition   In the shipping container industry there are several market leading companies that have continued to beat estimates.  Textainer Group Holdings Ltd. (TGH), which holds a current market cap of $1.98Billion, reported third-quarter earnings of $54.3 million. Earnings, adjusted for non-recurring gains, came to 88 cents per share, which beat Wall Street expectations. The average estimate of analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of 75 cents per share.     CAI International Inc. (CAP) with a current market cap of $458M, reported earnings of $16.4 million in its third quarter. Earnings, adjusted for non-recurring gains, were 69 cents per share and in line with Textainer, these results beat Wall Street expectations. The average estimate of analysts surveyed was for earnings of 66 cents per share.  So for investors looking to profit on shipping container companies, the industry looks ripe for future growth in our opinion.  Market participants like Textainer and CAI trade above $20 per share, currently Pan Ocean trades at $3.61/share with a market cap just slightly under $160M or about 1/3 that of CAI International.     Should things be held equal and Pan Ocean moves toward a similar market cap as CAI or even that of Textainer, price per share would be in the area of $10-$45 per share!  Currently Pan Ocean shows that it could be incredibly undervalued at its current trading price with massive potential to increase in value as the company continues to progress further in the shipping container industry.

	Pan Ocean Container Supplies Co. Ltd.






	(SYMBOL: PAOC)

	According to Department of Homeland Security, there are more than 108 million containers worldwide and it is estimated that there are approximately 200 million shipboard trips annually among seaports around the world. The maritime container shipping industry increases at an annual rate of about 10%. Almost 90% of the world’s manufactured goods are moved by container, and roughly 40% arriving by ship. In the USA alone there are more than 95% of non-North American trade arrives by ship, most of which is transported in maritime shipping containers. These containers consist of large and sturdy metal boxes, typically 8 ft wide by 8.5 ft high and 20-40 ft in length. Containers are moved frequently, being transferred often between ships, railroad cars and highway tractor-trailers. 


	Pan Ocean Container Supplies Co. Ltd

	Pan Ocean Container Supplies Co. Ltd. (OTCBB: PAOC) utilizes innovative solutions to build industry-leading shipping and multipurpose containers. In order to execute a carefully engineered design concept, Pan Ocean is dedicated to manufacturing secure, green, intelligent, and lightweight containers. Recognized for its high industry standards, Pan Ocean was awarded its International Organization for Standardization (ISO) certification in January 2014. Manufacturing companies that meet ISO standards and are granted its seal of approval are regarded highly in the container manufacturing industry and to date the company offers five individualized containers. 

	Pan Ocean was founded in July 2012 and initiated production in July 2013. Based in Jiaxing, Zhejiang Province, Pan Ocean has become China’s leading enterprise in container manufacturing. Currently, the Company has a registered capital of $50 million dollars, with a total investment of $98 million dollars. The entire project requisition of land is 190,000 square meters (2.1M square feet), 80,000 square meters (861k square feet) of which is allocated to the building area and 11,000 square meters (118k square feet) is allocated to the container yard. The expected annual output is 180,000 TEU (twenty-foot equivalent unit).

	There are four individual production plants: cold work fabrication, subassembly, main assembly and painting, respectively. Pan Ocean’s collaboration of advanced technology and expertise enables the company to produce secure, high quality, high-yield cargo containers in a cost-effective manner.


	Market Opportunity

	The Wall St. Journal cites that China's container ports have registered some of their biggest gains in port-handling volumes this year as a result of US economic growth and European economic recovery. After analyzing the last month of the third quarter, 2014, WSJ found that “traffic at Chinese coastal container ports, which number more than a dozen, grew 6% in September. According to analyst, Helane Becker, an increase in global GDP leads to container demand growth by two or three times. Global gross domestic product is a key indicator for global economy, which combines all individual economies worldwide. When looking at the gross domestic product / GDP of selected global regions, it is obvious that GDP is highest in industrialized countries. 

	Global GDP for 2014 according to Statista is at 4.13% up from 2013’s 3.6% and nearly an entire percentage point higher than that of 2012 (3.3%). These figures support the potential growth containerized trade should see into the coming year.
	In addition to this, the competitive advantage for Pan Ocean stems from an successful mix of several key factors including: 
	 

	·       Quality-certified with worldwide distribution capabilities 
	Well-established relationships with leading international shipping, leasing, and container trading companies 
	Clear strategy and design concept
	Advanced equipment to produce a high-yield
	Latest welding techniques to ensure the highest quality
	Cost efficient production processes 
	Situated in close proximity to major airports, ports and railways


	Additional Opportunities for Pan Ocean Outside of Shipping

	Pan Ocean represents a tremendous opportunity for the container manufacturing industry. In addition to a strategic alignment with major shipping, leasing, and container trading companies, PAOC has new product and expansion initiatives in the works. The new product comes in the form of shipping container homes. These eco-friendly, custom homes incorporate the latest technology of building architecture with shipping container. Therefore this ideal material will allow PAOC to build the homes efficiently and at a low cost.

	More and more architects, builders, and prospective home owners are seeing the potential of shipping containers as modular building components in architecture and green prefab home building designs. The ISO shipping container has been designed to stringent standards, not only to withstand the extreme weather conditions on sea voyages, but also to withstand the stacking of 9 fully laden containers makes it an ideal construction medium. 

	New Geography estimates that America will have to house some 100 million more people by 2040 so the demand for humane, affordable, sustainable housing is going to escalate dramatically in the coming years. For most Americans, particularly millennials, the demand for affordable homes near workplaces will be paramount. Shipping crates have been used in construction for thousands of years but today the old practice is being revived with entrepreneurial, innovative, outside-the-box thinking. 

	These containers can be cut, fabricated, re-modeled, and turned into a basic home structure for approximately $25-$27 a square foot compared to the US median list price per square foot $120 according to Zillow. This puts a whole new industry in front of shipping container manufacturers and even if global shipping were to decline dramatically, these companies could still benefit from the increased demand for affordable housing solutions.


	Opportunity To Capitalize On Value Proposition

	In the shipping container industry there are several market leading companies that have continued to beat estimates. Textainer Group Holdings Ltd. (TGH), which holds a current market cap of $1.98Billion, reported third-quarter earnings of $54.3 million. Earnings, adjusted for non-recurring gains, came to 88 cents per share, which beat Wall Street expectations. The average estimate of analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of 75 cents per share. 

	CAI International Inc. (CAP) with a current market cap of $458M, reported earnings of $16.4 million in its third quarter. Earnings, adjusted for non-recurring gains, were 69 cents per share and in line with Textainer, these results beat Wall Street expectations. The average estimate of analysts surveyed was for earnings of 66 cents per share. So for investors looking to profit on shipping container companies, the industry looks ripe for future growth in our opinion. Market participants like Textainer and CAI trade above $20 per share, currently Pan Ocean trades at $3.61/share with a market cap just slightly under $160M or about 1/3 that of CAI International. 

	Should things be held equal and Pan Ocean moves toward a similar market cap as CAI or even that of Textainer, price per share would be in the area of $10-$45 per share! Currently Pan Ocean shows that it could be incredibly undervalued at its current trading price with massive potential to increase in value as the company continues to progress further in the shipping container industry.

Promotional Products Work


Connect with your customers
We're always trying to improve our connections with our customers and clients, and there are few more effective ways to do that than with promotional items.
Look at your desk.
There's that promotional pen your accounting firm gave you when you first met with them. It's your favorite pen. Consciously or not, you associate the good feelings of "effective" and "does its job well" with that accounting firm every time you use the promo pen. When you give quality logo pens to your customers, they'll associate the quality with your brand.
The pen is probably sitting on top of a promotional notebook you got from your marketing agency. The nice paper and high-quality construction invite you to keep your best creative ideas in that branded notebook. And the agency is top of mind when you do. Custom journals and logo notebooks make fantastic pieces of an executive gift pack, and encourage your customers to be more creative and more organized.
Behind the notebook is a promotional coffee mug you were given by your business coach when you started this company. Every morning to start your day, you clear your head and remind yourself of the lessons she taught you while you literally hold her brand in your hand. Giving coffee mugs with your logo to your clients puts your brand on their desk every day.
Promo products create connections between your brand and your customers. Give them the right branded products, from promotional office items to custom t-shirts and custom logo hats, and your clients will keep them for a long time, making impressions every day.


Engage your employees
Promotional products and branded apparel items are great for external marketing, but when implemented properly they're just as useful for internal employee engagement efforts.
Consider employee wellness programs — everything from sponsored 5k races, where branded race t-shirts show solidarity and support, to water-drinking challenges, where promotional water bottles come into play. And don't forget custom awards or employee gifts to recognize the participants.
Taking it to the next step, we can create custom branded solutions that keep your employees engaged and optimize your promotional product purchasing. Looking to outfit your team? Whether you're a small restaurant or a multi-location nationwide retail chain, we can coordinate and execute a custom corporate apparel program to keep your team on-brand and in-style with custom t-shirts, branded polo shirts, custom hats, embroidered caps, and more.
Looking to affect employee behavior? We can create a custom incentive portal to track and reward training activities. Want to increase employee participation in corporate events? We can design and build a rewards and recognition portal for employees to log activities and receive branded rewards.
Whether you call them promos, swag, or tchotchkes, promotional products are a vital piece of your company's marketing mix. Finding the best promotional partner is necessary to make the best use of branded items. At Pinnacle Promotions, we help you make the right impression by seeking out the most effective promotional items for your company.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
