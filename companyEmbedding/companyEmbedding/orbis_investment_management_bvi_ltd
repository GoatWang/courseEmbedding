Our approach

Leaders of small and mid-sized businesses have multiple roles and competing priorities. You want a best-in-class retirement plan but may be unsure about all the complexities and requirements. You may be uncertain about the costs and fees involved. You need a provider focused solely on retirement and aligned with your needs and goals—and fully committed to you, your participants, and the ongoing improvement of retirement investing.

Vanguard is committed to the retirement business and is a leader in the retirement plan industry. Best of all, you can benefit from Vanguard's unique ownership structure: We're owned by our clients and not by outside investors or stockholders. That means you never need to question whose interests come first for us. This approach serves as a foundation for all that we do with Vanguard Retirement Plan Access™, our 401(k) offer for small and mid-sized plans. You can count on our expertise to remove the uncertainties from managing your plan and our leadership to help you offer a strong plan for your participants. 



Key benefits




You can:

Have confidence in your plan.
Understand your costs.
Focus on your business.





Cost-conscious?
As a business owner and plan fiduciary, you want to eliminate ambiguity in retirement plan costs. Research has shown that plan costs for the smaller end of the market tend to be higher, and you need a retirement plan provider that not only provides transparent pricing but has a fair and reasonable cost structure.1
With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access:

You receive an All-in Fee Report that shows the total cost of your plan.
You have access to low-cost Vanguard index funds, plus the opportunity to choose from among more than 12,000 non-Vanguard funds.
Your annual recordkeeping price is based on a per-participant fee—a fee that doesn't jump as your assets grow, as with many small to mid-sized retirement plans.
You have flexibility in how you cover your plan costs—including a recordkeeping credit depending on the share class selected.




Too busy?
 As a business owner, you're pressed for time and focused on many aspects of business. With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access, you can rely on high-quality recordkeeping and administration to ease your administrative burden and help your employees stay on track for retirement.

Advisory services
Many organizations like yours find it challenging to oversee their portfolio while also managing the day-to-day responsibilities of running their endowment, foundation, or charitable organization. But partnering with a provider who understands your needs can help you better balance these competing priorities.
Partnering with your organization
Vanguard Institutional Advisory Services® (VIAS) offers nonprofits the considerable resources of a large investment firm like Vanguard with the customized service of a specialized boutique. When your organization partners with VIAS, you work with a team of investment professionals that has your objectives and fiduciary responsibilities in mind. VIAS strives to:

Understand your organization's mission, spending needs, and unique situation and offer sophisticated, unbiased advice.
Develop a low-cost portfolio customized to your organization's needs.
Relieve your staff of many of the day-to-day burdens of investment program management.

OCIO: One service, many names


One approach nonprofits are increasingly considering is an outsourced chief investment officer (OCIO). An OCIO service—which is a key offering of Vanguard Institutional Advisory Services—acts as an extension of the board and investment staff. The OCIO determines an asset allocation strategy, selects investment advisors to implement it, and manages its operation and execution. Investment providers and clients call this service a variety of names, including discretionary management, advisory services, and investment management.





Investing and advising
Optimizing your portfolio to meet your long-term investment objectives requires time and skill. VIAS helps you develop a tailored portfolio that ensures your investments are diversified, risk-appropriate, and aligned with your overall strategy.
Our comprehensive advisory services include:









Portfolio construction 

Asset allocation analysis that uses a distinct, proprietary model to deliver solutions based on your portfolio needs.
Investment policy consulting designed to meet the unique investment goals of your organization.
Customized product selection that focuses on low-cost index and active investments.











Portfolio management

Performance reporting to help keep your investment committee informed.
Investment reviews that provide insights into your portfolio and the broader market and economic environment.
Steadfast commitment to risk management and process excellence through ongoing portfolio monitoring and rebalancing.








Research & expertise

Investment expertise and commentary on financial issues that provide context for your decision-making.
Investment committee best practices that are designed to increase your group's effectiveness.





Notes:

Advice services offered through Vanguard Institutional Advisory Services are provided by Vanguard Advisers, Inc., a registered investment advisor.
All investments are subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. 
Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market.

PurposeSince the firm’s inception in 1989, our purpose has been straightforward: to empower our clients by enhancing their savings and wealth.Click through on the puzzle piece to learn more.ValuesWe adhere to a set of Core Values that guide our decisions as a firm and the way we conduct ourselves as individuals.Click through on the puzzle piece to learn more.PhilosophyWe are long-term, fundamental and contrarian investors. Put simply, we seek to buy shares for much less than the intrinsic value of the business.Click through on the puzzle piece to learn more.PeopleWe hire talented individuals with extraordinary potential and give them the resources they need to succeed. The rest is up to them.Click through on the puzzle piece to learn more.ProcessOur disciplined, time-tested investment process helps us to implement our investment philosophy consistently across global markets and over multiple generations of decision-makers.Click through on the puzzle piece to learn more.OwnershipOur structure is more akin to a partnership than a corporation. As a firm with no outside owners, we have the freedom to take a long-term perspective.Click through on the puzzle piece to learn more.IncentivesWe take great care to ensure close alignment of interests with our clients. All of our fee structures are performance related and each person is rewarded for the value they create for clients.Click through on the puzzle piece to learn more.PerformanceInvestment performance doesn’t come in a straight line. We view periods of short-term underperformance, some of which can be painfully long, as the inevitable price one must pay for seeking pleasing long-term returns.Click through on the puzzle piece to learn more.                                Your job is tougher than ours. As hard as it may be to pick stocks, it’s even tougher                                to find good stockpickers.                                At Orbis, we seek to generate superior returns by buying shares that are out of                                favour, overlooked or misunderstood. As such, it can be easy for us to look foolish                                in the short term and for our clients to feel uncomfortable. But our experience                                has shown that the rewards that come with contrarian thinking, discipline and patience                                can be substantial over the long term.                                As important as performance may be, it never tells the whole story. To really understand                                a manager, you need to dig deeper. How do they make decisions? What are their incentives?                                What are their values? How have they structured their firm?                                We recognise that our approach isn’t for everyone. Only you can decide if Orbis                                is the right fit for your needs, but hopefully we can make that decision a little                                easier.Start due diligence »

In particular, we have established powerful incentives against making decisions that are at the expense of future investment performance.Download Our Organisational Philosophy in PDF »
1. Continuity of Private OwnershipBeing a contrarian investor requires being out of sync with conventional thinking and being painfully wrong at times. That creates career risk for individual decision-makers and pressure for the owners of a firm. As a firm that is owned by the key investment decision-makers, our ownership structure is designed to give our people the freedom to make tough, unpopular decisions and stick with them. This is also true from an operational perspective. We believe our ability, as a firm and as individuals, to focus on the very long term without the pressure to produce short-term results is an enduring competitive advantage in this industry.  For more information on our ownership structure, please click here.William GrayInvestment Team
2. Alignment of InterestsPerformance fees and co-investment help to ensure that our success is aligned with that of our clients. Our fees have always been designed to reward us for superior performance as well as penalise us for underperformance, making the firm’s profitability much more sensitive to investment performance than growth in assets under management. Under our Refundable Reserve Fee structure, we refund performance fees to our clients in periods of underperformance. We also offer larger investors a pure refundable performance fee structure—in other words, we only get paid if we outperform. Co-investment further reinforces this focus on performance. Orbis’ founders, owners, management and employees invest alongside clients, and pay the same fees. Indeed, as a group they are the largest single investor in our funds. We therefore have powerful incentives to behave as responsible stewards of our clients’ capital.Jimmy ChanQuantitative Analyst
3. Individual AccountabilityWe believe contrarian investment decisions are best made by individuals, not groups. Our investment process has therefore always been designed to encourage individual thinking and accountability. For all members of the firm, individual performance is evaluated in terms of value added for clients. Our detailed performance attribution systems track the results of individual investment decisions, allowing an objective assessment of each person's contribution, in addition to acting as an early warning system and helping to highlight areas of improvement.Ben PrestonEquity Analyst
4. Building SustainabilitySince inception, we have recognised that assets under management will inevitably grow if we are successful on behalf of our clients. Such growth presents both opportunities and challenges. To maximise the likelihood that we can meet those challenges, we have chosen to invest heavily in maintaining and developing our investment and operational capabilities. Our ownership structure provides the foundation that enables us to prioritise such long-term investments over short-term profitability, while our performance-based fee structures act as a powerful incentive against gathering assets at the expense of investment performance.Dan BrocklebankEquity AnalystWilliam Gray - Investment Team

Working at Orbis is not for everyoneIt is imperative that our people can thrive in an environment of individual accountability and our flat management structure emphasises contribution over seniority.At Orbis, we seek to attract highly motivated individuals who share our Core Values. This applies not only in investment management but in everything that we do, from client service to back-office operations. We aim to give our people the resources they need to succeed and the rest is up to them. While we expect our people to have outstanding academic credentials we also look for evidence of success outside the classroom in whatever they have done. We also place great value in demonstrated courage to think independently, even if it means disagreeing with the rest of the team. Our flat management structure emphasises contribution over seniority meaning that an individual’s progression and reward is completely dependent on their ability to add value.Meet Our People to watch more profiles.Contact OrbisOrbis AccessMedia EnquiriesAccessibilityOrbis Investment Management Limited © 2017

Commission and incentives may be paid by investors to third parties and, if so, would be included in the overall costs. The Funds are priced weekly.  A Fund may be closed to new investments at any time in order to be managed in accordance with its mandate.  The Funds invest in foreign securities. Depending on their markets, trading in those securities may carry risks relating to, among others, macroeconomic and political circumstances, constraints on liquidity or the repatriation of funds, foreign exchange rate fluctuations, taxation and trade settlement.Specific Information for the United StatesNeither the shares in the Funds nor the Funds themselves have been registered under any United States securities legislation and are only offered through transactions that do not violate such legislation and do not require the registration of the Funds or the shares of the Funds in the United States of America or in any of its territories or possessions.Terms of UseOur website and email services are made available to you for your personal use only.

The content on the Orbis website is not intended to provide legal, tax or investment advice. You are solely responsible for determining whether any investment, investment strategy, security or related transaction is appropriate for you based on your personal investment objectives, financial circumstances and risk tolerance. You should consult your legal or tax professional regarding your specific situation.Changes are periodically made to the information on our website or the content provided through email services and these changes will be incorporated from time to time in our website. Orbis expressly reserves the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to alter or amend any information or content on our website without notice.The information and content contained on our website or received through email services is relevant as of the dates expressly stated therein and no implication is being made that there has been no change in such information subsequent to such dates. The information is subject to change without notice.Our website may now, or hereafter from time to time contain certain statements or information with respect to the projection of revenues, income, earnings per share, capital expenditures, dividends, capital structure, or other financial items; or the plans, objectives and/or projections of Orbis for future operations; or future economic performance. Orbis wishes to caution you that such projections are only predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. Orbis is an active manager and any statement that relates to a specific issuer should not be treated as a representation that Orbis is pursuing any particular trading strategy. In particular, where the website or the content received through email services provides commentary on securities, financial instruments, indices, financial products or indicators, or economic conditions, it is done in the context of investment decisions for the Funds. The website content does not constitute a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any shares or other securities in the companies mentioned in it (“relevant securities”) nor does it constitute financial advice, and it has not been prepared in accordance with legal requirements designed to promote the independence of investment research. Orbis and its employees are subject to certain restrictions on dealing in relevant securities ahead of the dissemination of this commentary.The Orbis Funds are speculative and involve a high degree of risk. The Funds’ performance may be volatile. An investor could lose all or a substantial amount of its investment. The Funds’ manager has total trading authority over the Funds and the use of a single adviser applying generally similar trading programs could mean lack of diversification and consequently higher risk. For some Orbis Funds, there is no secondary market for interests in the Fund, and none is expected to develop. There are restrictions on transferring interests in the Funds. The Funds’ fees and expenses may offset the Funds’ trading profits.Allocations are subject to change at any time.Cookies	We use cookies and similar tools on our website to improve its performance and enhance your user experience.

Our approach

Leaders of small and mid-sized businesses have multiple roles and competing priorities. You want a best-in-class retirement plan but may be unsure about all the complexities and requirements. You may be uncertain about the costs and fees involved. You need a provider focused solely on retirement and aligned with your needs and goals—and fully committed to you, your participants, and the ongoing improvement of retirement investing.

Vanguard is committed to the retirement business and is a leader in the retirement plan industry. Best of all, you can benefit from Vanguard's unique ownership structure: We're owned by our clients and not by outside investors or stockholders. That means you never need to question whose interests come first for us. This approach serves as a foundation for all that we do with Vanguard Retirement Plan Access™, our 401(k) offer for small and mid-sized plans. You can count on our expertise to remove the uncertainties from managing your plan and our leadership to help you offer a strong plan for your participants. 



Key benefits




You can:

Have confidence in your plan.
Understand your costs.
Focus on your business.





Cost-conscious?
As a business owner and plan fiduciary, you want to eliminate ambiguity in retirement plan costs. Research has shown that plan costs for the smaller end of the market tend to be higher, and you need a retirement plan provider that not only provides transparent pricing but has a fair and reasonable cost structure.1
With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access:

You receive an All-in Fee Report that shows the total cost of your plan.
You have access to low-cost Vanguard index funds, plus the opportunity to choose from among more than 12,000 non-Vanguard funds.
Your annual recordkeeping price is based on a per-participant fee—a fee that doesn't jump as your assets grow, as with many small to mid-sized retirement plans.
You have flexibility in how you cover your plan costs—including a recordkeeping credit depending on the share class selected.




Too busy?
 As a business owner, you're pressed for time and focused on many aspects of business. With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access, you can rely on high-quality recordkeeping and administration to ease your administrative burden and help your employees stay on track for retirement.

Advisory services
Many organizations like yours find it challenging to oversee their portfolio while also managing the day-to-day responsibilities of running their endowment, foundation, or charitable organization. But partnering with a provider who understands your needs can help you better balance these competing priorities.
Partnering with your organization
Vanguard Institutional Advisory Services® (VIAS) offers nonprofits the considerable resources of a large investment firm like Vanguard with the customized service of a specialized boutique. When your organization partners with VIAS, you work with a team of investment professionals that has your objectives and fiduciary responsibilities in mind. VIAS strives to:

Understand your organization's mission, spending needs, and unique situation and offer sophisticated, unbiased advice.
Develop a low-cost portfolio customized to your organization's needs.
Relieve your staff of many of the day-to-day burdens of investment program management.

OCIO: One service, many names


One approach nonprofits are increasingly considering is an outsourced chief investment officer (OCIO). An OCIO service—which is a key offering of Vanguard Institutional Advisory Services—acts as an extension of the board and investment staff. The OCIO determines an asset allocation strategy, selects investment advisors to implement it, and manages its operation and execution. Investment providers and clients call this service a variety of names, including discretionary management, advisory services, and investment management.





Investing and advising
Optimizing your portfolio to meet your long-term investment objectives requires time and skill. VIAS helps you develop a tailored portfolio that ensures your investments are diversified, risk-appropriate, and aligned with your overall strategy.
Our comprehensive advisory services include:









Portfolio construction 

Asset allocation analysis that uses a distinct, proprietary model to deliver solutions based on your portfolio needs.
Investment policy consulting designed to meet the unique investment goals of your organization.
Customized product selection that focuses on low-cost index and active investments.











Portfolio management

Performance reporting to help keep your investment committee informed.
Investment reviews that provide insights into your portfolio and the broader market and economic environment.
Steadfast commitment to risk management and process excellence through ongoing portfolio monitoring and rebalancing.








Research & expertise

Investment expertise and commentary on financial issues that provide context for your decision-making.
Investment committee best practices that are designed to increase your group's effectiveness.





Notes:

Advice services offered through Vanguard Institutional Advisory Services are provided by Vanguard Advisers, Inc., a registered investment advisor.
All investments are subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. 
Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
