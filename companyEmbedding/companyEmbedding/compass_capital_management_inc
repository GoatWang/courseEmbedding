You are here because you have a need 
 You also believe in having goals and working toward them. We share those beliefs, and we’ll work hard to help you address these needs and goals.
 Compass Capital Management, Inc. founded in 1988, is a client-centered, fee-based asset management firm. We work closely with a select group of clients and invest carefully in quality stocks at attractive prices

for long-term capital appreciation and quality bonds for principal preservation and income. 


We have found that this strategy minimizes risk while enhancing returns.
 What makes us different from other firms? Unlike huge corporate investment firms, we're sized for more personal and responsive service.  We're long on experience and big on tailoring each client's portfolio to their distinctive needs and goals.
If you expect outstanding service, custom portfolio management and time-tested performance, we think you’ll appreciate the way we work with you. What’s your vision of the future? We’ll help you get there.
 For an informational meeting, please call us at 612-338-4051 or learn more about our investment strategy .

How We Work With You 
 We’ll work closely with you and listen to your needs 
Choosing your investment partner is a pivotal decision. We want to make sure we have your full confidence – and that the chemistry is right for both of us. Here’s how we’ll learn about your vision for the future, understand your needs and keep you informed.
 Introductory meeting 
 You talk and we’ll listen – carefully. Tell us about your needs, concerns, and hopes for the future. Take your time. Then feel free to question us about our investment strategy and process, the advantages of working with Compass, our experience or our performance. The more we know and understand each other, the more effective our relationship will be. 
 Developing your investment strategy 
 Once you’re ready to work with us, we’ll begin our financial evaluation, determining your: 

 Investment needs 
 Risk tolerance 
 Time horizon 
 Tax situation 
 Return expectations 

 Our assessment will culminate with a written Investment Policy Statement: a clear roadmap of your specific financial goals and how we’ll help you achieve them. Finally, we’ll customize your investment portfolio together, using high-quality stocks, bonds and mutual funds and we’ll be happy to coordinate our efforts with your accountant or attorney. 
 Managing your portfolio 
		        With your custom investment portfolio in place, we’ll actively manage and monitor your investments, meeting with you personally on a regular basis to report and discuss results. At Compass Capital, we’ll keep your goals foremost.

Stock Management Strategy 
Our core stock portfolio: 25 high-quality,
			      mid-to large-sized growth companies


 



• These companies are growing faster than the general market (superior sales, earnings and dividend growth enhances long-term performance).
• They are well diversified in terms of product mix, geographical sales distribution, etc. (reduces risk).
• They are established industry leaders with strong management teams, good balance sheets and cash flow (hallmarks of companies that are likely to continue to be successful).
• They have consistently weathered changing economic conditions – and prospered.
• We have a low turnover rate which results in very tax-efficient portfolios.







 

Grow real portfolio value over time (ahead of inflation and taxes).
We purchase these great companies at significant valuation discounts and hold them for long periods to reduce risk and help portfolio return.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for NCR (NASDAQ:NCR CORP) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A

A smart product management hub for retailthat streamlines digital content and data sharing






 





















Our mission
 
We have made it our mission to provide brands and retailers simple and affordable tools that tackle many challenges in digital product management and distribution by:













Solving the practical challenge of organizing, sourcing, and sharing product content.









Giving brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed ecommerce data and analytics
















Take control of your products with Plytix
 









Our Story
 
The idea for Plytix evolved from our time at Google, when we were working with some of the biggest companies in the e-commerce space. At the time, technology allowed tracking user behaviour on individual websites, but we wanted to give brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed data, bringing them a better understanding of their products through 3rd party product analytics. 
 
Since then Plytix has evolved into an end-to-end product management eco-system where brands and retailers can organize, analyze, and share product content and performance in a user-friendly and efficient way without breaking the bank. 
 




























Our Team
 
We're a diverse, international team passionate about creating extraordinary client experiences and serious about revolutionizing e-commerce. We are growing rapidly and we're always on the look out for smart, driven people to join our team.
