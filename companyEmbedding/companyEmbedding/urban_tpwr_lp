Urban Dictionary: VinylTop definitionVinylunknownVinyl Discs.  The grandfathers of CDs, vinyl discs are spun, mixed, and scratched by DJs.Man, this vinyl that DJ is spinning is tha' shit!by HMRising June 28, 200441098The Urban Dictionary MugOne side has the word, one side has the definition. Microwave and dishwasher safe. Lotsa space for your liquids.Buy the mug2VinylunknownVinyl usually refers to Analog Long Playing Records (LPs). While vinyl is not as mainstream today as it was back in the day, the format is still in use. Vinyl records are considered to be more "warmer" and pleasant sounding than CDs.Many audiophiles (and non-audiophiles) argue that Vinyl is superior to CD, and those people are correct in my opinion.by Analog Kid September 11, 200535192The Urban Dictionary MugOne side has the word, one side has the definition.

Microwave and dishwasher safe. Lotsa space for your liquids.Buy the mug5VinylunknownWell it's better than cd's (by a long shot).Can be used for playing frisbee. Although I would not reccomend it.Can be a pain if you don't feel like putting a vinyl on the record player.Example 1. Person 1: Man Sublime is AWESOME!!!Person 2: Hell Yeah they are! I just got there self titled on vinyl, it kicks ASS.Example 2: I could listen to music on vinyl, but that gets annoying putting the vinyl on. Eh, I'll listen to it on cd instead. Not as good as vinyl, but is faster to put on.#sublime#cd#kicks ass#good#ass#record player#frisbee#long shot#better#awesomeby Borgie Baby October 24, 20115121The Urban Dictionary MugOne side has the word, one side has the definition.

Urban Investment Partners (UIP) is a real estate investment firm, specializing in multi-family and mixed-use residential properties, primarily in the Washington, DC MSA. The firm’s core activities include “heavy lift” value add strategies that reposition assets and increase operating income dramatically.  By preserving historic, irreplaceable assets, upgrading building systems and finishes, UIP provides a differentiated rental product to a more discerning client/Resident.  DC’s neighborhoods are dotted with older, architecturally significant properties that often suffer from years of extreme deferred maintenance and a lack of any meaningful upgrades.  UIP renovates and restores this underutilized housing inventory, acquiring properties in core residential neighborhoods, at compelling (, less than replacement value) prices often based on deferred maintenance, long term lack of capital improvements, and constrained rents. Highly targeted, cost efficient capital upgrades allow UIP to rent renovated apartments at market rates, and at lower overall costs, to improve cash flow.
UIP’s laser-focused knowledge of individual submarkets, cutting-edge – vertical integration approach; based on its Principals’ multi-disciplinary skills, a creative and fun company environment, and a Resident/Investor focus, has allowed UIP to deliver consistent, risk adjusted returns, irrespective of greater market cycles.  UIP’s strength is further enhanced by its principals’ unique combination of perspectives and experience, along with a deep understanding of local rental housing related statutes. 
Since inception, UIP has invested more than $500MM in the local real estate market, acquiring, renovating, selling, and owning more than 5,000 rental and condominium units.  Our current portfolio of more than 2,400 units in DC and MD is managed, primarily by, UIP Property Management, Inc. (www.uippm.com).  Construction and renovations are performed by UIP General Contracting, Inc. (www.uipgc.com).

UIP Acquires former GWU Dorm For $36 Million
New Apartments and Restaurant Planned for Old Watergate Burglar Lookout
Washington, DC, August 11, 2016– Urban Investment Partners (UIP) of Washington, DChas acquired a ten-story building at 2601 Virginia Avenue, NW across from the Watergate mixed-use complex for $36 million. The seller was George Washington University (GWU), which had used the building as student housing for 17 years.
Hall on Virginia Avenueachieved notoriety while operating as a Howard Johnson hotel in 1972. Rooms 419 and 723 were used as lookouts forthe “Watergate burglars,” who broke into offices of the Democratic National Committee in the Watergate office building. The ensuing Watergate scandal led to the 1974 resignation of President Richard M. Nixon. Room 723 was preserved as a museum until 2001, when the exhibit was moved to the GWU archives.  
GWU demolished the property’s interior about a year ago,planning to create new student and faculty housing, but decided to sell the property instead. CBRE’s Bobby Meehling, Andy Wimsatt, and Peter Larkinrepresented GWU in the sale.  
UIP plans to developabout 200rental apartments within the existing 97,300 SF core and shell, and build about 50 more units in a new 40,000 SF addition on the building’s east side. UIP also will create an 8,000 -10,000 SFrestaurant/coffee shop on the first floor, which will be a fully activated space for residents and neighbors.The building has underground parking for 200 vehicles, plus bike storage and care facilities with lockers.
Boathouse, as the new development will be called, will offer residents numerous contemporary amenities as well as easy access to GWU, Georgetown, Foggy Bottom, the Potomac River/GT Waterfront, and Rock Creek Park. An expansive rooftop recreational area with river views will incorporatea deck, large swimming pool, fire pits, gourmet kitchen, and world-class (2,000 SF) fitness center. Other amenities will includeabike share program, library, multimedia theatre, and a 24-hourhonor-based convenience store. 
“We are going to create something never seen before in this city, focusing on access to the park and the river, promoting a healthful lifestyle that includes fitness, exercise, and fresh food,” said UIP Principal Steve Schwat.“This is going to be an exciting place to live, equidistant from the Georgetown waterfront and the Foggy Bottom Metro stop, which is just a five-minute walk away.” 
“This transaction is consistent with our strategy of acquiring underutilized structures in prime locations and restoring them to productive use as Class A multifamily buildings,” said UIP Vice President of Development Brook Katzen. “There are a number of unique elements that make this one of the most exciting projects I have worked on at UIP. We look forward to enhancing the Foggy Bottom community with a best-in-class project.”
Boathouse enjoys an irreplaceable location in the famous Foggy Bottom neighborhood in close proximity to Georgetown, GWU, the John F. Kennedy Center for The Performing Arts, and the recently renovated Watergate complex. Both Georgetown and Foggy Bottom are almost completely built out, with significant regulatory constraints preventing further development. With a walkscore of 86 and a bikescore of 94  (from www.walkscore.com), Boathouse will provide incomparable access to the area’s wealth of restaurants, shops, cultural destinations, and recreational venues. 
Earlier this year, UIP purchased three commercial office buildings from American University, and is converting most of the newly acquired space into new apartment dwellings.  “Converting both hotels and office buildings to multifamily use is not much different than converting older apartment buildings, as we have done all over the city,” remarked Schwat.
The UIP family of companies owns and manages more than 2,500 apartments in Washington, DC and Maryland and has renovated, restored and built more than 20 downtown apartment buildings and condominiums over the last ten years. UIP’s primary focus includes “heavy lift” renovations as well as working with tenants in Washington, DC,helping them exercise their TOPA (Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act) rights. UIP also is active in entitling land, infill development, and acquiring residential assets in the close-in Washington, DC suburbs.

UIP ACQUIRES THREE OFFICE BUILDINGS FROM AMERICAN UNIVERSITY IN WASHINGTON, DC FOR $45MILLION
$75Million Apartment Conversion Planned Near Tenleytown Metro;Buildings Formerly Housed WAMU and Krupin’s Deli
Washington, DC, (February 12, 2016) – Urban Investment Partners (UIP) of Washington DC has acquired three class C office buildings in the Tenleytown neighborhood of Washington, DC from American University (AU). The portfolio, including the longtime home of National Public Radio affiliate WAMU, traded for $45 million.
UIP plans to invest $75 million in order to gut-renovate the Brandywine and Wisconsin Avenue buildings, creating residentialapartments, all within a block of the Tenleytown-AUMetro station on the Red Line and with an abundanceof underground parking. The properties are:

4000 Brandywine Street, NW (38,396 SF) has long been known as the WAMU Building, where American University housed its radio station and recording studios. Syndicated talk shows hosted by Diane Rehm and KojoNnamdi originated from this building, which is situated on the highest piece of land in the city. WAMU moved out in early 2013, and the building has been used for AU administrative offices and classrooms. AU will continue to occupy the building for about nine months.
4620 Wisconsin Avenue, NW (59,996 SF) is the former home of TooJays, which became Krupin’sDeli and later Morty’s, which closed in 2010. This building also isoccupied by AU, which will stay in its space for about a year.
4545 42nd Street, NW(39,299 SF), located at the intersection of 42nd Street and River Road, NW, was built to look like individual town homes or row houses, but is actually a single poured concrete structure occupied by a mix of commercial tenants. It will continue to operate as a commercial office rental property.

CapSource is providing acquisition and construction loans for the Brandywine and Wisconsin Avenue locations. MidCap Mortgage is the lender for 4545 42nd Street.
Bobby Meehling and Scott Frankel of CBRE represented the seller in all three transactions.
“We are more than excited to close on this acquisition and I want to thank everyone involved: American University, CBRE, and those at UIP who put in a lot of extra hours to bring this deal to fruition,” said Steve Schwat, UIP Principal and Founding Partner. “Brook Katzen, Pete Bonnell, and I have alreadyengaged with many of the stakeholders in Tenley including Tenley Main Street and Ward 3 Vision. We look forward to working closely with our neighbors to help shape Tenleytown over the next few years.”
Named in the late 1700’s for local tavern owner John Tennally, Tenleytown surrounds the site of Civil War-era Fort Reno, built on the city’s highest natural ground at 409 feet above sea level. By 1900, the last remains of the fort had been replaced by a reservoir, water tower, and a park. Featuring sports fields, playgrounds, tennis, and more, Fort Reno Park remains a key community amenity.
The 1941 opening of Sears &Roebuck at Wisconsin Avenue and Albemarle Street was an important milestone in the neighborhood’s growth. The area’s first Hechinger store also was located in Tenleytown; after Sears vacated its store in 1994, Hechinger bought and moved into the property. Hechinger eventually shuttered all of its stores. By 2003, the former Sears/Hechinger site had been converted into one of the city’s firsttransit-oriented developments (TODs), Cityline at Tenley, which currently includes Best Buy, The Container Store, and Ace Hardware..
UIP’s newly acquired properties are surrounded by a wide variety of highly regarded amenities and destinations including DC’s public Wilson High School, the Wilson Aquatic Center, Friendship/Tenley Public Library, the brand new AU Law School, Starbucks, Whole Foods, Panera Bread, Burger Tap & Shake, CVS Pharmacy, and other popular retailers. Beefsteak, the new fast-casual concept from renowned chef Jose Andres, is coming soon, as is District Taco, set to open in Tenley View.
In addition to the Tenleytown/AU Metrorail station, the neighborhood has 11 Metrobus lines originating at Tenley and a several local circulator buses including the AU and Sibley Hospital shuttles. The AU shuttle bus stops on the same block as 4000 Brandywine.
The UIP family of companies owns and manages more than 2,500 apartments in Washington, DC and Maryland and has renovated, restored and built more than 20 downtown apartment buildings and condominiums over the last ten years. UIP’s primary focus includes “heavy lift” renovations as well as working with tenants in Washington, DC,helping them exercise their TOPA (Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act) rights. UIP also is active in entitling land, infill development, and acquiring residential assets in the close-in Washington, DC suburbs.

UIP Acquires Historic DC Apartments for $7.6M
Urban Investment Partners (UIP) has acquired Rhode Island Gardens, with 81 apartment homes, for $7.6 million. Originally built in 1931, the property is located at 230 Rhode Island Avenue NE just a half mile from the Rhode Island Avenue Metro station.
The seller, Roydun Corporation, is an affiliate of Washington, DC-based DARO Realty, a longtime local apartment owner and manager. CBRE represented the seller.
UIP coordinated the acquisition with the Rhode Island Gardens Tenants Association. “This is our fourth acquisition for the year and our third development agreement with a tenant association in 2015, highlighting UIP’s unique level of experience and strong desire to participate fully with tenants in the properties we buy,” said Steve Schwat, Principal at UIP.
UIP and the tenants’ association worked together to plan a $7 million renovation of the building to be performed by UIP subsidiary UIP General Contracting Inc. The project will include adding five apartments on the building’s lower level, upgrading electric service, installing individually controlled heating and air conditioning in each apartment, plumbing replacements and upgrades, and upgrading all common areas and apartment interiors (with a particular focus on kitchens and baths), while maintaining the structure’s historic character.
“As with many of our other apartment building renovations, Rhode Island Gardens residents who stay through the renovation will enjoy a modernized apartment building with no increase in rent,” added Schwat.
Rhode Island Gardens is ideally located in the Edgewood neighborhood, a flourishing, urban infill setting just north of NoMa, one of the top employment centers in the Nation’s capital. The structure has a prominent presence on the corner of 3rd Street and Rhode Island Avenue NE, a major commuter route connecting Prince George’s County to the District of Columbia.
The nearby Rhode Island Avenue Metro station on Metro’s Red Line provides direct connections to NoMa (just one stop away), Union Station, and the rest of the metropolitan area. Within ten minutes’ walking distance, residents have access to Rhode Island Row, a large mixed-use project completed in 2012, with 150 square feet of retail space including CVS, Carolina Kitchen, Jersey Mike’s, and more.
Several major employers including MedStar Washington Hospital Center, Catholic University of America (CUA), and Trinity Washington University are located within a mile of Rhode Island Gardens.
The UIP family of companies owns and manages more than 2,500 apartments in Washington, DC and Maryland and has renovated and restored more than 20 downtown apartment buildings over the last ten years. UIP’s primary focus includes working with Tenants in Washington, DC and helping them exercise their TOPA (Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act) rights. UIP is also active in entitling land, new infill development, and acquiring residential assets in the close-in Washington, DC suburbs. For more information, visit www.uipllc.com and www.uippm.com.

Contrary to what the Huffington Post says, Bishop T.D. Jakes is not a supporter of same-sex marriage. BET.com reports the religious leader took to social media to set the record straight on comments he made to the publication last week that seemed to indicate his support of same-sex marriage. According to Jakes, his remarks were[continue reading…]

    	  Detecting Urban-Rural Temperature Differences with MODIS and AppEEARS    	


Author: LP DAAC
 Date: June 22, 2016


 Image of annual mean accumulated growing degree-days (AGDD) for 2003-2012. AGDD is calculated from the MODIS-Aqua and MODIS-Terra 1,000 meter 8-day composites of daytime and nighttime land surface temperature (LST). Five of the eleven study sites from Krehbiel and Henebry (2016) are labeled in this image. Areas with higher mean annual AGDD are shaded red, including major cities such as Minneapolis-St. Paul, MN, and Chicago, IL. AGDD data provided courtesy of the author.
 
June 21st marks the Summer Solstice, ushering in the arrival of summer, and generally warmer temperatures. The ~250 million urban dwellers in the US will feel the heat of summer even more so than their rural counterparts. Why? Because of the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect, or the general phenomenon of higher temperatures in urban areas versus the surrounding countryside. UHIs are generally measured by urban-rural air temperature differences, whereas land surface temperatures (LST), often captured by satellite sensors, measure the Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI). The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is a sensor aboard the Terra and Aqua satellites that provides daily global LST observations.
Air temperature observations from weather stations in and around cities provide long-spanning records of urban temperatures at a specific location, but they suffer from poor spatial coverage throughout cities. In contrast, MODIS LST data products provide total coverage of urban and surrounding rural regions, but at a lower spatial resolution of 1,000 meters. A recent study by Krehbiel and Henebry (2016) used 8-day composites of daytime and nighttime LST from MODIS-Aqua (MYD11A2) and MODIS-Terra (MOD11A2) from 2003 to 2012 to calculate growing degree-days and accumulated growing degree-days to characterize the SUHI for eleven urban areas in the Midwest.  They compared the MODIS LST-based results with corresponding air temperature-based UHI characterization from (1) weather station data from the Global Historical Climate Network (GHCN) and (2) modeled gridded Daymet temperature data. The study compared daytime vs. nighttime, urban vs. rural, and seasonal dynamics of the [S]UHI.  
The MODIS LST-derived results were closer to the GHCN air temperature-derived results than the Daymet modeled air temperature results for the nighttime observations. This suggests that MODIS LST could be used for monitoring nighttime UHI dynamics for cities in the mid-latitudes. Seasonally, the study found more pronounced urban-rural differences in thermal time during the summer months, once the surrounding rural vegetation canopy developed. Understanding the thermal climate of cities is important because urban areas impact daily, seasonal, and annual weather on local to regional scales.
The LP DAAC’s Application for Extracting and Exploring Analysis Ready Samples (AppEEARS) is a data extraction tool that can be used to visualize urban vs. rural and daytime vs. nighttime differences in the SUHI effect. Below are the results from inputting the eleven urban and corresponding rural (22 total) point locations used in Krehbiel and Henebry (2016) into AppEEARS for the same time period (2003-2012) for MOD11A2 and MYD11A2 daytime LST. The boxplots labeled “Sites” show differences in the median LST between the eleven urban sites and eleven rural sites.
AppEEARS also allows the user to select a subset of their results, as seen below (2nd plot, bottom) for the Minneapolis-St. Paul, MN, urban-rural site pair. In Minneapolis-St. Paul, the median urban MODIS-Aqua daytime LST was 297.8 K (24.6 °C, 76.4 °F) compared to the median rural LST, which was 294.7 K (21.6 °C, 70.8 °F). The visualizations generated by AppEEARS provide a quick and easy way to begin exploring SUHI characteristics for any city across the world using MODIS LST data.







Example of using AppEEARS to compare categories (above) by city for all MODIS-Aqua (MYD11A2) daytime land surface temperature (LST) observations from 2003-2012 for the study sites from Krehbiel and Henebry (2016). Below, AppEEARS compares median decadal LST split between all urban and rural sites. Both Y axes are in Kelvin.



AppEEARS also allows the user to select a subset of the results to adjust the focus of their research as needed. In this example, only the Minneapolis-St. Paul (MSP) urban and rural sites are being compared. Both Y axes are in Kelvin. Additional information on how to use AppEEARS for data extraction and analysis can be found here.

Persistence and sorption of fipronil degradates in urban stream sediments

Abstract


                Fipronil, an increasingly popular insecticide used for urban pest control, is known to readily transform into several degradates that generally have similar or greater toxicity to aquatic organisms than the parent compound. However, knowledge on the fate of these degradates in the environment is obscure. In the present study, degradation kinetics and sorption of desthiofipronil, fipronil sulfide, and fipronil sulfone were investigated in urban stream sediments. All degradates showed enhanced persistence in sediments compared to fipronil under facultative or anaerobic conditions. Under facultative conditions, the estimated half‐lives of desthiofipronil, fipronil sulfide, and fipronil sulfone were 217 to 497, 195 to 352, and 502 to 589 d, respectively. Under anaerobic conditions, the corresponding half‐lives were over one year in one sediment, while no detectable degradation occurred in the other two sediments after 280 d. Sorption isotherms of fipronil and its degradates in the sediments were linear, with mean KOC values of 802, 1,296, 3,684, and 3,543 L/kg for fipronil, desthiofipronil, fipronil sulfide, and fipronil sulfone, respectively, suggesting that the degradates generally have a higher sorption capacity than fipronil. Sorption coefficient Kd increased up to fourfold over 280 d, suggesting an aging effect on sorption. The inherent toxicity, long persistence, and strong sorption potential highlight the importance for a better understanding of the sediment toxicity of fipronil degradates in surface water bodies.

However, knowledge onthe fate of these degradates in the environment is obscure. In the present study, degradation kinetics and sorption of desthioﬁpronil,ﬁpronil sulﬁde, and ﬁpronil sulfone were investigated in urban stream sediments. All degradates showed enhanced persistence insediments compared to ﬁpronil under facultative or anaerobic conditions. Under facultative conditions, the estimated half-lives ofdesthioﬁpronil, ﬁpronil sulﬁde, and ﬁpronil sulfone were 217 to 497, 195 to 352, and 502 to 589 d, respectively. Under anaerobicconditions, the corresponding half-lives were over one year in one sediment, while no detectable degradation occurred in the othertwo sediments after 280 d. Sorption isotherms of ﬁpronil and its degradates in the sediments were linear, with meanKOCvalues of802, 1,296, 3,684, and 3,543 L/kg for ﬁpronil, desthioﬁpronil, ﬁpronil sulﬁde, and ﬁpronil sulfone, respectively, suggesting thatthe degradates generally have a higher sorption capacity than ﬁpronil. Sorption coefﬁcientKdincreased up to fourfold over 280 d,suggesting an aging effect on sorption. The inherent toxicity, long persistence, and strong sorption potential highlight the importancefor a better understanding of the sediment toxicity of ﬁpronil degradates in surface water bodies.Keywords—Fipronil Sediment toxicity Fipronil degradates Runoff MetabolitesINTRODUCTIONFipronil (Fig. 1) is a phenylpyrazole insecticide that is wide-ly used in residential areas for controlling of termites and ants.Fipronil contains a unique triﬂuoromethylsulﬁnyl substituentand is active against insects resistant or tolerant to other in-secticides such as organophosphates, pyrethroids, carbamates,and most of the cyclodienes [1]. In California, USA, ﬁpronilwas granted exclusively for structural pest control in urbanareas in the late 1990s. Because of the restrictions of otherurban insecticides such as diazinon and chlorpyrifos, the an-nual use of ﬁpronil in California increased rapidly from 300kg (as active ingredient) in 2000 to 44,803 kg in 2006 (Cal-ifornia Department of Pesticide Regulation; http://www.cdpr.ca.gov/docs/pur/pur06rep/chmrpt06.pdf).Fipronil transforms to several degradates in the environ-ment. Fipronil is stable in aqueous solutions under mildly acid-ic or neutral conditions [2,3] but undergoes transformationthrough hydrolysis under basic conditions [2,3], photolysis [3–6], and oxidation or reduction in water, soil, or sediment [7–14]. The main degradates (Fig. 1) include desthioﬁpronil fromphotolysis, ﬁpronil amide from hydrolysis under basic con-ditions, and ﬁpronil sulﬁde and ﬁpronil sulfone from reductionand oxidation [2–15]. A survey study showed that most urbanstreams from 10 states in the United States were contaminatedwith low levels of ﬁpronil, desthioﬁpronil, ﬁpronil sulﬁde, andﬁpronil sulfone (U.S. Geological Survey; http://infotrek.er.usgs.gov/traverse/f?pϭNAWQA:HOME).Several studies showed that desthioﬁpronil, ﬁpronil sulﬁde,and ﬁpronil sulfone exhibit similar or greater nontarget toxicitythan ﬁpronil. By conducting a suite of in vitro and in vivo* To whom correspondence may be addressed (kunde@ucr.edu).Published on the Web 2/12/2009.bioassays, Hainzl et al. [16] found that ﬁpronil, desthioﬁpronil,and ﬁpronil sulfone have similar biological activity. Otherstudies showed that the degradates may have higher toxicityto aquatic species than ﬁpronil. For example, the median lethalconcentrations (LC50) of ﬁpronil, desthioﬁpronil, ﬁpronil sul-ﬁde, and ﬁpronil sulfone toProcambarus clarkiiwere 14.3,68.6, 15.5, and 11.2␮g/L, respectively [17]. The 21-d medianeffective concentrations (EC50) toDaphnia magnafor ﬁ-pronil, desthioﬁpronil, ﬁpronil sulﬁde, and ﬁpronil sulfonewere 190, 230, 27, and 4.5␮g/L, respectively [18]. Further-more, desthioﬁpronil and ﬁpronil sulfone were, respectively,approximately 8.1 and 6.4 times more potent to rainbow troutthan ﬁpronil [18].The signiﬁcant toxicity of ﬁpronil degradates and their com-mon occurrence in surface streams dictate the need for un-derstanding their fate and transport in the environment. Al-though degradation and transformation of ﬁpronil have beenwell studied, at present behaviors of ﬁpronil degradates in soilor sediment environments remain little known. The primaryobjective of the present study was to investigate the degra-dation kinetics and sorption of desthioﬁpronil, ﬁpronil sulﬁde,and ﬁpronil sulfone in urban stream sediments.MATERIALS AND METHODSChemicalsStandards of ﬁpronil (5-amino-1-[2,6-chloro-4-(triﬂuoro-methyl)phenyl]-4-[(triﬂuoromethyl)sulﬁnyl]-1H-pyrazole-3-carbonitrile, 98.9%) and its derivatives desthio (98.7%), sulﬁde(98.8%), and sulfone (99.7%) were obtained from the U.S.Environmental Protection Agency’s National Pesticide Stan-dard Repository (Fort Meade, MD, USA). The water solubilityof ﬁpronil is approximately 1.8 mg/L, while it is unknown for
