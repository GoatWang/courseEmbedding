Elizabeth Arden Unveils Next Step in Multi-Channel Distribution Strategy | Business Wire


























































Elizabeth Arden Unveils Next Step in Multi-Channel Distribution 
      Strategy






March 06, 2014 03:26 PM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Elizabeth Arden, Inc. (NASDAQ:RDEN), a global prestige beauty products 
      company, announces the launch of its new Elizabeth Arden Rx 
      skincare line, which will be available exclusively in physician offices. 
      This is consistent with the Company’s omni-channel growth strategy of 
      selling and marketing Elizabeth Arden branded products in the prestige 
      retail, spa and now the professional skincare market.
    


      “Our core target is actively shopping in all skincare distribution 
      channels,” said E. Scott Beattie, Chairman, President and Chief 
      Executive Officer of Elizabeth Arden, Inc. “Given our portfolio of 
      efficacious prestige skincare products and spa-based brands, through our 
      unique association with the Red Door Spas, we have an exciting 
      opportunity to further build Elizabeth Arden equity by expanding into 
      the medical professional channel. Expanding the Company’s efforts to 
      reach its target consumer in a credible, science-based environment is a 
      strategic and logical next step for us.”
    

      Through the Company’s investment in US Cosmeceutechs, LLC (USC), a skin 
      care company that develops and sells skin care products into the 
      professional dermatology and spa channels, and its Chief Executive 
      Officer Joe Lewis, the Company designed the new Elizabeth Arden Rx 
      skincare line for exclusive distribution in physician offices. A key 
      pillar to Elizabeth Arden’s multi-channel growth strategy, Elizabeth 
      Arden Rx marks the company’s official entry into the global 
      professional skincare market.
    

      Joe Lewis first partnered with Elizabeth Arden, Inc. in 2005 to launch 
      Prevage,® which has gone on to win more than 160 international beauty 
      awards. Lewis, a chemist and cosmeceutical skincare researcher, is best 
      known for introducing some of the world’s most cutting-edge skincare 
      ingredients including Alpha-Hydroxy Acid in 1983, Idebenone in 2004 and 
      CoffeeBerry® in 2007.
    

      “I’m extremely excited about the partnership,” said Joe Lewis. “The 
      combination of USC’s R&D technology and global professional skincare 
      heritage with Elizabeth Arden’s technology portfolio and aesthetic 
      formulation expertise, is a winning strategy not only for physicians and 
      skincare professionals, but for their patients seeking the most 
      efficacious product formulations that deliver the best results.“
    

      Yesterday, the company announced the first of the product line up, 
      Triple Protection Factor Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50+ (TPF 50), in 
      tandem with the publication of a clinical study on the product in the Journal 
      of Drugs in Dermatology. TPF 50, a groundbreaking new anti-aging 
      product, was developed based on a unique combination of protective 
      ingredients including a DNA Enzyme Complex, a highly potent protein 
      protection Antioxidant Complex and broad spectrum SPF 50+ sun 
      protection. The study finds TPF 50’s revolutionary skin protection 
      technology to reduce the effects of sun damage associated with skin 
      aging and non-melanoma skin cancer.1 To view the TPF 50

	Cosmetics retailer Elizabeth Arden  is trying to boost sales after reporting unimpressive second-quarter fiscal 2014 results last month. As part of this strategy, last week, the Miramar, FL-based company forayed into professional skincare business with the launch of it latest Elizabeth Arden Rx skincare line. The skincare cream will be available exclusively at physician’s office.

	The cream is a stand-alone home skincare claimed to address four skin conditions — Anti-Aging, Brightening, Clarifying and Hydration. The cream is claimed to contain proprietary ingredients like several patent-pending technologies — AHA Retinoid Conjugate, an AHA/Vitamin A derivative combination; Allyl PQQ, a mitochondrial anti-oxidant; and an anti-oxidant complex designed specifically to protect essential skin proteins against harmful degradation.

	The launch is in line with Elizabeth Arden’s omni-channel retail strategy under which it distributes its products at prestige retail outlets and spas. Using professional skin care offices as outlets is expected to add a new dimension to the company’s marketing strategy. Consumers will be more confident about the product if it is available at their skincare specialists’ chambers. This will help the company to reach its consumers in a credible, science-based environment.

	Elizabeth Arden has been striving to expand into the professional medical channel. It has also invested in US Cosmeceutechs, LLC (“USC”), a skin care company that develops and sells skin care products through professional dermatology and spa channels. The two companies first partnered in 2005 to launch skin care brand Prevage which gained instant popularity. The new skincare line has also been jointly designed by the two companies.

	Last month, this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company posted weak second-quarter fiscal 2014 results and withdrew its fiscal 2014 guidance.

	Elizabeth Arden’s second-quarter earnings of $1.08 fell short of the year-ago earnings by 31.6% due to lower sales and gross margins. Net sales of $418 million also lagged year-ago results by 10.1% due to lower year-over-year sales in all the geographical segments. Gross profit declined 17.3% year over year to $200.0 million due to lower sales and higher depreciation related to cost of goods sold.

	Weak holiday sales due to bad weather conditions in December and January were responsible for the weak results. Moreover, the company reported higher inventory due to low traffic in the company’s mass retail accounts, and reduced discretionary spending by consumers facing macroeconomic headwinds.

	Like Elizabeth Arden, many U.S.-based retailers like Fred’s Inc. (FRED  -  Free Report)	, Gap Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report)	 and Ross Stores Inc. (ROST  -  Free Report)	 registered lower-than-expected sales during the holiday season.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Net sales of $418 million also lagged year-ago results by 10.1% due to lower year-over-year sales in all the geographical segments. Gross profit declined 17.3% year over year to $200.0 million due to lower sales and higher depreciation related to cost of goods sold.Weak holiday sales due to bad weather conditions in December and January were responsible for the weak results. Moreover, the company reported higher inventory due to low traffic in the company’s mass retail accounts, and reduced discretionary spending by consumers facing macroeconomic headwinds.Like Elizabeth Arden, many U.S.-based retailers like Fred’s Inc. (FRED), Gap Inc. (GPS) and Ross Stores Inc. (ROST) registered lower-than-expected sales during the holiday season.Read the Full Research Report on GPSRead the Full Research Report on ROSTRead the Full Research Report on FREDRead the Full Research Report on RDENZacks Investment ResearchReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextTrump’s unwitting legacy could be universal health coverageYahoo FinanceEngineer Finds Pattern; Makes Millions in StocksMoney MorningSponsoredAirbnb sued by woman who says she was sexually assaulted by 'superhost'The GuardianTax cuts just got more likelyYahoo FinanceVietnam says others should respect its right to drill for South China Sea oilReutersDiscover it: 4.8 out of 5 avg. by 24K+ customersDiscover CardSponsoredPogue: The business of keeping 5,000 kitchens out of landfillsYahoo Finance VideoThe average person would pay $9 more for commercial-free cableYahoo FinanceSean Hannity responds to claim he ran up a $42,000 tab at Trump's hotel after flying in a 70-year-old lobster from MaineBusiness InsiderZuckerberg Wife's Ambitious Secret Finally ExposedUNewz.MeSponsoredIntel impresses with strong quarter, Starbucks and Mattel shares are tankingYahoo FinanceU.S. economic growth picks up in second quarter, wages continue to lagReutersXbox Live Games With Gold for August 2017InvestorPlace"Women Need To Carry This Device With Them"Siren SongSponsoredAmazon shares fall after profit falls way short of expectationsYahoo Finance VideoStocks whiff as earnings and economic data pour inYahoo FinanceTrump Rages at Republicans as John McCain Kills Obamacare Repeal BillSuzy Q: Trump PROMISED he had a healthcare bill that would lower costs, expand coverage, and offer more choices.

Elizabeth Arden PRO is a cutting-edge professional skincare brand.Distributed exclusively by authorized Skin therapists. When it comes to your skin, leave it to the PROFESSIONALS
CAMBRIDGE, ON, Aug. 26, 2014 /CNW/ - US CosmeceuTechs, LLC (USC), distributor of PRIORI® Skincare, Revaléskin® and PRIORI® MD, is excited to announce an exclusive partnership with Elizabeth Arden to combine their 100 years in spa heritage, R&D, and marketing with its scientific heritage and novel, innovative technologies.
Elizabeth Arden tapped the innovation expertise of USC and its CEO, Joe Lewis to collaborate on Elizabeth Arden  PRO. Lewis first partnered with Elizabeth Arden, Inc. in 2005 to launch Prevage®, which has won more than 160 awards globally. Lewis, a chemist and cosmeceutical skincare researcher, is best known for introducing some of the world's most cutting-edge skincare ingredients including Alpha-Hydroxy Acid in 1983, Idebenone in 2004 and CoffeeBerry® in 2007. He is also the founder of PRIORI® Skincare.
With this new partnership, Elizabeth Arden will enter the global professional skincare channel with the launch of Elizabeth Arden  PRO, a comprehensive skincare line that incorporates groundbreaking, clinically proven technologies in both homecare and professional treatment products.
"With Elizabeth Arden  PRO, we have an opportunity to provide the professional skincare market with some of our most advanced skincare technology," said Joe Lewis, CEO of USC. "These products are the result of years of research and the development of cutting-edge, clinically proven ingredients. All of this results in a highly effective yet aesthetically elegant skincare line."
Elizabeth Arden's entrepreneurial spirit and commitment to innovation, quality and excellence remain the soul of the company today, and USC is excited to partner with such a longstanding, esteemed member of the beauty industry.
Collaborative research between one of the most established and well-known cosmetics brands, Elizabeth Arden, and one of the world's most innovative, leading skincare scientists, Joe Lewis, results in a cutting-edge cosmeceuticals brand: Elizabeth Arden  PRO. This cutting-edge cosmeceuticals brand is based on clinical trials and the Skin Health & Beauty Pyramid™ philosophy.
ELIZABETH ARDEN PRO OVERVIEW
• Elizabeth Arden  PRO combines Elizabeth Arden's strength, history and leadership in skin health and beauty with US CosmeceuTechs, LLC's leadership in developing innovative cosmeceutical technologies.
• The mission of Elizabeth Arden  PRO is to deliver effective, simple skincare regimens to offer solutions to specific skin conditions that maximize the guidance of the Skin Health and Beauty Pyramid™, which dramatically simplifies product selection in a crowded, confusing marketplace with an increasing number of new technologies, ingredients and product claims.

• Our skincare strategy combines one of the most effective synergy and concentrations of essential ingredients and delivers them in the most easy to use manner possible to strengthen the therapist/client experience and relationship.

Elizabeth Arden  PRO addresses key skin conditions in five simple, concise regimens – Problem Prone, Brightening, Age Defying, Hydration and Sensitive – along with booster products that are designed for all skin types. Highly effective in-salon professional treatments will also be part of this new, innovative brand, providing simple solutions for clients to augment their Elizabeth Arden  PRO homecare regimens.
Elizabeth Arden  PRO homecare products are designed to enhance, maintain and optimize results between professional treatments by using proprietary ingredients including several new, patent-pending technologies: AHA Retinoid Conjugate, an AHA/Vitamin A derivative combination; Allyl PQQ, a new mitochondrial antioxidant; and a novel antioxidant complex designed to scavenge free radicals and offer critical protection to proteins.
"Elizabeth Arden  PRO offers a more complete approach to improving skin health with a comprehensive skincare regimen that provides safe, effective, simple solutions both in and out of the salon/clinic," said Arthur Pellegrino, Vice President, Research and Development at Elizabeth Arden. "These products are the result of years of research into the needs of clients and the development of novel new, clinically proven ingredients. All of this results in a highly effective yet aesthetically elegant skincare line."
"With Elizabeth Arden  PRO, we have an opportunity to provide therapists and clients with some of our most advanced skincare technology," said Joe Lewis, CEO of US CosmeceuTechs, LLC. "We believe the combination of these novel technologies offers new simple solutions for clients' skin conditions with improved efficacy, reduced irritation and therefore better overall results with enhanced compliance."
Elizabeth Arden boasts over 100 years of innovation in skin health and beauty, while US CosmeceuTechs, LLC has a 25-year history in pioneering new molecular innovations in the cosmeceutical skincare industry.
Elizabeth Arden started one of the first global prestige beauty companies at a time when it was uncommon for women to use cosmetics, much less run their own company. As a champion of women's suffrage, successful international entrepreneur and her holistic approach to beauty, she set the scene for what today is modern skin care. Elizabeth Arden opened her first spa in 1910: Red Door Spa in New York, and was one of the first in the industry that emphasized scientific theories as a basis for their skin care products.
PROFESSIONAL IN-SALON  TREATMENTSElizabeth Arden  PRO offers professional-strength, chemical peel treatments to address the key skin concern areas and are designed for fast, visible results with no downtime. Elizabeth Arden PRO professional salon treatments are uniquely tailored with specific combinations/concentrations of ingredients to "exfoliate" the stratum corneum without invasive damage to the underlying viable epidermis. Each customizable treatment includes a customized skincare regimen to address the key concerns of the client and to ensure that the most appropriate products are used for maximum results. The core treatment products is Hydrating Peel Gel, which uses a powerful, effective combination and concentration of anti-aging and hydrating ingredients including Lactic Acid (AHA), Glycolic Acid (AHA) and Salicylic Acid (BHA) plus antioxidants to help improve skin hydration and give a fresh, healthy radiant look to the skin.
HOME SKINCARE REGIMENSThe simple, concise Elizabeth Arden  PRO skincare regimens include homecare products that are innovative, highly effective, and multifunctional  in that they are formulated with some of today's most advanced ingredients and skincare technologies, such as the new patent-pending AHA Retinoid Conjugate. This conjugate is designed to work with the skin to deliver benefits of both AHA and Retinoid (Vitamin A derivative), while helping to reduce irritation. All Elizabeth Arden PRO homecare products offer multifunctional benefits to address clients' overall skincare concerns and are oil-free, non-comedogenic, dermatologist tested, fragrance-free and paraben-free.
Elizabeth Arden  PRO will only be sold to the professional skincare market and will be available August 2014 only at professional skincare locations.

Elizabeth Arden, Inc. announced the launch of its new Elizabeth Arden Rx skin care line, which will be available exclusively in physician offices. This is consistent with the company’s omni-channel growth strategy of selling and marketing Elizabeth Arden branded products in the prestige retail, spa and now the professional skin care market.
“Our core target is actively shopping in all skin care distribution channels,” said E. Scott Beattie, chairman, president and CEO of Elizabeth Arden, Inc. “Given our portfolio of efficacious prestige skin care products and spa-based brands, through our unique association with the Red Door Spas, we have an exciting opportunity to further build Elizabeth Arden equity by expanding into the medical professional channel. Expanding the company’s efforts to reach its target consumer in a credible, science-based environment is a strategic and logical next step for us.”







Through the company’s investment in US Cosmeceutechs, LLC (USC), a skin care company that develops and sells skin care products into the professional dermatology and spa channels, and its CEO Joe Lewis, Elizabeth Arden designed the new Elizabeth Arden Rx skin care line for exclusive distribution in physician offices. A key pillar to Elizabeth Arden’s multi-channel growth strategy, Elizabeth Arden Rx marks the company’s official entry into the global professional skin care market.
Lewis first partnered with Elizabeth Arden, Inc. in 2005 to launch Prevage. “I’m extremely excited about the [new] partnership,” said Lewis. “The combination of USC’s R&D technology and global professional skin care heritage with Elizabeth Arden’s technology portfolio and aesthetic formulation expertise, is a winning strategy not only for physicians and skin care professionals, but for their patients seeking the most efficacious product formulations that deliver the best results.“
