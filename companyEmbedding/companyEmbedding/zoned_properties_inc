Zoned Properties Issues Year End Shareholder Update 

Zoned Properties recently reported unaudited third quarter 
financials, in which it showed $10.5 M in assets including $9M in real estate 
and equipment. 
SCOTTSDALE, Arizona, December 18, 2014 - Zoned Properties, Inc. (OTC:
ZDPY) http://www.zonedproperties.com, 
a lessor of land, facilities and equipment to licensed medical marijuana 
operators has issued a year-end shareholder update. 

The company is pleased to announce updates regarding its senior leadership team 
and long-term operational strategy. Bryan McLaren, Chief Executive Officer, is 
excited to bring together a Board of Directors with an extensive background in 
business and leadership to help drive the future growth of the company. Mr. 
McLaren has successfully recruited Irvin Rosenfeld, Art Friedman, and Alex 
McLaren to join him on the Zoned Properties Board of Directors. The team is 
currently speaking with prospective candidates to fill the fifth board position. 
Our new Board of Directors includes leaders with vast experience from the 
medical marijuana advocacy movement, the alcohol distribution industry, and the 
field of medical research.

In addition, the company has signed agreements with Laura Anthony, ESQ to 
represent the company as SEC Counsel, along with Adam Wasserman, CPA to manage 
the preparation of the company’s financial statements. Mr. McLaren stated, “We 
have worked hard to build an experienced leadership team at Zoned Properties 
that will support our mission to create a company based on transparency and 
integrity – I’m proud to know that this team believes in the vision for the 
future for Zoned Properties.”

The company would like to announce the hiring of Michael Iacono, who will lead 
our Business Development team. Mr. Iacono comes to the company as a licensed 
real estate broker that will assist the company in expanding its operations on a 
national level. As the industry progresses into other states, he will be tasked 
with building the company’s backlog of opportunities. Currently, he will work to 
set up a Zoned Properties presence in Florida, expanding the operational 
network. 

Zoned Properties recently reported unaudited third quarter financials, in which 
it showed $10.5 M in assets including $9M in real estate and equipment. Those 
assets primarily represent five properties acquired in Arizona and New Mexico. 
At present time, four of the five properties have state-licensed medical 
marijuana operators signed to ten-year lease agreements. Each licensed tenant is 
currently operating and paying rent to Zoned Properties. 

The company is evaluating expansion projects in Oregon and Washington, as well 
as additional projects in Arizona and New Mexico. Mr. McLaren added "I am 
inspired by what our team has accomplished to date and by what we plan to 
accomplish in the coming months and years. We will continue recruiting top 
talent to join our team and strategically expand our property portfolio. The 
Board of Directors is pleased with the company’s third quarter profits and 
outlook as we continue to expand aggressively in 2015. Our brand name and 
leadership position within the industry gives us the ability to work with some 
of the most sophisticated operators on a national scale. We will continue to 
form these strategic relationships and successfully bring real assets to market 
with long-term revenue."

Zoned Properties, Inc. Issues Shareholder Update

SCOTTSDALE, Arizona, January 9, 2014 /PRNewswire/ --
Zoned Properties, Inc. (OTC: ZDPY) http://www.zonedproperties.com, a lessor of land, facilities and equipment to the medical marijuana market in Arizona has issued a shareholder update in regards to present and future projects.
The following is a summary of what has happened with the company recently and what their short, intermediate and long-term goals are.
Vanguard Minerals is now Zoned Properties, Inc. The trading symbol has been changed to ZDPY. The company's shares were up-listed from limited to current status. The entire management team has been changed and the company is no longer involved in mineral exploration. Zoned Properties, Inc. is a reinvented company with an entirely new focus, one that Zoned Properties, Inc. believes will deliver company shareholders great value in the coming weeks, months and years.
Zoned Properties, Inc. is currently focused on acquiring hard to find property that can be specially zoned for medical marijuana cultivation facilities and dispensaries. Currently the company is in late stage negotiations to acquire properties in Arizona, but has plans to move into the Nevada and New Mexico markets as well over the intermediate term.
"Zoned Properties, Inc. has spent a great deal of time identifying certain properties that can be zoned for dispensaries and cultivation and has moved ahead to acquire the ones that we believe will be of most value," stated Marc Brannigan, CEO of Zoned Properties, Inc. "We expect to update shareholders in great detail on these activities as soon as we have definitive agreements in place."
Zoned Properties, Inc. believes it is uniquely positioned in an industry that is growing as fast as any in the world. Mr. Brannigan added "We are planning to be a pure real estate play in this arena, one of the very few that will have hard assets unlike so many publicly traded companies in the space. Our tenants will be paying very high lease rates being that space for these operations is few and far between, highly sought after and very difficult to find in the states we are focusing on.  We believe that when investors see a long term recurring revenue stream from commercial operations, Zoned Properties, Inc. will be known as an innovator and leader in the space."
Zoned Properties, Inc. would also like to announce at this time that they have begun the search for new board members and other key management that can take the company to the next level. Zoned Properties, Inc. is already in the process of vetting potential candidates for these positions and will update shareholders when final decisions are made.

Zoned Properties[SM], Inc. Acquires Real Estate for Key Medical Marijuana Dispensary in Arizona

SCOTTSDALE, Arizona, February 5, 2014 /PRNewswire/ --
Zoned Properties[SM], Inc. closes on site for 8th largest medical marijuana dispensary in the state of Arizona
Zoned Properties[SM], Inc. (OTC: ZDPY) http://www.zonedproperties.com, a lessor of land, facilities, and equipment to the medical marijuana market in Arizona announces that it has closed on all of the real estate associated with the approved site for a medical marijuana dispensary located in Gilbert, Arizona for $1.115 million. The Town of Gilbert has already granted a conditional use permit and approved the design of the property, which is properly zoned for a medical marijuana dispensary.
In the state of Arizona, only one dispensary is permitted in each community health analysis area (CHAA) and a total of 99 licenses were awarded in a lottery held in August of 2012. Only one other location for a dispensary exists in the Town of Gilbert, the 7th largest municipality in a state with a population over 6.6 million.
Zoned Properties[SM], Inc. CEO Marc Brannigan stated, "Gilbert, Arizona adopted one of the more stringent zoning ordinances of any municipality in the entire state. We feel this is a tremendous accomplishment as our first completed commercial real estate transaction in the medical marijuana industry in the state of Arizona."
At present time, Zoned Properties[SM], Inc. is in advanced discussions with the dispensary license holder who intends to occupy the facility. Mr. Brannigan commented further, "These properties are not only hard to locate but once identified, getting the proper permits is not easy. Generally, lease rates for the medical marijuana industry are substantially above traditional retail or commercial lease rates. This is due to limited industry experience and higher than normal revenue per square foot. These leases tend to produce yields more consistent with high-end specialty retailers/services. Another factor is simply limited availability due to zoning laws and the subsequent ability to get the proper permits"
About Zoned Properties[SM], Inc.:
Zoned Properties[SM], Inc.is a strategic real estate investment firm whose primary focus is acquiring commercial properties that face unique zoning challenges. Zoned Properties[SM], Inc. will acquire commercial properties zoned within a variety of usage types such as industrial, agricultural, as well as mixed use. Zoned Properties[SM], Inc. also targets commercial properties that can be acquired and potentially re-zoned for specific purposes.
