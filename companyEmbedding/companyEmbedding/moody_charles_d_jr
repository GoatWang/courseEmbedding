 UBR Spotlight: Construction Co. CEO C. David Moody Jr.
More on the entrepreneurs, business strategies and economic news on The Urban Business Roundtable

This week on The Urban Business Roundtable, UBR Contributor Renita D. Young talks with Charles David Moody Jr., the CEO of C.D. Moody Construction Co. Based in Lithonia, Georgia, the contracting and construction management firm earned revenues of $75 million in 2010 to land at No. 49 on the Black Enterprise 100s list of the nation’s largest Black-owned industrial/service companies.
For more than 20 years Moody has led contracting and construction management projects in Georgia and throughout the southeastern region of the U.S., including renovations of some of Atlanta’s best-known landmarks, such as Hartsfield-Jackson Airport. Moody has been recognized with numerous awards for his business leadership, including being named Minority Contractor of the Year by the National Association of Minority Contractors and the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year.
Also, UBR Contributor Teria Seah sits down with small business expert Colleen DeBaise, author of The Wall Street Journal Complete Small Business Guidebook (Three Rivers Press), about the characteristics of the successful and productive entrepreneur.
In addition, in my “Alfred’s Notepad” segment, I talk about protecting the most important asset of your small business: you, the owner and CEO. Simply put: your health is the foundation of your wealth. Or, as actor and best-selling author Hill Harper says, in his latest book The Wealth Cure: Putting Money In Its Place, “Money plus Wellness equals Wealth.” I explain why entrepreneurs who don’t make their own health and wellness a top priority limit their ability to maximize their earning potential, while putting all of their other investments and relationships at risk.
And finally, every week on UBR, you’ll get motivation and inspiration from author and entrepreneurial icon Farrah Gray, a weekly wrap-up of business news from USA Today business correspondent Charisse Jones, our Patient Investor Report from Ariel Investments and key economic intelligence for small business owners from our UBR economists Derrick Collins and Rasheed Carter.
If you have a question you want answered or a topic you want addressed on The Urban Business Roundtable, connect with me at BE Insider, the social media network for people who are serious about Black Enterprise. You can also find me on Twitter and Facebook.
 
Alfred Edmond Jr. is the senior VP/editor-at-large of Black Enterprise and the host of the Urban Business Roundtable, a weekly radio show, sponsored by Ariel Investments, airing CST Wednesdays at 8:30 a.m., Thursdays at 6:30 p.m. and Saturdays at 9:30 a.m. on WVON-AM 1690, the Talk of Chicago. You can also listen live online at WVON.com.  Check back each week for UBR Spotlight, which features additional  resources, advice and information from and about the topics,  entrepreneurs and experts featured on the show.
