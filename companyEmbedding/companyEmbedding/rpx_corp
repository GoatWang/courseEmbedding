Due to their large numbers, companies are forced to direct resources and attention towards lawsuits.RPX helps companies drastically reduce their litigation exposure, with a unique business model that enjoys several durable competitive advantages.The firm's addressable market (patent litigation defense & insurance) remains largely untapped.The opportunity exists as most players within this space have a bad reputation, as many utilize their portfolio of patents in order to extract settlements/licensing fees from companies.I believe RPX Corporation is substantially undervalued at current levels (with 80%+ upside) even assuming no multiple expansion. Taking multiple expansion into consideration increases upside potential several-fold.Landscape of patent litigation
Intellectual property laws were created in order to promote progress. The idea was that an inventor or creator would be deterred from performing their purpose (inventing and creating) if they did not have any protection of their works created. When IP laws were created, inventors and creators had sufficient incentive (particularly incentive of the financial nature) to come up with new products and services that would allow societal progress. If an inventor created a product that was beneficial for society, said product could be commercialized, and the inventor could pocket the profit derived. The model worked well for decades.
Until recently.
"Patent trolling" rapidly became infamous in the 2000s. Patent trolls, as they are pejoratively named, discovered that they could purchase a portfolio of patents, initiate lawsuits on the basis on patent infringement, and pocket the settlement offered by the defendant. Typically, the patent troll purchases patent from financially-distressed companies, thus allowing the patent troll to acquire intellectual property at cheap prices, due to the presence of a cash-strapped and highly motivated seller. This practice was highly lucrative resulting in a flood of patent trolls adopting a similar modus operandi. Suffice to say, as the number of patent trolls increased, patents became more expensive. Regardless, the practice remains feasible from a financial standpoint.


Although successful infringement lawsuits are few and far between, the outsized payout (as seen in the above) from a single lawsuit continued to motivate patent trolls. Companies began to suffer from lawsuits initiated by patent troll. Most notably, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the #1 target for patent trolls, having received over a hundred lawsuits in recent years. Patent trolling is clearly a big problem.
The curious reader would probably have the following question in mind: can't companies defend against these lawsuits? To that question, the answer is a resoundingly yes. However, not only does legal defense not come cheap, patent lawsuits tend to distract management from their core operations. Additionally, settlement costs are equally huge. Combined, legal defense and settlements costs to the industry have grown from $5.5b in 2009 to $12.2b in 2014 (as seen below).

Furthermore, the defendant is in no position to counter-sue, given that the plaintiff (patent troll) typically does not create or sell their own products and services. Hence, there is no legal basis for a countersuit.
RPX Corporation (NASDAQ:RPXC) offers a solution.
Enter RPX Corporation
The company's business model is rather simple to understand. RPXC offers two solutions:

a defensive patent aggregation solution,
and insurance to cover the costs of patent litigation.

Simply put, RPXC first acquires a portfolio of patents (thus aggregating them) and then provides their clients with licenses to these patent assets, hence protecting said clients from potential litigation exposure. In a nutshell, the company acts as a middleman between its clients and patents. Additionally, the company also offers patent litigation insurance, which serves as a natural add-on to its core patent risk management solution.


Source: RPX Corporation
The firm's core patent risk management solution is a tremendous value-add to its clients. The rationale here is simple. Essentially, RPXC helps its clients dramatically reduce the cost of patent litigation. The patent market is highly irrational due to the presence of huge deadweight losses (primarily legal costs). Non-practicing entities ("NPEs", a more palatable term for patent trolls) use litigation to transfer value between patent owners and users. Litigation costs are substantial.

RPXC is able to buy high-quality patent assets cheaply (9x and 3x for pre-litigation and litigation acquisition respectively) before they become a costly problem (whether pre-litigation or during litigation, as seen above) due to the fact that it shares the cost amongst its large clientele (over 200 clients and growing), which increases their overall negotiating leverage. In the absence of these lawsuits, litigation costs decrease substantially. Licenses are less expensive as they are negotiated and not litigated. In a nutshell, RPXC can settle litigation issues for its clients at 1/9 or 1/3 of the cost. In addition, the client's management team can focus their effort on their core operations instead of lawsuits. Suffice to say, RPXC adds substantial value to its clients.

The business makes money from its patent risk management solution through subscription fees collected from its clients from the licensing of patent assets. These fees are typically calculated as a percentage of the client's top-line or operating income, thus allowing RPXC to not only participate in the financial success of its clients but also ensures the alignment of interests for both parties. As for the insurance solution, RPXC adopts a cookie-cutter insurance model, collecting premiums upfront and distributing payouts contingent on certain events.
Reducing litigation exposure with a business model that enjoys durable competitive advantages
Barriers to entry to this space are formidable. RPXC derives its competitive advantages from the following sources:

capital requirements,
reputation & track record,
scale,
and network effects.

Purchasing one or two patents is just not going to cut it; the value proposition for such companies looking to manage patent litigation exposure is just not there. As a result, a newcomer looking to enter the space would require substantial amounts of capital in order to purchase a diverse portfolio of patent assets (RPXC spends $100m annually to acquire patents - to date, the company has spent nearly $1b), resulting in the creation of a meaningful barrier to entry.
However, acquiring these patent assets is not enough. Reputation and track record matters. The new challenger would need to spend months or even years (RPXC mentioned its sales cycle may span over a year) convincing a potential client that it can be trusted as a service provider. The reasoning for this is simple; the potential client has no idea if the new entrant would simply do a bait-and-switch (since the new entrant would have a portfolio of patents) and litigate the client. Therefore, reputation and track record counts for a lot. RPXC has been in operation for 7 years, and to the best of my knowledge, the company has maintained a pristine track record of never litigating its clients.

Even if capital requirements, reputation, and track record were not an issue, without a large installed base of clients providing a steady stream of subscription fees, the challenger would need to operate at a loss for many years before they achieve scale.
Finally, network effects are particularly prominent in this space. There is only a limited number of patents issued every year, and patents do expire (usually within 20 years from date of issue). Major players such as RPXC who possess a portfolio of 227 high-quality (diverse applications across their clientele) patent assets present a compelling proposition to existing and potential clients. As the company expands its client base, new patents that are acquired from the addition of clients can be licensed to existing clients, resulting in value enhancement for the entire network with each incremental addition. Additionally, as the network grows, its negotiating leverage grows in tandem, as purchases of patent assets are made by a consortium, not a single entity.
In a nutshell, we have a business that:

provides a highly compelling value proposition to companies that face patent litigation exposure (i.e. nearly every technology company),
possesses extremely durable competitive advantages stemming from formidable barriers to entry (which manifests from the presence of capital requirements, scale, reputation & track record, and network effects),
and generates highly-recurring cash flows (derived from a large installed base of subscribers and consistent cash in-flow from insurance premiums).

Not many businesses share these characteristics; RPXC is without a doubt, a great business.
As always, qualitative discussion is all well and good, but the numbers need to back up the narrative. In this case, they do. Competition theory tells us that the greater the barriers to entry, the higher the profit margins the incumbent can earn, and the longer the incumbent can maintain said profit margins. RPXC has consistently earned 73% EBITDA margins (per Morningstar data) that have remained remarkably stable in the past half-decade. Subscription fees and insurance premiums, revenue streams that are highly-recurring (90% renewal rates), form the entirety of the company's revenue base.

The firm's addressable market (patent litigation defense & insurance) remains largely untapped
Due to its rather unique business model, RPXC can grow in several ways. I believe the most plausible ways are:

continued additions to its client base (results in increased subscription fees and insurance premiums collected),
and improvement in financial performance of its network of clients (as subscription fees are tied to revenues/operating income of RPXC's customers).

Earlier, I emphasized the fact that RPXC helps companies reduce litigation costs in two key areas - pre-litigation and during litigation. It follows that the market opportunity for RPXC in the latter area can be quantified by a metric that measures the volume of litigation - specifically the number of active NPE campaigns.

Source: RPX Corporation
As seen above, the number of active NPE campaigns have been growing at a rapid pace - the 2014 number is more than double that in 2010. This effectively illustrates the size of the market opportunity that is available to RPXC. To put things in perspective, RPXC was able to obtain sub-licenses for 35 campaigns in 2014, compared to a total of 1348 campaigns. This represents a mere 2.6% penetration, supporting my belief that the company's addressable market (within the pre-litigation and litigation areas) remains largely untapped.
New campaigns will always be filed as more patents get approved, but due to RPXC's tremendous value-add (discussed earlier), its clients would either exit those actions or never encounter them in the first place. It is good to be an RPXC client. Due to the company's highly attractive value proposition and the prevalent nature of NPE campaigns, I expect RPXC's penetration to increase meaningfully in the near-term.

Network effects will play a huge role in enticing new clients to come on board. This is not a mere hypothetical - it is already happening. The company managed to add an increasing number of clients year after year (client additions were 36, 28, and 28 for the years 2014, 2013, and 2012). In Q1 FY15 alone, the company added 20 new clients on a net basis, indicating that network effects are ever-strengthening.

Source: RPX Corporation
The market potential within the patent litigation insurance space is similarly untapped. To date, the company has 57 policyholders (they only began selling policies late-2014). As seen above, management has identified that there are possibly over 10,000 companies that require such insurance. Although one can make the argument that other insurance companies (as insurance is largely a commodity) can acquire market share in the patent litigation insurance space, the argument does not hold.
This is because underwriting insurance policies in this area is largely unheard of, due to the inability of insurers to estimate the likelihood of payouts in order to price premiums correctly. In the case of RPXC, the company has been able to compile proprietary data sets on the frequency of NPE litigations and the cost of said litigations. This is thanks to their core patent risk management solution which provides RPXC with an underwriting advantage, thus allowing the firm to estimate likelihood of payouts and price premiums very accurately. Other insurers are simply unable to do this - they do not have the data. This underwriting advantage is likely to be durable as the company expands its data sets over time. As a result, RPXC currently faces next to no competition in the area of patent litigation insurance, and should soon see increasing penetration (due to network effects detailed earlier) going forward.


Source: RPX Corporation
Additionally, as subscription fees derived from the company's core patent risk management solution is structured as a percentage of the revenue/operating income of its clients, RPXC can benefit from improvements in the operating performance of their clients. As seen above, the firm's client network is highly diversified within the technology sector. The sector is likely to experience massive growth in the near-term due to the trends in cloud computing, big data, social, eCommerce and mobile. RPXC will tag along with this growth.

Source: RPX Corporation
This tag-along is likely to benefit RPXC hugely as the company's clients are major players that participate in fast-growing markets mentioned above. They include heavyweights such as Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), LinkedIn (LNKD), IBM (NYSE:IBM), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and many more.
Valuation



Note that capital expenditures are not assumed to be constant thus it is left blank in the key assumptions tab, and varied within the model itself.
I have modeled out the company's free cash flows as seen above. FY15 revenue growth is expected to be in the high single-digits, which is in-line with management estimates. From FY16-18, I expect RPXC to be able to continue growing revenue at mid to high single-digit growth rates. I believe this growth will be driven by greater penetration within the markets (patent risk management & insurance) that the firm serves, along with client operating performance improvements. EBITDA margins are expected to be flat at ~72%. This is due to the fact that formidable barriers to entry (as outlined earlier) are able to deter new entrants for entering the space and forcing margins down. I will address this point further in a later section. I believe this is a conservative estimate as the company managed 40% operating margins in Q1 FY15, compared to the normal 32% in prior quarters. If this margin expansion is sustainable, upside potential will be far greater.

Source: RPX Corporation
Capital expenditures include net acquisition spending on patent assets. I have modeled this line item to decline meaningfully as a percentage of sales as the company begins to benefit from increased scale as a result of the addition of more clients to its network. This is further supported by the company's historical net acquisition spend as seen above. Utilizing a terminal growth rate of 3% and a 10% discount rate, my model implies substantial upside (80%+) from current levels. Additionally, this analysis does not include the upside potential as a result of margin expansion. As a result, I believe the company is severely undervalued at current trading prices.

"Stagnant" profitability
One potential bone of contention that investors might have with the company is its apparently-stagnant GAAP profitability (net income has remained at $39-$41m throughout 2012-2014). However, I believe that net income is not a reasonable metric to measure the company's performance. As a by-product of RPXC's business model, amortization charges have been the primary contributor to a flat net income over the period mentioned. I opine that examining cash flow metrics is a better indicator of the firm's performance. Over the 2012-2014 period, cash from operations doubled. Thus, I believe that the company actually benefits from its huge amortization expenses which allow it to reduce pre-tax income, thus leading to lower taxes paid.
Why this opportunity exists and risks to the thesis
Historically, NPEs have a rather bad reputation. Not only are their practices controversial, their business models are highly volatile (and thus unattractive to investors) due to their reliance on large (and essentially "forced") licensing deals and settlements that they can extract from the companies they litigate or threaten to litigate. RPXC gets lumped together with NPEs due to the fact that both parties compete with one another in the patent acquisition market. It follows that RPXC is underfollowed as investors may dismiss the company as an NPE due to its activity in the patent acquisition market.
Further, prominent NPEs such as Acacia Research (NASDAQ:ACTG) trade at multiples that are drastically higher than that of RPXC. For reference, RPXC currently trades at about 2-3x EBITDA, while ACTG trades at about 30x EBITDA. I believe the reason why ACTG trades at such a premium multiple is due to their presumably sizable backlog of pending litigation activity, which investors feel may result in large payouts either in the form of settlements of licensing deals.
I believe that the primary risk to the bull case is the threat of competition. If one considers RPXC's coveted EBITDA margins, it is not a stretch to assert that the threat of competition should be on every investor's mind. However, I believe this risk is heavily mitigated by several factors explained below.

The model that ACTG and Intellectual Ventures (another high-profile NPE) adopts is not sustainable without frequent external capital infusions. These companies can go a long time without pocketing a large payout. One need only examine ACTG falling revenues as evidence of this. The NPE has been executing lesser agreements (whether settlement or licensing) in recent years, with the number of new agreements executed falling from 138 to 88 over the 2012-2014 period. In addition, the company's cash-flow streams are slowly drying up, as the number of licensing and enforcement programs that generate revenue fell from 68 to 46 over the same period. ACTG reported a net loss for 2014 and is also cash-flow negative. A side effect of this unprofitability is that ACTG is unlikely to be able to meaningfully compete with RPXC in the area of patent asset acquisition. As ACTG is cash-strapped and RPXC is not (as RPXC is able to syndicate capital through its network of clients, substantially increasing its financial strength to buy patents), ACTG is unlikely to be able to bid higher than RPXC for patent assets. A similar case can be made for other patent trolls. Clearly, the patent troll model is not built to last.
In contrast, RPXC's business model is built with long-term durability in mind. The firm does not rely on huge one-time payouts or short-lived annuity streams to finance further growth. Instead, its cash-flow is generated from the subscription fees collected from its clientele and insurance premiums that it collects from underwriting patent litigation insurance. Without a doubt, RPXC's business model is clearly better. Therefore, I opine that the company is likely to experience meaningful multiple expansion as investors begin to realize the difference between the RPXC model and the patent troll model.
The clever reader would then pose the following question: can't NPEs transition into a model similar to RPXC? At first sight, this seems to be possible. After all, many NPEs possess substantial patent assets (particularly Intellectual Ventures, which has consistently been ranked in the top 5 patent owners in the US). However, if one examines further, they would come to the conclusion that such a transition is nearly impossible.

The reasoning is simple. These NPEs have a history of litigating companies in order to extract huge payouts. As elaborated earlier, reputation and track record counts for a lot in this space. It would be a huge stretch to posit that potential clients would be willing to work with a former NPE instead of RPXC, given the NPEs' tainted track record. Other competitive advantages which mitigate the threat of competition, such as capital requirements, scale, and network effects have been explained in earlier paragraphs.
Substantially undervalued middleman in the patent litigation industry
RPXC is a pioneer in the field of patent litigation, and adopts a business model that enjoys several highly-durable competitive advantages. New entrants would have a tough time entering the industry, thus allowing the RPXC to maintain its 70%+ EBITDA margins going forward. Furthermore, it would be nigh impossible for existing competitors that compete with the company in the market for patent assets to transition to the RPXC model. The potential for growth remains largely untapped, whether in patent risk management or in patent litigation insurance. As detailed earlier, RPXC is severely undervalued even if we assume that the company would not be able to experience multiple expansion in the future, something that I view is highly unlikely. I have little doubt that RPXC is a terrific business due to its numerous competitive advantages, and thus the firm deserves a premium multiple.
RPXC is a highly attractive long candidate for the investor with a long-term horizon. The company is poised to acquire market share with little threat of competition and thus is likely to trade at a steep multiple in the future. Its defensive end-market exposure (patent litigation is unlikely to be hugely affected by ebbs and flows in the economy) should mitigate cyclicality. Couple this with its strong cash flow conversion, the firm should offer solid FCF yield even if it trades at higher multiples.The firm is also substantially undervalued at current levels with 80% upside per my DCF. Thus, I highly recommend a long position in RPXC. After all, it is not every day one finds a firm generating 70%+ EBITDA margins (that are likely to remain stable going forward), with largely-untapped growth potential, trading at 3x EBITDA.

Business[edit]
RPX's service is designed to mitigate membersâ litigation risk and costs from NPEs by purchasing patents and patent rights before patents are asserted, or to resolve an ongoing litigation.
RPX clients receive a license to all of the patents and associated rights aggregated in the RPX portfolio. Over time, RPX clients receive perpetual license to the patents held when they became members or purchased after they joined, as well as any patents sold during their membership.
The service is structured on an annual membership. Annual membership fees may increase each year to account for the growing value of the RPX portfolio, but early-joining members lock in a lower rate. Companies that join the RPX client network later receive the same benefits, but must pay the then-current rates.
RPX provides data services as part of its membership.[8] The RPX client portal provides data related to patents and patents available for sale, historical and current patent litigation and NPEs.[9] however the product is not publicly available (exclusive to RPX members)[10] and it has yet to be seen how the RPX portal compares to other services. In May 2014, to increase transparency, the company released RPX Search - a search engine that provides free public access to most of its data - independent of RPX membership.[11]
History[edit]
RPX was founded in 2008 by John Amster, Geoffrey Barker and Eran Zur. The company was initially financed by Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Charles River Ventures,[12] and Index Ventures.
In its first year, RPX generated $0.8 million revenue in that year. Revenue grew to $32.8 million in 2009, reaching profitability. In the first nine months of 2010 RPX earned $10 million in profit on $65.2 million in revenue.[13]. RPX's revenue for the year 2016 was $333.1 million[14].
RPX filed an S1[15] on January 21, 2011 and RPX began publicly trading on the NASDAQ exchange as "RPXC" in May 2011.
RPX arranged a consortium to purchase 4000 Nortel patents from the Rockstar Consortium in December 2014.[16][17]

RPX Launches New "A" Rated NPE Patent Litigation Insurance with Lloyd's
RPX subsidiary approved as a coverholder at Lloyd's


SAN FRANCISCO, April 16, 2014 /PRNewswire/ --Â RPX Corporation (NASDAQ: RPXC), the leading provider of patent risk management solutions today launched a new insurance service for businesses facing patent infringement litigation with non-practicing entities (NPEs). Â As a coverholder at Lloyd's, RPX Insurance Services, LLC will provide marketing, underwriting, and claims management services on behalf of a syndicate at Lloyd's. Â As part of its entry to this new service, RPX has formed a reinsurance company that will share a portion of the underwritten risk. 
Any company today that provides a technology-based product or service is at risk from the growing threat of NPEs, also known by the "patent troll" moniker.Â  RPX's insurance solution focuses on the underlying causes of NPE risk.Â  Through proactive market intervention, RPX reduces risk exposure by acquiring patents before NPEs can assert them against its network of 168 clients. Â The company has deployed more than $100 million annually to acquire patents in each of the past six years.Â  This acquisition activity has led to companies in the RPX network receiving more than 430 dismissals from over 60 litigations. Â Using the unique data from this industry-leading acquisition activity to drive its actuarial model and underwriting methodology, RPX can model patent risk for policyholders and offer effective risk transfer.
"Our approval as a coverholder at Lloyd's further endorses our unique approach, and paves the way for RPX to offer a mainstream insurance product that could become as widely accepted as D&O or cyber liability coverage.Â  We hope this RPX solution can enable patent risk to become a reasonable and predictable line item in companies' budgets, as opposed to the highly unpredictable risk it is today," said John A. Amster, Chief Executive and Co-founder of RPX.
NPE patent litigation costs companies worldwide almost $13 billion in defense expenses and settlements last year, up from roughly $5 billion in 2008.Â  Also, RPX research shows the volume of NPE patent suits over the past five years increased nearly 600%, from approximately 600 in 2008 to more than 3,600 in 2013, impacting approximately 8,000 companies in the same period.
As of December 31, 2013, RPX had invested over $750 million to acquire more than 4,200 US and international patent assets and rights on behalf of the 168 members of its client network in seven key sectors: consumer electronics and PCs, E-commerce and software, financial services, media content and distribution, mobile communications and devices, networking, and semiconductors.Â  
Lloyd's currently enjoys an "A" rating from AM Best and A+ ratings from Fitch Ratings and Standard & Poor's.Â  
About RPX CorporationRPX CorporationÂ (NASDAQ: RPXC)Â is the leading provider of patent risk solutions, offering defensive buying, acquisition syndication, patent intelligence, insurance services, and advisory services.Â  Since its founding in 2008, RPX has introduced efficiency to the patent market by providing a rational alternative to litigation.Â  The San Francisco-based company's pioneering approach combines principal capital, deep patent expertise, and client contributions to generate enhanced patent buying power.Â  By acquiring patents and patent rights, RPX helps to mitigate and manage patent risk for its growing client network.

Together they interact with thousands of brokers daily to create insurance solutions for businesses in over 200 countries and territories around the world.

					Full Description



RPX Corporation, incorporated on July 15, 2008, is engaged in providing an alternative to litigation through its patent risk management services. The Company helps companies reduce patent litigation risk and corporate legal expense through two primary service offerings: patent risk management services and discovery services. The Company operates through two segments: patent risk management and discovery services. Its patent risk management segment generates its revenues from membership subscriptions, premiums earned from insurance policies, and management fees for marketing, underwriting, and claim management. Its discovery services segment generates its revenues from fees generated for data collection, hosting and processing, project management, and document review services.Patent Risk Management ServicesThe Company's patent risk management services reduce transaction costs incurred by owners of patents and prospective licensees of those patents compared to transactions driven by actual or threatened litigation. The core of this service is defensive patent aggregation, in which it acquires patents or licenses to patents that are being or may be asserted by patent owners against its clients. When it acquires patent assets, it generally provides to its clients non-exclusive sub-licenses to those patent assets. As a part of its patent risk management services, it provides patent market intelligence and data to its clients. Clients can access this market intelligence and data through its Web portal and through discussions with its client relations team. This market intelligence and data helps its clients understand past and potential patent acquisition transactions, relevant litigation activity and key participants and trends in the patent market. It offers patent litigation insurance that covers certain costs associated with patent infringement lawsuits. Its insurance product helps policyholders manage and cap their risk of patent litigation. It is responsible for claims management and provides pre-litigation support to its policyholders based on its patent market data, which helps them manage their patent.Discovery ServicesThe Company's discovery services offering helps clients manage the costs and risks related to the legal discovery process through the use of technology and a managed services model. Its approach is designed to streamline the administration of litigation matters, internal and external investigations, regulatory compliance, and other matters by offering a range of technology-enabled services, including document collection and processing, document review, document production and project management. Its discovery services clients include corporations and law firms. The Company offers services to its clients, including Data Collection and Forensics; Data Processing and Analytics; Data Hosting; Project Management; Production, and Document Review Services. The Company acquires patent assets from various parties, including operating companies, individual inventors, non-practicing entities (NPEs), universities and bankruptcy trustees. Clients can access this market intelligence and data through its Web portal and through discussions with its client relations team.The Company serves clients in a range of industries, including consumer electronics, personal computers, e-commerce, financial services, software, media content and distribution, mobile communications and handsets, networking and semiconductors. The Company offers multiple collection platforms and techniques aimed at harvesting relevant data. The Company offers data filtering techniques and processing services using various third-party software, data analytics and technology assisted review. It offers data production capacity and printing, copying and scanning services. It utilizes a variable workforce model to manage and staff the activities required to review document collections in legal matters. These tasks include sourcing qualified legal professionals for project-based work, developing review protocols and quality control procedures, and providing guidance to outside counsel throughout the various stages of the discovery process. It operates data centers domestically and internationally that provide access to its software environment and client databases.The Company competes with Wi-LAN, Acacia Research, PanOptis, DTI Global, KrolLDiscovery, Consilio and FTI Consulting.

RPX Corporation (Rational Patent EXchange)(NASDAQ:Â RPXC) is an American worldwide provider of patent risk management services, offering defensive buying, acquisition syndication, patent intelligence and advisory services. Since the company was founded in March, 2008,[1] RPX claims to have introduced efficiency to the patent market by providing a rational alternative to litigation. RPX is based in San Francisco. By acquiring patents that pose potential problems and providing information on litigation, RPX seeks to reduce patent assertions directed at its clients.[2]
RPX provides a Defensive Patent Aggregation service to mitigate clientsâ risk of litigation from non-practicing entities (NPEs) â also called patent trolls â which acquire patents for the sole purpose of licensing and asserting their patent rights.[3][4]
RPX identifies and purchases patent assets they identify as of high value, relevance and risk that could be used offensively against members of the company's client network. Depending on the situation, RPX may acquire assets from a third party or directly from an NPE. [5] When necessary and possible, RPX will buy patent rights out of an active litigation.
RPX promises to never assert or litigate the patents in its portfolio.[6][7]

Business[edit]
RPX's service is designed to mitigate membersâ litigation risk and costs from NPEs by purchasing patents and patent rights before patents are asserted, or to resolve an ongoing litigation.
RPX clients receive a license to all of the patents and associated rights aggregated in the RPX portfolio. Over time, RPX clients receive perpetual license to the patents held when they became members or purchased after they joined, as well as any patents sold during their membership.
The service is structured on an annual membership. Annual membership fees may increase each year to account for the growing value of the RPX portfolio, but early-joining members lock in a lower rate. Companies that join the RPX client network later receive the same benefits, but must pay the then-current rates.
RPX provides data services as part of its membership.[8] The RPX client portal provides data related to patents and patents available for sale, historical and current patent litigation and NPEs.[9] however the product is not publicly available (exclusive to RPX members)[10] and it has yet to be seen how the RPX portal compares to other services. In May 2014, to increase transparency, the company released RPX Search - a search engine that provides free public access to most of its data - independent of RPX membership.[11]
History[edit]
RPX was founded in 2008 by John Amster, Geoffrey Barker and Eran Zur. The company was initially financed by Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Charles River Ventures,[12] and Index Ventures.
In its first year, RPX generated $0.8 million revenue in that year. Revenue grew to $32.8 million in 2009, reaching profitability. In the first nine months of 2010 RPX earned $10 million in profit on $65.2 million in revenue.[13]. RPX's revenue for the year 2016 was $333.1 million[14].
RPX filed an S1[15] on January 21, 2011 and RPX began publicly trading on the NASDAQ exchange as "RPXC" in May 2011.
RPX arranged a consortium to purchase 4000 Nortel patents from the Rockstar Consortium in December 2014.[16][17]

Investor Relations











	RPX Corporation was founded in 2008 to provide corporate legal departments with new technology-enabled services to reduce cost and risk and to improve transactional efficiency.

	The companyâs first services were aimed at rationalizing the process of patent licensing â in particular, the expensive and wasteful infringement litigation costs brought on by non-practicing entities (NPEs, also known as âpatent trollsâ). RPXâs pioneering defensive patent acquisition network and its unique patent litigation insurance products use data, market-based tools, and collaboration to efficiently mitigate risk. To date, RPX has cleared more than 15,500 patents, achieved over 1,000 litigation dismissals and saved its nearly 320 clients more than $3.3 billion dollars in avoided legal costs and inflated settlements.

	In 2016, RPX extended its services into the related legal area of eDiscovery when it acquired Inventus Solutions, Inc. Inventus is a leading international Discovery management provider focused on reducing the costs and risks associated with the Discovery process through the effective use of technology solutions. The Inventus offering includes Hosting and Analysis, Managed Review, and Workflow Tools.

	RPXâs combined offering of patent risk management and Discovery management reduces the risk and cost for corporate legal departments. By providing powerful technology and expertise-based solutions, RPX is able to make legal services more efficient by lowering the unnecessary costs associated with legal transactions and patent licensing.

	Operating Units

RPX: Patent Risk ManagementÂ 

	RPX provides solutions that rationalize and lower the costs of patent licensing by reducing the unnecessary legal costs associated with infringement litigation brought by NPEs.

	The companyâs core defensive patent acquisition service uses market-based principles to buy or license patents preemptively, before they can become expensive sources of litigation for clients. Â Members of the RPX client network pay an annual fee. We then use this aggregated capital to acquire potentially problematic patents and rights from the pre-litigation market and out of active litigations. Members of the network receive a license to every asset acquired. RPX never litigates or asserts the patent assets it purchases.

	In addition to our core patent acquisition service, RPX also facilitates large-scale syndicated licensing transactions that can include non-members and members (who make contributions beyond their regular subscription fees).

	RPX also offers a suite of unique patent litigation insurance products. The policies offer a variety of coverage options, and all are written on A rated paper and backed by a Lloydâs underwriting syndicate.

	As part of all its services, RPX provides clients with a unique trove of in-depth industry data, analysis, and market intelligence. The company also offers strategic patent advisory services.

	The RPX network has grown to comprise nearly 320 clients in sectors including automotive, consumer electronics and personal computing, E-commerce and software, financial services, media content and distribution, mobile communications, networking, and semiconductors.

Inventus: Legal Discovery ManagementÂ 

	The acquisition of Inventus has expanded the suite of technology-enabled services RPX provides to help legal departments reduce risk and costs associated with the processes they manage every day. Inventus provides intelligent document analysis, hosting and managed review to its clients for litigation and investigations. Inventus serves industries across the board from Financial Services, Energy, Healthcare, Retail, Aerospace and Defense, and Technology.

	The Discovery management solution provides three main services:

	1) Hosting/Analysis, which involves identifying, collecting and securely hosting potentially relevant data.
	2) Reviewing and coding relevant documents by contract attorneys.
	3) Workflow Tools involving proprietary middleware to enhance client efficiency.

	Specifically, Inventus LuminosityÂ® reduces cost and risk by processing data once, culling data collection, and streamlining the review process. M3: Multi Matter ManagementÂ®, the latest offering from Inventus, is a Discovery management solution that lets corporations recycle data, coding, and valuable attorney work product to save time and expense. Both products exemplify Inventus' technology-enabled approach to enhanceing the legal discovery process and creating a more cost-effective discovery services practice.

	Inventus expands RPXâs growth strategy and its ability to serve a broader corporate legal market opportunity. While the RPX core business will focus on continued defensive patent buying and broadening the insurance client base, the addition of Inventus provides technology solutions that make legal activity more efficient by lowering the unnecessary costs associated with legal transactions.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
