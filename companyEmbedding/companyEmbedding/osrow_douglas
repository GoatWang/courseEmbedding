Forward-looking statements may be in the future tense, and often include words such as "anticipate", "expect", "project", "believe", "plan", "estimate", "intend", "will" and "may". These statements are based on current expectations, but are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and are beyond the control of Remark Media. Relevant risks and uncertainties include those referenced in Remark Media's filings with the SEC, and include but are not limited to: our losses and need to raise capital; ability to procure content and monetize audiences; recent and future changes in technology, services and standards; a disruption or failure of Remark Media's or its vendors' network and information systems or other technology relied on by Remark Media; changes in consumer behavior, including changes in spending behavior and changes in when, where and how content is consumed; the popularity of Remark Media's products and services; changes in Remark Media's plans, initiatives and strategies, and consumer acceptance thereof; competitive pressures, including as a result of user fragmentation and changes in technology; changes in advertising market conditions or advertising expenditures due to, among other things, economic conditions, changes in consumer behavior, pressure from public interest groups, changes in laws and regulations and other societal or political developments; piracy and Remark Media's ability to exploit and protect its intellectual property rights in and to its content and other products; restrictions on intellectual property under agreements with third parties; challenges inherent in developing an online business; reliance on key personnel; risks of business in foreign countries, notably China and Brazil, including obtaining regulatory approvals and adjusting to changing political and economic policies; governmental laws and regulations, including unclear and changing laws and regulations related to the internet sector in foreign countries, especially China; general industry conditions and competition; and general economic conditions, such as advertising rate, interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the forward-looking statements, and therefore should be carefully considered. Remark Media assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments, except as required by law.
