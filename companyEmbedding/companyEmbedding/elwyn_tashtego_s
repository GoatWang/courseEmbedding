                                Report abuseTranscript of TASHTEGOTASHTEGO BACKGROUND PROBLEM •Should the motor vessel Tashtego be used as a freight tender between Das-es-Salaam and Zanzibar in East Africa or;•As a tapioca ship between Balik Papan and Singapore in the East Indies DATAS DATA 1: The Tapioca Trade between Balik Papan and Singapore•Round Trip between Balik Papan and Singapore is 960 miles                                        Large Vessel                     TashtegoBalik Papan – Singapore  6850 tons of tapioca   3950 tons of tapiocaSingapore – Balik Papan  3150 tons of tapioca   3150 tons of tapioca•SP: Balik Papan – Singapore = $5.10; Singapore – Balik Papan = $2.70•There appeared to be a stable or increasing demand for tapioca. findings and discussion conclusion/recommendation Assuming constant sales, using Tashtego as a freight tender between Dar-es-Sallam and Zanzibar is a better decision because it would have bigger profits. Moreover, costs are cheaper by more than 100k compared to Singapore to Balik Papan route. These cheaper costs are resulted from the shorter travel distance, cheaper trip cost and cargo cost. However, the decision should not only depend on the cost; it should also depend on the demand for the shipments. The management should also consider the time constraints. MS can cover its costs and sustain its profits in the long-run, then it should continue investing on Teshtego for the Dar-es-Salaam to Zanzibar route. In the meantime, Mr. Georgepoulis should invest on Tashtego and try to reduce its costs further as much as possible. Since Macedonian Shipping was one of very few fully booked shipping lines in the business, it only has few competitors so in the short-run, MS can still change a relatively high but still reasonable price to its customers. The long-run is a different story; MS can expect more competitors in the industry. By this time, MS should find ways to outrun its competitors.

It's often used to thicken soups and sweeten the flavor of baked goods, and it makes a dandy pudding. http://ask.yahoo.com/20010702.html•Tapioca pudding is similar to sago pudding•Balik Papan obtained a grant to deepen the harbor channel so ships of up to 15,000 tons can pass through.
