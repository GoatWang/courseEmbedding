Eleven Biotherapeutics Continues Expansion of Clinical Development 
      Team with Appointment of David Brooks, M.D., Ph.D., to Senior Vice 
      President, Clinical Development




-- Dr. Brooks Brings Substantial Experience in Leading Oncology 
      Clinical Development Programs --






May 17, 2017 08:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Eleven Biotherapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:EBIO), a late-stage clinical 
      oncology company advancing a broad pipeline of novel product candidates 
      based on its Targeted Protein Therapeutics (TPTs) platform, today 
      announced the appointment of David Brooks, M.D., Ph.D., to Senior Vice 
      President, Clinical Development. Dr. Brooks will be responsible for the 
      execution of Eleven’s ongoing and planned clinical trials. He will 
      report to Arthur DeCillis, M.D., Chief Medical Officer.
    


      “Eleven is at a pivotal inflection point, as we progress our Phase 3 
      registration trial of Vicinium™ and prepare to advance our second 
      program, Proxinium™, into a Phase 1/2a study in combination with a 
      checkpoint inhibitor,” said Stephen Hurly, President and Chief Executive 
      Officer of Eleven Biotherapeutics. “We are pleased to welcome David to 
      the Eleven team as we continue to build out our clinical development 
      organization. David brings a highly-relevant skillset, including 
      experience overseeing the simultaneous development of multiple oncology 
      programs as monotherapies and in combination with immuno-oncology 
      agents. We look forward to his contributions as we continue to evaluate 
      the potential of our locally- and systemically-administered TPTs and 
      work to bring new medicines that improve upon existing therapeutic 
      options to patients.”
    

      Dr. Brooks joins Eleven Biotherapeutics from Deciphera Pharmaceuticals, 
      where he served as Vice President, Clinical Research and Translational 
      Medicine. In this role, Dr. Brooks led the clinical development of four 
      oncology product candidates, set clinical strategy for assets entering 
      testing in direct anti-tumor and immune combination therapy, and planned 
      clinical trials evaluating the combination of immunotherapies with novel 
      myeloid cell checkpoint blockers. Prior to joining Deciphera, Dr. Brooks 
      was Senior Director Physician, Oncology Early Clinical Development at 
      AstraZeneca, where he led the clinical development of a dual specificity 
      PI3K inhibitor across multiple oncology indications and managed a 
      portfolio of external alliances and investigator-sponsored studies. 
      Earlier in his career, Dr. Brooks served as Medical Head, Translational 
      Medicine at TESARO Inc., as Chief Medical Officer and Senior Vice 
      President at Generation Health, Inc., and as Medical Director, Global 
      Clinical Medicine at Abraxis Bioscience, Inc. He also worked at Shire 
      Human Genetic Therapies, Inc. and Merck & Co., Inc. Dr. Brooks holds a 
      M.D. and Ph.D. in Molecular Biology from Cornell University. He 
      completed his residency in Internal Medicine at the University of 
      Pennsylvania and a fellowship in Medical Genetics at the Children’s 
      Hospital of Philadelphia/Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. He 
      also served as an Instructor in Medicine in the Division of Medical 
      Genetics at the University of Pennsylvania.
    

      “I am pleased to join the Eleven team at such an important time,” said 
      Dr. Brooks. “The Company’s lead drug candidates have demonstrated 
      promising anti-tumor activity and safety as single agents. I am eager to 
      work with Eleven’s team to further demonstrate the potential of Vicinium 
      in the clinic. I am particularly excited to progress the ongoing Phase 3 
      registration trial of Vicinium for patients with high-grade non-muscle 
      invasive bladder cancer, a disease which has not seen meaningful 
      advancements in approximately forty years.”
    

      Dr. Brooks is the third recent addition to Eleven’s clinical development 
      group in recent months. In the first quarter, Eleven appointed Gary 
      Conboy as Executive Director, Clinical Sciences and Mary Rohrer as 
      Associate Director, Clinical Operations.
    

About Eleven Biotherapeutics


      Eleven Biotherapeutics, Inc. is a late-stage clinical oncology company 
      advancing a broad pipeline of novel product candidates based upon the 
      Company's TPT platform. The Company's TPTs incorporate a tumor-targeting 
      antibody fragment and a protein cytotoxic payload into a single protein 
      molecule in order to achieve focused tumor cell killing. The Company 
      believes its TPT approach offers significant advantages in treating 
      cancer over existing ADC technologies. The Company believes its TPTs 
      provide effective tumor targeting with broader cancer cell-killing 
      properties than are achievable with small molecule payloads that require 
      tumor cell proliferation and face multi-drug resistance mechanisms. 
      Additionally, the Company believes that its TPT's cancer cell-killing 
      properties promote an anti-tumor immune response that will potentially 
      combine well with immuno-oncology drugs such as checkpoint inhibitors. 
      For more information please refer to the Company's website at www.elevenbio.com.

Eleven Biotherapeutics, Inc. to Collaborate with AstraZeneca and the National Cancer Institute on Development of ViciniumTM in Combination with Durvalumab for the Treatment of Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer
Jun 6 17
Eleven Biotherapeutics, Inc. announced the signing of a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) on the development of Eleven’s targeted therapeutic, ViciniumTM in combination with AstraZeneca’s immune checkpoint inhibitor, ImfinziTM (durvalumab), for the treatment of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Vicinium, like Eleven’s other TPTs, is a single protein molecule composed of an antibody fragment genetically fused to a potent cytotoxic payload. Vicinium selectively binds to epithelial cell adhesion molecules (EpCAM), a cell surface marker that is highly expressed on many cancers, including high grade NMIBC, but that is present at minimal to no levels on healthy bladder tissue. After binding to EpCAM on the surface of the tumor cell, Vicinium is internalized into the cell where its potent cytotoxic cell killing payload, Pseudomonas Exotoxin A (ETA), is released, disrupting protein synthesis and leading to cell death. Under the terms of the CRADA, the NCI, led by principal investigator Dr. Piyush Agarwal of the NCI Center for Cancer Research, Urologic Oncology Branch, will conduct a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with high-grade NMIBC to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and biological correlates of the Vicinium and durvalumab combination therapeutic strategy. Patients will be evaluated for response and recurrence throughout the study.


Eleven Biotherapeutics Announces Data and Safety Monitoring Board Recommendation to Continue Phase 3 Registration Trial with Vicinium in Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer Based on Review of Safety and Efficacy Data
Jun 1 17
Eleven Biotherapeutics, Inc. announced that its Phase 3 registration trial of Vicinium in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) has exceeded 50% enrollment and that the independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for the trial has recommended that the trial continue as planned. The DSMB reviewed available data to assess the risk/benefit to patients on drug and recommended that the trial continue without modification. Vicinium is a single protein anti-epithelial cell adhesion molecule (anti-EpCAM) antibody fragment fused with Pseudomonas Exotoxin A (ETA) that is designed to specifically target and deliver a potent anti-cancer payload directly into tumor cells. The ongoing Phase 3 registration trial is a single-arm study evaluating Vicinium in patients with high-grade NMIBC, who have previously received two courses of BCG and whose disease is now BCG-unresponsive. Eleven Biotherapeutics plans to enroll 134 patients, at over 70 centers in the United States and Canada. The trial’s primary endpoint is the complete response rate in patients with carcinoma-in-situ (CIS). Secondary endpoints include time to disease recurrence and event free survival. The Company expects to complete patient enrollment in the second half of 2017 and to report 3-month data in the second quarter of 2018.

PIPELINE


Eleven has a pipeline of novel therapies, called Targeted Protein Therapeutics (TPTs), based upon antibody fragments genetically fused to cytotoxic proteins that are innovative anti-cancer treatments. 



Our first generation of TPTs are locoregional therapies for treatment of cancer. These locoregional TPTs are believed directly kill tumor cells that they are targeted to as well as initiate patient anti-tumor immune responses, potentially making them attractive for both single agent and combination treatment strategies with immune-oncology agents such as checkpoint inhibitors.



The most advanced drug candidates in our pipeline are locoregional TPTs: 

Vicinium™, a fully biologic engineered protein designed for targeted tumor local therapy to EpCAM positive tumor cells, is in an active Phase 3 clinical trial in the U.S. and Canada for the treatment of high-grade non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), with topline data expected in the first half of 2018. 
Proxinium™ is being developed for late stage squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.  A Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating Proxinium as a single agent versus Proxinium in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor is planned for the first half of 2017. 



Eleven has earlier pipeline candidates of next generation TPTs that are designed and optimized for systemic administration to treat a broader spectrum of cancer types.

	Eleven Biotherapeutics, Inc. is a late clinical-stage company advancing a broad pipeline of novel anti-cancer agents based on our Targeted Protein Therapeutics (TPTs) platform. Our TPTs genetically combine targeting antibody fragments with cytoxic protein payloads to create a single fusion protein through Eleven's proprietary one-step manufacturing process.

	We have designed TPTs with the potential to offer:

	• Multiple advantages in treating cancer over traditional antibody drug conjugates.

	• Effective tumor targeting with cancer cell-killing properties unique to protein payloads versus small molecules, using our rational approach to therapeutics design for TPTs.

	• The dual action of the TPT protein cytotoxic to both kill directly and promote a local inflammatory anti-tumor immune response, suggesting that TPTs will combine well with immune oncology drugs.

	• Enhanced linker stability and more efficient and cost effective manufacturing process, based on TPT’s fusion protein construction.

 ABOUT ELEVEN
Eleven Biotherapeutics, Inc. is a late clinical-stage company advancing a broad pipeline of novel anti-cancer agents based on our Targeted Protein Therapeutics (TPTs) platform. Our TPTs genetically combine targeting antibody fragments with cytoxic protein payloads to create a single fusion protein through Eleven's proprietary one-step manufacturing process.
We have designed TPTs with the potential to offer:

Multiple advantages in treating cancer over traditional antibody drug conjugates.
Effective tumor targeting with cancer cell-killing properties unique to protein payloads versus small molecules, using our rational approach to therapeutics design for TPTs. 
The dual action of the TPT protein cytotoxic to both kill directly and promote a local inflammatory anti-tumor immune response, suggesting that TPTs will combine well with immune oncology drugs. 
Enhanced linker stability and more efficient and cost effective manufacturing process, based on TPT’s fusion protein construction.

(EBIO), a late-stage clinical oncology company advancing a broad pipeline of novel product candidates based on its Targeted Protein Therapeutics (TPTs) platform, today reported financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, and provided a corporate update.“During our first quarter of 2017, we made meaningful progress, advancing our Phase 3 registration clinical trial of Vicinium and continuing development efforts with Proxinium™ and VB6-845d,” said Stephen Hurly, President and Chief Executive Officer of Eleven Biotherapeutics. “Importantly, we also presented new preclinical data supporting the potential of our locally- and systemically-administered drug candidates not just as monotherapies, but also in combination with immuno-oncology products, including checkpoint inhibitors. These results accord with our clinical development strategies, and we look forward to further exploring TPTs as new medicines with the potential to offer considerable improvements over existing options.”First Quarter and Recent Business Highlights and Anticipated Upcoming Milestones:Vicinium: Vicinium is a single protein anti-epithelial cell adhesion molecule (anti-EpCAM) antibody fragment fused with Pseudomonas Exotoxin A (ETA) that is designed to specifically target and deliver a potent anti-cancer payload directly into tumor cells. Vicinium is currently in a Phase 3 registration clinical trial for the treatment of high-grade non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) in subjects who have previously received two courses of Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) and whose disease is now BCG-unresponsive. Complete enrollment for Phase 3 registration clinical trial expected in second half of 2017  Topline data from Phase 3 registration clinical trial expected in 2018 Proxinium: Proxinium is a single protein anti-EpCAM antibody fragment fused with ETA for the treatment of late-stage squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Proxinium has received Orphan Drug Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and Fast Track designation from the FDA. Proxinium has demonstrated anti-tumor activity in prior Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials. Initiation of Phase 1/2a clinical trial evaluating Proxinium in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor expected in second half of 2017 At the American Association of Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting in April, Eleven presented new preclinical results with VB4-845, the active pharmaceutical ingredient used to formulate both Vicinium and Proxinium. Data suggest that VB4-845 induces the expression of HMGB1 in tumor treated cells; HMGB1 is one of three damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) indicative of immunogenic cell death (ICD). Eleven has previously disclosed observations of the other two DAMPs markers – cell surface expression of calreticulin and extracellular release of ATP – following treatment with VB4-845. Together, these results suggest that product candidates formulated with VB4-845 are capable of driving host anti-tumor immune responses that can potentiate the activity of immuno-oncology agents.As part of the same poster presentation, Eleven shared data from a preclinical model in patient-derived xenograft tumor-bearing mice reconstituted with a human immune system, which was used to assess the combination of intratumoral injection of VB4-845 with the anti-PD1 antibody, nivolumab. Treatment with VB4-845 alone suppressed the growth of injected tumors, while monotherapy nivolumab had little effect. In contralateral, non-injected tumors, responses from mice treated with both VB4-845 and nivolumab were more pronounced than responses in mice treated with either product as a monotherapy. Based on these results, Eleven believes that VB4-845 killing of tumor cells could facilitate and augment checkpoint inhibitor anti-tumor activity.Systemically-administered TPT Pipeline: Eleven’s initial systemically-administered TPTs leverage a proprietary, highly potent, de-immunized, plant toxin, deBouganin. DeBouganin has picomolar killing of cancer cells and may be effective against cancer stem cells. In preclinical studies, deBouganin demonstrated the ability to avoid multi-drug resistance mechanisms that can decrease the efficacy of small molecule payloads. Based on these results, Eleven believes that deBouganin-based therapies may be effective against a wide spectrum of cancers. Investigational New Drug Application (IND) submission for VB6-845d planned for first quarter of 2018 At the AACR Annual Meeting, Eleven presented preclinical data suggesting that its deBouganin payload is capable of effectively killing tumor cells that are resistant to treatment with antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) composed of DM-1 and MMAE payloads when conjugated to the same monoclonal antibody, trastuzumab. The Company believes this is due, in part, to deBouganin’s lack of sensitivity to both the multidrug resistance pumps and the changes in phosphorylation status of proteins involved in cell proliferation and survival that allow some cancers to escape the action of anti-mitotic ADCs.Read MoreCorporate: Eleven further expanded its internal clinical development team with two key hires: Gary Conboy as Executive Director, Clinical Sciences and Mary Rohrer as Associate Director, Clinical Operations.First Quarter 2017 Financial Results: Cash Position: Cash and cash equivalents were $20.3 million as of March 31, 2017, compared to $25.3 million as of December 31, 2016.  Revenue: Revenue was $0.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to $0.2 million for the same period in 2016. This increase was due to revenue recognized from the License Agreement (License Agreement) with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. (Roche).  R&D Expenses: Research and development expenses were $2.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to $4.6 million for the same period in 2016. The decrease was due primarily to a reduction in isunakinra and EBI-031 related development expenses, partially offset by an increase in Vicinium related development expenses.  G&A Expenses: General and administrative expenses were $2.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to $2.1 million for the same period in 2016.  Net Loss: Net loss was $6.1 million, or $0.25 per share, for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to net loss of $7.6 million, or $0.39 per share, for the same period in 2016.  Financial Guidance: Based on current operating plans, Eleven expects to have cash to fund research and development programs and operations into early 2018.

The Company’s TPTs incorporate a tumor-targeting antibody fragment and a protein cytotoxic payload into a single protein molecule in order to achieve focused tumor cell killing. The Company believes its TPT approach offers significant advantages in treating cancer over existing ADC technologies. The Company believes its TPTs provide effective tumor targeting with broader cancer cell-killing properties than are achievable with small molecule payloads that require tumor cell proliferation and face multi-drug resistance mechanisms. Additionally, the Company believes that its TPT’s cancer cell-killing properties promote an anti-tumor immune response that will potentially combine well with immuno-oncology drugs such as checkpoint inhibitors.
