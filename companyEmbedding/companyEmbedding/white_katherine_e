Life Without Katharine:  E. B. White and His Sense of Loss


By Nan Robertson, Special to the New York Times 



Tuesday, April 8, 1980


orth Brooklin, Me.--E. B. White is alone.  He sat the other day in this old, immaculate white 
farmhouse, set on a little rise overlooking the rockbound sea, mourning his wife of almost 48 years. 
Yet Katharine White is here, in the gardens she loved, the snapshots on every ledge, the chintz sofa 
with its little pink pillows where she reclined and worked in her last years of illness, and in E. B. 
White's thoughts.  Even her voice dictating letters, clear and elegant as the editing she did for The 
New Yorker for so long, rose from a tape recorder.
He wanted to talk about her.  For that he broke his rule of "no interviews" in recent years.  This, he 
said, would be the sole exception.  He was proud of the book of her New Yorker gardening reviews 
that he had put together, and for which he wrote an introduction.  Farrar Straus & Giroux published 
it last fall as "Onward and Upward in the Garden," two years after her death in 1977 at the age of 
84.

'I Love the Place'

"This place doesn't fit me since Katharine died," said the writer of plain and graceful English who 
has been called one of America's most precious literary resources.  "The only thing is, I really had 
to live here.  Also, I love the place, and it's my home."  They bought it in 1933, four years after 
their marriage, and lived in it almost continuously beginning in 1938.  With them was their son, 
Joel, now a naval architect who runs the boathouse nearby, and Katharine's children by a previous 
marriage, Roger Angell and Nancy Angell Stableford.
"I have nine grandchildren and six great-grandchildren, with another one coming up in June," Mr. 
White said.  "I am full of years and descendants.  It's a hazard."  He would not be without the 
animals he loves either.   Still here are two noisy geese "for comic relief," flapping between the 
pond and the barn, eight industrious hens who each lay an egg a day, and Susy, an off-white West 
Highland terrier who keeps climbing on her master's lap.
Mr. White at 80 years of age is small, wiry and limber, with frosty eyebrows, a toothbrush 
mustache and blue eyes that peer from a ruddy face.  His voice remains rich and resonant.  As he 
warmed to his memories of Katharine, he would act her out--his wife reaching for the phone with 
one hand and a cigarette with the other, rolling up her long hair "around and around like this" and 
putting in many pins, cluttering up the sofa and coffee table with her papers.  "She was impervious 
to disorder," said this tidy man.  "I'm neat--I can't start work on something unless I clear the decks."
An elfin smile wreathed his face as he recalled the day they met.  It was at The New Yorker in 
1926, and he had already submitted "two or three short things" to the new and struggling magazine. 
"She came striding out into the reception room where I was panting, waiting," he said.  "'Are you 
Elwyn Brooks White?' she said, and I said, 'I am.'  She had a lot of black hair and was very 
beautiful."
"I never liked Elwyn," he went on.  "My mother just hung it on me because she'd run out of names. 
I was her sixth child."  But from college on, to his relief, he has been called Andy.  He acquired 
Andy at Cornell, after its first president, Andrew D. White.  The nickname was commonly 
bestowed on students named White.
Mr. White described his love affair with Katharine Sergeant Angell as "stormy."  He added, "She 
was a divorced woman, but a conscientious mother with two children.  I was six years younger than 
she.  We finally went off and got married one day."  That was in 1929.  Years thereafter, he was to 
write:  "I soon realized I had made no mistake in my choice of a wife.  I was helping her pack an 
overnight bag one afternoon when she said, 'Put in some tooth twine.'  I knew then that a girl who 
called dental floss tooth twine was the girl for me."
Katharine White and Harold Ross, The New Yorker's founding editor, were an odd couple, by Mr. 
White's account:  "He was a big, blundering, loud man, clumsy and tempestuous.  She was quiet, 
calm.  I may be biased, but I don't think The New Yorker would have survived if Kay hadn't 
showed up there."  She became known as the "intellectual soul" of The New Yorker as E. B. White 
was its quintessential writer.  A Boston Brahmin, product of Miss Winsor's School and later Bryn 
Mawr, she was, according to her husband and many others, "a creative editor in every way," finding 
and encouraging gifted writers.
"She had a fabulous correspondence with them," Mr. White said.  "She mothered them.  She was 
interested in their family life, their sorrows and their horrors."
In 1938, although both Whites loved New York, "I felt I had to get away to our farmhouse in 
Maine.  I liked sailing and Kay loved the country.  I tore Katharine loose from The New Yorker.  It 
was extraordinarily stupid.  She had a desk job.  I didn't realize until too late what an awful wrench 
it would be.  But she simply set herself up in the job long-distance."
Pretty soon, he said, "We were just as busy as monkeys.  She was editing and gardening and I was 
writing and farming.  There was never a dull moment, never a dull day, year in and year out.  I 
think if I'd turned out to be a bum writer our marriage would have gone on."
Every day, a few minutes before lunch, Katharine White would "go out among her borders," as her 
husband told it.  "She never dressed down for her gardens."  She might be wearing a tweed suit and 
Ferragamo pumps, and if it were muddy, she kicked off the shoes on coming back into the house.  
As for her attitude toward flowers, he said, "She didn't mind a ruffled petunia, but never a ruffled 
snapdragon.  She was not a ruffled girl herself."

Time for Martinis

It was just before lunch, time for dry martinis.  Roguishly, he reminded his guest that Wolcott 
Gibbs had said:  "There is no such thing as one martini."
He was asked if his wife had ever edited him.  "Never!" he said, then, "Well, I suppose some of my 
very early pieces, little squibs that didn't amount to anything.  But I never even let her see what I 
wrote until after it was done."
They enjoyed the same humor and satire, which provoked her rare and contagious laughter.  "Her 
laugh was like a little piece of music," Mr. White said.  Their sense of humor was to be sorely 
tested in the last 20 years, for the shadow of her serious illnesses fell on them.  She met it "with 
tremendous character and poise and courage," he said.
In 1961, she developed a rare skin disease.  It was treated with massive doses of cortisone, which 
destroyed her appearance and crumbled her bones.  Toward the end, Katharine White suffered a 
series of congestive heart failures.  "She survived four of them," her husband said.  "She missed the 
fifth."
In 1975, for their 46th wedding anniversary, he gave her a small greenhouse and potting shed close 
by the house, "with all my love and bright hopes for a green springtime in Maine."  She was to see 
only two more.
Since her death, E. B. White has kept himself busy with the bequests of her papers and other 
precious things, with replies to notes of sympathy, and with the garden book, a labor of love.  "Only 
just lately have I been free to explore the depths of despair you get into," he said.  "I don't have 
friends here my own age.  Everybody I know is below ground."  He brightened with the thought 
that his doctor was around, as well as his son, Joel, the kind-neighbor women who cook him 
delicious meals and care for his house, and the faithful Henry Allen, his caretaker.
But that does not fill the aching void left by the loss of his life's companion.  Shortly after her death, 
he write a friend:  "I hope you are right that my book of letters was a love story.  Goodbye, my 
love!"
