Showing Designer Michael Weiss








Since the launch of his collection with Vanguard, Michael Weiss has prevailed as a leader in modern furniture design. His signature style, defined by clean lines and architectural simplicity, expresses an acute awareness of the evolution of design. Michael's formal training in fine arts and design began in New York City at The Julliard School, and he remains a student of 19th and 20th century decorative arts and classic modern design. More about Michael...




Vanguard casegoods are versatile enough to be interchangeable throughout each room of the home.
