Gold Coins
Produced and sold for collectors, gold coins produced by the U.S. Mint are beautiful pieces of art in precious metal.  Coins are produced in proof and uncirculated finishes, in varying composition ranging from one-tenth to one ounce and 22– or 24–karat gold.
Gold Bullion Coins provide investors with a convenient and cost effective way to add gold to their investment portfolio.  Pricing for bullion coins typically depends on the market price of the metal.  Visit the Bullion Dealer Locator to locate a dealer – bullion coins are not sold directly by the U.S. Mint.


Pricing for precious metal numismatic products (e.g., platinum, 24-k gold, 22-k gold) varies by the average cost of the underlying metal. We use our pricing range table the week prior to sale in order to determine the product's price. If the average weekly price of the precious metal moves up or down into another cost range, the price of the product will also go up or down, respectively, by a fixed amount. Click here for detailed pricing instructions. Download the Adobe reader here.

Harvard Economist Harry Dent Warns: “$700 Gold by 2018" | Economy and Markets












































































































Harvard Economist Warns “$700 Gold by 2018″


									By Harry Dent							



Investors are fleeing to gold in a desperate attempt to weather the recent market volatility… but is this long time “safe-haven” actually poised to collapse wiping out trillions of dollars of wealth in the process?
One highly respected Harvard economist is stating an emphatic “yes!”.
“While many economists will argue that gold is not in a bubble… and insist it will soar to $2,000, $5,000 and even $10,000, my research has said otherwise” says Harvard economist Harry Dent in his latest report. “I’ve never been more certain of anything in over 30 years of economic forecasting.”
Market volatility, worries over the Europe Central Bank, negative interest rates, and China are among a laundry list of events that are driving panicked masses to buy the yellow metal. But this is only inflating the gold bubble that is poised to pop at any moment, he says.
>>Related: Harvard Economist Warns: Get Out of Gold IMMEDIATELY and Buy This Instead
Dent, who pioneered a whole new science of economic forecasting in the early 1980’s has been able to accurately predict almost every major economic event over the past 30 years. —including the collapse of Japan, The Great Tech Boom of the 1990’s, and the 2008 market crash.
Now his latest prediction his proving controversial among financial circles across the country.
Traditionally investors flock to gold as a way to hedge against inflation. But according to Dent’s research, we’re about to see the exact opposite happen.
Dent warns that we are about to experience an economic crisis far worse than 2008 — the full-blown collapse of the stock market and massive deflation.
And that investors who attempt to hide their money in the “safe haven” of gold, could damage their wealth to an even greater degree.
>>Related: How To Get Rich From Deflation
This scenario was practically preordained — as far back as the mid-1990s when the bubble in stocks began and real estate followed and Baby Boomers were heading for their peak spending years into 2007.
“When you understand this event, including the fundamental reasons driving it, you need not panic. You will see there’s a tremendous upside to what will unfold over this decade and beyond.” Says Dent. “After all, when you’re able to know what’s coming – and position yourself accordingly – the years ahead could be prosperous times.”
What is Dent saying the one investment you need to buy right now to protect yourself, instead of gold is? Click here to watch his new presentation and find out.

Company Overview
MexusGoldUS (OTCBB: MXSG) is a gold and silver producing company with projects in Mexico.  The company seeks properties and projects with high grade mineralized material and low operating costs.   The company currently has three properties in various stages of exploration with certain properties currently in production.
The Santa Elena project is a 7,300 acre property near Caborca, Sonora State, Mexico.  This property lies on the Mojave-Sonora Megashear trend which is home to some of the largest gold mines in the world, including La Herradura and Noche Buena.  This property consists of 8 different concessions.  In May 2016, Mexus entered into a 50/50 net income joint venture with MarMar Holdings Inc.  The mine is now producing gold with the company looking to reach production of 10,000 tons a day by December, 2017.
Mexus and MarMar Holdings are also a 50/50 joint venture partner at the San Felix project which is located in the NW portion of the Sonora State, Mexico.  The property consists of 7 concessions totaling approximately 26,689 acres.  The project infrastructure is complete including haul roads, an approximate 3 million ton leach pad, 1600 GPM Merrill Crowe recovery system and open pits ready to mine.   The company is looking to have this property into production by January, 2018.
The Ures claim is located 80km NE of Hermosillo, Mexico.  The property encompasses 6900 acres and a total of 8 concessions.   The company is currently evaluating the El Scorpio concession, which has high grade copper, and the Ocho Hermanos which has high grade silver.   Mexus has a geologist on-site who is currently sampling the property which will be the basis for a mining plan.
Mexus feels it is well positioned with production nearing at multiple properties and very little debt on the balance sheet.   Management looks to maximize shareholder return with the goal of becoming a dividend producing company.

Mexus Gold US San Felix Mine Update




















September 18, 2013 06:00 ET

 | Source: Mexus Gold US





CARSON CITY, Nev., Sept. 18, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mexus Gold US (OTCQB:MXSG), 50% owner of Mexus Enterprises SA de CV, releases cost projections per ounce gold equivalent mined from the San Felix Mine.

	Mexus Enterprises can now project costs per ounce gold equivalent. Based upon using an experienced and well equipped mining contractor at a rate of $2.09 USD per ton. These cost projections are based on information contained in an August 2013 report by geologist Ing. Javier Martinez which Mexus Enterprises published September 16, 2013. This report indicates the gold and silver content is considered to be 1.23 grams of gold with a 70% recovery of 0.86 grams of gold and 24.60 grams of silver with a 70% recovery of 17.32 grams of silver per ton of ore. Based upon a stable production of 3,000 tons of ore a day, Mexus Enterprises anticipates 108.60 ounces gold equivalent per day. At 3,000 tons of ore per day production, Mexus Enterprises can make the following cost projections:



				Established daily direct costs to produce:

				$ 20,246.07



				Contract miner at $2.09 per ton:

				$ 25,080.00



				Contingency:

				$ 4,682.61



				 

				 



				Total projected mining costs for 3,000 ton:

				$ 51,508.68



				 

				 



				Gold equivalent ounces per day:

				$ 108.60



				Projected cost per gold ounce equivalent:

				$ 474.30



				Gross sales per day:

				$141,179.31



				Projected net per day ($1,300 gold & $20.00 silver)
				 

				$ 89,670.63
				 



	The Mexus Enterprises existing 1,600 gpm gold recovery plant has the capacity to handle 6,000 tons per day production.

	The 3,000 tons per day is considered to be a start up amount. Mexus Enterprises has a target production rate of 6,000 tons per day. At the 6,000 tons per day, Mexus Enterprises can project a gold equivalent recovery of 217.20 ounces per day with a gross sales amount of $282,358.62, a projected net per day of $202,577.33, and a projected cost per gold ounce equivalent of $367.17.

	The above figures are based upon gold sales of $1,300 per ounce and silver sales of $20 per ounce.

Gold Coins
Produced and sold for collectors, gold coins produced by the U.S. Mint are beautiful pieces of art in precious metal.  Coins are produced in proof and uncirculated finishes, in varying composition ranging from one-tenth to one ounce and 22– or 24–karat gold.
Gold Bullion Coins provide investors with a convenient and cost effective way to add gold to their investment portfolio.  Pricing for bullion coins typically depends on the market price of the metal.  Visit the Bullion Dealer Locator to locate a dealer – bullion coins are not sold directly by the U.S. Mint.


Pricing for precious metal numismatic products (e.g., platinum, 24-k gold, 22-k gold) varies by the average cost of the underlying metal. We use our pricing range table the week prior to sale in order to determine the product's price. If the average weekly price of the precious metal moves up or down into another cost range, the price of the product will also go up or down, respectively, by a fixed amount.

Harvard Economist Harry Dent Warns: “$700 Gold by 2018" | Economy and Markets












































































































Harvard Economist Warns “$700 Gold by 2018″


									By Harry Dent							



Investors are fleeing to gold in a desperate attempt to weather the recent market volatility… but is this long time “safe-haven” actually poised to collapse wiping out trillions of dollars of wealth in the process?
One highly respected Harvard economist is stating an emphatic “yes!”.
“While many economists will argue that gold is not in a bubble… and insist it will soar to $2,000, $5,000 and even $10,000, my research has said otherwise” says Harvard economist Harry Dent in his latest report. “I’ve never been more certain of anything in over 30 years of economic forecasting.”
Market volatility, worries over the Europe Central Bank, negative interest rates, and China are among a laundry list of events that are driving panicked masses to buy the yellow metal. But this is only inflating the gold bubble that is poised to pop at any moment, he says.
>>Related: Harvard Economist Warns: Get Out of Gold IMMEDIATELY and Buy This Instead
Dent, who pioneered a whole new science of economic forecasting in the early 1980’s has been able to accurately predict almost every major economic event over the past 30 years. —including the collapse of Japan, The Great Tech Boom of the 1990’s, and the 2008 market crash.
Now his latest prediction his proving controversial among financial circles across the country.
Traditionally investors flock to gold as a way to hedge against inflation. But according to Dent’s research, we’re about to see the exact opposite happen.
Dent warns that we are about to experience an economic crisis far worse than 2008 — the full-blown collapse of the stock market and massive deflation.
And that investors who attempt to hide their money in the “safe haven” of gold, could damage their wealth to an even greater degree.
>>Related: How To Get Rich From Deflation
This scenario was practically preordained — as far back as the mid-1990s when the bubble in stocks began and real estate followed and Baby Boomers were heading for their peak spending years into 2007.
“When you understand this event, including the fundamental reasons driving it, you need not panic. You will see there’s a tremendous upside to what will unfold over this decade and beyond.” Says Dent. “After all, when you’re able to know what’s coming – and position yourself accordingly – the years ahead could be prosperous times.”
What is Dent saying the one investment you need to buy right now to protect yourself, instead of gold is? Click here to watch his new presentation and find out.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
