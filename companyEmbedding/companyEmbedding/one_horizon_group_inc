One Horizon Group provides the world’s first carrier grade mobile VoIP solution

Using our proprietary SmartPacket™ technology platform, One Horizon has been able to significantly improve the efficiency by which voice signals are transmitted by radio over the Internet resulting in a 10X reduction in mobile spectrum required to transmit a VoIP call.
As a result, our Horizon Call solution is able to deliver crystal-clear, uninterrupted voice calls over Wi-Fi, 4G, 3G, 2G and EDGE networks. Because we re-engineered mobile VoIP from scratch, we are able to overcome the limitations of other VoIP OTT (over-the-top) apps such as poor voice quality, high bandwidth requirements, dropped calls, and congested networks.

The core of the Abbey Technology suite of products was a proprietary web application server with customized add-on components designed and delivered to customers requirements.
In November 2010, Abbey Technology merged with Satcom Group Holdings and Brian Collins joined the board of the new company as Chief Technology Officer while continuing as CEO of the wholly owned subsidiary Abbey Technology.[2] The company focused its R&D efforts on developing the Horizon platform for mobile network operators. Shortly after the merger, on 21 January 2011, the Company changed its name from SatCom Group Holdings to One Horizon Group.[3]
In 2012, the Company announced plans for an Initial Public Offering in Hong Kong.[4] In October, the company sold the Satcom Global business and all the subsidiaries involved in satellite communications to Broadband Satellite Services Limited. In November, a Securities Exchange Agreement was completed between Intelligent Communication Enterprise Corporation and One Horizon Group. Following this, in December, the American company filed to change its name from Intelligent Communication Enterprise Corporation to One Horizon Group, Inc. FINRA approved this change, effective 31 January 2013. Along with the name change, Intelligent Communication Enterprise Corporation also filed with Finra to change its ticker symbol from ICMC to OHGI, this was also approved.[5]

	One Horizon Group Unveils Security Update
	of Optimized Mobile Platform for Enterprises and Government Agencies


	 



		Software update allows for highly secure voice calls,
	private instant messaging and encrypted file transfers on mobile devices	



	 


	LIMERICK, IRELAND -- (Accesswire) – 1/19/17 -- One
	Horizon Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: OHGI) (‘One Horizon’), a leading carrier-grade VoIP solution for mobile providers and
	smartphones, today unveiled security and functionality updates to its product suite. Meeting the security demand of enterprises
	and government agencies, One Horizon’s software now allows highly secure voice calls, private instant messaging and encrypted
	file transfers on mobile devices when outside the secure confines of their own corporate networks.


	 


	Unlike popular consumer messaging and voice apps, One Horizon’s
	in-app Secure-Mode service allows enterprises and governments to enforce complete end-to-end security of their communications by
	utilizing a key-cloud or by deploying a standalone encryption key broker service inside their own network, anywhere in the world.


	 


	Secure-Mode provides military-grade end-to-end encryption
	using patented and proprietary crystal-clear voice combined with the ease of use of a consumer-focused app. One Horizon’s
	white label technology can be deployed on-premises or in the Microsoft Azure cloud thereby enabling fast and easy adoption across
	the enterprise.


	 


	While using the secure-mode, voice calls, messages and file
	transfers are fully encrypted and are routed through the mobile device’s data connection. The data is never stored on any
	physical storage, not even on the phone itself where keys and messages are stored in-memory only. Upon completion of the secured
	session, all trace of the communications will be destroyed on the handsets, therefore, even when a handset falls into the wrong
	hands, the messages are gone.


	 


	Brian Collins, CEO of One Horizon Group, stated, "People
	are making more and more work-related calls on mobile phones and sending text messages on non-secure consumer apps at an increasing
	rate making our enterprises more and more vulnerable to infiltration. Our latest Secure-Mode now gives governments and enterprises
	the comfort of knowing that their business communications are safer and more secure than ever before.”

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

	CAUTIONARY NOTE CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING
	STATEMENTS



	 


	The statements made in this Report, and in other materials that
	the Company has filed or may file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in each case that are not historical facts, contain
	“forward-looking information” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and Section 27A
	of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, both as amended, which can be identified
	by the use of forward-looking terminology such as “may,” “will,” “anticipates,” “expects,”
	“projects,” “estimates,” “believes,” “seeks,” “could,” “should,”

	taxes in our international operations; increased market and competitive risks, including currency restrictions, in our international
	operations; risks related to the acquisition or integration of future businesses or joint ventures; our ability to obtain or maintain
	relevant intellectual property rights; intellectual property and other litigation that may be brought against us; failure to protect
	our trademarks and internally developed software; security breaches and other compromises of information security; our dependence
	on third party facilities, equipment, systems and services; system disruptions or flaws in our technology and systems; uncertainties
	relating to regulation of VoIP services; liability under anti-corruption laws; results of regulatory inquiries into our business
	practices; fraudulent use of our name or services; our ability to maintain data security; our dependence upon key personnel; our
	dependence on our customers' existing broadband connections; differences between our service and traditional phone services; our
	ability to obtain additional financing if required; our early history of net losses and our ability to maintain consistent profitability
	in the future. These and other matters the Company discusses in this Report, or in the documents it incorporates by reference into

	SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING REVERSE STOCK SPLIT




	 



	Effective April 14, 2017, we completed a reverse stock split in
	which each six (6) shares of our common stock were automatically combined into and became one (1) share of our common stock. As
	of the effective date of the reverse stock split, the per share exercise price of, and the number of shares of common stock underlying,
	any stock options, warrants and other derivative securities issued by us were automatically proportionally adjusted, based on the
	one-for-six reverse split ratio, in accordance with the terms of such options, warrants or other derivative securities, as the
	case may be. All share numbers, stock option numbers, warrant numbers, other derivative security numbers and exercise prices appearing
	in this Report on Form 10-Q have been adjusted to give effect to this reverse stock split, unless otherwise indicated or unless
	the context suggests otherwise.

	NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
	STATEMENTS




	March 31, 2017



	 



	Note 1.  Description of Business, Organization and
	Principles of Consolidation



	 




	Description of Business




	 


	One Horizon Group, Inc., (the “Company” or “Horizon”)
	develops proprietary software primarily in the Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and bandwidth optimization markets (“Horizon
	Globex”) and provides it to telecommunication companies under perpetual license arrangements (“Master License”)
	throughout the world. In addition, the Company either sells related user licenses and software maintenance services to or enters
	into revenue sharing agreements with telecommunication companies. Horizon, through its Chinese company Suzhou Aishuo Network Information
	Co. Ltd., provides the Aishuo App to end user customers through App stores based in China. Our Aishuo customers purchase call credits
	for Public Service Telephone Network (PSTN) access using a variety of Chinese on-line payment services including Union Pay and
	Apple Pay.


	 




	Interim Period Financial Statements




	 


	The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements
	have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) for interim
	financial information and with the Securities and Exchange Commission’s instructions. Accordingly, they do not include all
	the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.  The results of operations reflect
	interim adjustments, all of which are of a normal recurring nature and, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair
	presentation of the results for such interim period.  The results reported in these interim consolidated financial statements
	should not be regarded as necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the entire year.  Certain information
	and note disclosure normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant
	to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and regulations.  These unaudited interim consolidated financial
	statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Annual
	Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 10, 2017.


	 




	Principles of Consolidation




	 


	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of One
	Horizon Group, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries One Horizon Group plc, Horizon Globex GmbH, Abbey Technology GmbH, One Horizon
	Group Pte., Limited, Horizon Globex Ireland Limited, Global Phone Credit Limited and One Horizon Hong Kong Limited, and its wholly-owned
	subsidiary, Horizon Network Technology Co. Ltd. (“HNT”). In addition, included in the consolidated financial statements
	as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2017 are the accounts of Suzhou Aishuo Network Information Co., Ltd. which is controlled
	by One Horizon Group, Inc. through various contractual arrangements .


	 


	All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been
	eliminated in consolidation.


	 



	Note 2.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies




	 





	Liquidity and Capital Resources





	 



	As we continue to pursue our operations and our business plan, we
	expect to incur further losses in 2017, which when combined with our continued investment in our intellectual property, will generate
	negative cash flows. As of March 31, 2017, the Company did not have any available credit facilities. As a result, we are in the
	process of seeking new financing by way of sale of either convertible debt or equities. Whilst we have been successful in the past
	in obtaining the necessary capital to support our investment and operations there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain
	additional financing under acceptable terms and conditions, or at all. In the event, we are unable to obtain sufficient additional
	funding when needed in order to fund our ongoing research and development activities as well as our operations, we would not be
	able to continue as a going concern and maybe forced to severely curtail or cease operations and liquidate the Company.


	 


	The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any
	adjustments relating to the recoverability or classification of assets or amounts of liabilities that might result from the outcome
	of these uncertainties. Our current independent registered public accounting firm included a paragraph emphasizing this going concern
	uncertainty in their audit report dated April 10, 2017, regarding our 2016 financial statements.


	 




	Foreign Currency Translation




	 


	The reporting currency of the Company is the United States dollar.
	Assets and liabilities of operations other than those denominated in U.S. dollars, primarily in Switzerland, Ireland, the United
	Kingdom and China, are translated into United States dollars at the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date.  Revenues
	and expenses are translated at the average rate of exchange throughout the period.  Gains or losses from these translations
	are reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income (loss) until all or a part of the investment in the subsidiaries
	is sold or liquidated.  The translation adjustments do not recognize the effect of income tax because the Company expects
	to reinvest the amounts indefinitely in operations.


	 


	Transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange-rate fluctuations
	on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in general and administrative expenses.


	 







	9

	 






	 



	 




	Accounts Receivable




	 


	Accounts receivable result primarily from sale of software and licenses
	to customers and are recorded at their principal amounts. The categories of sales and receivables and their terms of payment are
	as follows:


	 







	a)





	Master
	License Agreement (“Agreement”) deposits

	– Deposits are payable in accordance with the terms of the Agreement.
	Payment terms may vary from Agreement to Agreement, with payment due generally within 30 days of the execution of an Agreement.





	 







	b)





	Software
	consultancy and hardware fees

	– The terms of payment are fixed terms, with payment normally due within stated terms,
	normally 30 days from the date of the invoice.





	 







	c)





	Maintenance
	and operational fees and end user licenses fees

	– Payments vary from customer to customer. For customers who have not
	entered into a revenue share agreement, the terms of payment are fixed and payment is due within stated terms, normally 30 days
	from the date of the invoice. For customers who have entered into a revenue share agreement, the Company will receive an agreed
	proportion of a customer’s revenue from the customer’s operation of the Horizon service. The proportion of a customer’s
	revenue received is used to pay the receivable balance until the balance is paid.





	 


	Receivables are generally unsecured.


	 


	The Company does not have off-balance sheet credit exposure related
	to its customers. As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, two customers accounted for 55% and 61%, respectively, of the accounts
	receivable balance.


	 







	10

	 






	 





	 






	Intangible Assets




	 


	Intangible assets include software development costs and customer
	lists and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of five years for customer lists and ten years
	for software development. The Company periodically evaluates whether changes have occurred that would require revision of the remaining
	estimated useful life. The Company performs periodic reviews of its capitalized intangible assets to determine if the assets have
	continuing value to the Company. Based on these valuations, no impairment charges were recognized during the three months ended
	March 31, 2017.


	 


	The Company expenses software development costs as incurred until
	technological feasibility has been established, at which time those costs are capitalized until the product is available for general
	release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. The Company
	has determined that after technological feasibility for software products is reached, the Company continues to address all high
	risk development issues through coding and testing prior to release of the products to customers. The amortization of these costs
	is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.


	 


	During the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 software development
	costs of $129,000 and $116,000 respectively, have been capitalized.


	 




	Revenue Recognition




	 


	The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable
	and earned. The Company establishes persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement for each type of revenue transaction based on a
	signed contract with the customer and that delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, price is fixed and determinable,
	and collectability is reasonably assured.


	 




	 



	●




	Software and licenses – revenue from
	sales of perpetual licenses to telecom entities is recognized when payments are due under extended payment term arrangements. Revenue
	from sales of perpetual licenses to other entities is recognized over the agreed collection
	period.





	 




	 



	●




	Revenue for user licenses purchased by customers is recognized when the user license is delivered.





	 




	 



	●




	Revenue for maintenance services is recognized over the period of delivery of the services.





	 




	 



	●




	Revenues from Aishuo retail sales are
	recognized when the Public Switched Telephone Network (“PSTN”) calls and texts are made.





	 



	For purposes of revenue recognition
	for perpetual licenses, the Company considers payment terms exceeding one year as a presumption that

	the fee in the transaction
	is not fixed and determinable.


	 


	During the three months ended March 31, 2017, $287,000 or 30% of
	the Company’s revenue was concentrated in the hands of one major customer. In the three months ended March 31, 2016 the equivalent
	amount was $523,000 or 86% of the revenue.

	Research and Development Expenses




	 


	Research and development expenses include all direct costs, primarily
	salaries for Company personnel and outside consultants, costs related to the development of new products, significant enhancements
	to existing products, and the portion of costs of development of internal-use software required to be expensed.  Research
	and development costs are charged to operations as incurred with the exception of those software development costs that may qualify
	for capitalization.


	 




	Debt Issue Costs




	 


	Debt issue costs related to long-term debt are shown as a reduction
	of debt outstanding and amortized over the term of the related debt using the effective interest method.


	 




	Income Taxes




	 


	Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based
	on temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, operating loss, and tax credit carryforwards,
	and are measured using the enacted income tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to be recovered
	or settled. Realization of certain deferred income tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate
	jurisdiction. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred income tax assets to amounts that are more likely than
	not to be realized. The initial recording and any subsequent changes to valuation allowances are based on a number of factors (positive
	and negative evidence). The Company considers its actual historical results to have a stronger weight than other, more subjective,
	indicators when considering whether to establish or reduce a valuation allowance.


	 


	The Company continually evaluates its uncertain income tax positions
	and may record a liability for any unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain income tax positions taken or expected to
	be taken in an income tax return. Estimated interest and penalties are recorded as a component of interest expense and other expense,
	respectively.


	 


	Because tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations,
	significant judgment is required. As a result, the Company makes certain estimates and assumptions in: (1) calculating its income
	tax expense, deferred tax assets, and deferred tax liabilities; (2) determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred
	tax assets; and (3) evaluating the amount of unrecognized tax benefits, as well as the interest and penalties related to such uncertain
	tax positions. The Company’s estimates and assumptions may differ significantly from tax benefits ultimately realized. Historically
	the Company has not filed income tax returns and the related required informational filings in the US. Certain informational filings
	if not filed contain penalties. The Company is currently addressing this issue with advisors to determine the amount, if any, of
	potential payments due. Given the complexity of the issue the Company is unable to quantify a range of potential loss, if any.
	Accordingly no liability has been recorded in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets in respect of this matter


	 




	Net Loss per Share




	 


	Basic net loss per share is calculated by dividing the net loss
	attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding in the period.  Diluted
	loss per share takes into consideration common shares outstanding (computed under basic loss per share) and potentially dilutive
	securities.  For the three month periods ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, outstanding stock options, warrants and
	convertible debt are antidilutive because of net losses, and as such, their effect has not been included in the calculation of
	diluted net loss per share.  Common shares issuable are considered outstanding as of the original approval date for purposes
	of earnings per share computations.


	 







	12

	 






	 





	 




	Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)




	 


	Other comprehensive income (loss), as defined, includes net loss,
	foreign currency translation adjustments, and all changes in equity (net assets) during a period from non-owner sources.  To
	date, the Company has not had any significant transactions that are required to be reported in other comprehensive income (loss),
	except for foreign currency translation adjustments.


	 




	Use of Estimates




	 


	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity
	with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
	disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts
	of revenues and expenses during the fiscal year.  The Company makes estimates for, among other items, useful lives for
	depreciation and amortization, determination of future cash flows associated with impairment testing for long-lived assets, determination
	of the fair value of stock options and warrants, determining fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business
	combinations, valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, allowances for doubtful accounts, and potential income tax assessments
	and other contingencies.  The Company bases its estimates on historical experience, current conditions, and other assumptions
	that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.  Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.


	 




	Share-Based Compensation




	 


	The Company accounts for stock-based awards at fair value on date
	of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest.  The fair value of stock
	options is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which includes subjective judgements about the expected life
	of the awards, forfeiture rates and stock price volatility.


	 







	13

	 






	 



	 



	Note 3.  Intangible Assets



	 


	Intangible assets consist primarily of software development costs
	and customer and reseller relationships which are amortized over the estimated useful life, generally on a straight-line basis
	with the exception of customer relationships, which are generally amortized straight line over the related asset’s pattern
	of economic benefit.

	retail revenues. We are also commercially focused on expanding
	sales of new and existing licensed products and services to existing customers, and renewing subscriptions and software support
	agreements. We target customers of all sizes and across a broad range of industries.


	 


	We are an ISO 9001 and ISO 20000-1 certified company
	with assets and operations in Switzerland, Ireland, the United Kingdom, China, India, Russia, Singapore, Hong Kong and Latin America.


	 


	Since 2015 we have rolled out a retail service available only in
	China with a brand name of “Aishuo”. The Aishuo product has been delivered to the major stores in Chinese App
	marketplace including Baidu’s 91.com and Baidu.com, the Tencent App store MyApp.com, 360 Qihoo store 360.cn, Apple’s
	iTunes and the ever growing Xiaomi store mi.com. The Aishuo smartphone app is expected to drive multiple revenue streams from the
	supply of its value-added services including the rental of Chinese telephone phone numbers linked to the app, low cost local and
	international calling plans and sponsorship from advertisers.  Subscribers can top up their app credit from the biggest
	online payment services in China including AliPay (from Alibaba), Union Pay, PayPal and Tencent’s WeChat payment service.


	 


	In addition to the developments in the rollout of Aishuo smartphone
	app brand in mainland China, we continue to rollout a data roaming VoIP solution with, Smart Communications, the Philippines' leading
	wireless service provider with an estimated 64 million prepaid subscribers. For the first time ever, prepaid subscribers that travel
	abroad are now able to call home on their operators' data roaming service free from roaming fees (

	http://smart.com.ph/smartroamer

	). 
	The management expect this commercial rollout of an optimized data voice solution for roamers to drive further mobile operator
	interest in the Company’s products and to drive revenues from its rollout to Filipinos throughout 2017.

	Research & Development



	 



	Duri

	ng the first three
	months of 2017, we spent approximately $129,000 on capitalizable research and development together with approximately
	$134,000 on expensed research and development.


	 


	During the three months ended March 31 2017 we continued with our
	drive for innovation and our research and development teams brought us a low bandwidth Video Calling solution that consumes just
	0.5MB per minute, 7x lower than most other video services. This solution now means that our users can enjoy video calls across
	2G, 3G and 4G networks as well as HD video calls across Wi-Fi connections.


	 


	The expanded R&D team also delivered a cyber-secure VoIP service
	that leverages the low bandwidth benefits of Company’s patented technology to allow VoIP over the strongest security protocols
	on the Internet with encrypted video calls that also supports in-call encryption for when a user starts a call in an unencrypted
	mode and they needs to secure the line without having to hang up and restart the call.


	 


	The R&D team also delivered a complete Google AdMob advertising
	environment for our operator customers to further monetize their subscriber base. Intelligent ads are delivered based on the user
	profile and their location.


	 


	The R&D team also delivered a call transfer feature that allows
	one user to transfer a call from their smartphone app to another app user.


	 


	The R&D team also delivered the complete Apple CallKit solution
	from Apple Inc. that seamlessly integrates our smartphone app with the native iOS call interfaces making the usability of the application
	even more attractive.


	 


	The R&D team also delivered an advanced fraud management and
	detection that permits pre-paid users to only spend a certain amount of money and other server side fraud management that massively
	reduces risk of theft.


	 


	The R&D team also delivered an encrypted call from the smartphone
	to an enterprise voice server thereby ensuring staff calls are all encrypted and contained within the enterprise secure IT infrastructure

	Revenue: 


	Our revenue for the three months ended
	March 31, 2017 was approximately $373,000 as compared to approximately $609,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016, a decrease
	of approximately $236,000, or 38.7%. The decrease was primarily due to the reduction in income from the Business to Business
	(“B2B”) revenue in Asia as a result of timing of license purchases by customers.


	 




	Cost of Revenue: 


	Cost of revenue, excluding amortization
	of software development costs, was approximately $2,000 or 0.5% of sales for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to
	cost of revenue of $26,000 or 4.3% of sales for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Our cost of sales, excluding amortization
	of software development costs, is composed of cost of ancillary hardware equipment sold and PSTN breakout costs and network charges.   


	 




	Gross Profit

	: 

	Gross profit excluding amortization
	of software development costs, for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was approximately $371,000 as compared to $583,000

	 

	for
	the three months ended March 31, 2016, a decrease of approximately 36.4%.

	Operating Expenses:


	 Operating expenses, including
	general and administrative expenses, depreciation and research and development were approximately $988,000 and $1,167,000
	during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  The overall reduction in Operating expenses was
	primarily due to reductions in employee salaries, legal fees and provision for doubtful accounts partially offset by increases
	in audit costs and outside consultancy costs. Going forward, management does not expect operating costs to rise significantly until
	revenue grows following the increase of end users.  


	 




	Net Loss: 


	Net Loss for the three months ended
	March 31, 2017 was approximately $1,284,000 as compared to net loss of approximately $1,258,000 for the same period in 2016.

	Net cash generated from operating activities was approximately $150,000
	for the three months ended March 31, 2017 as compared to net cash used in operating activities of approximately $121,000 for the
	same period in 2016. The increase in cash generated from operations was primarily due to the increase in cash collected from customers.


	 


	Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $131,000
	and $118,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities was primarily
	focused on development of software.


	 


	There was no net cash used in financing activities for the three
	months ended March 31, 2017 as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $28,000 for the three months ended March 31,
	2016.



	 



	As we continue to pursue our operations and our business plan, we
	expect to incur further losses in 2017, which when combined with our continued investment in our intellectual property, will generate
	negative cash flows. As of March 31, 2017, the Company did not have any available credit facilities. As a result, we are in the
	process of seeking new financing by way of sale of either convertible debt or equities. Whilst we have been successful in the past
	in obtaining the necessary capital to support our investment and operations there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain
	additional financing under acceptable terms and conditions, or at all. In the event, we are unable to obtain sufficient additional
	funding when needed in order to fund our ongoing research and development activities as well as our operations, we would not be
	able to continue as a going concern and maybe forced to severely curtail or cease operations and liquidate the Company.


	 


	The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any
	adjustments relating to the recoverability or classification of assets or amounts of liabilities that might result from the outcome
	of these uncertainties. Our current independent registered public accounting firm included a paragraph emphasizing this going concern
	uncertainty in their audit report dated April 10, 2017, regarding our 2016 financial statements.



	  







	ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
	RISK.



	 


	Not applicable.



	 







	ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.



	 



	(a)  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures



	 


	Disclosure controls are procedures that are designed with the objective
	of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Report, is recorded,
	processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls are
	also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
	the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
	Our management evaluated, with the participation of our current chief executive officer and chief financial officer (our “Certifying
	Officers”), the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2017, pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b)
	under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Certifying Officers concluded that, as of March 31, 2017, our disclosure
	controls and procedures were not effective.


	 







	23

	 






	 



	 


	We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will
	prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can
	provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further,
	the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must
	be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation
	of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances
	of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood
	of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential
	future conditions.


	 



	(b)  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting





	 


	There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
	(as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter covered by this
	report that has materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

History[edit]
One Horizon Group, Inc. started in the banking software industry operating as Abbey Technology that developed and licensed its software to banks in Switzerland and also licensed its software through banking software distributor Finnova AG. The core of the Abbey Technology suite of products was a proprietary web application server with customized add-on components designed and delivered to customers requirements.
In November 2010, Abbey Technology merged with Satcom Group Holdings and Brian Collins joined the board of the new company as Chief Technology Officer while continuing as CEO of the wholly owned subsidiary Abbey Technology.[2] The company focused its R&D efforts on developing the Horizon platform for mobile network operators. Shortly after the merger, on 21 January 2011, the Company changed its name from SatCom Group Holdings to One Horizon Group.[3]
In 2012, the Company announced plans for an Initial Public Offering in Hong Kong.[4] In October, the company sold the Satcom Global business and all the subsidiaries involved in satellite communications to Broadband Satellite Services Limited. In November, a Securities Exchange Agreement was completed between Intelligent Communication Enterprise Corporation and One Horizon Group. Following this, in December, the American company filed to change its name from Intelligent Communication Enterprise Corporation to One Horizon Group, Inc. FINRA approved this change, effective 31 January 2013. Along with the name change, Intelligent Communication Enterprise Corporation also filed with Finra to change its ticker symbol from ICMC to OHGI, this was also approved.[5]
On 17 September 2013, the company opened a new software research and development office in the Nexus Innovation Centre on the campus of the University of Limerick in Ireland. On 2 July 2014, the company received approval by NASDAQ's Listing Qualifications Department to list its common stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market. The common stock commenced trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market on 3 July 2014 under the same ticker symbol OHGI.[6]

One Horizon Group provides the world’s first carrier grade mobile VoIP solution

Using our proprietary SmartPacket™ technology platform, One Horizon has been able to significantly improve the efficiency by which voice signals are transmitted by radio over the Internet resulting in a 10X reduction in mobile spectrum required to transmit a VoIP call.
As a result, our Horizon Call solution is able to deliver crystal-clear, uninterrupted voice calls over Wi-Fi, 4G, 3G, 2G and EDGE networks. Because we re-engineered mobile VoIP from scratch, we are able to overcome the limitations of other VoIP OTT (over-the-top) apps such as poor voice quality, high bandwidth requirements, dropped calls, and congested networks.

One Horizon Group, Inc. started in the banking software industry operating as Abbey Technology that developed and licensed its software to banks in Switzerland and also licensed its software through banking software distributor Finnova AG. The core of the Abbey Technology suite of products was a proprietary web application server with customized add-on components designed and delivered to customers requirements.
In November 2010, Abbey Technology merged with Satcom Group Holdings and Brian Collins joined the board of the new company as Chief Technology Officer while continuing as CEO of the wholly owned subsidiary Abbey Technology.[2] The company focused its R&D efforts on developing the Horizon platform for mobile network operators. Shortly after the merger, on 21 January 2011, the Company changed its name from SatCom Group Holdings to One Horizon Group.[3]
In 2012, the Company announced plans for an Initial Public Offering in Hong Kong.[4] In October, the company sold the Satcom Global business and all the subsidiaries involved in satellite communications to Broadband Satellite Services Limited. In November, a Securities Exchange Agreement was completed between Intelligent Communication Enterprise Corporation and One Horizon Group. Following this, in December, the American company filed to change its name from Intelligent Communication Enterprise Corporation to One Horizon Group, Inc. FINRA approved this change, effective 31 January 2013. Along with the name change, Intelligent Communication Enterprise Corporation also filed with Finra to change its ticker symbol from ICMC to OHGI, this was also approved.[5]
On 17 September 2013, the company opened a new software research and development office in the Nexus Innovation Centre on the campus of the University of Limerick in Ireland. On 2 July 2014, the company received approval by NASDAQ's Listing Qualifications Department to list its common stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market.
