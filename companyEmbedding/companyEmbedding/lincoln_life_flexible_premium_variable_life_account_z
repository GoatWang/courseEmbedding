time by the fund. Refer to the funds prospectus for specific information on any

The following paragraph
is added to the �Market Timing� section of the
Prospectus:
Market Timing
Under the SEC rules, we are required to: (1) enter
into written agreement with each underlying fund or its principal underwriter
that obligates us to provide to the underlying fund promptly upon request
certain information about the trading activity of individual policy owners, and
(2) execute instructions from the underlying fund to restrict or prohibit
further purchases or transfers by specific policy owners who violate excessive
trading policies established by the underlying fund.
Some of the underlying funds have reserved the right
to temporarily or permanently refuse payments or transfer requests from us if,
in the judgment of the underlying fund�s investment adviser, the underlying
fund would be unable to invest effectively in accordance with its investment
objective or policies, or would otherwise potentially be adversely affected. To
the extent permitted by applicable law, we reserve the right to defer or reject
a transfer request at any time that we are unable to purchase or redeem shares of
any of the funds in which the Separate Account invests, including any refusal
or restriction on purchases or redemptions of the Sub-Account units as a result
of the funds� own policies and procedures on market timing activities. If a
fund refuses to accept a transfer request we have already processed, we will
reverse the transaction within 1-2 business days of the day on which we receive
notice of the refusal. We will notify you in writing if we have reversed,
restricted or refused any of your transfer requests. Some


underlying funds also may impose redemption fees on
short-term trading (i.e., redemptions of underlying fund shares within a
certain number of business days after purchase). We reserve the right to
administer and collect any such redemption fees on behalf of the underlying
funds. You should read the prospectuses of the funds for more details on their
redemption fees and their ability to refuse or restrict purchases or
redemptions of their shares.

The following paragraph should be added to the section titled LINCOLN LIFE, THE 
SEPARATE ACCOUNT AND THE GENERAL ACCOUNT:                                       

On October 9, 2005, Lincoln National Corporation, the parent company of Lincoln 
Life, entered into a merger agreement with a wholly owned acquisition subsidiary
("LNC acquisition subsidiary") and Jefferson-Pilot Corporation                  
("Jefferson-Pilot"), each a North Carolina corporation. The merger agreement    
provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the    
merger agreement, Jefferson-Pilot will merge with and into the LNC acquisition  
subsidiary, with the LNC acquisition subsidiary continuing as the surviving     
corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of LNC. More information about 
the merger agreement as well as a copy of the merger agreement can be found in  
the Form 8-K filed by LNC with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October
11, 2005. Lincoln Life's obligations as set forth in your policy, prospectus and
Statement of Additional Information will not change upon completion of this     
merger.                                                                         

The following replaces the section titled Distribution of the Policies and      
Compensation:                                                                   

Distribution of the Policies and Compensation                                   

The policy is distributed by broker-dealer firms through their registered       
representatives who are appointed as life insurance agents for the Company.     
Broker-dealer firms distributing the policy enter into selling agreements with  
the Company. One of the broker-dealer firms with a selling agreement is Lincoln 
Financial Advisors Corporation ("LFA"), also an affiliate. Broker-dealer firms  
may receive commission and service fees up to 60% of first year premium, plus up
to 5% of all other premiums paid. In lieu of premium-based commission, we may   
pay equivalent amounts over time, based on accumulation value. Broker-dealer    
firms may elect to share this compensation with their registered                
representatives. Additionally, we may pay the broker-dealer additional          
compensation on first year premiums and all additional premiums and/or provide  
reimbursements for portions of policy sales expenses. In some situations, the   
broker-dealer may elect to share its commission or expense reimbursement        
allowance with its registered representatives. Registered representatives of    
broker-dealer firms may also be eligible for cash bonuses and "non cash         
compensation." The latter, as defined in NASD conduct Rule 2820, includes such  
things as office space, computers, club credit, prizes, awards, and training and
education meetings.                                                             

We may pay broker-dealers or their affiliates additional amounts for: (1)       
"preferred product" treatment of the policies in their marketing programs, which
may include marketing services and increased access to sales representatives;   
(2) sales promotions relating to the policies; (3) costs associated with sales  
conferences and educational seminars for their sales representatives; (4) other 
sales expenses incurred by them; and (5) inclusion in the financial products the
broker-dealer offers. We may provide loans to broker-dealers or their affiliates
to help finance marketing and distribution of the policies, and those loans may 
be forgiven if aggregate sales goals are met. In addition, we may provide       
staffing or other administrative support and services to broker-dealers who     
distribute the policies.                                                        

These additional types of compensation are not offered to all broker-dealers.   
The terms of any particular agreement governing compensation may vary among     
broker-dealers and the amounts may be significant. The prospect of receiving, or
the receipt of, additional compensation may provide broker-dealers and/or their 
registered representatives with an incentive to favor sales of the policies over
other variable life insurance policies (or other investments) with respect to   
which a broker-dealer does not receive additional compensation, or receives     
lower levels of additional compensation. You may wish to take such payments into
account when considering and evaluating any recommendation relating to the      
policies.                                                                       

Depending on the particular selling arrangements, there may be others whom we   
compensate for distribution activities. For example, we may compensate certain  
"wholesalers," who control access to certain selling offices, for access to     
those offices or for referrals, and that compensation may be separate from the  
compensation paid for sales of the policies. One of the wholesalers is Lincoln  
Financial Distributors, Inc. ("LFD"), a registered broker-dealer, also an       
affiliate of Lincoln Life. We may compensate marketing organizations,           
associations, brokers or consultants which provide marketing assistance and     
other services to broker-dealers who distribute the policies, and which may be  
affiliated with those broker-dealers. Commissions and other incentives or       
payments described above are not charged directly to policy owners or the       
Separate Account. All compensation is paid from our resources, which include    
fees and charges imposed on your policy.                                        

We do not anticipate that the surrender charge, together with the portion of the
premium load attributable to sales expense, will cover all sales and            
administrative expenses which we will incur in connection with your policy. Any 
such shortfall would be available for recovery from the Company's General       
Account, which supports insurance and annuity obligations.                      

                                                                      SUPP-05.22
