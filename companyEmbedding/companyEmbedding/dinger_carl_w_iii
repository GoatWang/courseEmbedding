P-->SC 13D/A4th�Page�of�6TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�4th
ITEM 2. IDENTITY AND BACKGROUND 

a.)   This statement is being filed jointly by Carl W. Dinger III, individually 
     and as trustee for three individual trusts, (the "Filers") and as general
     partner of Carousel World LP. The beneficiaries of the irrevocable trusts
are the children of Carl W. Dinger III, Ashley E. Dinger, Caleigh N.
    Dinger and Shelby C. Dinger. Jeff E. Dinger is a co-trustee of the three
trusts and a general partner of Carousel World LP.                  

b.)   The principal address of each person or entity in the group is as follows:

    Carl W. Dinger III (individually and as trustee)
PO Box 150                                  
Green Village, NJ 07935                     

c.)   Present Principal occupation or employment and the name, principal        
  business and address of any corporation or other organization in which
such employment is conducted:                                       

             Carl W. Dinger III - Consultant/Officer of Carousel World
               LP Jeff E. Dinger - Consultant/Officer of Carousel World LP

d.)   No reporting person in the group has, during the last five years, been    
convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or 
similar misdemeanors).                                              

e.)   None of the reporting persons in this group has, during the last five     
     years, been a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative
    body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding was or
is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future    
     violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal
  or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such
laws.                                                               

f.)   Mr. Carl W. Dinger III, Jeffrey E. Dinger and Ashley E. Dinger are        
citizens of the United States.                                      

ITEM 3. SOURCE OF FUNDS 

The source of funds of each of the filers are personal funds in two accounts,   
borrowings from investment brokerage accounts supported by several equity       
holdings. The three irrevocable trusts and Carousel World LP have no such       
borrowings.                                                                     

ITEM 4. PURPOSE OF THE TRANSACTION 

The Filing Group has purchased the shares for investment purposes. The Group    
believes the synergies related to the merger of Transpro's and Modine's         
aftermarket business will ultimately result in significant contributions to the 
bottom line but is disappointed in the length of time for the turnaround. The   
group believes commodity costs and market conditions have been the culprits in  
the delay and feels management is taking appropriate steps to deal with these   
issues. The Filing Group may buy or sell securities in the Issuer at any time.

with respect to such laws.                                                      

f.)     Mr. Carl W. Dinger III, Mr. Jeffrey E. Dinger and Mr.                   
Carl W. Dinger, Jr. are all citizens of the United States.                      
Carousel Art Incorporated is incorporated in the State of                       
New Jersey.                                                                     

ITEM 3.         SOURCE AND AMOUNT OF FUNDS 

The source of funds of each of the reporting persons in the                     
group are the personal funds of each individual and in two                      
accounts, borrowings from investment brokerage accounts                         
supported by several equity holdings.                                           

ITEM 4.         PURPOSE OF THE TRANSACTION 

This 13D amendment is being filed pursuant to the Dinger                        
Group's change in position with respect to Foodarama                            
Supermarkets Inc. Carl W. Dinger III of the filing Group has                    
had ongoing discussions with Foodarama's Management regarding                   
the Group's recently submitted shareholder proposal which                       
recommends Management authorize a dutch tender offer.                           
Management indicated that while they support efforts to                         
enhance shareholder value, the timing of the proposal is not                    
opportune.  The Chief Executive Officer referred to a number                    
of matters affecting the Company's operations and capital                       
requirements as disclosed in the Company's recent 10K filing                    
including the ongoing store-remodeling program.                                 

The filing Group believes Management has done an exemplary                      
job managing the Company in a competitive environment.  This                    
was evidenced by the recent earnings report showing                             
significant improvement in Fiscal 2000 LIFO-adjusted                            
earnings.  While the filing group believes the stock is                         
significantly undervalued and steps should be taken to                          
improve shareholder value, the group is also deferential to                     
Management's judgement given recent operating improvement.                      

Accordingly, the Group will adhere to Management's request to                   
withdraw the proposal.  The Dinger Group has informed                           
Management that it intends to resubmit the proposal for the                     
2002 annual shareholders meeting if the stock price does not                    
improve substantially and reflect more normal industry                          
multiples.

Howard Street, Niles, IL 60714.      ITEM 2.  IDENTITY AND BACKROUND  a.) This statement has been filed jointly by Carl W. Dinger III, Carl W.

No reporting person in the group has, during the last five years, been convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors).   e.)

SOURCE AND AMOUNT OF FUNDS   The source of funds of each of the reporting persons in the group are the personal funds of each individual and in some cases, borrowings from investment brokerage accounts supported by several equity holdings.   ITEM 4. PURPOSE OF THE TRANSACTION   The group has taken a 5.63% stake in the Issuer pursuant to the formation of the group on October 17, 2016. The Group has become disenchanted with the Issuer’s stock price performance. Issuer announced a $2 million stock buyback plan on February 5, 2015. Issuer has failed to fully implement the stock buyback plan and has only purchased approximately 15% of the authorized buyback. Given the lack of performance of Issuer’s stock over the past five years, the Group is seeking a sale of the Issuer.   MFRI’s management has, to their credit, reduced the number of businesses that were not producing positive results. Unfortunately, the small capitalization of MFRI, the excessive managerial costs, the related stock options grants, and the regulatory costs, have all made this stock sell at or to a large discount to book value, price to sales and to several other financial metrics over a long period of time. What is left now is a pipe insulation company that also provides leak detection systems. The remaining segment is particularly attractive to a large number of companies seeking to fully integrate their pipe operations.    The poor performance of the stock is the final reason MFRI must be sold. The Issuer’s stock has significantly lagged every market index imaginable over the past five years. Consequently, the group is seeking an immediate, orderly sale of the Issuer and will seek support from other shareholders. Additionally, the Group is seeking the shareholder list and a Board seat to ensure that such a sale occurs in a timely and orderly fashion. If a sale is not completed in a timely manner, the Group intends to present a proposal to the shareholders at large at the next shareholder meeting to have the Issuer placed up for sale. A letter requesting the above is being served on the MFRI Board along with this filing.             ITEM 5.  INTEREST IN THE SECURITIES OF THE ISSUER  As reported in the Issuer's 10Q for the quarter ending 7/31/16, the issuer had 7,539,568 common shares outstanding. The reporting persons forming the group own an aggregate of 424,127 common shares representing 5.63% of the Issuer's shares outstanding.

WEDDINGS; Irene E. Stuart, Jeffrey E. Dinger
Published: May 9, 1993









                    Irene Elise Stuart, a model and actress in New York, was married yesterday to Jeffrey Edward Dinger, a vice president at Morgan Stanley & Company in New York. Msgr. John F. Corr, a Roman Catholic priest, performed the ceremony at the Church of Christ the King in New Vernon, N.J.        

                    Mrs. Dinger graduated from Dartmouth College. She is the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Eugene A. Suchta of Wilmington, Del. Her father was an administrator for Amtrak there. The bride changed her last name for professional reasons.        

                    Mr. Dinger graduated from Muhlenberg College. He is a son of Mr. and Mrs. Carl W. Dinger Jr. of Morristown, N.J. His mother, Charlotte Dinger, is the president of Carousel Art Inc., a company that reconstructs old carousels there, and is the author of the book "The Art of the Carousel." His father, now retired, was the group president of Rheem Manufacturing, a maker of air conditioners and heaters in Linden, N.J.
