FRANKLIN, Tenn., Aug. 27, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Franklin Financial Network, Inc. (NYSE:  FSB) announced today that effective August 25, 2015, Benjamin Wynd, CPA has been appointed to the Board of Directors of Franklin Financial Network, Inc. as well as the Board of Directors of Franklin Synergy Bank. Franklin Financial Network, Inc. is the parent company of Franklin Synergy Bank.
"Ben has a breadth of finance and healthcare industry experience that will make him an extraordinarily valuable addition to our board as we move into the area of healthcare lending," said Richard Herrington, Franklin Financial Network, Inc. Chairman and CEO. "We are extremely pleased to welcome Ben as a director and know that his experience will serve Franklin Synergy Bank and our shareholders well."
Wynd is a Certified Public Accountant with extensive management, technical and analytical skills. He brings significant experience in various technical accounting, finance and SEC reporting roles. 
Most recently, Wynd became partner at Smiley CPAs, a Franklin, Tennessee based firm that has been serving the local community for more than twenty-nine years. Prior to joining Smiley CPAs in November 2014, Wynd was heavily involved in Nashville's healthcare industry, serving as the Director of Financial Reporting at Tenet Healthcare/Vanguard. 
While at Tenet/Vanguard he was actively engaged in working on the company's SEC filings, including Vanguard's initial public offering in June 2011, comprehensive debt refinancing, overseeing the financial reporting of the company's health plans and supporting acquisition due diligence. Wynd's experience also includes working with national accounting firms, as well as with the 2002 Olympic Winter Games in Salt Lake City, Utah. 
"Franklin Synergy Bank has a deep bench of high-caliber leaders in our community and I am very enthusiastic about this opportunity," said Wynd. "I know how important Franklin Synergy Bank is to Middle Tennessee, and I have confidence in Richard and the management team. My priority will be to add value and further accelerate the excellent work that's been done thus far."
Wynd is a graduate of Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky; he is currently a member of the Tennessee Society of Certified Public Accountants and American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Wynd also serves on the Board of Directors at Outdoor Encounter, a Franklin-based non-profit organization that's mission is to improve the quality of life for those around us - not only by preserving green space, but by making that valuable space accessible to people of all ages. 



Founded in November 2007, Franklin Synergy Bank currently has six offices in Williamson County and five offices in Rutherford County. The bank provides deposit and loan products, treasury management, wealth management, trust and financial planning services for consumers and businesses. Franklin Synergy earned its first profit after just five quarters of operation, and has been profitable ever since that time.





The bank's assets and deposits both surpassed $1 billion in July 2014, just after the completion of the acquisition of Rutherford County's MidSouth Bank. Loans surpassed $1 billion in July 2015.





Recent FDIC data shows that Franklin Synergy Bank is the deposit share market leader in Williamson County. The bank is also the top deposit share bank in Franklin, Tennessee. 





Additional information about Franklin Synergy Bank is available at the bank's website: www.franklinsynergybank.com.

Benjamin Wynd, CPA Joins Franklin Financial Network, Inc. Board of Directors






Aug 27, 2015, 9:01am EDT














FRANKLIN, Tenn., Aug. 27, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Franklin Financial Network, Inc. (NYSE:FSB) announced today that effective August 25, 2015, Benjamin Wynd, CPA has been appointed to the Board of Directors of Franklin Financial Network, Inc. as well as the Board of Directors of Franklin Synergy Bank. Franklin Financial Network, Inc. is the parent company of Franklin Synergy Bank.

"Ben has a breadth of finance and healthcare industry experience that will make him an extraordinarily valuable addition to our board as we move into the area of healthcare lending," said Richard Herrington, Franklin Financial Network, Inc. Chairman and CEO. "We are extremely pleased to welcome Ben as a director and know that his experience will serve Franklin Synergy Bank and our shareholders well."
Wynd is a Certified Public Accountant with extensive management, technical and analytical skills. He brings significant experience in various technical accounting, finance and SEC reporting roles. 
Most recently, Wynd became partner at Smiley CPAs, a Franklin, Tennessee based firm that has been serving the local community for more than twenty-nine years. Prior to joining Smiley CPAs in November 2014, Wynd was heavily involved in Nashville's healthcare industry, serving as the Director of Financial Reporting at Tenet Healthcare/Vanguard. 
While at Tenet/Vanguard he was actively engaged in working on the company's SEC filings, including Vanguard's initial public offering in June 2011, comprehensive debt refinancing, overseeing the financial reporting of the company's health plans and supporting acquisition due diligence. Wynd's experience also includes working with national accounting firms, as well as with the 2002 Olympic Winter Games in Salt Lake City, Utah. 
"Franklin Synergy Bank has a deep bench of high-caliber leaders in our community and I am very enthusiastic about this opportunity," said Wynd. "I know how important Franklin Synergy Bank is to Middle Tennessee, and I have confidence in Richard and the management team. My priority will be to add value and further accelerate the excellent work that's been done thus far."
Wynd is a graduate of Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky; he is currently a member of the Tennessee Society of Certified Public Accountants and American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Wynd also serves on the Board of Directors at Outdoor Encounter, a Franklin-based non-profit organization that's mission is to improve the quality of life for those around us - not only by preserving green space, but by making that valuable space accessible to people of all ages. 



Founded in November 2007, Franklin Synergy Bank currently has six offices in Williamson County and five offices in Rutherford County. The bank provides deposit and loan products, treasury management, wealth management, trust and financial planning services for consumers and businesses. Franklin Synergy earned its first profit after just five quarters of operation, and has been profitable ever since that time.





The bank's assets and deposits both surpassed $1 billion in July 2014, just after the completion of the acquisition of Rutherford County's MidSouth Bank. Loans surpassed $1 billion in July 2015.





Recent FDIC data shows that Franklin Synergy Bank is the deposit share market leader in Williamson County. The bank is also the top deposit share bank in Franklin, Tennessee. 





Additional information about Franklin Synergy Bank is available at the bank's website: www.franklinsynergybank.com.

Product Description

On Wynd Armoire by YumanMod Sale . For people who are seeking
Wynd Armoire by YumanMod
review. We have additional information about Detail, Specification, Customer Reviews and Comparison Price. I would really like recommend that you check always the purchase price
 I have already been a smoker of cigs for sixty-two years. I actually stop smoking cigarettes cigarettes by using the Green Machine electric cigarette. I was very skeptical when I bought it, because I would not accept anyone telling myself that I could leave cigarettes.The Green Equipment is an electronic cigarette that uses injections of a formula that makes you feel that you're smoking. The vapors that you inhale are flavored vapor. A smoker enjoys the smoke from a cigarette and without the similarity of smoke there is no satisfaction. The vapor is there when you exhale and provides substantive satisfactionWhat about the kick, you ask?You can purchase several flavours for the Green Equipment. Tobacco, blueberry, mint, menthol, and many more flavours are available and can be obtained with smoking in the formula, or without it. I started out with the tobacco taste with nicotine, because We were skeptical of the smoker's satisfaction. I are now smoking the blueberry flavor, with nicotine, and I am very pleased with the smokers "kick". It would appear that the only thing lacking is the tars, but that's not detectable.Can be the difference between smoking cigarettes and the Green Equipment?Cigarette smokers inhale tars from the tobacco that cause blockages in the blood stream. I give up smoking tobacco because I actually had a heart strike. The primary artery in my heart became blocked and could not pump the blood for recirculation. I had fashioned to have surgery to unblock the artery, and I spent five times in intensive care so they could get my heart to again overcome in a rhythmic mouvement.The Green Machine will not produce tars and when consulting my cardiologist I received approval for use. The pleasure perhaps there is and the danger is minimal, in comparison to cigarettes.I never thought I'd be able to quit cigarettes until I actually tried the Green Equipment. There are several other electronic cigarettes on the industry, but the Green Equipment is the one I actually use, and functions. 3 months ago I would have given anyone a stiff argument about the dangers of tobacco use. I had all the answers to all the anti-smokers' arguments. Now I actually know I used to be dead incorrect. No, I'm not deceased, but I could have been because I was too stubborn to hear.Sources:

Online Store declares over everything. I mean to show to уou what current owners necessity certainly to express over it.
In terms of quitting smoking everyone panics and can't decide which smoking alternative/cessation to choose, due to side effects. The safest option and most healthy options are the digital cigarette. Are there any side effects to the e-cigarette?Most people would say no side results what so ever. Yet , I have to somewhat disagree. When you are trying a new product 90% of the time there is always some kind of concern. Here's what My spouse and i learned after using the electronic cigarette for 2 weeks straight now. Dry up MouthFrom day one of using the digital cigarette I indeed experienced dry mouth. I never had dry mouth before, because I usually drink everywhere from 60-100 ounces of water a day vigilantly. After I took the first 10 puffs I actually noticed my mouth sense like cotton.From that point on I upped my water to see if the dryness was actually coming from the e-cigarette. I puffed again a few times, and the cotton mouth went back. However, the dry mouth area was not going to scare me away, because I AM SMOKE COST-FREE for 2 weeks, and this side effect is nothing. Slight HeadacheThe initial few days of using the e-cig I actually had a slight frustration. I recently came across my head harm more once i inhaled too much at the same time. The elements in the e-cigarette are propylene glycol, glycerin filtered water, nicotine, terpineol, methylfurfural, and vanilla extract.Even so after the two week mark I noticed the headache was gone. Might be every other day approximately I would get an extremely slight one but nothing to really grumble about. Loss Of CravingsThis side effect could be just the thing for many. They will say when you leave smoking you can gain weight. I really believe if your a food person it can all in your brain and you will go right to food. However, with the e-vape I discovered I really haven't recently been hungry at all. The more I puff on it, the more I actually lost my appetite. This may definitely vary everyone is different and can react different.Although I experienced some effects I am still smoke free. This was totally worth it. Simply ensure you drink plenty of fluids to keep your body intact.
