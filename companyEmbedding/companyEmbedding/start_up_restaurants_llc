Starting a Restaurant Business




Thinking about starting a restaurant? Start here for an overview of important legal and financial considerations.

Opening a restaurant has its own set of legal considerations. These 
include choosing the proper business entity, obtaining licenses and 
permits, dealing with health and safety, getting adequate insurance, 
reviewing franchising issues, and dealing with employees.
Choosing the Business Entity
While
 you could operate your restaurant as a sole proprietorship or 
partnership, you should probably consider using a legal form that 
protects you from personal liability, such as a corporation or a limited
 liability company. Unlike some other types of business, such as certain
 professional or consulting offices, restaurants have a significant 
number of customers coming through every day, and in many cases also a 
significant number of employees engaged in a lot of physical activity. 
This increases the likelihood that a person could be injured, or his or 
her property damaged, on the premises—in which case you would want the 
business, not you personally, to be responsible for any liability.
Learn more about choosing a type business structure.
Licenses and Permits
You
 will need to obtain a variety of licenses and permits in order to 
operate your restaurant. In some cases, such as obtaining a permit for 
handling food, you most likely will need to look to a local government 
office. In other cases, such as obtaining a liquor license, you will 
probably need to work with a state agency such as a liquor control 
commission. And, if you are thinking of serving liquor in your 
restaurant, keep in mind that the liquor licensing process can be 
complicated and may require outside legal assistance.
If your 
restaurant will be serving large numbers of people you may have crowd 
control issues and, therefore, need to obtain a license or permit from a
 fire or police department. Similarly, you probably will also need a 
permit or license from a local building department relating to adequacy 
of exits from the restaurant and related emergency issues.
Health and Safety
Because
 restaurants are all about people eating food, they are subject to 
significant regulations regarding food health and safety. Beyond needing
 to obtain a permit to handle and prepare food, you can expect regular 
monitoring from your local health department. Local health authorities 
generally have a lot of latitude regarding what they can inspect, and 
health department inspections can cover a wide array of items in your 
restaurant. Inspections may cover not only the food itself, raw and 
prepared, but also refrigeration systems, cooking equipment, and waste 
disposal, among other areas.
The health and safety of restaurant 
workers is also an issue. The Occupational Safety & Health 
Administration (OSHA) has a variety of regulations relating to, among 
other things, eye and face protection, hand protection, and 
walking-working surfaces.
Insurance
There are particular 
risks associated with operating a restaurant, such as customers or 
employees slipping and falling on the premises, someone getting hurt 
from hot liquid or broken glass, or someone becoming seriously ill from 
the food itself. These are on top of more generic business risks such as
 fire, theft, or other sources of property damage or personal injury.
Try
 to work with an insurance agent who has previous experience writing 
policies for restaurants. For property coverage, try to make sure that 
everything of importance, from plates to stoves, is fully covered. For 
injuries to people, make sure you have an excellent general liability 
policy. This should cover not only a patron who slips at your 
restaurant’s front door, but also one who becomes gravely ill from 
eating the restaurant’s food. And, if you do outside catering, make sure
 you have proper vehicle insurance, as well.
For more information, see Nolo's article on Obtaining Business Insurance.
Franchising
If
 you’re thinking of opening a restaurant that is part of a franchise, 
keep in mind that you will have to operate under far more restrictions 
than if you opened your own independent restaurant. You will be subject 
to a franchise contract which you should expect to favor the franchisor,
 and which likely will give the franchisor rights to:

decide where other competing restaurants will be located
block sale of your franchise to a particular prospective buyer
choose the geographic location where any disputes will be resolved, and
require you to buy all of your goods and services from the franchisor.

Along
 with the restrictions contained in the franchise contract, you should 
keep in mind the additional financial costs of a franchise. In exchange 
for being given a preexisting business plan, getting certain help as 
needed when running the restaurant, and benefitting from group 
marketing, you will be required to pay out a substantial amount of your 
profit to the franchisor. More specifically, apart from a large initial 
franchise fee, expect to be required to pay the franchisor:

a percentage of your profits as a royalty
an above-market cost for equipment, goods, and supplies purchased from the franchisor
finance charges on those same purchases
training fees for you and your employees, and
contributions to a fund for group advertising.

If
 you are considering starting a restaurant as part of a franchise, 
investigate the franchise as thoroughly as you can, including reviewing 
closely the federally-required franchise disclosure statement.
To learn more, see Nolo's article, Want to Buy a Franchise? Ten Reasons Not to Do It.
Employees
Most
 restaurants have employees and, in many cases, there can be relatively 
frequent turnover, particularly among waitstaff, bussers, and similar 
positions. You should inform yourself about basic employment law issues 
such as illegal discrimination, workers compensation, and how to handle 
the hiring process. With regard to hiring in particular, learn how to:

create a useful job application that does not include illegal questions
check
 references or make other preemployment inquiries -- again without 
violating privacy laws or otherwise seeking illegal information, and
ask interview questions that are both useful and legally permissible.

Keep
 in mind that there are some employment laws that are specifically 
relevant to restaurants, such as minimum wages for tipped employees.
A good resource for general employment issues is The Employer’s Legal Handbook, by
 Fred Steingold (Nolo). Also, many key employment laws are administered 
through the Department of Labor, and there are a variety of informative 
webpages within the Department of Labor website.

While allowing business owners to remain free from a great deal of the formalities imposed on other types of businesses, it still provides limited liability protection for its owners (members). LLCs are also eligible for "pass-through" taxation, which means that the company's income taxes are only reflected on each owner's personal tax return, not at the business level.

Most large companies are formed under this structure as it offers the most tax related options for business owners. It provides the greatest level of separation between the company and its owners, and allows the company to raise capital through the issuance of publicly traded stock. However, the many formal requirements placed on C Corps prevent the structure from being the ideal choice for many smaller organizations.

The most important of these differences is that S Corps are eligible for special pass through taxation status with the IRS. This allows S Corp owners to avoid double taxation on their business income. S Corps must request pass through taxation status, by filing Form 2553 with IRS after successfully incorporating.

Why Incorporate | Why You Should Incorporate Your Business | Swyft Filings Home   Starting Your Business  Why Incorporate Your Business? About Us Pricing Overview Our 5 Step Process Why Incorporate General FAQs Our GuaranteeThe Benefits of IncorporatingIncorporating your business offers a unique mix of benefits, many of which are unavailable to informal business structures such as sole proprietorships and general partnerships. If you are looking for tax flexibility, limited liability, and the option to raise capital, incorporation may be the best path for you. The following are four of the major benefits of incorporation:Increased CredibilityBeing recognized as a corporation proves to creditors and potential clients that your business is organized according to state law. By simply adding “Inc” or “LLC” to the end of your business name gives you the professional look and credibility that many customers are looking for.Tax Benefits Corporation owners are able to deduct many more expenses than those who own informal businesses. These write-offs can be substantial since insurance, travel, and entertainment are deductions. Corporation owners are also free from paying certain self-employment taxes, which informal business owners must pay.Asset ProtectionIn the event that a corporation becomes unable to pay its debts, the owners are given limited liability status. This means that their personal funds or assets cannot be collected in order to pay business debts. In the event legal proceedings are brought against the corporation, the owners’ personal assets are protected.Perpetual lifespan If your business is incorporated, it will not be forced to dissolve due to changes in ownership. The transfer of ownership is typically accomplished through the simple sale of common or unrestricted preferred stock or by membership interest transfers. Informal business structures are not perpetual entities, so in the event that an owner dies or wants to sell, the business typically ceases to exist in its current form. Being a perpetual entity makes it easier for incorporated businesses to get bank loans and to attract investors.

If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account.

If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products.

We love to help!Should I form my business as an LLC?Despite being a relatively new option, the limited liability company (LLC) is now one of the most popular business structures among smaller organizations. While allowing business owners to remain free from a great deal of the regulations imposed on other types of companies, it still provides limited liability protection for its owners (members). This means that the personal assets of an LLC's ownership cannot be collected to fulfill the debts of the business. What is involved in forming an LLC?All states require potential LLC owners to file a substantial set of documents, typically called the Articles of Organization, in order to establish their business. We can take care of this process for you, saving you time, effort, and allowing you to focus on developing your business – not filing paperwork. How should I name my LLC?The name you choose for your LLC is an important decision, as it will be how you represent yourself to potential associates and clients. With that in mind, it is advisable that you take some time to craft a name that you will be proud to have representing you and your business.Your name must be unique, and not deceptively similar, to any other trademarked name or business. It is also required that your name not be used to intentionally misrepresent the products or services you offer. For LLCs, nearly all states will also require you to add a signifier of your limited liability status, such as "LLC" or "L.L.C." to the end of your company's name. You may be able to operate under a name other than your formal LLC name by applying for and using a dba. Are there a required number of individuals needed to form an LLC?There is no minimum requirement as to the number of owners (also referred to as members) that an LLC must have. At the federal level, single-member LLCs qualify for pass-through taxation, however this is not always true at the state level.

How to Start a Business: Opening a Restaurant
by Stephanie Morrow, March 2009






From steakhouses to sub shops, more and more restaurants are popping up in cities every day. Since restaurants are such a common business venture, people must enjoy running them. How do these benefits sound to you? Be your own boss, have more flexibility, and sincerely enjoy what you do. Not bad. However, all of those advantages come at a price - building a restaurant from scratch isn't easy.
It's a hard and expensive process, and the reality is that many restaurants fail in their first year of business. But rest assured, there are ways to reduce the risk of becoming another statistic. Follow some of these handy tips and you too can run a successful food establishment.
Work in a Restaurant
One of the best ways to reduce the risk of owning a failed restaurant is to have some restaurant experience before you start. Many successful restaurateurs have said that the best way to prepare for owning a restaurant is by working in one, hopefully in an eatery similar to one you'd like to open. You'll learn more than just how to serve food with a smile; you can learn restaurant marketing, menu development, payroll, and other significant components of the restaurant world. Working in the restaurant industry and learning the basics is an important first step to becoming an owner.
Know Your Target Market
Who do you see eating at your restaurant? Are you targeting the family crowd, teenagers or seniors? Knowing your target market before you start planning will not only help you solidify your menu; it will help determine your location, décor and the overall atmosphere of your restaurant. A family-style restaurant, which caters to parents and their kids, may not appeal to seniors. On the other hand, an upscale, quiet restaurant offering a two-hour dining experience wouldn't be appealing to teenagers or families with small children.
Select a Service Style and Food Concept
What type of restaurant do you see yourself owning? One of the first things you must decide is what specific service style you are interested in. If you are a morning person, you may be more apt to owning a diner specializing in breakfast and brunch. On the other hand, if you consider yourself a night owl you may prefer an after 4 p.m. dinner/bar crowd.
Typically, you service style will either be fast-food, which offers food types that range from burgers, fries, hot dogs and sandwiches; midscale, which has full course meals at value prices; or upscale, offering full service meals with high-class ambiance and, in turn, higher prices. After narrowing your establishment to one of these three options, you can narrow your style of food choices. Is there a particular type of cuisine that you see yourself serving? Do you prefer pizza or seafood? Sandwiches or Chinese? Choosing your food concept goes hand-in-hand with your choice in service style.
Develop a Business Plan
Like any other type of company, a restaurant will need a concise business plan. This plan should include but is not limited to: the overall concept and goal of your restaurant; specific financial information and projections; a description of your target market; your menu and pricing; equipment and employee details; an advertising and marketing plan; and a potential exit strategy.
Create a Menu
The menu can make or break a restaurant, and should be in accordance with the overall concept of the restaurant. Revisit your business plan to make sure the menu is attractive to your target market, is affordable within your budget, and complements your restaurant's design concept. For example, if your restaurant is family-friendly, you will need a kids menu. If you are an upscale establishment, a lot of thought will have to go into your wine list.
Choose a Location and Layout
The old saying of "location, location, location" is vital in the restaurant world. It is important to find a location that has a continuous stream of traffic, convenient parking, and is in proximity to other businesses (especially if you're catering to the lunch crowd). And don't forget to revisit your business plan to make sure you are close to your target market. If you are opening a restaurant/night club, it may not be the best idea to open it in the vicinity of retirement homes. In addition, make sure your monthly rent is in-line with your business plan's projected profit so that you do not become building-poor.
Once you find your location, the layout and design of the interior should be taken into account. You should already have a concept of your restaurant in your business plan; bring this concept into the design of the dining room. When designing your kitchen area, think about what's on your menu in order to determine what is needed for the food preparation area.
Get Funding
Your business plan will help you recognize how much money you will need to start your restaurant. If you are unsure about how much money you will need upfront, talking to other restaurant owners can help you project your expected start-up costs. There are numerous ways restaurateurs raise capital to start their business, including taking advantage of government programs that cater to upstart small business owners; liquidating assets or using them as collateral for a loan; or encouraging a family or friend to become a partner.
Be Familiar With Safety Regulations
Restaurants are regulated and subject to inspection, and failing to be up to speed with these regulations could be detrimental to your company. Most regulatory agencies will work with new restaurateurs to help them become familiar with what they must do to meet the necessary legal requirements.
Hire Employees
One of the biggest challenges restaurants face is a lack of qualified labor. In order to get and retain qualified employees, make sure your employment ads specifically state what you are looking for in an employee, and clearly outline the job's duties and responsibilities. In addition, find out what other restaurants are paying their employees so that you can be competitive in the job market, without spending too much on payroll.

 
 
Advertise and Market
As with any business, "build it and they will come" won't have customers breaking down your door. Every business needs a comprehensive marketing plan, and restaurants are no exception. After determining your marketing budget, price out billboard advertising, ads in coupon clippers, and television and radio advertising. Get noticed online by posting your restaurant on sites such as www.fooddigger.com. Ask your customers how they found out about you, so that you can record where your advertising and marketing dollars are best spent. Grass roots advertising, such as setting up tasting booths at local events or having an event at the restaurant benefiting a local charity, can be an inexpensive way to achieve positive word-of-mouth.
More Information
Owning and running a restaurant is not for everyone; there is a lot of work involved. However, there are many experts that can help you be a successful restaurateur. Trade associations are an excellent source because they can give you specific information about your particular market niche. Visit the National Restaurant Association's Web site at www.restaurant.org for more information. And, as with any new business venture, it is important to discuss business options with an attorney.

LegalZoom can help you start a business. Answer a few simple questions and we'll help you decide which business structure is right for you. Find out whether an LLC, C corporation, S corporation, or sole proprietorship fits best with your business goals.

Executive Summary
This business plan was created to secure investors. La Salsa Fresh Mexican Grill is one of the hottest franchises to team up with and offers enormous potential in Oregon. Currently, La Salsa is in all of the neighboring states of Oregon and is still expanding. The Santa Barbara Restaurant Group (SBRG) franchises the La Salsa chain. There are two main reasons that La Salsa will succeed in Eugene: first is the lack of direct competition (nothing like it in town), the second is the high demand for a product like this in Eugene. Eugene is in preparation for a large population growth period, the current population of the greater Eugene/ Springfield metro area is over 300,000 according to Census 2000 and expanding. The creation of a Limited Liability Corporation (LLC) will shield owners and investors from personal liability. Over the next three years Benjamin D. Strock plans to expand La Salsa in Oregon, developing between 3 to 10 restaurants under the LLC. This business plan only includes the first store plans which will help create more concrete goals. Per store revenues for La Salsa range between $400,000 to $1,000,000 depending heavily on location. Estimated start-up costs from SBRG are between $300,000 and $400,000, and require an initial investment of  around $600,000. Half of this money will be financed by a small business loan, and the other half will come from private investors. Net profits will be high, yielding an estimated $85,000 a year per store (possibly much more). The franchisor, SBRG will control most of pricing, training, building and advertising in exchange for between 8% and 10% of gross sales. Hopefully, the first La Salsa in Oregon will be built and running within three months of the initial financing assuming that a location has been agreed upon by franchisor, franchisee and investors.
1.1 Mission
La Salsa Fresh Mexican Grill will establish itself as the premier casual Mexican dining restaurant in Eugene while maintaining uncompromising principles as we grow to more than three restaurants. The six following guiding principles will help us measure the appropriateness of our decisions.Provide a great work environment and treat employees with dignity and respect.Embrace diversity as an essential component in the way that we do business.Apply the highest standards of excellence to the food production, preparation, and service to our customers.Build lasting relationships with the guests. Contribute positively to communities and our environment.Recognize that profitability is essential to our future success.

Perpetual existence Varies     The life of the LLC is dependent of the terms of the operating agreement. Its existence may be short term or perpetual that survive the death or transfer of the membership interests of the original founders. C Corps are separate entities that survive the death or transfer of stock of the owners and/or major shareholders. S Corps are separate entities that survive the death or transfer of stock of the owners and/or major shareholders. DBAs end upon closure of the company or the death of the owner. Nonprofits are entities that survive any change in their board of directors. Ongoing formalities      Depending on the state of incorporation, an LLC may be required to file an annual report and/or pay franchise fees. After formation, C Corps have many ongoing formalities such as writing bylaws, selecting directors, holding initial and annual shareholder meetings, and issuing stock. After formation, S Corps have many ongoing formalities such as writing bylaws, selecting directors, holding initial and annual shareholder meetings, and issuing stock.

We love to help!Should I form my business as an LLC?Despite being a relatively new option, the limited liability company (LLC) is now one of the most popular business structures among smaller organizations. While allowing business owners to remain free from a great deal of the regulations imposed on other types of companies, it still provides limited liability protection for its owners (members). This means that the personal assets of an LLC's ownership cannot be collected to fulfill the debts of the business. What is involved in forming an LLC?All states require potential LLC owners to file a substantial set of documents, typically called the Articles of Organization, in order to establish their business. We can take care of this process for you, saving you time, effort, and allowing you to focus on developing your business – not filing paperwork. How should I name my LLC?The name you choose for your LLC is an important decision, as it will be how you represent yourself to potential associates and clients. With that in mind, it is advisable that you take some time to craft a name that you will be proud to have representing you and your business.Your name must be unique, and not deceptively similar, to any other trademarked name or business. It is also required that your name not be used to intentionally misrepresent the products or services you offer. For LLCs, nearly all states will also require you to add a signifier of your limited liability status, such as "LLC" or "L.L.C." to the end of your company's name. You may be able to operate under a name other than your formal LLC name by applying for and using a dba. Are there a required number of individuals needed to form an LLC?There is no minimum requirement as to the number of owners (also referred to as members) that an LLC must have. At the federal level, single-member LLCs qualify for pass-through taxation, however this is not always true at the state level.

 When Starting a New Restaurant: Sole Proprietorship or LLC? | Chron.com              Skip to main content.  When Starting a New Restaurant: Sole Proprietorship or LLC?  by Regina Anaejionu        Picking the best business structure for your restaurant will help the business run smoothly. restaurant image by Olga Struk from Fotolia.com   Related Articles  1 Small Business LLC Vs. Corporation Vs. Sole Proprietorship 2 10 Examples of Sole Proprietors 3 What Licenses Do I Need to Start a Restaurant Business? 4 Limited Liability Partnership Vs. Limited Liability Company    Based on your needs, either a limited liability company, commonly called an LLC, or a sole proprietorship can be a rewarding business structure for your restaurant. Though they have many similarities, sole proprietorship restaurants and LLCs differ. You and your restaurant are the same legal entity when you own a sole proprietorship; an LLC provides your business a separate legal entity. A little planning and a careful look at key factors can help you decide what works best for your restaurant.        Costs Although most costs are the same whether you start your restaurant as an LLC or a sole proprietorship, there is one fee that is distinct --- your business formation expense. In most states you start a sole proprietorship by filing an assumed name certificate, also called a doing business as certificate, with your county clerk's office for under $25. Filing a certificate of formation for an LLC is done through the secretary of state's office, and most states do not charge more than $300. Liabilities Since a sole proprietorship is not a separate legal entity, if your restaurant is not able to pay its debts, your creditors can come after your personal property. Assets such as your car, home and personal savings are at risk. If your restaurant is run as an LLC, you are not personally responsible for business debt unless you sign a guarantee that says so. This means creditors can only gain access to your business savings and assets, but not your personal property. In the same way, if a patron sues your restaurant, claiming your food made him sick or he slipped and fell on your flooring or any number of things, an LLC can help protect your personal assets from risk. Financing and Loans When you own a sole proprietorship, financial institutions and other investors often have only your personal credit information from which to make a lending decision, since your business is not a separate legal entity. With an LLC, your business credit is more likely to be taken into consideration and can be shown as an alternative to, or in addition to, your personal credit. Your restaurant as an LLC will have its own credit rating, in the same way individuals have credit scores. This may benefit your restaurant if you want to expand it, purchase new equipment, open a second location, remodel or any number of things that will help your business grow but may take financing. Taxes If you choose to make your restaurant a sole proprietorship, you will be required to report your business taxes with your personal income on a Schedule C form for businesses. If you are the sole member/owner of an LLC however, you can elect to be taxed as a corporation, partnership, or sole proprietor, according to the IRS website. This means that whether you choose to run your restaurant as an LLC or sole proprietorship, you can avoid double taxation, meaning your profits will only be taxed once, as a part of your personal income tax return. Other business forms such as corporations are taxed on profits as a business, and then the owners are taxed on their share of the income from the business. IRS Audits Since restaurants conduct multiple cash transactions per day, it is easy for owners to understate earnings. This fact, combined with your sole proprietorship status, may make your restaurant more likely to be audited by the IRS than an LLC. In 2010 the U.S. Treasury Department asked for IRS audit measures to be strengthened because of the likeliness of a sole proprietor underreporting income on her taxes. This is not to say your LLC is not subject to random audits, but the propensity to underreport is not as high.

If you are thinking about opening a food business, there are many regulatory requirements that you will need to meet. Some of these requirements apply to all food businesses, and some are specific to the particular food product, such as low-acid canned food, seafood, or juice.This information provides a cursory overview of regulatory requirements that relate to starting a food business. In addition to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) requirements, your food business will be subject to other federal, state, and local requirements. These will vary depending on the your product and the type of facility you operate. If you are planning to operate a food business, you may want to discuss your specific product and facility with the FDA District Office and the state and local regulatory agencies that have jurisdiction. These discussions will help you identify what state and local regulations must be met related to operating a food business.On this page:Food Businesses Subject to FDA RegulationHome-Based Businesses Food Facility Registration Food ImportsPrior NoticeRecordkeeping Good Manufacturing Practice RequirementsHazard Analysis & Critical Control Points (HACCP)Food AdditivesFood Contact SubstancesLabelingReportingPreventive ControlsInspections Dietary SupplementsAdditional Information Responsibility of a Food FacilitySpecific Food Product RequirementsResources back to topFood Businesses Subject to FDA Regulation  FDA regulates all foods and food ingredients introduced into or offered for sale in interstate commerce, with the exception of meat, poultry, and certain processed egg products regulated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).The Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFAN), works with FDA field offices to ensure that the nations' food supply (except meat, poultry and some egg products, which are regulated by USDA) is safe, sanitary, wholesome, and honestly labeled and that cosmetic products are safe and properly labeled.Examples of Food businesses NOT regulated by FDA:Retail food establishments (i.e. grocery stores, restaurants, cafeterias, and food trucks), which are regulated by state and local governments.Farmers marketsback to topHome-Based BusinessIf you are starting a home-based food business, you will need to understand the regulations of FDA and your state and local health department. Local and county health agencies inspect food service and food retail establishments, provide technical assistance to food facilities, and educate consumers about food safety.In some cases home-based food business are exempt from certain FDA regulations. An example of an exemption: if you are not entering into interstate commerce (selling your product outside of your state), you may not have to register as a facility. However, all imported food is considered to be interstate commerce.If you are importing food products, conducting internet sales, and/or shipping food products outside of your state, you must register as a facility. Be sure to carefully review the regulations to understand how they apply to your unique set of circumstances.    Requirements governing what FDA regulates:What Does FDA Regulate? How do I know if my product is regulated by FDA?Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFD&C Act)Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR)Public Health Service Act (several provisions of this act provide FDA with important statutory authority, such as the authority to issue regulations for the control of communicable diseases)Laws Enforced by FDA  back to topFood Facility RegistrationFacilities that manufacture, process, pack, or hold food that is intended for human or animal consumption in the United States must register with FDA before beginning these activities. The registration requirement applies to any facility that conducts these activities, unless a facility is specifically exempted. An example of exempted facility is one that manufactures/processes, packs, or holds only a food contact substance or pesticide. For a full list of exempted facilities please visit the links below.Facility Registration: Registration of Food FacilitiesGuidance for Industry: What You Need to Know About Registration of Food Facilities; Small Entity Compliance GuideGuidance for Industry: Questions and Answers Regarding Food Facility Registration (Sixth Edition) Requirements governing food facility registration:Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 (Bioterrorism Act)21 CFR section 1.225Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA)Facility Registration Under the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA)Food Defense Guidance Documents & Regulatory Informationback to topFood ImportsFood imported into the United States must meet the same laws and regulations as food produced in the United States. It must be safe and contain no prohibited ingredients, and all labeling and packaging must be informative and truthful, with the labeling information in English (or Spanish in Puerto Rico).All imported food is considered to be interstate commerce. back to top Prior Notice   As of December 12, 2003, FDA must be notified in advance of any shipments of food for humans and other animals that are imported into the U.S., unless the food is exempt from Prior Notice. Prior Notice of imported food shipments provide FDA with an opportunity to, review and evaluate information before a food product arrives in the U.S., inspect and intercept contaminated food products . Prior Notice of Imported FoodsWhat You Need to Know about Prior Notice of Imported Food Shipmentsback to top  RecordkeepingFood manufacturers, processors, packers, transporters, distributors, receivers, holders, and importers are required to establish, maintain, and make available to FDA upon request certain records that will allow the agency to identify all food products handled by the facility.For instance, if your business is required to register under the Bioterrorism Act and makes cookie dough that is subsequently baked and packaged by another facility, your records must include the names and addresses of the facilities from which you get your ingredients, plus the names and addresses of the facilities where you send your dough to be baked and packaged. This is also known as "one up, one down" in the distribution chain.Depending on the type of food business you operate, your food business may have to keep records in addition to those required under the Bioterrorism Act and to make them available to FDA. You may want to consult Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations to determine what records are required for a specific type of facility and operation. Requirements may vary depending on the food commodity and the type of food processing in your business. Requirements governing recordkeeping: Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 (Bioterrorism Act)21 CFR Part 1, Subpart JFood Safety Modernization ActResources:Establishment and Maintenance of RecordsRecords and Records Access under the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA)back to top Good Manufacturing Practice RequirementsCurrent Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations require that food offered for sale or introduced into interstate commerce be produced under safe and sanitary conditions.Certain food commodities have additional requirements because of inherent hazards, particular attributes, or specific manufacturing processes. For instance, certain egg producers must follow the Egg Safety Final Rule in order to reduce the spread of Salmonella Enteritidis, a known pathogen of eggs.Requirements governing cGMP: 21 CFR Part 110 Resources:Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) for the 21st Century - Food ProcessingCommodity Specific Information (Eggs, Milk, Seafood, and more)Bag Bug Book (Second Edition)back to topLabelingFood manufacturers are responsible for developing labels (including nutrition information) that meet legal food labeling requirements. All labeling of FDA-regulated food products must be truthful and not misleading. Proper labeling, including nutrition labeling and labeling for the major food allergens, is required for most prepared foods.Note: The labels of food products sold in U.S. interstate commerce must be in English. However, foods distributed solely in Puerto Rico may bear labels in Spanish instead of English. See Compliance Policy Guide Sec. 562.750 Labeling of Food Articles Distributed Solely in Puerto Rico. Requirements governing the labeling of foods: Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFD&C Act)Fair Packaging and Labeling ActNutrition Labeling and Education ActFood Allergen labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004FDA’s regulations on food labeling - 21 CFR 101 Resources: Food Labeling and Nutrition OverviewFood Labeling GuideFood Allergens Labeling Information Small Business Nutrition Labeling ExemptionTopic-Specific Labeling InformationDeveloping Labels:Manufacturers may choose to hire a commercial laboratory to perform analyses of foods to determine nutrient content. FDA cannot recommend any particular laboratory.The United States Department of Agriculture’s Food Nutrient Database can be used to develop appropriate nutrient information for products. This information may be used in conjunction with food product recipes to calculate nutrition information required for food labels.FDA's Nutrition Labeling Manual provides technical instructions to manufacturers about how to develop and use nutrition databases for food products.    back to topReportingRegistered facilities must report when there is a reasonable probability that the use of, or exposure to, an article of food will cause serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals. Information is available about how to report these situations to FDA's Reportable Food Registry. FDA allows conventional food manufacturers, processors, packers, transporters, distributors, receivers, holders, and importers to forward reports of serious adverse events in connection with their products to FDA by filing Form 3500.FDA requires reporting of serious adverse events involving dietary supplements. See Dietary Supplements - Reporting an Adverse Event and Guidance for Industry: Questions and Answers Regarding Adverse Event Reporting and Recordkeeping for Dietary Supplements as Required by the Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act for additional information.back to topPreventive Controls The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA), signed into law in January 2011, enables FDA to focus more on preventing food safety problems rather than relying primarily on reacting to problems after they occur. See Preventive Standards Under the Food Safety Modernization Act for more information.Unless specifically exempted by FSMA, the owner, operator, or agent in charge of a facility will be required to:Evaluate the hazards that could affect food manufactured, processed, packed, or held by the facility;Identify and implement preventive controls to significantly minimize or prevent the occurrence of such hazards;Provide assurances that such food is not adulterated under section 402 or misbranded under section 403(w) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act;Monitor the performance of those controls; andRoutinely maintain records of this monitoring. Note: FDA is currently developing proposed regulations to implement requirements under the FSMA. Information about FSMA implementation is posted on the FDA website. You can sign up for FSMA updates to receive updates on implementation and progress via e-mail.back to topInspectionsInvestigators with FDA's Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA) inspect FDA-regulated facilities. Alternatively, FDA may arrange for state regulatory officials to conduct inspections on behalf of the agency. ORA offices are located throughout the country. A list of local ORA offices provides a point of contact for manufacturers and distributors located within each jurisdiction. State regulatory agencies can provide information about their state and local agencies' contacts, requirements, and inspections.FDA inspects food facilities on a varying schedule based upon the risk level of the product, time elapsed since previous inspection, and compliance history, as well as other factors. For instance, infant formula facilities are inspected annually.back to topDietary SupplementsFDA regulates both finished dietary supplement products and dietary supplement ingredients. Dietary supplements are regulated under a different set of regulations than those covering "conventional" foods and drug products.Dietary supplements are regulated under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA). However, dietary supplement manufacturers and distributors are not required to obtain approval from FDA before marketing dietary supplements. Before a firm markets a dietary supplement, the firm is responsible for ensuring that the products it manufactures or distributes are safe; any claims made about the products are not false or misleading; and that the products comply with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and FDA regulations in all other respects.Resources: Dietary Supplements Guidance Documents & Regulatory InformationDietary Supplement Labeling GuideNational Institutes of Health, Office of Dietary Supplementsback to top Additional InformationResponsibility of a Food Facility Under provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFD&C Act), and FDA's implementing regulations found in Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations, food manufacturers, processors, and distributors are responsible for ensuring that their products that are intended for distribution in U.S. interstate commerce are safe, sanitary, and labeled according to federal requirements.Specific Food Product Requirements Certain foods, such as low-acid canned foods, milk, eggs, juices, seafood, and infant formula, have additional product-specific regulatory requirements to ensure that they are healthful and free of contamination.back to top ResourcesSmall Business Guide to FDASmall Business/Small Entity Compliance GuidesIs It Really FDA ApprovedLocal Health Department: Please speak with your local health department to determine if you will be required to meet state and local laws. Advertising: The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) primarily regulates advertising.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
