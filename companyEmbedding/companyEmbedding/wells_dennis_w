I had symptoms of the flu, and as a RN on an oncology floor at a local hospital, I can't afford to infect my patients, so I dragged myself to this clinic today, on a Saturday, to get an accurate diagnosis.  I didn't need an ER, but my primary care provider doesn't see patients on Saturdays unless it's an emergency.  So MD360 is a great, convenient option to the ER, not to mention less expensive.  From arrival to check out, each employee was friendly, empathetic, and professional.  Dr. Holcombe and the nurse Elaine made my day better, even making me laugh a couple of times, despite feeling like a truck ran over me, backed up, then ran over me again.  After check in, I only waited 5 minutes.  I recommend their services without reservation (and this from a nurse who works at a competitor!).  University Medical GroupMarilda H. ratedI was very pleased with the workers; who waited on me. They was very prompt. My therapist explained in detail; how, and whys of the procedure of the massages ; she was telling me how to, and why it was beneficial. I Will give her a bouble plus, because what ai have learned; it is still working.  Thank you very much.Md360haydendanielle rated~MD360 of Greenville S.C is exceptional~ I have never been so impressed with a walk in clinic!
