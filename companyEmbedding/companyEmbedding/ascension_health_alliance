                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

News Analysis





 

Event




On 16 March 2012, Ascension Health Alliance, a U.S. Catholic nonprofit health system, which generated about $15.5 billion in revenue in 2011, announced that it had:






Signed a memorandum of understanding for the Daughters of Charity Health System (DCHS) to become part of the Ascension Health Alliance. DCHS is a health system operating 22 sites, including six hospitals in coastal California.






Formed a group purchasing organization (GPO) service that will be provided through the Resource and Supply Management Group, a subsidiary of Ascension Health Alliance.





 

Analysis




Ascension Health Alliance’s expansion and creation of its own GPO that will likely leverage large committed volume contracts continues the consolidation of demand that we forecast in



"Predicts 2012: Supply Chain for Healthcare and Life Sciences"



. Regional and national health systems, such as Ascension Health Alliance, continue to consolidate, and GPO services offered by an integrated delivery network (IDN) are increasing.




Ascension Health Alliance will expand its footprint nationally and continue to take advantage of volumes to lower costs. This expansion in the scale and scope of the supply chain will likely push manufacturers to become even more effective in end-to-end supply chain planning to differentiate their capabilities from those of their competitors.




Ascension Health Alliance’s further expansion into geographically dispersed markets presents an opportunity for national distributors that support multiple areas effectively. Regional consolidated service centers may work in certain geographies, but Ascension Health Alliance is likely to continue to pressure large distributors to manage complexity. Gartner expects that the national leverage of IDNs such as Ascension Health Alliance will lead distributors to continue improving collaboration and to support standardization and visibility across the end-to-end value chain.




 

Recommendations







Life sciences manufacturers and service providers:







Prepare for another round of negotiations as Ascension Health Alliance aggregates demand and commits to a minimum volume of business. Calculate the value of committed volume contracts vs. broader traditional GPO contracts and structure the agreement accordingly.






Develop strategies to address the needs of a new breed of customer that commits to buying volumes across regions. Develop a more efficient end-to-end supply chain to serve these large, progressive customers profitably.






Use service, standardization and a focus on patient outcomes, along with lower end-to-end product and service costs, to drive comprehensive value for IDNs, such as Ascension Health Alliance.






Consider building an account-specific profit-and-loss statement to drive value beyond contract price for large IDN/GPO combinations that are increasing their reach.







Distributors:







Develop offerings in response to the expected increase in pressure from Ascension Health Alliance and other large IDNs with expanding sourcing capabilities for advanced relationships that support standardization, greater end-to-end visibility and lower delivered costs.






Build capabilities that balance service with delivered cost at the closest point of supply to patient care.







IDNs:







Consider leveraging the committed volume of powerhouses such as Ascension Health Alliance or other regional sourcing initiatives to help drive down costs.






If you are a large IDN with unique supply chain capabilities and brand recognition, consider using your supply chain strengths to create "marketable programs" for other IDNs as a revenue generator.
