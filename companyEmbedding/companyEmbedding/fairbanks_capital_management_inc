1. Confidence and Trust
Putting clients first has resulted in many of our founder’s client relationships lasting in excess of thirty years.  Relationships of such longevity are uncommon in this business.  Our policies and principles guide us in responsible and effective investment management, dealing honorably with our clients, protecting our clients in bad market periods, and acting to ensure that in times of rapid change, client assets are safe and growing.









2. Reliable Growth
Our long term track record is the direct result of our core practice of rigorous, bottom-up analysis.  We seek to build generational wealth via a conservative, value-driven strategy with limited tax exposure.  We believe in making long-term investments in companies with proprietary product franchises, and managements who act like shareholders: relentlessly seeking improvements in performance, profitability, and innovation.









3. Accessible and Accountable
We sincerely care about the prosperity of our clients.  For this reason we operate on a strictly independent basis, and in a transparent, unbiased manner.  All of our accounts are regularly reviewed, and our clients are warmly invited to call or visit anytime they have a question or concern.  Our investment practices have outlived market-cycles, and we do not make investments for clients which we would not make for ourselves.






















Fairbanks Capital Management, Inc.
FCMI is an independent, opportunistic, value-oriented yet growth-focused investment management company.  We operate strictly on a fee basis, creating concentrated client portfolios which, through rigorous, bottom-up analysis, consist of what we believe are high quality stocks and bonds held for the long-term.  Founded in December of 1995, we serve both institutional and private clients.  Clients of our founder, Steven L. Re’, CFA, formed the basis of our business; many of those clients have been, and continue to be clients of our business after over thirty years of service.

About Us

Fairbanks Capital Management, Inc. was founded in December of 1995 by Steven L. Ré, CFA.  Clients of Steven L. Ré, CFA, some of who have been with him for well in excess of 30 years, formed the base of our business.
Our clients include retirement plans, corporations, foundations, trusts, charities, private entities, families, individuals and IRA’s.  We are in business to opportunistically invest in both domestic and foreign growing companies, and high quality bonds for the long term.  Good long-term results that build retirement wealth and income can be obtained by buying excellent businesses with proprietary products, excess cash generation, strong financial positions, and healthy reinvestment of capital at rates of return above the cost of capital.
We seek out these companies from a number of different publicly available sources, analyze them internally and value them according to our proprietary financial criteria.  We frequently visit, or participate in conference calls with managements of companies in which we have interest.  Our ideal equity purchase is a company with an excellent long-term track record that is inexpensively priced due to being out of favor with investors.
We seek thereby to grow client net-worths as we protect clients from the long-term effects of inflation.  While we make no guarantees, we firmly believe that securities prices, over the long term, follow increases in the intrinsic value of their underlying businesses.  We further believe that the valuation methodology we employ determines the intrinsic value of a business accurately enough to make intelligent long-term investment decisions.
Our principal and founder Steven L. Ré, CFA’s investment management experience began 1975 when he worked in commercial banking for Lloyds Bank California.  He learned to protect investment capital in the much bleaker markets of the seventies and early eighties.  These experiences developed a style dedicated to the purchase of high quality companies which are leaders in their industries.  He has since followed the same investment practices and style for more than three decades.
In a world where conservative investment disciplines have become out of vogue, our memories keep us conservative.  We know that the ‘exuberance of markets’ are merely pleasant aberrations which will change someday, and that in times of change, often-careless speculators sustain permanent financial damage to both themselves, and their clients.  We work to assure that our clients are not included in this group.
Fairbanks Capital Management, Inc. is registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission as a Registered Investment Advisor.

Home / Investment Strategy / Fixed Income  








Fixed Income Strategy:
Fairbanks Capital Management, Inc. utilizes a unique, propriety strategy to obtain investment grade bonds for our clients.  Our fixed income investments are typically characterized by high coupons, moderate maturities, and varying degrees of tax exemption.  By seeking active call provisions, which shorten the duration and compress the dollar price of the bond, we achieve substantially increased yield to maturity in comparison to new issue bonds of comparable maturity.
We welcome you to contact us to discuss how our unique and proprietary approach to Fixed Income management can benefit your investment portfolio.

Minimizing Tax Exposure







Home / Investment Strategy / Minimizing Tax Exposure  







Minimizing Tax Exposure

Fairbanks Capital Management, Inc. utilizes a low turnover investment style that minimizes the taxation of gains in taxable accounts.
Avoiding High Turnover
For the taxable investor located in California, or a state with a similar tax regime, taxation can reduce returns by 25-45%.  Take the example of an actively managed equity mutual fund that earns a 15% return in a particular year.  If the fund has the high level of turnover common among today’s mutual funds, much of this return will be taxable.  If half of the realized gains are short-term, the combined federal and state tax penalty to the fund’s return could exceed 35%.  Thus, the rate of return to its investor is reduced, in reality, to about 10% after tax.  As an investor who is subject to taxation, the rate of return which one actually keeps is what really counts!
Required Distributions
A painful lesson some mutual fund investors have learned is that mutual funds must distribute any net realized gains, whether the fund made or lost money for the year.  Yes, a fund that loses money for the year may still sock its investors with a tax bill!
At FCMI, we are long term investors.  Our major positions are held for years.  Many positions we started building for our more seasoned clients have never been sold, allowing real cases where our basis is in the low single digits on stocks now selling over $50 per share.
Because of our consistent long-term strategy, the returns our investors earn are exposed to minimal taxation.  We do not force our investors to share their returns with the government.
