Avista was formed in 2005 by a cohesive team of experienced private equity professionals, who worked together at DLJ Merchant Banking Partners—which at the time was one of the world's largest and most successful investment firms. Avista's team of proven investment professionals is augmented by veteran Operating Executives with expertise in the Healthcare, Communications and Energy sectors.

Avista espouses a proven, well-developed Global Partnership Strategy – a strategy rooted in combining investment professionals with industry experts.

Avista Capital Partners approaches private equity investing based on a proven methodology derived from extensive experience and success—it was built through years of disciplined focus on generating value. 
Avista's strategy emphasizes more than merely "good buying." Our Investment Partners take an active role in supporting strong management teams and working with portfolio companies to develop strategic plans, enhance organic growth, pursue value-creating acquisitions and increase operational efficiencies. Additionally, our Operating Executives provide the strategic insight, operational oversight and counsel that help drive growth and performance, creating long-term value. 


Our Global Partnership Strategy
Avista’s Global Partnership Strategy utilizes the sector-specific expertise of its Investment Partners paired with that of Operating Executives to source, evaluate, oversee and manage portfolio companies. Most of Avista’s eight Operating Executives have worked with the Investment Partners for many years, including when they were at DLJMB.
We believe that the extensive networks of relationships developed by our investment team and Operating Executives are critical to Avista’s ability to source deals for each of the firm’s targeted industry sectors. 
Avista’s professionals have long recognized that a sponsor cannot only be a “good buyer” of companies to achieve success. To create long-term value, Avista utilizes a combination of private equity professionals and Operating Executives to create a cohesive team that blends financial sophistication, industry knowledge and business management skills. Avista has significant experience in assembling strong management teams and working with portfolio companies to develop strategic plans, enhance organic growth, pursue accretive acquisitions and increase operational efficiencies. Avista utilizes a proactive, hands-on and value-added approach. 
The Global Partnership Strategy helped make DLJ Merchant Banking Partners one of the most successful private equity franchises in the world, and remains the cornerstone of Avista.

Company[edit]
The firm, which is based in New York City, was founded in 2005 when a team of professionals, led by Thompson Dean and Steven Webster, completed a spinoff from Credit Suisse's private equity arm DLJ Merchant Banking Partners to form a new private equity firm. Dean had previously been the co-head of DLJMB.
Avista completed fundraising for its first $2 billion fund in 2007.[1][2] Avista closed on its second fund with $1.8 billion[3] of commitments, which represents only 60% of its original $3 billion target.[4]
Avista was formed one year after Larry Schloss left DLJ Merchant Banking Partners to found Diamond Castle Holdings, a middle-market focused private equity firm. Unlike Diamond Castle, Avista received support from Credit Suisse for its debut fund.[5]
The spinout of Diamond Castle and Avista from Credit Suisse First Boston came at the same time as the spinouts of private equity groups from other leading investment banks including: JPMorgan Chase (CCMP Capital), Citigroup (Court Square Capital Partners), Deutsche Bank (MidOcean Partners) and Morgan Stanley (Metalmark Capital).
In 2009, one of Avista's media acquisitions, the Minneapolis Star Tribune newspaper, the nation's 15th largest daily paper, fell into Chapter 11 bankruptcy.[6][7]
In 2011, Avista acquired DataBank Ltd. an enterprise-class managed data center based in Dallas, TX. The company is expected to open a new facility towards the end of 2012.
