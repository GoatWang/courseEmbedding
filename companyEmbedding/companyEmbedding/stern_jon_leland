This is a classic gem; Filled with A-List celebrities and yet most people have never even heard of it. The movie has similar plot to the film "The Hang-Over"; but has a twisted, sadistic,darkness that few other comedies can rival. If you  like actors such as John Favreau and Jeremy Piven, you'll be sure to love this!by shaun1521Jul 18, 2006Very Bad ThingsIt is a well designed movie with an interesting story. Maybe a little gory in parts. Then again maybe it is supposed to be. Any way it keeps my attention. What was so weird was they keep it in the realm of "this could really happen."

I have run into a few people like the part that Cameron played. I could see this years from now on something like Mystery science theater 3000, with lines like "she got hung up" and "he was stuck for the drinks."

For real, this was a chance for the people like Christian Slater to be their selves. If you do not think this is a good movie, try "8 Heads in a Duffel Bag" with (Joe Pesci, Andy Comeau, Kristy Swanson, Dyan Cannon, and George Hamilton). Alternatively, maybe "Eating Raoul" directed by Paul Bartel.by tammynpeterApr 09, 2007Comedy at it's darkestI bought this movie to replace one I loaned to a friend, which they gave back in unwatchable condition. This being my favorite movie, I HAD to replace it. I love the theme of this movie, a what comes around goes around, or Goosed!... A bachelor party goes astray, and instead of doing "the right thing" the gentlemen decide to handle things in a very bad way. Their behavior comes back to "get" them, including the bride, whos' top priority is the wedding. The soundtrack makes the movie. It reminds me that this is a comedy. If the music had been different it may have made this movie very dark, not humorous.by bccs-mountain-h...Jul 12, 2011AwesomeWhat a thriller, totally unexpected ending! Awesome The movie lived up to it;s title in every way. Twists at every turn and many scenes that lived up to the title in every way.           It would be tough to make a sequel for this one, get ready for a shocking movie that makes your jaw drop often. Never expected most of the scenes that played out throughtout the show.by adjiiiJul 24, 2011Very Bad Things. If you like dark comedies, you have to see this!This is my favorite movie of all time. I don't know what happened to my copy of it so I had to get another. I love the way the plot shoots off in a totally different direction than you think it's going to.Explore Buying GuidesHow to Choose the Right DVD Box Set for a PresentPublished By:ebaybuyingguidesWhat is DVD Format?Published By:ebaybuyingguidesYour Guide to 'The Big Bang Theory' Seasons on DVDPublished By:ebaybuyingguidesBest Selling in DVDs & Blu-ray DiscsTrending price is based on prices over last 90 days.Psych: The Complete Series (DVD, 2014, 31-Disc Set)TRENDING PRICE$53.99New$50.99UsedGame of Thrones: The Complete Seasons 1-6 (DVD, 2016)TRENDING PRICE$49.70New$34.95UsedKong: Skull Island (DVD)TRENDING PRICE$7.99New$7.95UsedThe Fate of the Furious (Blu-ray/DVD, Includes Digital Copy)TRENDING PRICE$14.99New$9.99UsedThe Fate of the Furious (DVD)TRENDING PRICE$8.97New$8.00UsedThe Boss Baby (DVD, 2017)TRENDING PRICE$7.99New$7.95UsedBeauty and the Beast (DVD)TRENDING PRICE$7.99New$7.15UsedSave on DVDs & Blu-ray DiscsTrending price is based on prices over last 90 days.Psych: The Complete Series Season 1 2 3 4 6 7 8 ( DVD, 2014, 31-Disc Set) $48.99Trending at $53.99The Fate of the Furious (Blu-ray/DVD + Digital HD) NEW/SEALED w slipcover$11.35Trending at $14.99Kong: Skull Island (3D/4KUHD/Blu-ray/DigitalHD) Best Buy Excl.
