Gray, William Henry (1843–1929)



	The late Mr. and Mrs. W. H. Gray, of 10 Wyrallah road, Lismore, who died within a few hours of each other on Tuesday, were buried in adjoining graves at the Methodist portion of the Lismore general cemetery yesterday afternoon. In the large and representative attendance at the funeral there was a tribute to the lives of two district pioneers and their sterling character.

	The pall bearers were: Messrs G. Mortimer, E. Johnston, J. J. Gray, N. C. Gray, E. Morrow, A. F. Gray, G. H. Gray, W. T. Gray, M. S. Gray, P. E. Gray, C. B. Gray and L. Gray.

	Messrs. W. Riley and Son, had charge of the obsequies.

	There was a large congregation at the graveside, an impressive service being conducted by Rev. A. F. Crapp, assisted by Rev. L. H. Rolph (Clunes).

	Prior to the funeral the Rev. A. F. Crapp conducted a service at the Methodist church, from which the cortege left for the cemetery. A favourite hymn of the late Mrs. Gray was sung, and in his address Rev. Crapp referred to the unique event of husband and wife of old age passing away within a few hours of each other. He spoke of their early association with the district as pioneers, and loyal membership of the Methodist Church. Years ago, the late Mr. and Mrs. Gray had extended hospitality to ministers of the Lismore circuit, and the late Mr. Gray occupied the position of circuit steward for some time this being the highest position a layman could be called to in the denomination.

	God had been with them throughout their lives said Rev. Crapp, and did not fail them in their old age and in the hour of death. Charles Wesley's lines "My people live well and they die well," were exemplified in the Christian character of Mr. and Mrs. Gray. Death had no terrors for them and just before the late Mrs. Gray died she sang her favourite hymn and both offered prayer before passing away.

	Rev. Crapp added that of the late Mr. and Mrs. W. H. Gray it could truly be said, "Now the labourers' task is o'er; now the battle day is past; now upon the farther Shore land the voyagers at last."

	Rev. R. J. Thomas (Sydney), an old friend of the family, who attended the golden and diamond wedding of the deceased, will conduct a memorial service at Lismore Methodist church on Sunday.

	Over one hundred wreaths were received from the following:—Sons and daughters, jointly, two wreaths, Willie Gray, Annie and family, George, Emma and family, Edward, Agnes and family, John, Addie and family, Henry, Laura and family, Tessie, Eva and family, Alfred, May and girlies, George, Jane and family, Walter, Alice and family, Percy, Amy and Earl, Jim, Alice and family, Maurice, Muriel and family, Charlie, Essie and family, Victor and Olive Mortimer, grandchildren at Meadow Bank, Charlie, Wallace and Ruby Bower, Louisa Morrow, Lilian Gray, Lydia Gray, Aunt Annie and cousins, Mr. and Mrs. J.

B. Miller (Wingewal), Mr. and Mrs. G. Miller (Sydney), Mr. and Mrs. R. Gray (Toowoomba), C. W. Craig (Kiama) (2), Lilian Morrow (Southport), W. C. Gray (Pomona).

	The late Mr. and Mrs. Gray were both natives of the South Coast, coming to the Richmond from Kiaina district. The late Mr. Gray's parents came from the north of Ireland in 1843, accompanied by three daughters. The late Mrs. Gray's parents, Mr. and Mrs. N. Craig, who were married just prior to sailing for Australia, came from Cornwall in 1838. The late Mr. and Mrs. Gray were married at "Orange Grove,'' the residence of the bride's parents at Kiama, on December 29, 1865, by the Rev. Angwin. For three years the late Mr. Gray was a member of Gerringong Muni- cipal Council, and for nearly 50 years he had been a Justice of the Peace. Forty years ago he and his wife came to the North Coast and settled at Cowlong, having then a family of eight sons and four daughters. Two sons were born after they came to the Richmond.

	The late Mr. Gray's name has been closely associated with the history of the dairying industry of the North Coast ever since its infancy. About 37 years ago he installed a butter making plant, primarily for his own use, although he also made it available to neighbours. It could almost be said he ran a butter factory for years. He joined Norco Ltd. and was a staunch supporter, being chairman for three years and a director for many years. The late Mr. and Mrs. Gray were loyal members of the Methodist Church, and the late Mr. Gray was superintendent of the Methodist Sunday school at Cowlong for 27 years, later occupying the position of circuit steward at Lismore. The late Mr. and Mrs. Gray celebrated their golden wedding at "Meadow Bank,'' Eltham on December 29, 1915, and their diamond wedding on the same date in 1925 at the Richmond Hall, Lismore.

	At the diamond wedding it was mentioned that the Gray family was represented by 13 sons and daughters, 14 sons-in-law and daughters-in-law, 70 grandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren, making a total of 129 descendants.

	Mrs. G. Mortimer (Mullumbimby), Mrs. E. Johnston (Pearce's Creek), Mrs. W. H. Morrow (Pearce's Creek), Mrs. J. Millar (Gerringong) are daughters; and Messrs. W. C. Gray (Pomona, Q.), N. C. Gray (Bonalbo), G.H. Gray (Parramatta), W. T. Gray (Lismore), M. S. Gray (Lismore), J. J. Gray (Eltham), A. P. Gray (Eltham), P. E. Gray (Eltham), C. B. Gray (Eltham) are sons.

	A son, Arthur, died about five years ago and Mrs. W. C. Gray, a daughter-in-law, recently died in Sydney.

Biographical notes:

Dr. William Henry Gray, a physician and lay missionary for the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, was born
                        on May 10, 1810. In 1836, he joined Marcus Whitman and Henry H. Spalding to travel overland and establish a mission for the
                        Indians of the Oregon Country. In 1837, Gray traveled east in order to obtain more recruits for the missions and returned
                        the following year with his new bride, Mary Augusta Dix Gray. William Gray was also instrumental in the formation of Oregon's
                        Provisional and Territorial governments.
                     
From the guide to the William Henry Gray Papers, 1835-1907, 1835-1846, (Oregon Historical Society Research Library)
Gray was born in Fairfield, NY, on September 8, 1810. In 1926, his father died and Gray became apprentice to a cabinetmaker
                        in Springfield, NY. He moved to Utica, NY at age 21. Though there are conflicting accounts as to Gray’s educational status,
                        most agree that he was informally trained in medicine and theology. During his medical training, he contracted an incurable
                        disease that left him with a weakened lung. In 1831, Gray joined the Presbyterian Church, in which his brother was a minister.
                        Later, Gray was appointed to the Oregon Mission of the American Board by his friend, Rev. Chauncey Eddy. In 1835, Gray was
                        offered a position with the Whitman party and left his fiancée in Utica to join the Whitmans and Spaldings who had already
                        traveled to Liberty, Missouri, where they gathered supplies. According to accounts from letters, Gray was the motivator in
                        the party and woke everyone up in the early morning to keep the team moving.
                     
Gray, the Spaldings, and the Whitmans arrived at Fort Walla Walla on Oct 2, 1836. It was assumed by Spaldings and the Whitmans
                        that Gray would conduct most of the manual labor, while the more educated men would conduct mission work. Gray, however, did
                        not stay long at the two mission sites and returned east in the spring with a party of four Nez Perce. According to accounts,
                        their party was captured by the Sioux; the guides were killed, and Gray was taken prisoner and removed to Canada. He was rescued
                        by members of the Hudson Bay Company. Upon his return to New York, he married Mary Augusta Dix and they returned west, leading
                        the Walker-Eels party in 1838.
                     
Gray was involved both politically and financially in the establishment of Oregon. Gray remained at the Whitman’s Waiilatpu
                        Mission for a time and then moved to Salem, Oregon, where he secured manual employment by building Willamette University.
                        Afterward, Gray moved to Klatsop Plains, just north of Astoria, and built the first Presbyterian Church west of the Rockies.
                        Gray served as the secretary of the Champoeg meetings, the provisional government in pre-state of Oregon. After the establishment
                        of an official government, he served as a member of the territorial legislature. Gray studied transportation engineering and
                        was on the vanguard of river travel. In 1858, he pioneered the Fraiser River in British Columbia with model boats and sloops.
                        From 1860-1861, Gray built a model boat, 91 feet long and 12 feet wide, and piloted it down the entire length of Okanogan
                        River to the Columbia River, where his journey ended near Celilo Falls.
                     
Gray and his family moved to the Dalles in 1864, where Gray build the steamer, Cesadilla. He spent his later life writing
                        the History of Oregon, and securing funds to erect a monument at Waiilatpu to honor Marcus and Narcissa Whitman. In addition,
                        he was involved in the Pioneer and Historical Society of Oregon, where he served as secretary for a number of years.
                     
His wife, Mary Augusta Dix Gray, died in 1881. Gray’s death followed in 1889. William H. and Mary Augusta Dix Gray were buried
                        at Klastop plains, and later their remains were moved to the memorial site of the Waiilitpu mission.

Obituary



            Henry "Hank" W. Gray, 56, of Clarksville, Iowa and formerly from Waverly, Iowa died suddenly in a construction accident, Monday, May 2, 2016 in Denver.

     Henry William Gray was born on August 16, 1959, the son of DW and Bessie (Hupp) Gray in Estherville, Iowa. The family moved to Waverly soon after when his father started his optometry practice. He was raised in Waverly and baptized at St.  Paul's Lutheran Church in 1975. Hank graduated from Waverly Shell Rock High School in 1977. He attended one year at Wentworth Military Academy in Missouri and then attended UNI, before starting his career in construction. From 1979 to 1988, he worked in the Dallas, Texas metro area on many projects including his favorite and the one he was most proud of, The Ross Perot EDS Cluster. He moved back to Waverly in 1988. He was well known for his excellent concrete work and worked for numerous construction firms in the area. He was currently employed at Snelling Construction of Tripoli the last 7 years. He was known to many as "Hank". He married the love of his life, Marilee Myers on February 18, 1989 at Trinity United Methodist Church in Waverly. He was a proud and loving father of their four sons. The couple raised their young family in Waverly, until 2005, when they all moved to an acreage near Clarksville, what Henry fondly referred to as "The Resort".

     Hank was a unique individual who truly enjoyed life to the fullest. He marveled at nature and the "beauty of it all". He enjoyed being outdoors, fishing and turtle hunting with his boys. He was very creative and built meticulous models in his spare time. He was a deep thinker who got a kick out of sending mass texts with his words of wisdom. He really enjoyed going to the boys sporting events, where he was often one of the loudest fans.

     Henry was a passionate man with a deep appreciation for music. He loved going to music events and playing tunes in the garage and around the patio fire with his family and friends. Most of all, Henry loved spending time with his family. He and his wife pondered many hopes and dreams for their son's futures and how they would spend their retirement years, which he looked forward to.

     Survivors are his loving wife, Marilee E. Gray of Clarksville, Iowa; his #1 son, Justis E. Gray (Rachael Meagher) of Richmond, Virginia, his #2 son, Hunter W. Gray (Katie Wedeking) of Clarksville, Iowa, his #3 son, Weston W. Gray of Cedar Falls, Iowa and his #4 son, Spencer H. Gray of Clarksville, Iowa; his mother, Bess Gray of Waverly, Iowa; two brothers, Barrett (Mary Jo) Gray of Spirit Lake, Iowa and Stuart (Diane) Gray of Waverly, Iowa; two sisters, Elizabeth Schellhorn of Granbury, Texas and Catherine (Andrew) Remley of Shell Rock, Iowa; sisters-in-law, Kathy (Marvin) Folkerts of Waverly, Iowa and Jeanie (Jon) Simpson of Cedar Falls, Iowa; brothers-in-law, Jeff (Bernita) Myers of Shell Rock and Wade (Nikki) Myers of Waverly, Iowa and so many nieces and nephews, cousins and friends that meant a lot to him, including some of his son's friends, Henry took under his wing, and a special nephew, Joseph Rosol of Windsor Heights, Iowa. He was preceded in death by his father, Dr. DW Gray, brother-in-law, Roger Schellhorn; father-in-law, Ellwood Myers; his mother-in-law, Bille Myers; sister-in-law, Janis Onstad and a special uncle, Ed Kabele.

     Funeral services will be held on Friday, May 6, 2016 at 10:30 am at the Kaiser-Corson Funeral Home in Waverly, Iowa with Pastor Val Swinton officiating. Private family burial will be in Harlington cemetery at a later date. Visitation will be held on Thursday from 4:00 pm until 8:00 pm at the Kaiser-Corson Funeral Home in Waverly, Iowa and also an hour prior to the service on Friday. Memorials may be directed to the Gray family for a later designation in Henry's name and online condolences for Hank may be left at www.kaisercorson.com.

Materials
Sterling SilverSterling silver is an alloy of silver containing 92.5% by mass of silver and usually 7.5% by mass of copper. The sterling silver standard has a minimum millesimal fineness of 925. The sterling alloy originated in continental Europe and was being used for commerce as early as the 12th century in the area that is now northern Germany. William Henry uses the latest state-of-the-art casting equipment to create mesmerizing pieces that are often considered par with our hand-carved work.Fossil Dinosaur boneDinosaur Bone is probably the most exotic of our fossil materials — the fossil comes from a 100 million year-old Apatosaurus. Found and sourced in Utah, dinosaur bone offers the possibility of owning one of the most ancient zoological testaments of the planet. The colors can vary from red to brown, black and green, depending on the minerals surrounding the bone as it became petrified.  
Here is a stunning 40lb specimen we shot here at the studio. Smoky QuartzSmoky quartz is a grey, translucent variety of quartz. It ranges in clarity from almost complete transparency to a brownish-gray crystal that is almost opaque.Smoky Quartz was known as a Stone of Power. To the ancient Druids, it was sacred and signified the potent dark power of Earth gods and goddesses.

Limited Edition B10 Gray Dawn Knife$1,250.00

(Pictures are of knife in inventory.)
The Lancet ‘Gray Dawn’ features a beautiful frame in etched ‘Brain Wave’ damascus by Chad Nichols, inlaid with a mesmerizing piece of fossil walrus ivory. The blade is black-coated, ‘Wave’ damascus with ZDP-189 core; the one-hand button lock and the thumb stud are set with ruby. The ‘Gray Dawn’ features some of the exotic materials and hand-forged metals that are the hallmark of William Henry’s collections; a distinctive personality statement to be worn and used for a lifetime.
Lancet Knives:
William Henry’s first design defines the quintessential gentleman’s folder in the modern world. Sleek, elegant, refined, and comfortable in the hand and to the eye. Like many of our designs, the Lancet offers maximum flexibility and utility – simply an exceptional fusion between a personality statement and an outstanding instrument, worthy of virtually any task or situation. Winner of multiple industry awards, in a variety of iterations over the years.
Each piece is engraved with two distinct numbers – a serial number on the blade and limited edition number on the leading edge of the handle. The numbers, along with the details about the knife’s construction, are listed in the included Certificate of Authenticity.
