DETROIT — The chief executive of General Motors, an automaker synonymous with Detroit, saw the future of driving not in the Motor City but on the streets of San Francisco.Mary T. Barra, a G.M. lifer who had worked her way from engineer to the top, was in the back seat of a prototype self-driving electric car as it wound its way through the city’s downtown a year ago.She wanted to see for herself whether automation was ready to take over from a driver — safely, and on a mass scale. How would it react, for example, when it reached an intersection as a light turned yellow?Driving in a situation like that, “you have to make a decision,” she recalled in a recent interview. “Generally if you decide to go, you decide to speed up. Or you stop.” If the technology works, she said, it will make the right decision: “The car knows.”

After that drive, Ms. Barra made her own decision to speed up, convinced that such cars were worth betting the company on. Within six months after what she called her “aha! moment” in San Francisco, a fleet of self-driving Chevrolet Bolts, the company’s new electric car, was being built at a G.M. assembly plant in Michigan, the pace accelerated at the direction of Ms. Barra and her senior management team.

It was a first for any major car company, and the first leg of a race she is determined to win. The question now is whether a company identified with the industry’s bygone glory days can be a trendsetter in 21st-century transportation — and beat out Silicon Valley rivals like Google, Tesla and Uber with no legacy business to encumber them.“The auto industry is on the cusp of significant change, and G.M. has to prove that a longtime established player can be up to the task,” said Michelle Krebs, a senior analyst with the car-shopping site Autotrader, who has followed the company since the 1980s. “If you look at their past performance, their record has been spotty at best.”General Motors is making a big wager that it can succeed, shedding overseas operations while investing $600 million this year in self-driving cars and other advanced technologies. It spent $1 billion on Cruise Automation, a Silicon Valley start-up that developed the driverless technology powering Ms. Barra’s ride in San Francisco.





 



It is a perilous challenge — balancing the demands of a global automotive business with an aggressive push into expensive high-tech models — that has already claimed victims. Last month, Ford Motor ousted its chief executive, Mark Fields, aiming to send a signal that it could keep pace.But G.M. is making a case that it can be a leader in the auto industry of both today and tomorrow. “We are very, very serious and intent on putting something on the road,” Ms. Barra said of the company’s automated vehicles. “We definitely want to be first.”Like its rivals, G.M. has ridden the economic recovery and low gas prices to record demand and profits. But it faces headwinds as sales flatten and new technologies increasingly cast a shadow over its traditional business. Tesla, the electric-car upstart, is now valued more highly than any Detroit automaker.In shaping its future, G.M. is betting on products that have yet to gain a foothold in the marketplace and could take years to develop fully.

It is doing so while enduring criticism from President Trump for building vehicles in Mexico and for laying off workers at home. At the same time, Ms. Barra has built a closer relationship with Mr. Trump than other auto executives have, serving on his business advisory panel and taking the lead for the industry in talks on fuel-economy rules.The company is also fending off a campaign by a dissident investor to create two classes of stock, aimed at increasing G.M.’s value to shareholders. One class would pay a steady dividend, while the other would appreciate based on the company’s growth. The fight will culminate on Tuesday at the annual shareholder meeting.In a letter to investors last week, the hedge fund that floated the dual-class proposal, Greenlight Capital, called G.M.’s board — including Ms. Barra, its chairwoman — “uninspired” for opposing its proposal. “After seven years of a flat stock price, how much longer must shareholders wait?” the letter said.While she agrees the company is undervalued, Ms. Barra insists that G.M.’s performance will ultimately pay off in better returns. “Does it frustrate me?” she said of the stock price. “Yes, but I want to do the right things over the long term to improve the business.”In beginning to assemble fully automated Bolts in January, G.M. was a step ahead of Google and Uber, which are converting mass-market minivans and sedans into driverless models. It went beyond what Tesla has achieved with autonomous controls on its own models. And it reflected the feverish competition underway.

                The Race for Self-Driving Cars            

                There are increasing signs that autonomous cars have arrived — and may be driving on our city streets sooner than we think.            








                    OPEN Graphic                




“We don’t go in to compete,” Ms. Barra said. “We don’t go in to have an entry. With every new product we’re doing, we are going in to win.”For Ms. Barra, 55, who took the helm at G.M. in 2014 as the first female chief executive of a major automaker, it is the latest chapter in the company’s long comeback.Eight years ago, G.M. was so deeply debt-ridden and burdened by high costs and faltering brands that some thought it would be left for dead. It was rescued through a government-engineered bankruptcy, only to find itself under fire over defective ignitions that were tied to 124 deaths.

Under Ms. Barra, the company weathered that crisis and is moving to become leaner and stronger. It is selling off its money-losing European division and unwinding its operations in other international markets like Australia, India and Russia. It has cut unprofitable sales of vehicles to rental fleets and reduced shifts and workers at some American factories that make slow-selling cars.

“G.M. used to constantly talk about where we were going to spend more money,” said Mark L. Reuss, the company’s executive vice president for product development. “What we were doing was robbing our good businesses to fix the broken ones.”As G.M. streamlines operations in the United States and elsewhere, it is redirecting energy and capital to its self-driving initiative.“I do believe General Motors is a tech company,” Ms. Barra said. “We put these products on the road that integrate 30,000 parts and have hundreds of millions of lines of code in them already. And we have to make them durable and work in all environments.”Its commitment is on display at a sprawling plant in Orion Township, Mich., about a 45-minute drive northwest of Detroit, where the company builds conventional subcompact cars as well as Bolts.One area of the factory is dedicated to a small-scale assembly line where workers customize Bolts with self-driving equipment, including a large computer in the trunk and modules packed with sensors on the roof and fenders.





 



“We’re on the cutting edge here,” said Bill Rock, a 22-year G.M. veteran who works on the autonomous vehicle line. “It’s a very complicated process, but it’s the direction the company needs to go.”G.M. has built about 140 autonomous Bolts to be used for testing in Arizona, California and Michigan by Cruise Automation, now a subsidiary. Kyle Vogt, a founder of Cruise, said G.M. had given its engineers a distinct advantage by building a state-of-the-art autonomous vehicle, rather than retrofitting a conventional car.“These vehicles coming off the assembly line have been built from the ground up,” he said. “That’s a real car, and not a mash-up of off-the-shelf parts that need to be integrated into the system.”

Ms. Barra’s view of what G.M. can accomplish was forged in her years as one of its first female plant managers. And she believes G.M. can lead the self-driving revolution without additional acquisitions or partners. “We have everything we need,” she said.Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, a business professor at Yale and a leadership expert who has known most of Ms. Barra’s predecessors dating back decades, is convinced of her resolve. “Mary is the right person at the right time, and she does it without an ounce of showmanship,” he said.The challenge of autonomous vehicles is hardly her first test as chief executive. Her baptism by fire came during the congressional hearings and government investigations surrounding the faulty ignition switch.Ms. Barra methodically directed the company to fix the defective parts, revamp its safety procedures, compensate accident victims and their families and negotiate settlements and fines with regulators and the Justice Department.She says the episode informed her approach to self-driving cars, which she believes herald a new era of road safety, and left her impatient for results. And she says she is determined for G.M. to lead the technological revolution changing the industry.“If anyone can,” she said, “why shouldn’t we be the ones to do it?”

What makes the CEO’s story all the more compelling is that she grew up in a middle-class GM family and wound up leading the world’s second-largest automaker.




If Mary Barra has any major faults, you won’t find them in a new book entitled “Road to Power” (Wiley & Sons, 143 pages, $29.95).
It’s not that the author, Bloomberg News reporter Laura Colby, didn’t try. However, the sources she interviewed and the articles she liberally cites, have almost nothing but praise for General Motors’ first female CEO.
The book’s subtitle is “How Mary Barra Shattered the Glass Ceiling.” But in charting Barra’s life from her birth as Mary Makela on Christmas Eve 1961 in suburban Waterford, MI, to her 39th-floor Renaissance Center office in the company’s Motor City headquarters overlooking the Detroit River, it turns out she didn’t so much as shatter glass as earn her way to the top as a brilliant engineer and a can-do manager and executive.
What makes her story all the more compelling is that she grew up in a middle-class GM family and wound up leading the world’s second-largest automaker. Her father was a journeyman die maker and member of the UAW union at GM’s Pontiac Motor Div. and her mother was a bookkeeper.
Colby writes about women in business for Bloomberg, and it’s clear that despite recent successes by numerous females in reaching the top at major corporations, she employs MLB-like stats to argue that much more needs to be done. That starts with the longstanding argument that women remain underpaid compared to men, that they still face formidable obstacles to getting ahead in their careers and that they face verbal abuse in the workplace from their male counterparts.
Anyone who has followed GM even marginally since its bankruptcy six years ago to its current faulty-ignition-switch dilemma, which reportedly has claimed more than 100 lives and caused hundreds of injuries, will find much familiar reading in the book.
To answer an immediate question: Colby found no evidence Barra knew of the switch problem, which traces back more than10 years. The switch failure turns off the ignition, eliminating power to the airbags and increasing steering and braking effort, which can cause drivers to lose control.
Should she have known, given her major engineering and product-development assignments? Not if GM was as insular and silo-oriented as Colby and others have underscored. The problem was traced to decisions made at lower levels and, from most accounts, never surfaced up the ladder until wrongful-death suits began piling up.
Colby’s book was published in March so it doesn’t include some later developments involving the faulty switches. Lawyers now are seeking depositions from former CEO Rick Wagoner, who was fired as part of the government bailout, and other high-ranking GM officials, including Barra.
Barra inherited the mess when she took over as CEO 18 months ago. Since then she has appeared before Congress, where she received low marks for providing stock answers to tough questions, Colby writes. But she also has been forceful, firing 15 and suspending others; setting up a $400 million fund for those killed or injured; meeting with survivor families; and naming a new safety czar to avoid future calamities.
Barra has been a high achiever starting in her high school days, Colby writes. She went on to attend the General Motors Institute (now Kettering University) in Flint, MI, where she earned a degree in electrical engineering in 1985, the same year she married Tony Barra, a fellow graduate engineer. They have two children, but Colby provides very few details about her personal life.
Barra began her GM career at the Pontiac plant building the Fiero small car, but within three years was off to Stanford University to pursue an MBA sponsored by GM, a clear sign she had been recognized as a “high potential” candidate.
From then on she moved up quickly. Although she rose through the engineering and manufacturing ranks, she was tapped in 1997 to report as an aide to then-CEO Jack Smith at GM headquarters. There she worked for both Smith and Vice Chairman Harry Pearce. “She stood out,” Pearce is quoted as saying. “Very easy to talk to, very engaging, not a big ego, real thirst for knowledge.”
Jack Smith’s strategy – he declined to be interviewed by Colby – was to give those destined for high jobs at GM an opportunity to gain experience “to understand the bigger picture,” Colby explains. Barra remained in the executive offices until 2001, the last two years as general director of internal communications – a stint that honed her already impressive skills in that vital area.
Barra shifted back to engineering and in 2003 she was named manager of the1985-vintage Detroit/Hamtramck plant with 3,400 employees, a major leap in her career. She had set her sights on running an assembly plant early on, and the post paved the way for higher things to come.
From 2004 to 2014 she moved on to a series of increasingly important jobs  in manufacturing engineering including head of global human resources during GM’s bankruptcy period (2009-2011).
Dan Akerson, one of two interim CEOs brought in from outside during GM’s post-bankruptcy period, in 2013 named Barra as executive vice president-global product development, purchasing and supply chain, deemed by some as GM’s No.2 job, putting her over 35,000 employees in 130 countries. And when he departed, Akerson chose Barra as his successor.
Comments about her personality and capabilities, universally favorable, from big names like Bob Lutz and Mark Reuss, are sprinkled throughout “Road to Power.” There also are some trifling errors any good editor would’ve caught.
Overall, however, it’s a quick read as the first full-length book about an exceptional woman as she battles to restore GM’s once-proud name while fighting daily headlines about those faulty switches.
I personally like one quote attributed to her: “No more crappy cars.” Amen, Ms. Barra.

DETROIT —  Her father was a die maker for 39 years, one of the legions of employees who performed the gritty tasks that made General Motors the nation’s largest and most powerful auto company.And ever since she was a child, Mary T. Barra aspired to join the family business and make her mark in the rugged, automobile industry. At 18, she did just that, entering a G.M. technical school to become an engineer.On Tuesday, Ms. Barra, 51, completed a remarkable personal odyssey when she was named as the next chief executive of G.M. — and the first woman to ascend to the top job at a major auto company.While she is the consummate insider who has spent 33 years with G.M., Ms. Barra is now charged with driving change at the automaker, which, just four years ago, went bankrupt and needed a $49.5 billion government bailout to survive.

But the selection of Ms. Barra (pronounced BAHR-ra) is a milestone in an industry long dominated by men, and a signal that the stodgy corporate culture at G.M. has changed forever.“This is truly the next chapter in G.M.’s recovery and turnaround history,” Ms. Barra told employees at a town-hall style meeting Tuesday at company headquarters in Detroit. “And I’m proud to be a part of it.”Ms. Barra brings extensive experience to her new position. She has been a rank-and-file engineer, a plant manager, the head of corporate human resources and, since 2011, the senior executive overseeing all of G.M.’s global product development.And she has, in the parlance of the Motor City, gasoline running through her veins. She and her husband, Tony, a management consultant whom she met at G.M.’s technical school, have owned several Chevrolet Camaros. And Ms. Barra can often be found on the company’s test track putting vehicles through their paces at high speeds.Mr. Akerson, who is retiring earlier than expected from G.M. because of his wife’s health problems, insisted that Ms. Barra was not chosen to make a statement about the need for diversity in the ultracompetitive auto industry.

She beat out some prominent candidates for the job, including Mark Reuss, the head of G.M.’s North American operations and the son of a former president of the company.“Mary was picked for her talent, not her gender,” Mr. Akerson said in a conference call with reporters.

But on a personal note, he said, promoting Ms. Barra to become chief executive was an emotional moment for him. “It was almost like watching your daughter graduate from college,” he said.He said that Ms. Barra “brought order to chaos” in G.M.’s vast product development organization, mostly by flattening its bureaucracy and cutting overlapping layers of executives. She was also in charge of reducing the number of expensive, global vehicle platforms, and bringing new models to market faster and at lower cost.During her tenure, G.M. has introduced competitive small cars like the Chevrolet Sonic and redesigned versions of its big-selling pickup trucks. Ms. Barra has also been a champion of more fuel-efficient engines and lighter-weight vehicles.G.M.’s announcement that Ms. Barra will take over as its chief executive in January came one day after the Treasury Department sold the last of the G.M. stock it took in exchange for the company’s government bailout.

Now G.M. can continue its comeback without the lingering, negative nickname of “Government Motors” — and under the leadership of a woman who has shattered the glass ceiling in the car business.Ms. Barra was not available for comment on Tuesday. One of the first women to serve as a G.M. vice president, Marina Whitman, said her selection was overdue in a company that rarely breached its tenets of conformity. “One of my greatest frustrations at G.M. was we were never able to persuade top management that the world was changing rapidly and they needed to change to keep up with it,” said Ms. Whitman, a University of Michigan business professor who worked at G.M. from 1979 to 1992.But because Ms. Barra has had such a stellar career at G.M., she now has an opportunity to accelerate its post-bankruptcy transformation.Ms. Barra is hardly a flamboyant figure at the company. She is known inside G.M. as a consensus builder who calls her staff together on a moment’s notice to brainstorm on pressing issues.

In a commencement speech last summer to students at her alma mater, the G.M.-sponsored Kettering University in Flint, Mich., she summarized her inclusive management style. “Problems don’t go away when you ignore them — they get bigger,” she said. “In my experience, it is much better to get the right people together, to make a plan, and to address every challenge head on.”One of her initiatives in the product-development job was to assign engineers to work in car dealerships to learn more about what customers want and need in their cars and trucks.“It’s the little things,” she said in November. “It’s the person who programs the Sonic windshield wiper who says, ‘Hmm, why don’t I turn this on when the rain sensor for the windshield senses it’s raining, when the person puts it in reverse?’ ”And while she has a low-key personality, Ms. Barra, the mother of two teenage children, is keenly competitive when it comes to beating rival automakers.“We’re not developing models to participate in a segment,” she told members of her team at a recent meeting. “We’re developing models to win in a segment.”Mr. Akerson lauded Ms. Barra for her management and product skills, but also said she had “an ability with people” that is critical to G.M.’s team-first approach.She will need those talents to lead other executives who lost out on the chief executive job, including Mr. Reuss, who will take over Ms. Barra’s product development duties, and Daniel Ammann, the chief financial officer who was promoted on Tuesday to be G.M.’s president.The G.M. board, however, did split the chairman and chief executive jobs that were both held by Mr. Akerson. The new chairman of the board will be Theodore M. Solso, a former head of Cummins, the engine manufacturer.

In the end, Ms. Barra’s biggest challenge is to continue to ensure improvements in G.M.’s product lineup. G.M. has overhauled many of its models since emerging from bankruptcy in 2009, but its American market share remains stuck at about 18 percent.

Other hurdles include fixing G.M.’s troubled European operations, and spurring more growth in China and Asia. And while G.M. has been profitable for 15 consecutive quarters, it still lags competitors like Toyota and Ford Motor in overall earnings.

Career & SuccessWrittenMary Barra: Simplify Bureaucracy, and Don’t Be Afraid To Job HopThe CEO of GM discusses leadership lessons and the future of self-driving cars.June 5, 2017|by

The product-development cycle at GM used to be measured in years; these days it works at “startup speed,” CEO Mary Barra says. | ToniBird Photography 

Running a 109-year-old automobile company in the age of software, ride sharing, and self-driving cars is the challenge faced by General Motors CEO and Chairwoman  Mary Barra. In the three-and-a-half years she’s steered the iconic carmaker, GM’s work force has entered a period of radical change. Nearly 40% of its salaried employees have been with the company fewer than five years, she says.
Barra’s company used to measure product development cycles in four- or five-year increments; now it’s learning to make changes in areas like its car-sharing program on a weekly basis, she says. Buying Cruise Automation — a developer of autonomous vehicle technology — last year adds more than new technology to GM; it also drives the whole company “to work at startup speed,” she recently told a group of Stanford Graduate School of Business students.

Life is too short to work for a company or be in a position that you don't love.Mary Barra
Although she’s one of the most powerful women in the business world and believes that diversity is critical to the success of GM, Barra sees herself as a champion of both men and women. “When you solve issues for women, you solve issues for everyone, because a lot of the time men have the same issues,” she says.
During a View From The Top appearance on May 4, Barra, who earned her MBA from Stanford GSB in 1990, spoke about the future of the auto business and her thoughts on managing a global organization in a period of rapid technological and social change.
How To Handle a Crisis
Shortly after becoming CEO, Barra was faced with a major crisis: Faulty ignition switches in some GM cars were causing serious, even fatal, accidents. In managing the situation, Barra says, “We were guided by three principles: doing the right thing for the customer, being transparent, and doing everything in our power to make sure it never happened again.” Although it’s important to answer questions as soon as possible, “you can’t answer questions you don’t know the answer to,” says Barra.
Enabling a Turnaround
Before she became CEO, Barra was part of GM’s senior leadership team and had been working to bring the company, founded in 1908, into the digital age. Her priorities included simplifying the company and eliminating bureaucracy. “If you believe that most people come to work every day and want to do a good job, then what's getting in their way? Do we have an environment, a collaborative environment, and the tools that are necessary so they can do their best work? Or is it painful to get the most simple task done?” she says.
Job-Hopping Is OK
Barra has worked at GM for 37 years, but she doesn’t believe that a long tenure at a company necessarily makes a potential hire a good one, nor does she think job-hopping is necessarily a negative.
People often leave jobs for good reasons, she says. “Life is too short to work for a company or be in a position that you don't love.” But if someone has held numerous positions in a short period of time, Barra says she might want to drill down to see if there’s an underlying issue that prompted the departures. Ultimately though, Barra adds, the issue isn’t long tenure versus short tenure. “It's really about the skills and abilities and experiences that they bring and the leadership that they bring.”
Learn How To Be Negative
Giving positive feedback is easy, but managers must learn how to be critical as well, Barra says. At GM, the senior leadership team has several off-sites a year where they learn how to give each other negative feedback that is also constructive. They can have a direct conversation where “I don’t agree with you and it’s not personal,” Barra says.
Self-Driving Cars Will Remain Rare for Years
An autonomous vehicle needs to be aware of exactly where it is, what’s happening around it, and what is the safest and most efficient route to take, says Barra. A key enabling factor is vehicle-to-vehicle communication. Although some of that capability can be added to existing cars — replacing the nation’s entire fleet of some 240 million conventional vehicles adds up to “a long journey” since only about 17.5 million new cars are sold in the U.S. each year, she says.

By Jim Tankersley


Mary Barra was about 10 when she first fell in love with a car. It was a red Chevy Camaro convertible, late-'60s vintage, driven by her older cousin. When Barra describes it, her brown eyes widen and her cheeks flush just a touch. "It was just a beautiful, beautiful vehicle," she says at her office high in the tower that houses General Motors' corporate headquarters. "The first vehicle where I went, 'Wow, that is cool.'"
When the time came to buy herself a set of wheels, Barra still had muscle on her mind. She plunked down a deposit on a Pontiac Firebird, the iconic hot rod of the late 1970s. But at the last moment she blinked. Bound for college, watching her budget, she bought a Chevrolet Chevette, an affordable, boxy hatchback that the automaker marketed by emphasizing its legroom and trunk space. Promotional films from the time show the car struggling to stay on four wheels as it rattles around corners at suburban speeds. She still thinks about that Firebird.
Today, Barra's job—and her storied employer's fate—boils down to making sure no car buyer ever wrestles with that kind of tradeoff again.
Barra, MBA '90, took the wheel in February as GM's senior vice president for global product development—and became the highest-ranking woman in the automotive industry. In charge of engineering, design and quality control for the world's second-largest automaker (after Toyota), she has arrived just in time to lead GM's product line into a very uncertain future.
As the world warms and oil prices roller-coaster upward, automakers face the biggest overhaul of their industry since the birth of the assembly line. We don't know what exactly the cars of the coming decades will look like: They could plug into wall sockets, or guzzle advanced biofuels, or run on hydrogen fuel cells or even liquefied sunlight. But in the increasingly globalized auto market, we know consumers aren't likely to buy any vehicle that doesn't deliver style and performance commensurate with its greener engine. If GM wants to keep making and selling cars, it must find a way to combine the practicality that drove Mary Barra into a Chevette with the swoon she got from her cousin's Camaro.
Barra understands the depth of the challenge. "Whatever happens, it's going to be a more fuel-efficient vehicle in 5, 10, 15 years," she says. "My goal is to make sure we do that with a suite of products for customers based on their needs and wants." Later, she adds, "We're going to have beautiful, innovative designs. We're going to put the right technology on the vehicle by [consumer] segment, the way the customer wants it. We're going to have the right quality and the right performance features. Repeating that process—it's as simple as that and as hard as that."
Detroit automakers owe much of their high-profile woes over the past few decades to an inability to fit together those pieces—quality, performance, efficiency, technology. Barra has seen the struggles firsthand. She grew up in Waterford, Mich., where her father worked 39 years as a GM die maker. That oh-so-practical Chevette took her to General Motors Institute (since renamed Kettering University) in Flint, Mich., an engineering and management school that served as a sort of ROTC for GM. She earned an electrical engineering degree there, interning at the plant that produced the sporty Pontiac Fiero.
When she started at the plant, GM and its Big Three brethren were bleeding market share to Japanese competitors such as Honda and Toyota, whose cars American consumers had come to regard as more reliable and affordable. The focus on the Fiero line was quality: reducing defects, rebuilding public trust. Barra showed her faith by ditching the Chevette for a black Fiero her senior year.
In 1988, a GM fellowship took Barra to Stanford to earn an MBA. She would go on to rise through the management ranks, running engineering divisions and managing an assembly plant. GM turned out increasingly reliable cars, earned higher quality ratings and slowly, but surely, won back consumer confidence. Still, its market share eroded. By the early 2000s, GM was suffering under the weight of a cost structure—wages, pensions, health-care costs—that made a standard GM vehicle thousands of dollars more expensive to produce than a foreign competitor's.
To bridge the gap, GM and other domestic automakers stripped many cars of pricey features such as plush interiors or advanced electronics—which only served to devalue the vehicles in customers' eyes. They also chased the higher profit margins in manufacturing trucks and large sport utility vehicles that got miserable gas mileage. Spiking oil prices in 2006-07 caught Detroit flat-footed. The 2008 financial crisis pushed GM and Chrysler into bankruptcy.
Barra tries not to dwell on the dark days before and after GM filed Chapter 11—a period the company's employees, from hourly workers to top executives, discuss in graveyard-whistling tones. Like so many others at the downtown Detroit headquarters, she worked for days at a time, with little sleep. "It was a very difficult, and very humbling, time," Barra says. But she says she never doubted the company would survive. "We're going to get through," she says she kept thinking. "We're going to make it through."
GM was saved only by billions of dollars in federal bailout funds. The government-approved leadership tapped Barra in July 2009 to run the humbled company's human resources division. Then in January 2011, CEO Daniel Akerson named her head of global product development. The job placed Barra one step below Akerson on the GM corporate ladder, one of the top seven executives in the company. She oversees more than 30,000 employees worldwide, and her day-to-day huddles with designers and engineers determine which vehicles make it to the assembly line.
Barra began her tenure with a tailwind of sorts—or as much of one as anyone has had at GM in years. The company had shrugged off much of the weight of its uncompetitive cost structure, largely through financial concessions won in emerging from bankruptcy and from closing or selling off product lines such as Saturn and Hummer. It was starting to rake in profits again. Perhaps most important for its long-term viability, GM, like its domestic rivals, was finally catching up to foreign automakers in addressing the Chevette/Firebird dilemma.
For a long time, consumers of American cars could get a really sexy vehicle or a really practical one, but they rarely got one that was both. And if there's anything American consumers want, it's everything, in one package. Maybe the best example is in the truck market. Pickups, led by the Ford F-150 and the Chevy Silverado, top the list of America's best-selling vehicles. These truck buyers are not hauling beams to construction sites. Most buyers are suburbanites who just like to tow a boat on the weekend or flip down the tailgate outside the football stadium. They want the power, the performance, the cool, of a pickup.
Ever since gas cracked $4 per gallon, industry research shows, truck buyers have clamored for vastly improved fuel economy—without sacrificing anything else. Ford has pushed hard to respond, retooling its pickups with smaller, more efficient engines that deliver the same power as a roaring V-8. (In F-150 ads that run during TV football games, guys' guy actor Denis Leary brags about towing capacity and mpg in the same breath.)
To combine performance and mileage in smaller cars, GM recently introduced the Chevrolet Cruze, a sleek little head-turner aimed at young buyers that was the bestselling car in America in June. The bigger test—for the company and for Barra—will be the relaunch of the Silverado and the rest of GM's truck and SUV line. Complicating matters is the volatility of gasoline prices, which are trending up but have bounced from as low as $1.67 per gallon to as high as $4 per gallon in the past two years.
"They've got great small vehicles" at GM, says Dave Cole, chairman emeritus of the independent Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich. "That's not going to be a problem. But to be successful in this environment, to bet on a future high energy price, you've got to hit your bet, which means you've got to have products that work whatever the energy price is."
There's another balance the firm must strike. GM increasingly needs to roll out products that work across emerging markets as well as traditional ones. The more the company can use common platforms for cars around the world—which is to say, build and sell the same cars in Beijing and Detroit—the more it can capture economies of scale and save money. Problem is, buyers in China differ widely from buyers in Michigan, in terms of how far they drive, what features they crave and how much they can spend on a vehicle. "The way somebody drives in India is very different than the way somebody drives in the United States," Barra says, but she has to build for both, with as much overlap as possible.
Asia looms as GM's most important market over the next decade. China and India are home to droves of prospective first-time car owners—young people who are rising out of poverty and into a middle-class lifestyle that includes a vehicle. The Scotiabank Group forecasts Chinese consumers will buy more than 25 million cars and trucks in 2025, up from 10 million this year. Vehicle sales doubled over the past five years in India to 2 million units, Scotiabank says, and are expected to double again by the end of the decade.
Competition for this business will be fierce—especially from Indian automakers who, thanks to labor and production costs well below Detroit's, are turning out starter cars that cost a few thousand dollars. (In contrast, GM's new Michigan-made subcompact, the Sonic, which incorporates several shop-floor and pay-scale innovations to minimize cost, retails for about $14,000 in the United States.)
To handle such challenges in the past, GM relied on the legendary instincts of Bob Lutz, its longtime, design-savvy product chief, now retired. In his book, Car Guys vs. Bean Counters: The Battle for the Soul of American Business, Lutz writes about his from-the-gut leadership style, noting that he may have inadvertently set up GM for struggles after his retirement, because he relied so much "on my own will and my considerable influence."
GM executives and outside analysts say Barra's approach is diametrically different, one that relies on team-building and seeks consensus. She holds "hall meetings" to solicit advice on project direction. She challenges engineers and designers to rethink their assumptions. Lutz's motto was "Often wrong, never in doubt." Barra's might be: "Let's all figure this out together."
"Mary is trying to bring order to the business," says John Calabrese, GM's vice president of global vehicle engineering, who has worked with Barra in different capacities for 12 years. "She's very methodical, very logical, very fair. She challenges the status quo pretty well. She's provocative. . . . She's an outstanding listener. And I guess she kind of has a consensus approach, but when it's not coming together, she gets concise and she's pretty decisive."
Barra cultivates that image in the course of an interview in Detroit for this article. She deflects questions about her vision for the future of GM's product line. Asked what imprint she hopes to leave on the company—what we'll say a Mary Barra-era vehicle looks like—she demurs and talks about her team.
"My job is to keep with the technology advancement so that the consumers are able to choose," she says. "I want them to be able to choose what they drive because there's such a connection of how people pick vehicles, of what they like. So if we as a company have the right technology that allows us to deliver the fuel economy that is, I think, where the world is going, yet still offer a range of size and products to meet people's needs and wants, that's how we win."
Barra has no hesitation ticking off a list of challenges GM—and every carmaker—must confront. Automakers must develop and master advanced propulsion systems, including electric-powered cars and trucks that can drive hundreds of miles without a charge and deliver handling and brawn on par with traditional gasoline engines. Engineers will need to safely integrate smart technology for drivers and "infotainment" for passengers. "The experience in the front seat is very different than the experience in the back seat," Barra says. "We have to understand that."
Colleagues say Barra's understanding flows from her long and varied career at GM. In person, though, it's hard to shake the idea that her approach to the job started with her cousin's red convertible —that she is, at heart, a car girl.
She has arrived for the interview in a black pantsuit, her blouse open at the neck. At 9 a.m., she sips a Diet Coke from the can. Her smile is as warm and friendly as, well, a Camaro, which, incidentally, is not her day-to-day car these days. That would be a Cadillac Escalade, a status-symbol favorite of pro athletes, that Barra chose largely for its carrying capacity; her 14-year-old son was until recently a hockey goalie, a job that comes with a lot of gear.
Barra seldom has time to take the Escalade out for a cruise, but she often looks forward to her 35-minute commute. Really. "There's days when, after a long day of work," she says, "you get into your car, and you're like, this is fun. I get to drive this home." At least once a week, she takes a vehicle in development out for a spin on a GM test track.
Thanks to her son and her 12-year-old daughter, Barra has been thinking lately about the challenge of designing cars for what's been dubbed the millennial generation. These consumers—the children of Baby Boomers—often have lived a life without tradeoffs. Even more than their parents, they're not going to stomach the idea of sacrificing performance for economy. They're going to drive cars that, under proposed federal fuel regulations, will average 54.4 mpg, and they will expect those cars to corner well, go zero to 60 in a few ticks and incorporate all their favorite electronic toys. If Detroit won't sell them that, some foreign competitor will.
Like their mother, Barra's children pine, romantically, for their first vehicles. Her daughter is saving up for a Chevy Equinox SUV. Her son has been drawing cars since he was 3. Recently, Barra's husband ordered a new car. (Surprise! It was a Camaro.) Mother and father noticed the teenager doing some calculations in his head. Hey, Dad, he said, how about we get it in orange? "We had to tell him," Barra says, "the odds of you having the Camaro when you're 16 probably are pretty small."
Take heart, kid: You can get a used Chevette these days for a song. Check out that trunk space!

Mary Barra

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Mary Teresa Barra (née Makela; born December 24, 1961) is the Chief Executive Officer and Chairperson of the General Motors Company. She has held the CEO position since January 15, 2014, and she is the first female CEO of a major global automaker.[1][2] On December 10, 2013, GM named her to succeed Dan Akerson as Chief Executive Officer, and prior to that, Barra served as the Executive Vice President of Global Product Development, Purchasing and Supply Chain at General Motors.[1][2]

Early life[edit]
Barra was born in Royal Oak, Michigan. Her father, Ray Makela, worked as a die maker at Pontiac for 39 years. [3] Barra's parents are of Finnish descent.[4][5] Barra attended Waterford schools in Waterford, Michigan. She is a graduate of Waterford Mott High School.
Education[edit]
Barra graduated from the General Motors Institute (now Kettering University), where she obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering. She then attended Stanford Graduate School of Business on a GM fellowship, receiving her Masters in Business Administration degree in 1990.[6]
Career[edit]
Barra started working for General Motors at the age of 18[7] as a co-op student in 1980 and subsequently held a variety of engineering and administrative positions, including being the manager of the Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly plant.[6]
In February 2008, she became Vice President of Global Manufacturing Engineering. In July 2009 she advanced to the position of Vice President of Global Human Resources, which she held until February 2011, when she was named Executive Vice President of Global Product Development.[6][8] The latter position included responsibilities for design; she has worked to reduce the number of automobile platforms in GM.[1] In August 2013, her Vice President responsibility was extended to include Global Purchasing and Supply Chain.[9]
During her first year as CEO, General Motors was forced to issue 84 safety recalls involving over 30 million cars.[10] Barra was called before the Senate to testify about the recalls and deaths attributed to the faulty ignition switch.[11] Barra and General Motors also came under suspicion of paying for awards to burnish the CEO and corporation's image during that time.[12]
Awards and honors[edit]
Barra was listed as one of the world's most powerful women by Forbes, for the fifth time, in 2016. She was most recently listed as the fifth Most Powerful Women, rising from 35th in 2013.[13]
On May 3, 2014, she delivered the Spring Commencement address for University of Michigan's Ann Arbor campus at Michigan Stadium. She received an honorary degree.[14]
Barra was listed number 1 in Fortune's Most Powerful Women list in 2015, moving from second place the year before.[15]

Early life[edit]
Barra was born in Royal Oak, Michigan. Her father, Ray Makela, worked as a die maker at Pontiac for 39 years. [3] Barra's parents are of Finnish descent.[4][5] Barra attended Waterford schools in Waterford, Michigan. She is a graduate of Waterford Mott High School.
Education[edit]
Barra graduated from the General Motors Institute (now Kettering University), where she obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering. She then attended Stanford Graduate School of Business on a GM fellowship, receiving her Masters in Business Administration degree in 1990.[6]
Career[edit]
Barra started working for General Motors at the age of 18[7] as a co-op student in 1980 and subsequently held a variety of engineering and administrative positions, including being the manager of the Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly plant.[6]
In February 2008, she became Vice President of Global Manufacturing Engineering. In July 2009 she advanced to the position of Vice President of Global Human Resources, which she held until February 2011, when she was named Executive Vice President of Global Product Development.[6][8] The latter position included responsibilities for design; she has worked to reduce the number of automobile platforms in GM.[1] In August 2013, her Vice President responsibility was extended to include Global Purchasing and Supply Chain.[9]
During her first year as CEO, General Motors was forced to issue 84 safety recalls involving over 30 million cars.[10] Barra was called before the Senate to testify about the recalls and deaths attributed to the faulty ignition switch.[11] Barra and General Motors also came under suspicion of paying for awards to burnish the CEO and corporation's image during that time.[12]
Awards and honors[edit]
Barra was listed as one of the world's most powerful women by Forbes, for the fifth time, in 2016. She was most recently listed as the fifth Most Powerful Women, rising from 35th in 2013.[13]
On May 3, 2014, she delivered the Spring Commencement address for University of Michigan's Ann Arbor campus at Michigan Stadium. She received an honorary degree.[14]
Barra was listed number 1 in Fortune's Most Powerful Women list in 2015, moving from second place the year before.[15]

Mary Barra - Wikipedia





















 






Mary Barra

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Mary Teresa Barra (née Makela; born December 24, 1961) is the Chief Executive Officer and Chairperson of the General Motors Company. She has held the CEO position since January 15, 2014, and she is the first female CEO of a major global automaker.[1][2] On December 10, 2013, GM named her to succeed Dan Akerson as Chief Executive Officer, and prior to that, Barra served as the Executive Vice President of Global Product Development, Purchasing and Supply Chain at General Motors.[1][2]

Early life[edit]
Barra was born in Royal Oak, Michigan. Her father, Ray Makela, worked as a die maker at Pontiac for 39 years. [3] Barra's parents are of Finnish descent.[4][5] Barra attended Waterford schools in Waterford, Michigan. She is a graduate of Waterford Mott High School.
Education[edit]
Barra graduated from the General Motors Institute (now Kettering University), where she obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering. She then attended Stanford Graduate School of Business on a GM fellowship, receiving her Masters in Business Administration degree in 1990.[6]
Career[edit]
Barra started working for General Motors at the age of 18[7] as a co-op student in 1980 and subsequently held a variety of engineering and administrative positions, including being the manager of the Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly plant.[6]
In February 2008, she became Vice President of Global Manufacturing Engineering. In July 2009 she advanced to the position of Vice President of Global Human Resources, which she held until February 2011, when she was named Executive Vice President of Global Product Development.[6][8] The latter position included responsibilities for design; she has worked to reduce the number of automobile platforms in GM.[1] In August 2013, her Vice President responsibility was extended to include Global Purchasing and Supply Chain.[9]
During her first year as CEO, General Motors was forced to issue 84 safety recalls involving over 30 million cars.[10] Barra was called before the Senate to testify about the recalls and deaths attributed to the faulty ignition switch.[11] Barra and General Motors also came under suspicion of paying for awards to burnish the CEO and corporation's image during that time.[12]
Awards and honors[edit]
Barra was listed as one of the world's most powerful women by Forbes, for the fifth time, in 2016. She was most recently listed as the fifth Most Powerful Women, rising from 35th in 2013.[13]
On May 3, 2014, she delivered the Spring Commencement address for University of Michigan's Ann Arbor campus at Michigan Stadium. She received an honorary degree.[14]
Barra was listed number 1 in Fortune's Most Powerful Women list in 2015, moving from second place the year before.[15]

In April 2014, Barra was featured on the cover of Time's "100 Most Influential People in the World."[19]
In December 2016, Barra joined a business forum assembled by then President-Elect Trump to provide strategic and policy advice on economic issues.[20]
Personal life[edit]
Barra is married to consultant Tony Barra, whom she met while studying at Kettering University, and has two children.[1] The family lives in Northville, a suburb of Detroit.[21] She has named the Chevrolet Camaro and the Pontiac Firebird as her favorite cars.[7]
Barra is a member of the General Dynamics Board of Directors. She serves on the Board of Directors of the Detroit Economic Club and as a member of The Business Council. She is also a member of the Stanford University Board of Trustees, the Stanford Graduate School of Business Advisory Council and the Board of Trustees for the Detroit Country Day School.[22]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

I never want to get a job because I'm female. I want to get it because I earned it and I deserve it... Whether my hair is going to be blue or purple, people should be judged on how well they do the job and deliver results and whether they do it the right way. That's how I like to be judged; most people are like that.
Mary Barra


Job,
Blue,
Hair



















If you do every job like you're going to do it for the rest of your life, that's when you get noticed.
Mary Barra


Life,
Job,
Rest
























The biggest message I have for young women is, Don't start cutting off branches of your career tree unnecessarily early. Sometimes women say, I know I want to have a family or play in the local symphony, and they start pulling themselves out of their career path. You don't have to take yourself out of the running before you even start.
Mary Barra


Family,
Women,
Path



















Our goal is to make General Motors the most valuable automotive company. Clearly, that is having sustainable profitability and driving great returns for our shareholders.
Mary Barra


Great,
Goal,
Driving



















My definition of 'innovative' is providing value to the customer.
Mary Barra


Value,
Customer,
Providing



















My parents were both born and raised in the Depression. They instilled great values about integrity and the importance of hard work, and I've taken that with me to every job.
Mary Barra


Work,
Hard Work,
Integrity



















What I always say is, 'Do every job you're in like you're going to do it for the rest of your life, and demonstrate that ownership of it.'
Mary Barra


Life,
Job,
Rest



















I started at General Motors at 18 years old as a co-op student at the General Motors Institute, which is now Kettering.
Mary Barra


Student,
Now,
Old



















My goal is for General Motors to lead in safe autonomous driving.
Mary Barra


Goal,
Driving,
Lead
























The key with autonomous is the whole ecosystem. One of the keys to having truly fully autonomous is vehicles talking to each other.
Mary Barra


Key,
Talking,
Ecosystem



















It's a marathon, not a sprint. I actually feel like I come to work stronger when I've had a little time on the weekend to step away from it and enjoy my family and other things. I come back energized. If people think they're going to work 24/7, week in and week out, they're not bringing their full strength to the table.
Mary Barra


Work,
Family,
Strength



















When you look at the truck market in North America, you have to understand the customer, and that's one of the things I think General Motors does really well. There's a big population that buys our trucks. It's their life - or it's their livelihood. Not their lifestyle, their livelihood. It's a work truck.
Mary Barra


Life,
Work,
America



















I know we're all addicted to our smartphones, and I'll say, if I forget my smartphone, I go home and get it. And so understanding how to integrate that technology into the driving experience, both the front seat and the passenger seat and the back seat, I think is very important.
Mary Barra


Home,
Technology,
Experience



















My first job at General Motors was as a quality inspector on the assembly line. I was checking fits between hoods and fenders. I had a little scale and clipboard. At one point, I was probably examining 60 jobs an hour during an eight-hour shift. A job like that teaches you to value all the people who do a job like that.
Mary Barra


Quality,
Job,
Value



















My advice on firing is simple: Treat that person the same way you'd want to be treated if you were in that situation. They're still a good person, just not the right fit. So how do you help them move on in a productive way that allows them to maintain their dignity?
Mary Barra


Good,
Simple,
Good Person
























A car is thirty thousand parts you're putting together.
Mary Barra


Car,
Together,
You



















I'm a big believer of work/life balance. You need a little down time to recharge to make sure that when you're here, you're really all here. I still have a child in high school, so I go to her sporting events, even if it means leaving work and working again when I get home. I probably should work out a little more than I do.
Mary Barra


Work,
Time,
Home



















My senior leadership team is half people who have been at GM for a long period of time like me, and others who have joined the company within the last five years from different industries, experiences, and countries. You have a better picture of the world. The diversity of thought is where you can make better business decisions.
Mary Barra


Leadership,
Business,
Time



















Lyft is focused on the customer - the driver - as GM is. I've talked many times about our goal being, 'How we can put the customer at the center of what we do so we earn customers for life?' It's a very common goal of putting the customer first.
Mary Barra


Life,
Goal,
Customer



















One of our most promising technologies is Super Cruise, which is the working name for an innovative system coming to Cadillac in the 2016 time frame. It will allow you to drive on the highway without touching the wheel or pedals, both at speed and in stop-and-go driving.
Mary Barra


Time,
Name,
Working



















I have worked for a lot of really great leaders and mentors that I felt provided me, along with many of my peers - many of them women - opportunities.
Mary Barra


Women,
Great,
Opportunities



















My father was a die maker for 39 years, so I had a basic understanding of the automobile industry and what the manufacturing world was like, just from the opportunity to spend time with him - just talking, because he was a car buff.
Mary Barra


Time,
Father,
Car
























When I am there at our global product development centers, I am meeting with the design team and reviewing design work being done there and meeting with engineers responsible for work being done specific to that region, meeting with purchasing team.
Mary Barra


Work,
Team,
Design



















When you look at the Chevrolet Volt, those customers are some of the most satisfied across the industry.
Mary Barra


Look,
You,
Satisfied



















It was great to go to Stanford. Until that point, I'd spent my whole life in southeast Michigan, working for General Motors. I was in a different part of the country. People didn't know what General Motors was, didn't care, or if they did, they might not have had a favorable impression. I saw people driving nondomestic vehicles.
Mary Barra


Life,
Great,
Care



















Super Cruise will follow the lanes of the road, follow the speed you set, and you can be hands-off driving on an expressway.
Mary Barra


Road,
Driving,
Speed
