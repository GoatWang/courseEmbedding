 "RiverSource is not interested in you nor your family's welfare or concerns. All they want is your money... and once they have it they will delay, impede, and keep your money no matter the documents you're requested to send or any other information which other reputable companies will honor. DON'T USE THIS COMPANY... THEY ARE A SCAM" Commented on 2017-07-07 22:04:09 EST  "I chose to relocate an inherited IRA rather than leave it with RiverSource before I read these reviews cant get away from them fast enough. Like the other trustees mentioned, RiverSource was not helpful when it came to moving funds to another investment company. The medallion signature on my form was not honored, the letter of acceptance from the receiving firm was provided but ignored or overlooked, an account number for the transfer was provided, letters of instructions were requested even though instructions were indicated on their own forms, the form they sent was not sufficient so a new form package was sent to be filled out....that is the Readers Digest version of my experience. Hard to believe the request letters for additional information are not automatically generated monthly just to stall the process. You do not have a dedicated processing agent to handle your claim call the 800 number and good luck. The poor rep on the other end of the phone has no control to help you they only repeat the problem the claims department reports. They can see the history we are starting our 6th month now and confirm the documents have been received. Will update this if possible.  Do not let your financial planner put your funds in this scary place." Commented on 2017-04-04 16:04:12 EST "Aboslutely HORRIBLE. UNTRUSTWORTHY and SHADY. They ask for original documents - NO trustworthy company EVER asks for Originals - and then they LOSE them. I believe this is a scam to prevent them paying any claim or they are just very negligent. The way they deal with survivors of deceased relatives is abominable. I would NEVER trust my property let alone my life to them ever If there were a negative rating they would get a  -5 from me" Commented on 2017-02-09 02:19:20 EST "RiverSource a division of Ameriprise is a horrible company to deal with. My brother had an annuity with them, of which I was a beneficiary.  After my brother's death, RiverSource refused to provide a copy of the Annuity Contract for 13 months.  When it finally arrived, I learned there was a Rider on the contract that charged 0.95 a year.  The rider was to terminate on my brother's death, but RiverSource has taken out over 6000 in rider fees.  I believe they delayed providing me the information so they could charge these fees.    They also provide statements with contradictory information on the balance of the accounts...differences from one page to another were as high as 7500 a month.  They never offered an explanation of the different figures.  Three letters to Vice President Iachello went unanswered.  I could go on, but these people are rip-off artists, and should be avoided.  If you are filing a claim, get everything in writing, and start filing complaints with your state insurance commission the moment they start their delays." Commented on 2016-10-29 21:10:11 EST "I paid disability income premiums for 20 years and filed a claim in December of 2015. The experience has been horrible with their clear intent not to pay the claim.Meanwhile I go broke." Commented on 2016-09-10 07:39:27 EST "I have had A life insurance policy on my mother for many years but now have been told the policy will lapse.>My premiums went from $300 per month to over $900 per month.>I have asked for a full illustration of the policy to see future premium increases.>I have been promised 3 times I will get one but get a letter every time the policy is in danger of lapsing even though I pay the premium bills I am sent I cannot get the illustration so I can decide if this policy is worth having.>Just a big run around I pay up policy but by the time I do I am already behind again.>Really don't know what to do anymore.>These people should be banned from doing business in Ohio" Commented on 2016-03-29 17:21:05 EST "My father in-law has paid premiums for Long Term Care to Riversource Insurance for years.  He had to apply for his first claim in 2013 at the age of 93.  We have had nothing but problems  Riversource is so far behind in paying his claims that we just had to cancel 12 hours of his 24 hour care because we can't afford to pay for it.  This company's long term care is a scam.  We send all the paperwork we're supposed to and they pick and choose what they pay for with no explanation. When I call to find out what's going on I get the run-around every time.  I am exhausted after ten months of this.  BUYER BEWARE This company is a scam" Commented on 2014-10-24 10:39:49 EST "Great Service" Commented on 2014-10-21 11:51:08 EST "I was just advised that my River Source Life Insurance Policy will lapse.They are stating that the investments are not making enough money to sustain the death benefit. So to remedy that I need to come up with over 1000.00 now so it does not lapse and my premium will rise from 163.00 every 3 months to 776.00 every 3 months. Stay as far away from this company as you can.You are lured in by the low premiums and then after they have you a few years they pull this trick on you.  My Ameriprise Financial Adviser was the one who sold me on the policy and I thought it would be a great addition to our portfolio to help protect my family. Well that turned out to be wrong and feel Ameriprise failed me. They waited to the last minute to inform me that the insurance was lapsing. They know the game and play right along with it. I should have been informed earlier to help avoid this situation and make different investments to keep the policy affordable and not lapse. This way they can get you to buy something else to replace the policy you thought they were watch for you. I should know better and should a keep a closer eye on my investments. I thought I could trust Ameriprise to do that for me." Commented on 2014-03-09 12:21:37 EST "We are going to file a formal complaint because they never explained the policy and we had to allow it to lapse after 8 years and an investment of over 78000.  They cleaned out the account and we were left with nothing" Commented on 2014-02-01 09:13:00 EST "My advisor put me in Riversource annuities. I wanted to leave Ameriprise but found out the annuities had to stay. The fees are so high annually I decided to surrender them. Now I have a surrender fee HUGE and prorata rider fees and a 30.00 contract fee. These are vampires and fee hogs. STAY AWAY Look up greed in the dictionary you will find Riversource there. NEVER BUY AN ANNUITY FROM THESE FOLKS" Commented on 2013-10-04 11:17:20 EST "My Aunt passed away several months ago and I have been trying to make a beneficiary claim since. You are clearly calling off shore talking with folks that have made up names who can't call out. Faxes have been lost not imaged or never received.  Phone calls go to voice mail and then die. Stay away" Commented on 2013-10-01 05:28:43 EST "Earlier this year my sister and I lost our mother to pancreatic cancer. Among her investments was one with RiverSource. We were both given an equal amount of the money mom had with them substantial and both filled out separate paper work. The only option available to us to get our funds was a check mailed to each of us. About 14 days later props to them for processing this in a timely manner my sister receives a check and deposits it. The next business day she receives another check for a slightly different amount some taxes withheld on this one and calls them up to ask what is going on. Long story short RiverSource sent both my sister's funds and my funds to her in checks both made out to my sister We have both been on the phone mostly on hold with them over the past few days trying to get this resolved. We both requested that my sister simply wire me the funds but RiverSource refuses. They told me that she should expect a call telling her how to return the funds by a check in the mail they wrongly sent to her soon. Once that check gets to them and they then process it they will send out another check presumably to me this time.Now to me there has been several mistakes that RiverSource has made.Mistake 1 Sending funds through regular mailMistake 2 Sending my funds to the wrong personMistake 3 Refusing payment to me until the person they sent the funds to returns themIn this case it should all work out as I trust my sister completely and know she will return the funds. My question is though and I asked them this what would have happened if it wasn't my sister who got the funds? They never answered but my guess is that I would never get the funds legally due me.To me a financial firm should just not mess things up this badly and I for one would never trust RiverSource with my money after the experience I had." Commented on 2013-09-18 19:44:28 EST "After filling out the paperwork and suppling the mandated documentation I got a call saying that they did not receive the Death Certificate. I wonder what they plan on doing with the one I sent? They keep insisting I send them another one like they grow on trees or something." Commented on 2013-06-25 15:19:27 EST "I have been trying to move my Riversource variable annuity funds with Ameriprise to Vanguard. I have submitted all of the appropriate forms with the Medallion Guarantee signature to Vanguard and they have requested the funds which continue to sit in my Ameriprise account which is slowly being siphoned of funds. Probably will have to take legal action. Stay away from both Ameriprise and Riversource anything." Commented on 2013-06-13 15:18:34 EST "My father had his retirement invested with this firm.  He died in January and left all to my Mom as beneficiary.  We completed all the required paper work and submitted the death claim benefit to transfer to her and so that she would continue to receive monthly disbursements.  We were told it would take 3-5 business days.  It has now been over two months and we have not heard nor received anything.  We are told that they have a computer problem and it keeps throwing my mom's name out and they cannot process it.  We cannot get her money which she needs to live.  We have called everyday and are told they will fix it "today."  Everyday we are told the same thing "its a computer problem."  Now they put us on hold when we call.  We've been on hold now for 30 minutes.  They are basically keeping her money which I consider stealing.  Looks like our only resource is to hire an attorney.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY.  " Commented on 2013-05-08 10:35:03 EST "I have been trying to transfer my account to Fidelity for 2 years. They throw red tape and refuse to transfer the funds." Commented on 2013-02-08 18:37:49 EST "was sold with a 5% guaranteed base rate.  now company is reneging on agreement" Commented on 2012-07-31 18:39:17 EST "I was told several years ago that I HAD to buy life insurance with my investment portfolio.  I have NO trust for my "adviser" who thinks I should be happy because my "investments are following the stock market".  Other investments the company flaunts have 4X the return over mine in the last 10 years.  " Commented on 2012-06-14 18:01:16 EST "Beware of their stiff penalties for early withdrawl.  I was not made aware by my Ameriprise advisor.  " Commented on 2012-03-17 05:33:40 EST "Purchased term life 10 yrs ago w/monthly pmts of 90 auto deducted from my checking acct. through our financial planner. For the last two years our financial planner has left Ameriprise replacement cfp has never contacted us no longer get paper statements from Ameriprise no access through internet and never had any correspondence from Riversourse.  Company started deducting 540 four months ago before I noticed changed in premium and company refuses to refund.  We have never received any correspondence from them for ten years and amazingly they have a copy of notice we never received regarding change in premiums and they should not be allowed to change auto payment amounts without policy holders signature" Commented on 2012-01-19 12:02:32 EST "I have 2 life insurance policies and a disability insurance policy.  Im on disability now and its a fight every month to get my check.  They delay payment and I have to hound the claims analyst to call back  answer questions etc" Commented on 2012-01-13 11:19:07 EST "Impossible to deal with.  Customer dis-service people are all from Philippines.  IF you get an American they refuse to transfer to CEO or executive.  They are rude condescending and insulting - and theyre this way with people with LOTS of money in their funds  How stupid.  Run from these people. " Commented on 2011-11-28 08:18:40 EST "It has been extremely difficult and time-consuming to deal with claims department on long term policy. They seem to be delaying intentionally. I asked to speak to someone in customer service but was not referred to anyone. They said someone would call me back but they did not. They make it very difficult to file a claim continually saying that they did not receive the documents sent so they have to be requested again. Nothing can ever be done in a single call. It takes days and days to get anything done. Months later we are still trying to get it resolved." Commented on 2011-11-21 17:27:04 EST "Finding it very difficult to close out death claim. " Commented on 2011-09-05 18:26:30 EST "I am getting out ASAP due to eligibility date moved to 95 years old even if it costs me money. Not likely I will live that long." Commented on 2011-08-30 08:07:55 EST "They moved up the eligibility date to start withdrawing from their Annuity account until I am 95 years old. Ridiculous!! " Commented on 2011-03-02 12:37:58 EST "Have AMEX annuity: 1. could not do direct deposit [ACH failed payments], 2. 1099-R has material errors preventing tax filing [violates IRC 6722]" Commented on 2011-02-12 07:30:23 EST "Have a deferred annuity. My issue is obtaining info re sub accounts, perfformance, expenses. Not much transparency." Commented on 2011-02-11 19:33:25 EST "Very easy to submit claims.  Great service.  Best company out there..." Commented on 2010-12-06 09:12:21 EST "Every year,for the last three,I have had to reduce the benefits of my long term care insurance because the rates have increased. The increases would have totaled $471 for decreased benefits.So far I have been able to stay in the dance but I fear that in a few years the cost will outweigh the benefits and if I drop out they will get to keep all my premiums and not have to pay out a cent.And remember,they can say they never cut any benefits, it was always my choice." Commented on 2010-10-04 19:10:52 EST "This company should be avoided at all costs.  They outsource jobs overseas depriving legal US Americans of jobs. They refuse to honor contracts and "steal" your money with outrageous fees when you try and withdraw funds." Commented on 2010-09-20 10:16:38 EST "Stay away from them.

I have a variable annuity on which I am trying to effect a 1035 exchange -  they are dragging their feet big time, insisting I use their forms instead of industry standard forms, demanding an officer from the exchange company sign MY request for MY funds, no copies accepted, originals only ..... anything they can do to hold on to my money.

Take your money and run away from this bunch." Commented on 2010-08-16 13:59:33 EST "Easy to work with, pleasant customer service" Commented on 2010-04-29 08:00:51 EST "Increased cost over the years makes it hard for someone retired to afford the Long Term Care when we most need it.  I have been paying since my early 50s and the price keeps going up.  I have too much invested to change to another company." Commented on 2010-04-28 11:46:18 EST "Took over a month to send me claim forms for my mothers death, 4 phone calls later, they finally faxed me very unreadable copies, had no PDF file for me to use....very unprofessional and I will go out of my way to tell any of my friends to STAY AWAY from this company." Commented on 2010-02-24 07:52:11 EST "Great company that gave me the proper expectations and lived up to what they said.  They did not "paint me too blue of a sky"" Commented on 2010-02-17 08:18:28 EST "AMEX, Ameriprise and Riversource Life have provided tax-sheltered income for 25 years without fail and without resetting the quaranteed interest rate. " Commented on 2010-02-04 13:18:06 EST "Make sure you read the fine print, the agent selling the policy will not tell you about possible rate increases." Commented on 2010-02-01 17:35:42 EST "I have an annutity contract with them.  They determined the monthly withdrawal amount for us.  It was .05% over the limit allowed.  They would not change it and proceeded to deduct from the principal leaving me with 100,000.00 less than I should have.  No one at the company will correct their mistake.  I was told I had to pay an IRS penalty to change it.  " Commented on 2009-06-18 05:47:19 EST "They have managed their books prudently during times when everyone else needs to be bailed out.  There are good advisors and bad advisors at every company, find one you like and stay put." Commented on 2009-04-15 19:39:15 EST "misled originally by the " financial advisor"
After nine years the annual rates have gone up twice in the last 2 years to a point that I can not afford to keep the policy.  Wonder how much of a bonus the ceo's received." Commented on 2009-04-08 20:47:14 EST "Exclusions and exceptions on my mother's long-term care policy were not made clear to her; claim service was atrocious, and appeared to involve intentional delaying tactics." Commented on 2009-03-11 14:56:48 EST "If you work closely with an advisor - they will be an advocate for you.  If you are just a number - you may have the problems discussed above." Commented on 2009-03-04 14:02:59 EST "I filed a long term care claim for my 84 year old mother-in-law in Sept 2008.  My story is similar to those others on this site.  The claims agent was never available when I called, but fortunately I did receive return calls between 24 and 48 hours each time. I asked the claims agent to prequalify a facility for me before moving my mother-in-law into a facility.  I was told that this was not the process and that she would have to select a facility first, move in and then we could begin the lengthy claims process.  In the meantime, she would incur very expensive out of pocket costs in the hopes that the facility would be covered.  This is a Bad Faith process.  It should be illegal.  They also delayed decision for benefits because they could not find a doctor's signature on the nursing home policies and procedures.  This is not even a condition of the policy.  This is ridiculous.  Riversource will do whatever they can to avoid paying on claims.  We just received a denial for benefits letter in November.  The policy was taken out in October 1989.  Riversource was happy to take our premiums, but now refuses to pay benefits.  We are filing a claim against Riversource with our state's Dept of Insurance for Bad Faith in denying the claim and Bad Faith processes.  We will pursue legal action if the policy continues to be denied after appeal.  I would encourage anyone in my situation to file a complaint with your state's dept of insurance.  Also, you may find that your state regulations mandate a maximum amount of time for which Insurance Co.s are allowed before deciding to deny or approve a claim.  Riversource has exceeded that time in my state and we are legally eligible for damages.  I would encourage you to check this out.  You may be eligible for this also.  You should know that I have never taken any legal action in my lifetime, so I am not the type of person who sues over everything. But, this is such an extreme case of negligence, I feel I must do something.  Good luck to the rest of you and if you are reading this and considering Long Term Care policies, please do not even consider Riversource. " Commented on 2009-01-06 08:45:00 EST "My father has a LTC policy he purchased in 1993 from RiverSource.  We have filed a claim on this policy in August 2008 when he had to move to a nursing facility.  I have sent the required paperwork at least 3 times but I'm still being told they are missing information. Customer service can't tell what and I'm told I have to talk to the claim representative who of course is never available when I call.  I have also written 4 letters to her but again have never heard from her.  His premium is due in January 2009 which they did tell me he has to pay since he hasnt received any benefits yet.  But Im very tempted to just let this policy lapse as I cant get ANYONE to tell if his claim will be approved.  My next letter is being sent to the CEO by registered mail.

They will always find a loophoe." Commented on 2008-12-10 09:52:13 EST "After my advisor got all the money he could out of us (over 20 years) he acts like he don't know us. Other than Long Term we have about 1 1/2 mill with Riversource. (now down to 750,000) never heard yet from advisor. I called for meeting. his solution--HANG IN THERE.    Retired and feeling stuck." Commented on 2008-11-18 17:43:15 EST "excellent service, great product, very satisfied, I had a met life life insurance before and I lost it because the agent was ignorant, the advisors in riversource are very informed and willing to help" Commented on 2008-10-10 16:30:52 EST "I have a variable annuity account and due to market conditions now it is not doing very well. I'm hoping for improvement.   " Commented on 2008-10-05 08:21:28 EST "Our grandmother was also admitted to a nursing home earlier this year (2008.  She was also made a claim against her long term care insurance.  March, her claim was approved and she is still waiting to be paid.  She has had 3 different case workers.  Each time we call to get a status, we told she has a new claim rep., and that there is new/additional paperwork needed in order for her to collect.  I can't believe the run around this company has given her.  It should be illegal. " Commented on 2008-09-02 19:44:45 EST "My grandmother recently went into a nursing home. She had coverage with two other life insurance companies besides Riversource and Riversource is the only one that is dragging its feet. The other two insurance companies were helpful and quick to respond where Riversource drags it's feet. It's been 5 months now and the only time I hear anything from Riversource is when "I" call them to find out whats going on. They have never once called me and obviously could care less if they ever do. I have dropped any and all business that I currently have with them and cannot wait until this agony of dealing with them is over. I will never do business with them again." Commented on 2007-12-08 10:21:00 EST "Riversource is the leading provider of variable universal life policies.  My VUL and disability policy  were well advised and I feel that my agent/advisor services these policies well enough." Commented on 2007-08-01 18:55:33 EST "Have not had an occasion to file a claim with this company - up until now.  I am in the process of filing a claim at this very moment.  
an agent of this company sold me variable annuities that have surrender charges at 10 years EACH PAYMENT INVESTED !!  I am 60+ and will not be able to get my money for at least 10 years - I need it now!  

So, yes, I am filing a complaint - TODAY!" Commented on 2007-07-12 16:16:23 EST

The information in this supplement updates and amends certain information
contained in your current variable annuity product prospectus. Please read it
carefully and keep it with your variable annuity contract product prospectus.


FOR CONTRACTS WITH ACCUMULATION PROTECTOR BENEFIT RIDER, IF WE RECEIVE YOUR
REQUEST FOR THE ELECTIVE STEP UP OR THE ELECTIVE SPOUSAL CONTINUATION STEP UP ON
OR AFTER APRIL 29, 2013, A FEE OF 1.75% WILL APPLY TO YOUR RIDER. YOU CAN
REQUEST THE ELECTIVE STEP UP ONLY ONCE PER CONTRACT YEAR, WITHIN THIRTY DAYS
FOLLOWING EACH CONTRACT ANNIVERSARY, BUT PRIOR TO THE BENEFIT DATE.


The following changes are made to the prospectus:


IN THE "OPTIONAL LIVING BENEFIT CHARGES -- ACCUMULATION PROTECTOR BENEFIT RIDER
FEE" SECTION OF THE PROSPECTUS, THE LAST THREE PARAGRAPHS ARE REPLACED WITH THE
FOLLOWING: We will not change the Accumulation Protector Benefit rider fee in
effect on your contract after the rider effective date unless:


(a)  you choose the annual elective step up or elective spousal
continuation step up after we have exercised our rights to increase
the rider fee; or


(b)  you change your Portfolio Navigator program (PN program) investment
option after we have exercised our rights to increase the rider fee or
vary the rider fee for each PN program investment option.


If you change your PN program investment option after we have exercised our
rights to increase the rider fee as described above, you will pay the fee that
is in effect on the valuation date we receive your written request to step up
or change your investment option. Currently, we waive our right to increase the
rider fee if you change your PN program investment option.


If we receive your request for the elective step up or the elective spousal
continuation step up on or after April 29, 2013, your rider fee will increase
to 1.75%. This charge will be based on the greater of your contract value or
the Minimum Contract Accumulation Value (MCAV) on your contract anniversary. We
will calculate an average rider fee, for that year only, that reflects the
various different fees that were in effect during the contract year, adjusted
for the number of calendar days each fee was in effect.


The fee does not apply after the annuitization start date.



THIS SUPPLEMENT SHOULD BE READ AND RETAINED FOR FUTURE REFERENCE.



*    Valid until next prospectus update.

Item 27. Number of Contract owners



As of Dec. 31, 2012 there were 24,129 nonqualified contracts and
36,503 qualified contract owners.






Item 28. Indemnification



The amended By-Laws of the depositor provide that the depositor will indemnify,
to the fullest extent now or hereafter provided for or permitted by law, each
person involved in, or made or threatened to be made a party to, any action,
suit, claim or proceeding, whether civil or criminal, including any
investigative, administrative, legislative, or other proceeding, and including
any action by or in the right of the depositor or any other corporation, or any
partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan, or other enterprise
(any such entity, other than the depositor, being hereinafter referred to as an
"Enterprise"), and including appeals therein (any such action or process being
hereinafter referred to as a "Proceeding"), by reason of the fact that such
person, such person's testator or intestate (i) is or was a director or officer
of the depositor, or (ii) is or was serving, at the request of the depositor, as
a director, officer, or in any other capacity, or any other Enterprise, against
any and all judgments, amounts paid in settlement, and expenses, including
attorney's fees, actually and reasonably incurred as a result of or in
connection with any Proceeding, except as provided below.


No indemnification will be made to or on behalf of any such person if a judgment
or other final adjudication adverse to such person establishes that such
person's acts were committed in bad faith or were the result of active and
deliberate dishonesty and were material to the cause of action so adjudicated,
or that such person personally gained in fact a financial profit or other
advantage to which such person was not legally entitled. In addition, no
indemnification will be made with respect to any Proceeding initiated by any
such person against the depositor, or a director or officer of the depositor,
other than to enforce the terms of this indemnification provision, unless such
Proceeding was authorized by the Board of Directors of the depositor. Further,
no indemnification will be made with respect to any settlement or compromise of
any Proceeding unless and until the depositor has consented to such settlement
or compromise.





The depositor may, from time to time, with the approval of the Board of
Directors, and to the extent authorized, grant rights to indemnification, and to
the advancement of expenses, to any employee or agent of the depositor or to any
person serving at the request of the depositor as a director or officer, or in
any other capacity, of any other Enterprise, to the fullest extent of the
provisions with respect to the indemnification and advancement of expenses of
directors and officers of the depositor.


There are agreements in place under which the underwriter and affiliated persons
of the depositor or registrant may be indemnified against liabilities arising
out of acts or omissions in connection with the offer of the contracts; provided
however, that no such indemnity will be made to the underwriter or affiliated
persons of the depositor or registrant for liabilities to which they would
otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross
negligence.


Insofar as indemnification for liability arising under the Securities Act of
1933 (the "Act") may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons
of the depositor or the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or
otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities
and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as
expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim
for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the
registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling
person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or
proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in
connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in
the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent,
submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such
indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will
be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

Post-Effective Amendment No. 18
File Nos.:  333-139763/811-07195


Ladies and Gentlemen:


I am familiar with the establishment of the RiverSource Variable Annuity
Account ("Account"), which is a separate account of RiverSource Life Insurance
Company ("Company") established by the Company's Board of Directors according to
applicable insurance law. I also am familiar with the above-referenced
Registration Statement filed by the Company on behalf of the Account with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.


I have made such examination of law and examined such documents and records as
in my judgment are necessary and appropriate to enable me to give the following
opinion:


1.    The Company is duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing
under applicable state law and is duly licensed or qualified to do
business in each jurisdiction where it transacts business. The Company has
all corporate powers required to carry on its business and to issue the
contracts.


2.    The Account is a validly created and existing separate account of the
Company and is duly authorized to issue the securities registered.


3.    The contracts issued by the Company, when offered and sold in accordance
with the prospectuses contained in the Registration Statement and in
compliance with applicable law, will be legally issued and represent
binding obligations of the Company in accordance with their terms.


I hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Registration
Statement.


Sincerely,






/s/ Dixie Carroll
