Mobile operating systems such as Android, iOS, and Windows 10 address many old security issues but also create new and complex security requirements. In the traditional PC environment, security focused on restricting employees’ access to corporate resources and the actions they could take. Security meant users could do less. In the new world, the right security model means that employees can do more. The MobileIron platform was built to secure and manage modern operating systems in a world of mixed-use devices. With MobileIron, security means enabling business not restricting it.

Mobile Device Management - MDM
 




Mobile Device Management - MDM







Mobile device management (MDM): The foundation for a secure mobile enterprise







Secure, manage, and monitor any corporate­- or employee­-owned mobile device that accesses business ­critical data. MobileIron’s mobile device management (MDM) capabilities give you the fundamental visibility and IT controls needed to securely deploy, manage, and retire devices when employees replace devices or leave the company.








Simplify MDM device enrollment for users
Enable employees to quickly enroll their devices in MDM through a seamless setup process as soon as they power on their devices. Ease privacy concerns with clear, easy­-to­-read mobile policy guidelines.





A self­-service portal allows users to manage common tasks, such as adding or retiring devices, without IT assistance.
Visual privacy policy guidelines help employees understand how MDM protects their personal information on mobile devices.









Visual Privacy Policy Demo









Reduce help desk calls with automated device setup
MDM software simplifies configuration and reduces help desk calls. Registered devices are automatically configured with corporate connectivity settings, email profiles, and device-specific restrictions with a few clicks.





Help users instantly connect over corporate Wi-­Fi and VPN profiles.
Provide secure access to business email with support for Exchange, POP, and IMAP account types.
Deploy required enterprise apps and make recommended apps available via an enterprise app store.









Product Overview









The Ultimate Guide to 
						Enterprise Mobility Management













Provide mobile access control and secure connectivity
MobileIron’s identity and access management capabilities give authorized users secure access to business resources without requiring them to re­enter passwords, manually establish VPN, or other disruptive tasks. IT benefits by maintaining complete visibility and control over devices that access sensitive corporate information.









Leverage existing identity stores such as Active Directory.
Prevent man­-in-­the­-middle exploits with certificate­ based authentication.
Simplify secure access to business data through per­-app VPN.
Block jailbroken or non­compliant devices from accessing corporate resources.



ReadMobile Security:Threats andCountermeasures









Enforce security policies and monitor device compliance
Establish and enforce a consistent mobile device security framework using an intuitive policy engine. Granular policy settings and compliance configurations allow you to adapt security to match your specific business requirements.





Enforce device passcodes settings.
Protect data with device encryption and data loss prevention settings.
Quarantine or selectively wipe business data from non­-compliant devices.
Meet regulatory guidelines defined by PCI, HIPAA, and CJIS.









Mobile Security









Simplify and accelerate business processes with a mobile-­aware IT infrastructure
Transform your existing IT infrastructure to support a mobile-­aware enterprise. MobileIron EMM simplifies mobile management by integrating with other IT systems such as corporate directories (Active Directory/ LDAP), IT service management software, and network access control (NAC) systems.





Prevent unregistered devices from accessing resources over corporate Wi-­Fi networks by integrating MDM with NAC.
Streamline IT asset management by integrating MDM with ServiceNow.
Consolidate enterprise-wide IT systems reporting via the Splunk Forwarder and MobileIron App for Splunk Enterprise.








Partner Ecosystem









						We have experienced faster access to key data as a result of mobilizing employees. At the same time, I am confident that we have the security and policies in place to protect vital corporate information.

MobileIron Core
 




MobileIron Core



A key component to the MobileIron Platform is MobileIron Core, which integrates with backend enterprise IT systems and enables IT to define security and management policies for mobile apps, content and devices. Core can be extended through our APIs to integrate with the offerings of our Technology Partners.





 
 
Core enables the following areas of functionality:
 
 

 
Mobile Device Management
Our MDM capabilities enable IT to securely manage mobile devices across mobile operating systems and provide secure corporate email, automatic device configuration, certificate-based security, and selective wiping of enterprise data from both corporate-owned as well as user-owned devices.
Learn More 
 
Mobile Application Management
Our MAM functionality helps IT manage the entire application lifecycle, from making the applications available in the enterprise app storefront, securing applications on the device, enforcing user authentication, isolating them from personal apps, and retiring them as necessary.
 
Learn More 
 
Mobile Content Management
Our MCM functionality enables IT to provide mobile access to enterprise documents residing in SharePoint, file shares, and other content management systems so users can access them securely from any device. It also secures email attachments so that they are encrypted and can only be viewed with the Docs@Work or other enterprise application managed by MobileIron.

Data Reporting, Analytics, and Insight
Enterprise mobile computing is a mission critical and integral component of the IT infrastructure. Administrators need real time operational intelligence solutions to manage and maintain the posture, usage of mobile devices and applications globally. MobileIron Core collects over 200 fields of data with device, application, user metrics, and status which administrators can use to analyze, visualize, and get actionable insights into their mobile infrastructure.


Splunk Forwarder & Splunk App for MobileIron:
Administrators can correlate mobile & network machine generated data in order to diagnose infrastructure problems.
Learn More

MobileIron Reporting Database:
Administrators can include mobile device data in third party reporting solutions like Tableau, Crystal Reports, and QlikView.
 


CSV Export:
Gives administrators a  fast and simple way to export ad hoc reports into Excel for easy filtering, formatting, and analysis.


Dashboard Widgets:
New dashboard widgets deliver a better way to pull information from the MobileIron Reporting Database.




Visual Privacy Drives User Trust


Mobile is very personal. With users carrying so much personal information on their mobile devices, it is important for them to know what the enterprise is able to see when they register their device with an EMM platform. The Visual Privacy capabilities provide transparency to employees by allowing them to view exactly which data their company can see and which actions their company can take on the device. This level of transparency drives user trust and the Visual Privacy capabilities allows companies to greatly narrow the trust gap between them and their employees. Employees have peace-of-mind and this accelerates their adoption of new mobile enterprise services and BYOD programs.





Windows 10 Support


Windows 10 is now here and marks a major milestone for enterprises. The release of Windows 10 marks the convergence of traditional Windows operating systems to allow for security and management through a unified set of EMM API’s across mobile, desktop and embedded products. MobileIron Core 8.0 offers complete compatibility with Windows 10, allowing for users with new Windows 10 devices to enroll with MobileIron EMM. It also means that users with existing Windows 8.1 or Windows Phone 8.1 devices already enrolled with MobileIron EMM can effortlessly upgrade to Windows 10 and stay productive.





Android for Work Support


With the introduction of Android for Work, enterprise IT organizations now have a way to secure enterprise apps, manage disparate devices, and separate work and personal data at the OS level in a consistent manner across all Android devices. It is important to note that Android for Work features can only be implemented by using an EMM platform. MobileIron Core supports Android for Work allowing enterprises to effortlessly secure and manage a range of Android devices as they come into the enterprise.





Flexible Delegation with Spaces


MobileIron Core allows IT to establish data and task boundaries to protect user privacy and provide flexible delegation of IT responsibilities. Secure spaces with delegated administration and role based access enables the global IT lead to provide local IT or helpdesk admins with access to key systems based on their role within the organization and even distribute apps within certain spaces. Global IT teams can also determine which devices local IT or helpdesk admins can see and what they can do on those devices. This enables global organizations to gain flexibility and create secure spaces for various functions within which they can complete key actions, while ensuring user privacy.





On-the-go Management with Insight


MobileIron Insight is a native mobile app, designed to help IT Admins take a Mobile First approach towards managing their mobile deployments. With Insight, the industry-leading MobileIron EMM admin portal goes mobile, enabling IT administrators to easily view, monitor, and manage mobile devices at any time, no matter where they are. A great administration and help desk tool, supporting both on premise and cloud EMM platforms, Insight allows admins to do key things like view the status of mobile deployments across their company, search for users and devices, drill down on specific device info, and troubleshoot issues and manage devices, all without being tied to a desktop or laptop. IT admins can even use Insight to view multiple Core instances at the same time, enhancing efficiency and the ability to take proactive action. This app is available on both iOS and Android smartphones and tablets, in 18 languages.




Secure Mobile Access to Google Apps
Enterprises are increasingly migrating from on premise to cloud-based solutions for mission-critical business productivity apps.  In keeping with this trend, many enterprises are interested in migrating from their existing PIM solutions to Google Apps. However for many security conscious enterprises, delivering Active Directory credentials to the Google cloud prevents them from moving forward on their cloud-related migration plans, leaving them unable to take advantage of the many benefits of a cloud-based offering.  This issue is resolved by creating and managing Google Apps passwords on MobileIron Core enabling enterprises to go live with Google’s PIM products on mobile using ActiveSync. This frees up enterprises who desire the benefits of cloud-based apps such as ease of deployment and a simpler subscription model without sacrificing security. Currently, password management for Google Apps is supported on iOS and Android.

Integration with Microsoft SCCM Delivers Enhanced Visibility
MobileIron now offers real time connectivity between Microsoft’s System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) and MobileIron Core, offering enterprise IT a quick and easy way to view status of mobile devices directly from the SCCM console.  This provides enhanced visibility into mobile deployments which results in greater IT efficiency. With this integration, there is no need to do a constant refresh of the entire device catalog and SCCM can do a real-time query to the MobileIron Core to get a snapshot of mobile device status. IT admins can now take certain actions on mobile devices directly from the SCCM console such as locking, unlocking, wiping, and retiring a device as well as enabling a forced check-in as needed.

MobileIron Client - MDM Application for Enterprise Environments
 




MobileIron Client - MDM Application for Enterprise Environments



A key component to the MobileIron platform is the MobileIron Client, called Mobile@Work. End users download the app and it automatically configures the device to function in an enterprise environment by enforcing the configuration and security policies set by the IT department. The secure MobileIron container protects enterprise data and applications. 
Mobile Device Management (MDM)
The MobileIron Client works with MobileIron Core to configure corporate email, Wi-Fi, VPN, and security certificates and to create a clear separation between personal and business information. This allows IT to selectively wipe only the corporate data on the device if the user leaves the company or if the device falls out of compliance or is lost. 
Mobile Application Management (MAM)
The MobileIron Client works with MobileIron Core to install the enterprise app storefront so that users can browse and install the mobile applications made available to them by their enterprise. Also, depending on the users role in the organization, the Client automatically installs the mobile applications that have been assigned to that user. Enterprise data can only be exchanged between applications that are part of the secure MobileIron container. 
Mobile Content Management (MCM)
The MobileIron Client allows users access to web resources and content repositories that sit behind the firewall such as SharePoint. It also provides them with a secure reader that has the key to decrypt encrypted email attachments so that corporate data cannot leave the device or be leaked into personal email and attachments.

MobileIron Sentry
 




MobileIron Sentry


A key component to the MobileIron Platform is MobileIron Sentry, an in-line gateway that manages, encrypts, and secures traffic between the mobile device and back-end enterprise systems. Sentry addresses three fundamental needs for our customers: mobile security, scalability and user experience.
Security

Data and traffic between the mobile device and corporate resources can be configured to flow through Sentry, providing real-time secure tunneling and access control. 

Sentry enforces the security policies set by IT in MobileIron Core, enabling it to allow or deny access to corporate information and resources in real time. 

Sentry prevents unauthorized interception and malicious manipulation of data through its support for certificate-based authentication. 

Sentry can encrypt email attachments delivered to mobile devices so that unauthorized apps cannot open them on the mobile device, nor read them if they are copied to external cloud storage sites. 
Advanced traffic control through support for multiple proxy servers allows IT organizations to ensure the integrity of mobile app traffic by ensuring access to the right corporate destinations and denying access to non-IT approved destinations. With application rules an admin can specify which application(s) can be allowed, blocked or proxied in addition to destinations, enabling finer grained security so applications cannot get access to corporate resources to which they are not entitled.


Scalability

Sentry can scale to meet the high volume performance and redundancy requirements of global organizations. 

Organizations can set up multiple Sentry gateways in a cluster to accommodate standard and peak data volume scenarios. 

User Experience

Sentry supports certificate based SSO authentication, which can eliminate the need for users to enter their username and password when accessing email, intranet sites, and corporate data behind the firewall.
Sentry provides on-demand app-specific VPN’s, greatly improving user experience by eliminating the need for manually enabling device-wide VPN’s.

MobileIron, Inc. Key Developments

Doddle Selects MobileIron and Appurity to Quickly Deploy Secure Mobile Apps and Devices
Jun 29 17
Doddle has selected MobileIron and its technology partner Appurity to quickly deploy secure mobile apps and devices.


MobileIron and Dropbox Enable Secure Document Collaboration
May 31 17
MobileIron announced that MobileIron Access, the company's cloud security product, is integrated with Dropbox Business. MobileIron Access ensures that only trusted users, on trusted devices, using trusted apps can access enterprise data in cloud services. Now, through the integration with MobileIron Access, IT administrators can give employees instant access to Dropbox and leverage administrative capabilities including device approvals, network control, and extensive audit logs to ensure company data is not accessed by unauthorized users, devices, apps, or cloud services. MobileIron Access addresses the entire cloud service lifecycle: Easy on-boarding; Single sign-on (SSO) authentication; Policy enforcement; Conditional access; Data-in-motion and data-at-rest security; Audit and compliance reporting. The integration with MobileIron Access builds on Dropbox's enterprise mobility management (EMM) security controls by delivering SSO capabilities. The siloed sandbox architecture of mobile apps prevents traditional SSO techniques from working effectively so employees using a variety of cloud services like Concur, Office 365, Salesforce, or Tableau need to provide their credentials every time they log into an app. MobileIron Access ensures that the mobile endpoint is registered with MobileIron, that the Dropbox Business app is managed, and then uses MobileIron Tunnel, a per-app VPN solution, for authentication. MobileIron Tunnel employs a user certificate to generate the single sign-on (SAML) token in order to provide seamless single sign-on to Dropbox and other enterprise-managed cloud services such as Concur, Office 365, Salesforce, and Tableau. This integrated experience provides employees with a simple user experience, and ensures enterprise data is protected.

MobileIron Product Privacy Statement
 




MobileIron Product Privacy Statement
For business customer employees or consultants who have MobileIron software installed on their mobile devices 

What is MobileIron software? MobileIron, Inc. (“MobileIron”) is a leader in enterprise mobility management. Your employer (as defined below) has purchased MobileIron software as a tool to enable it to securely manage and deliver corporate apps, documents and other corporate content on this mobile device (either a mobile phone or tablet, depending on your employer’s policy).
What is this Privacy Statement?  This Privacy Statement describes how we handle information we collect about you and your device in this context. Note that your employer may have its own privacy policies with regard to your workplace communications and your mobile device and other privacy issues, and you should contact your employer if you have any questions about those privacy issues. In this Privacy Statement, we refer to the business that has purchased our products or services for deployment on your mobile device as your “employer” for convenience, although you may be a consultant or otherwise affiliated with such company.
How do I set up MobileIron software? If you have an Android device or iOS device such as an iPhone or iPad, you’ll need to download the MobileIron 'Mobile@Work' app or the ‘MobileIron Go’ app. After you’ve downloaded the appropriate app, follow the instructions inside the app to fully register your device with MobileIron.  In all cases, consult your employer for any instructions relevant to your organization.  If your employer has provided you with the company-owned mobile device, the Mobile@Work or MobileIron Go app may have been pre-loaded prior to your receipt of the mobile device.
How does MobileIron help me? Your employer may request you to use MobileIron in order to get mobile access to corporate resources like email. In general, MobileIron enables you to do the following from your mobile device:

Quickly access your corporate email, calendar, and contacts
Access corporate WiFi and VPN networks
Easily find and install work related applications
Check compliance with corporate security policies
Locate lost or stolen devices

The exact functionality of MobileIron on your device depends on the policies and configuration determined by your employer.  We encourage you to reach out to your employer for additional details about your organization’s policy on company- and personally-owned devices managed by MobileIron.
What can my Employer do to my mobile device? Can my employer control my device? Many companies offer “bring your own device” (BYOD) programs allowing employees to have access to company data in return for some control over their mobile devices. While it depends on the exact policies and configuration in your organization, these are the types of things you agree to when using a MobileIron-managed device:

The IT administrator at your company can wipe enterprise content off of your phone, leaving your personal information untouched; you can also wipe your phone in the same manner.
The IT administrator at your company can locate your device; you can also locate your device.
The IT administrator at your company can block applications, require applications, and limit access to corporate email and internal resources.
The IT administrator at your company can create minimum standards, like:
		
Encrypting your phone (to protect the data, both personal and company)
Requiring a minimum software version or a passcode to gain access to corporate resources
Not modifying your OS (commonly known as rooting or jailbreaking) and putting data at risk



Your employer may require you to run software that goes beyond the capabilities and features of MobileIron software. This software may even be distributed by MobileIron. Ultimately, the policies that are set by our software are determined by your employer. The above examples are only applicable where your employer deems them appropriate.  
What information does MobileIron collect?  We collect basic information about your device so that we may facilitate the registration of your device and the deployment, operation and maintenance of the MobileIron software for your employer.  The MobileIron software offers many protections for employees, and our goal is to minimize the collection or use of personal information. We collect and use only the types and amounts of your personal information necessary to provide functionality to your employer and for related internal purposes (user or device true-ups, troubleshooting, trend analysis and product development).

Non-U.S. mobile phone numbers, if such numbers are used by your employer’s IT administrator to send SMS text messages relating to the management of mobile devices deployed using MobileIron software. Our policy is to delete this information every 10 days

Does MobileIron share the Information we collect?  We only share the information we collect: (i) with your employer in connection with the operation of our software, (ii) with our affiliates, resellers or other third parties that are working with MobileIron or your employer if such parties need to know the information in order to assist your employer in its enterprise mobility efforts, (iii) with providers of products and services integrated into our software or service providers that perform services on our behalf and need to know such information for the purposes described in this Privacy Statement, (iv) as required by law or in response to a request by public and governmental authorities within or outside your country of residence, (v) to enforce our terms and conditions or to protect or defend the rights or property of MobileIron or our users or customers, or (vi) in connection with a sale of our business. 
What are my privacy choices?  Because our software is a tool deployed by your employer, your employer manages your privacy choices in connection with our products and services, and you should contact your employer for information in this regard. If you would like to access your personal information or to correct, amend or delete any inaccurate personal information processed in connection with your employer’s deployment of MobileIron products or services, please contact your employer.
How does MobileIron protect personal information? MobileIron has implemented administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to assist in protecting the personal information we collect against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use. Please note that no electronic transmission of information can be entirely secure. We cannot guarantee that the security measures we have in place to safeguard personal information will never be defeated or fail, or that those measures will always be sufficient or effective.

12. General.
a. Export/Import. The SaaS Product and Documentation may be subject to U.S. and foreign import and export control laws and regulations. Customer agrees to comply with all such regulations applicable to Customer, including obtaining applicable import licenses.
b. U.S. Government End Users. The SaaS Product and Documentation are “commercial items,” as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101, consisting of “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software documentation,” as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212. Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R.227.7202-1 through 227.729204, the SaaS Product and Documentation are being licensed to U.S. Government end users only as “commercial items” and with only those rights as are granted to all other end users pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

The In-Licensed Materials may be subject to additional terms and conditions, as identified on http://www.mobileiron.com/legal/thirdpartyterms or as otherwise made available to Customer. Such terms and conditions are incorporated by reference herein. To the extent MobileIron uses open source software in the Software, the terms and restrictions set forth herein shall not prevent or restrict Customer from exercising additional or different rights to such open source software in accordance with the applicable open source licenses.
d. Governing Law and Jurisdiction. Except as otherwise provided in Schedule A (if applicable), this Agreement, and the rights and duties of the parties arising from this Agreement, shall be governed by, construed, and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of California, excluding its conflicts-of-law principles. The sole and exclusive jurisdiction and venue for actions arising under this Agreement shall be state and federal courts in Santa Clara County, California, and the parties agree to service of process in accordance with the rules of such courts. The Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act and the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods shall not apply.
e. Assignment. Neither party may assign this Agreement without prior written consent of the other party, provided however either party may do so to a successor-in-interest pursuant to a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or substantially all of its business and/or assets. Any assignment in violation of this Section 12.e shall be void. Subject to the foregoing, all rights and obligations of the parties under this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by and against the successors and permitted assigns.
f. Data Communications. MobileIron shall only collect, access, use, store, safeguard, disclose and transfer (“Process”) Personal Information (i) for the purposes of this Agreement, including without limitation, to implement and deliver the SaaS Product and its features and associated services, provide Customer support, and help Customer prevent or address service or technical problems, (ii) as otherwise expressly permitted by Customer in writing, or (iii) as compelled by law.

MobileIron collects, analyzes, and uses aggregated, de-identified technical data and related information (such as product or feature usage, device metrics/metadata and/or mobile application usage) to facilitate market research, product development/improvement and to provide support and maintenance services. MobileIron may use, store, or disclose such information or material derived from such information, as long as it is in a form that does not identify or is not attributable to any individual.
g. Equitable Relief. The parties agree that a material breach of this Agreement adversely affecting MobileIron’s or its suppliers’ intellectual property rights in the SaaS Product or either party’s Confidential Information may cause irreparable injury to such party for which monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy and the non-breaching party shall be entitled to equitable relief (without a requirement to post a bond) in addition to any remedies it may have under this Agreement or at law.
h. Publicity. MobileIron may publicly disclose that Customer is a customer of MobileIron and a licensee of the SaaS Product, including in a list of MobileIron customers and other promotional materials.
i. Independent Contractor. The parties are independent contractors. This Agreement shall not establish any relationship of partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise or agency between the parties.
j. Customer Affiliates. An Affiliate may purchase MobileIron products and/or services either by executing a participation agreement with MobileIron or through MobileIron’s acceptance of an Order issued by such Affiliate or Authorized Reseller (as applicable). Upon execution of a participation agreement by Affiliate or, if the Affiliate issues a purchase order referring to this Section 12.j, that is accepted by MobileIron, such Affiliate shall be deemed to have purchased such products and/or services hereunder, and such Affiliate shall be bound by and shall comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement as a “Customer” under the Agreement.
k. Waiver & Severability; Amendments. The failure of either party to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of any other provision or any subsequent breach. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, the provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the intent of the parties, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. This Agreement may only be amended, or any term or condition set forth herein waived, by written consent of both parties.

Customer shall pay all freight, insurance, and other shipping-related expenses associated with purchases of hardware.
2.  Hardware Warranty . For the applicable warranty period identified in the applicable price list (or twelve (12) months if not identified in such price list) as measured from the date of MobileIron’s shipment of the hardware (as provided on the packaging material in which such hardware is shipped), MobileIron represents and warrants to Customer that such hardware shall be free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use. Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy and the entire liability of MobileIron for MobileIron’s breach of this warranty will be for MobileIron, at its option, to repair or replace such hardware, provided Customer complies with the RMA Procedures (defined below). Any hardware or replacement parts used may be new or reconditioned/refurbished.
3.   Return Material Authorization Procedures (“RMA Procedures”)  . Customer shall report suspected defects in the hardware to MobileIron through MobileIron’s Support Portal or support telephone helpline during the applicable warranty period.

For the avoidance of doubt, in order for MobileIron to ship replacement hardware, Customer must report the suspected defect, MobileIron must confirm that the hardware has failed to meet the warranty, and MobileIron must issue Customer a RMA number by 1:00 pm Pacific time during MobileIron’s business hours on that same day. If the RMA number is not issued by 1:00 pm Pacific time, MobileIron will ship the replacement hardware the next business day. Business hours are 9 am-5 pm Pacific time, Monday through Friday (excluding holidays). If Customer fails to return the defective hardware to MobileIron within thirty (30) days of the date MobileIron issues Customer a RMA number, MobileIron may invoice Customer for the replacement hardware at MobileIron’s then-current list price. Any returned defective hardware shall be MobileIron’s property once MobileIron delivers replacement hardware to Customer.

Navigating industry terminology for one clear solution.             The acronym world is a crazy one. We get it! If MDM, MCM, MAM, MIAM and MEM aren’t enough, there are also SDKs and app containers.

Security and privacy  Keep student and teacher data, both on and off-campus, safe with Apple's built-in security tools, managed by Jamf Pro.

Mobile operating systems such as Android, iOS, and Windows 10 address many old security issues but also create new and complex security requirements. In the traditional PC environment, security focused on restricting employees’ access to corporate resources and the actions they could take. Security meant users could do less. In the new world, the right security model means that employees can do more. The MobileIron platform was built to secure and manage modern operating systems in a world of mixed-use devices. With MobileIron, security means enabling business not restricting it.

History[edit]
The company was founded in 2007 and is headquartered in Mountain View, California.[1] It became publicly traded in 2014. After its share price fell from $9 at the time of the IPO to below $4 in early 2016, the company's founder Bob Tinker was replaced by Barry Mainz as CEO, but remained on the company's board of directors.[2]
Products[edit]
MobileIron's software allows the management of mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers in an enterprise environment, as well as the secure mobile access to enterprise data. As of June 2015 it held about 9.2% of global EMM market share.[2] It was listed as a "leader" in Gartner's June 2015 study "Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Mobility Management Suites",[3] together with AirWatch, Citrix, IBM and BlackBerry.[4]
In a 2016 review of MDM solutions, Markus Pierer described MobileIron as the market leader, highlighting its complete support of mobile operating systems, layered security model and fast development and release cycle, but noted its "suboptimal" support that depended on partners or resellers.[1] Also in 2016, CIO magazine, citing Gartner's study, noted that MobileIron faced increasing competition as "one of the last remaining stand-alone EMM vendors". It named platform compatibility, third party integration and customer satisfaction as some of MobileIron's strengths, but mentioned an outdated UI and unsatisfactory support among its weaknesses.[5]
As of 2016, MobileIron's principal competitors include Microsoft's Enterprise Mobility Suite, as well as other major enterprise software providers such as IBM, SAP and BlackBerry following their acquisition of previously independent EMM vendors including AirWatch and Good Technology.[2]

MobileIron - Wikipedia





















 






MobileIron

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

MobileIron Inc. is an American software company specializing in solutions for mobile device management (MDM) and enterprise mobility management (EMM).

History[edit]
The company was founded in 2007 and is headquartered in Mountain View, California.[1] It became publicly traded in 2014. After its share price fell from $9 at the time of the IPO to below $4 in early 2016, the company's founder Bob Tinker was replaced by Barry Mainz as CEO, but remained on the company's board of directors.[2]
Products[edit]
MobileIron's software allows the management of mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers in an enterprise environment, as well as the secure mobile access to enterprise data. As of June 2015 it held about 9.2% of global EMM market share.[2] It was listed as a "leader" in Gartner's June 2015 study "Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Mobility Management Suites",[3] together with AirWatch, Citrix, IBM and BlackBerry.[4]
In a 2016 review of MDM solutions, Markus Pierer described MobileIron as the market leader, highlighting its complete support of mobile operating systems, layered security model and fast development and release cycle, but noted its "suboptimal" support that depended on partners or resellers.[1] Also in 2016, CIO magazine, citing Gartner's study, noted that MobileIron faced increasing competition as "one of the last remaining stand-alone EMM vendors". It named platform compatibility, third party integration and customer satisfaction as some of MobileIron's strengths, but mentioned an outdated UI and unsatisfactory support among its weaknesses.[5]
As of 2016, MobileIron's principal competitors include Microsoft's Enterprise Mobility Suite, as well as other major enterprise software providers such as IBM, SAP and BlackBerry following their acquisition of previously independent EMM vendors including AirWatch and Good Technology.[2]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.source> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11x1gf2m6>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/type.object.type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.rate> 4.5 .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .


If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV
License: CC-BY

2 GB gzip8 GB uncompressed

Download



The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
