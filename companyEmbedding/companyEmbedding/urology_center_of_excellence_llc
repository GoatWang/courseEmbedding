When medications do not correct the problem, surgical correction is often necessary should the patient desire to have a procedure. We perform state of the art, minimally invasive surgical procedures for the correction of urinary incontinence and vaginal vault prolapse. We also offer Urodynamic testing to appropriately categorize the type of incontinence prior to surgical correction so that our physicians can choose the most appropriate procedure for each individual patient.RadiologistX-RaysChemotherapyTreatment for testicular cancer includes removal of affected testis. Depending on the stage and type of tumor found further treatments can include chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery to remove lymph nodes.Radiation TherapyWe offer the full extent of prostate cancer treatment options ranging from radiation treatment to surgical removal of the cancer. There are many options when considering treatment of prostate cancer. Every patient is unique and that is why our physicians tailor the most appropriate treatment for every individual. Our physicians are skilled in the performance of da Vinci® Robotic Prostatectomy, Radical Perineal Prostatectomy, and Radical Retropubic Prostatectomy. We also provide High Dose Radiation Brachytherapy (seedless brachytherapy) and External Beam Radiation Therapy to our patients who are candidates for radiation therapy.UltrasoundA Urologist may recommend biopsy to rule out cancer of the prostate for patients with an elevation of their PSA or if there is concern over an abnormal finding on rectal examination. This is typically performed in the setting of the office and is generally well tolerated by most patients. The prostate gland is best accessed via the rectum. Prostate biopsy is performed with the assistance of transrectal ultrasound by placing a probe into the rectum so that the prostate may be visualized. The urologist will administer lidocaine to make the procedure more comfortable for the patient. Measurements of the prostate are taken and the entire prostate is visualized to look for any abnormality. A series of needle biopsies are taken and sent to a pathology laboratory where a pathologist determines if cancer is present.InternistsKidney CancerKidney cancer effects 1 in 75 people over their lifetime. It is more often found when an ultrasound or CAT Scan are performed for other health reasons. Kidney cancer rarely has any signs or symptoms. Rarely, kidney cancer will present with pain in the flank and/or blood in the urine.Kidney StonesFollowing treatment of an acute attack of kidney stones, our physicians will determine if you are a candidate to undergo a metabolic evaluation to determine the cause of your kidney stones. We will give dietary recommendations and prescribe a medication to help to prevent further attacks should this be appropriate.Testicular CancerRisk factors for testicular cancer include history of an undescended testis, family history of testis cancer, and white race. Men in their third to fifth decades are most at risk for testis cancer.Urinary Tract InfectionBlood in the urine, or hematuria, is a common reason for consultation with a Urologist. Normal urine does not show blood. If blood is found and there is no current urinary tract infection, a Urologist may deem it appropriate to order tests to determine the cause of this blood. Causes of hematuria include stones in the urinary tract, tumors of the bladder, ureter, kidney or urethra, as well as other benign causes. A Urologist will likely perform three tests to determine a cause for blood. These include urine cytology (a laboratory test to look for abnormal cells in the urine), cystoscopy (looking in the bladder with a small scope) and some form of X-ray to evaluate the kidney to rule out stones or tumors. It is especially important for patients over the age of forty and those who use tobacco products to have a thorough evaluation.Prostate CancerThere are numerous options when considering treatment for prostate cancer. One such option is surgical removal of the cancer utilizing a minimally invasive approach via the da Vinci® Surgical System. The da Vinci® robot assists the surgeon in performance of laparoscopic removal of the prostate. It allows for extremely fine hand movements that mimic the human hand and 3-D visualization. The advantages of robotic prostatectomy are that it typically allows for...Internal MedicineBladder CancerA common location for cancer within the urinary tract is the urinary bladder. The chance of having bladder cancer within a lifetime are 1 in 30 for a man and 1 in 90 for a woman. Nearly 90% of people diagnosed with bladder cancer are over the age of 55. Bladder cancer is also more common in Caucasians and smokers versus their peers.UrologyN.E.O. Urology Associates, Inc. is a five physician Urology practice that was established in 1974.

This procedure is mainly performed in the office with the use of Valium to relieve patient anxiety. Our physicians and staff ensure that you are comfortable during the procedure and that your experience is a pleasant one that is free of worry.Robotic SurgeryLaparoscopyThere are many treatment options for kidney cancer. The most appropriate treatment is selected based on the size of the tumor, the location of the tumor within the kidney and the overall health status of the patient. Laparoscopic surgery has gained acceptance for the treatment of kidney cancer. Laparoscopy can be employed to remove the entire kidney, only the tumor itself, or to allow for freezing of the tumor. When a very large tumor is found, a traditional, open surgical procedure may be necessary.GynecologistsPregnancyEndocrinologistDiabetes CarePlastic SurgeonsLaparoscopic SurgeryLaparoscopic surgery involves the use of small instruments placed through small incisions to allow patients to have a more rapid recovery. The abdominal cavity is filled with air and the surgeon uses a camera to work inside the abdominal cavity. Images from the camera are projected onto monitors in the operating room and the surgeon views these images.PsychiatristsAnxietySend to PhoneUrology Center Of Excellence6262 Mahoning Ave, Youngstown, OH 44515(330) 270-5579Send this business listing as a text message to a mobile phone.I agree to the Terms and ConditionsCancelSendYour text message was sent.To opt out at anytime, send the word STOP to YP411.To get a help message, send the word HELP to YP411.There was an error sending your text.Please try again.E-MailUrology Center Of Excellence6262 Mahoning Ave, Youngstown, OH 44515(330) 270-5579Send this business details to yourself or up to 5 friends.Up to 5 email addresses, separate addresses with a commaSend Yourself a CopyCancelSend
