Was this review helpful?




Overall, these are a well-made jean, but I had to return because of the fit. I really wished they had worked out! The fabric is a thick, high quality denim with a lot of stretch. The high rise hits just below the belly button and the leg is slim and fitted throughout. Unfortunately, something about the high, faux pockets and the rise caused this style to bunch in the hip and crotch area in a most unflattering manner. With Zappos great return policy and the quality of this denim, it's worth giving them a try. Hopefully others don't have this same fit issue!
I'd also recommend:  J Brand, AG, Citizens of Humanity

Pignocco

The name Pignocco, according to an ancient folk tale, was given by the inhabitants of Barbara to a particulary imposing and bushy pine located at the top of a hill surrounded by our vines.






Grapes
                                                        Verdicchio                                                    





Type of Soil
                                                        Sandy tuft with Southeast exposure and an elevation of 230-250m

Wine-making
                                                        The wine is made in stainless steel tanks over an average of two weeks. During this time the temperature is controlled constantly and only selected yeasts that are excellent fermenting agents are used.
