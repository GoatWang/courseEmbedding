What are analysts saying about Ellington Financial LLC stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Ellington Financial LLC stock: 
1. FBR & Co analysts commented, "Ellington Financial reported 1Q17 EPS of $0.46, beating the Street and FBR estimates of $0.36 and $0.29, respectively, and covering the $0.45 dividend. We estimate core EPS, which excludes realized and unrealized gains on investments, FX, and derivatives, came in at $0.36, in line with consensus but below the dividend. Overall, this was a strong quarter as the company achieved a strong economic return of 10.4% annualized while continuing to redeploy capital from legacy non-agency RMBS into higher-yielding credit investments and securing new sources of financing. Given the larger portfolio and just over two-thirds of capital allocated to credit strategies that generate mid-teens ROEs, we believe core earnings power is poised to increase going forward, which should bode well for shares and support a stronger valuation. As such, we reiterate our Outperform rating and $17.50 price target, which represents a 10% discount to tangible book value and a total potential return of 17% when including the dividend." (5/8/2017)
2. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Ellington Financial LLC is a finance company that engages in acquiring and managing mortgage-related assets, including residential mortgage backed securities, prime jumbo, Alternative A-paper and subprime residential mortgage loans.
