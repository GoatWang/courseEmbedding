Nu Skin Enterprises is an American multilevel marketing company which develops and sells personal care products and dietary supplements (under the Pharmanex brand).[4] Nu Skin was founded in 1984 in Provo, Utah.[5] The company originated in the U.S. and began its first foreign operation in Canada in 1990. One year later, the company began operations in Asia with the opening of Hong Kong.[6] In 1996 the company listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The company markets its products in 54 markets through a network of approximately 1.2 million independent distributors.[3]
In the 1990s, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) investigated Nu Skin over complaints of its multilevel marketing practices.[7] In 1992, Nu Skin reached settlements with 5 states which had accused the company of deceptive advertising and overstating the income earned by distributors.[8] In 1994, following an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the company paid $1 million and signed a consent decree prohibiting it from making deceptive or unsubstantiated claims about its products.[9] In 1997, the company paid an additional $1.5 million to the FTC to settle ongoing allegations of unsubstantiated promotional claims.[10] In January 2014, the Chinese government announced that it was investigating Nu Skin following a People's Daily newspaper report calling it a "suspected illegal pyramid scheme." In 2016, Nu Skin settled $47 Million for operating a pyramid scheme after a being sued by China in a Utah federal court.[11] Nu Skin was also forced to pay another $750,000 for bribing a top Chinese official with funds from Nu Skin's charitable division after a US Securities and Exchange Commission probe.[12]

Brands and products[edit]
Under the Nu Skin and Pharmanex brands, the company develops and sells more than 200 personal care products marketed as helping people look and feel younger.[13] In the late 1990s, Nu Skin invested in Big Planet, a multi-level marketing company selling Internet services. The New York Times noted that Big Planet appeared to recruit people "even if they have little knowledge of the technology that they are supposed to be selling." A representative of the company stated: "I believe people who have never touched a computer before can become hugely wealthy in this business."[7]
In 1996, Nu Skin acquired Pharmanex, a dietary-supplement company.[14] A portion of proceeds from some product lines is donated internally to the Nu Skin Force for Good Foundation.[15] The company owns patent on a device developed by Pharmanex called a "BioPhotonic Scanner", which is designed to measure the carotenoid level in skin. According to Women's Health Letter, the device is a "scam" since it is designed merely to help sell more supplements: Nu Skin's 2002 annual report stated: "As customers track their skin carotenoid content, we believe they will be motivated to consistently consume LifePak for longer periods of time".[16]
In 2009, Nu Skin began working with LifeGen Technologies, a genomics company based in Madison, Wisconsin,[17] Nu Skin acquired LifeGen in December, 2011. LifeGen's genetic database aided in the development of Nu Skin's products, launching the ageLOC brand.[18]
Business model and sponsorships[edit]
Nu Skin Enterprises' utilizes a multi-level marketing business model. Each distributor markets products directly to potential customers, and can also recruit and train customers to become distributors. Distributors are paid from the retail markup on products they are able to sell personally, as well as a performance bonus based on the sales of distributors they have recruited.[19] Nu Skin states that it pays approximately 43 percent of its product revenue in sales compensation.[20]
Since the beginning of the 1992–93 professional basketball season, Nu Skin has sponsored the Utah Jazz Dancers.[21] Nu Skin also sponsors the Brigham Young University athletic program and the America's Freedom Festival at Provo, one of the nation's largest Independence Day celebrations.[22][23][24]
Scrutiny and reception[edit]
In the early 1990s, Nu Skin was investigated by the states of Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Florida, Illinois, Ohio, and Michigan over allegations of misleading marketing practices.[8] Ultimately, in 1992 the company settled with 5 of these states, admitting no wrongdoing but agreeing to pay the states' investigative costs, refund disgruntled distributors, and revamp its promotional practices.[25][26][27][28] However, the Connecticut Attorney General did not agree to those terms and sued Nu Skin, charging the company with misleading its distributors and operating a pyramid scheme.[8][29][30] Nu Skin admitted to no wrongdoing or violation of law and paid Connecticut $85,000 for consumer-protection programs as part of a settlement.[31]
In 1997, the Attorney General of Pennsylvania sued Nu Skin, alleging that the company operated a pyramid scheme through a subsidiary, QIQ Connections. The Attorney General's office alleged that distributors paid for the right to market technology services which did not, in fact, exist. Nu Skin discontinued the QIQ subsidiary, allowing those who had paid QIQ to transition to Big Planet, another Nu Skin interest marketing Internet technology. The president of Big Planet described the pyramid-scheme allegations as a matter of "a few distributors who in their enthusiasm have been overzealous in some of their marketing activities."[7]
In 2010, Nu Skin was listed among Forbes "100 Most Trustworthy Companies".[32]
In 2012, Stanford University sent a cease and desist letter to halt the use of the name of one of its researchers in Nu Skin's advertising claims.[33] Stanford later released a statement regarding its long-standing, research-based relationship with Nu Skin explaining that the letter was sent to Nu Skin as a request by Stuart Kim, PhD, a professor at Stanford. Kim requested in the letter that his name be removed from Nu Skin's marketing materials as he is no longer involved with research funded by Nu Skin. However, the letter did not recognize the existing research relationship between Stanford and Nu Skin. Stanford apologized for any misunderstandings that may have resulted.[34]
Also in 2012, Citron Research issued a report "stating that Nu Skin's sales model on mainland China, the fastest growing market in direct-selling, amounted to an illegal multi-level marketing scheme."[33] Nu Skin dismissed the claims, calling its sales model in China kosher and stating that it had no plans to change its business model in China.[35] In January 2014, the Chinese government announced that it planned to investigate Nu Skin for allegedly operating an illegal pyramid scheme, causing the company's stock price to plunge. At least one analyst is optimistic about the outcome.[36] Following the investigation, it was announced in March 2014 that the Chinese government would fine Nu Skin for approximately $540,000 dollars due to illegal sales as well as making false product claims.[37]
In February 2014, a securities fraud class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Utah against Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc. on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired the common stock of the Company during the period from July 10, 2013 through January 16, 2014.[38]
Evaluation of supplements[edit]
The Pharmanex LifePak Anti-Aging supplement was tested by ConsumerLab.com, and was reported as failing the overall review due to failing to clearly indicate its total Vitamin A content per FDA requirements.[39]
Political activities[edit]
In 2011, two Utah-incorporated business entities linked to top executives of Nu Skin each made a $1 million contribution to Restore Our Future, a "Super PAC" established by former aides to US presidential candidate Mitt Romney to support his bid for the White House.[40][41]
Beginning in 1989 Jason Chaffetz worked as a professional spokesman for the company for about ten years.[42] Chaffetz was elected U.S. Representative of Utah's 3rd congressional district in 2008.

Nu Skin Enterprises is an American multilevel marketing company which develops and sells personal care products and dietary supplements (under the Pharmanex brand).[4] Nu Skin was founded in 1984 in Provo, Utah.[5] The company originated in the U.S. and began its first foreign operation in Canada in 1990. One year later, the company began operations in Asia with the opening of Hong Kong.[6] In 1996 the company listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The company markets its products in 54 markets through a network of approximately 1.2 million independent distributors.[3]
In the 1990s, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) investigated Nu Skin over complaints of its multilevel marketing practices.[7] In 1992, Nu Skin reached settlements with 5 states which had accused the company of deceptive advertising and overstating the income earned by distributors.[8] In 1994, following an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the company paid $1 million and signed a consent decree prohibiting it from making deceptive or unsubstantiated claims about its products.[9] In 1997, the company paid an additional $1.5 million to the FTC to settle ongoing allegations of unsubstantiated promotional claims.[10] In January 2014, the Chinese government announced that it was investigating Nu Skin following a People's Daily newspaper report calling it a "suspected illegal pyramid scheme." In 2016, Nu Skin settled $47 Million for operating a pyramid scheme after a being sued by China in a Utah federal court.[11] Nu Skin was also forced to pay another $750,000 for bribing a top Chinese official with funds from Nu Skin's charitable division after a US Securities and Exchange Commission probe.[12]

Nu Skin Enterprises is an American multilevel marketing company which develops and sells personal care products and dietary supplements (under the Pharmanex brand).[4] Nu Skin was founded in 1984 in Provo, Utah.[5] The company originated in the U.S. and began its first foreign operation in Canada in 1990. One year later, the company began operations in Asia with the opening of Hong Kong.[6] In 1996 the company listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The company markets its products in 54 markets through a network of approximately 1.2 million independent distributors.[3]
In the 1990s, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) investigated Nu Skin over complaints of its multilevel marketing practices.[7] In 1992, Nu Skin reached settlements with 5 states which had accused the company of deceptive advertising and overstating the income earned by distributors.[8] In 1994, following an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the company paid $1 million and signed a consent decree prohibiting it from making deceptive or unsubstantiated claims about its products.[9] In 1997, the company paid an additional $1.5 million to the FTC to settle ongoing allegations of unsubstantiated promotional claims.[10] In January 2014, the Chinese government announced that it was investigating Nu Skin following a People's Daily newspaper report calling it a "suspected illegal pyramid scheme." In 2016, Nu Skin settled $47 Million for operating a pyramid scheme after a being sued by China in a Utah federal court.[11] Nu Skin was also forced to pay another $750,000 for bribing a top Chinese official with funds from Nu Skin's charitable division after a US Securities and Exchange Commission probe.[12]

Brands and products[edit]
Under the Nu Skin and Pharmanex brands, the company develops and sells more than 200 personal care products marketed as helping people look and feel younger.[13] In the late 1990s, Nu Skin invested in Big Planet, a multi-level marketing company selling Internet services. The New York Times noted that Big Planet appeared to recruit people "even if they have little knowledge of the technology that they are supposed to be selling." A representative of the company stated: "I believe people who have never touched a computer before can become hugely wealthy in this business."[7]
In 1996, Nu Skin acquired Pharmanex, a dietary-supplement company.[14] A portion of proceeds from some product lines is donated internally to the Nu Skin Force for Good Foundation.[15] The company owns patent on a device developed by Pharmanex called a "BioPhotonic Scanner", which is designed to measure the carotenoid level in skin. According to Women's Health Letter, the device is a "scam" since it is designed merely to help sell more supplements: Nu Skin's 2002 annual report stated: "As customers track their skin carotenoid content, we believe they will be motivated to consistently consume LifePak for longer periods of time".[16]
In 2009, Nu Skin began working with LifeGen Technologies, a genomics company based in Madison, Wisconsin,[17] Nu Skin acquired LifeGen in December, 2011. LifeGen's genetic database aided in the development of Nu Skin's products, launching the ageLOC brand.[18]
Business model and sponsorships[edit]
Nu Skin Enterprises' utilizes a multi-level marketing business model. Each distributor markets products directly to potential customers, and can also recruit and train customers to become distributors. Distributors are paid from the retail markup on products they are able to sell personally, as well as a performance bonus based on the sales of distributors they have recruited.[19] Nu Skin states that it pays approximately 43 percent of its product revenue in sales compensation.[20]
Since the beginning of the 1992–93 professional basketball season, Nu Skin has sponsored the Utah Jazz Dancers.[21] Nu Skin also sponsors the Brigham Young University athletic program and the America's Freedom Festival at Provo, one of the nation's largest Independence Day celebrations.[22][23][24]
Scrutiny and reception[edit]
In the early 1990s, Nu Skin was investigated by the states of Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Florida, Illinois, Ohio, and Michigan over allegations of misleading marketing practices.[8] Ultimately, in 1992 the company settled with 5 of these states, admitting no wrongdoing but agreeing to pay the states' investigative costs, refund disgruntled distributors, and revamp its promotional practices.[25][26][27][28] However, the Connecticut Attorney General did not agree to those terms and sued Nu Skin, charging the company with misleading its distributors and operating a pyramid scheme.[8][29][30] Nu Skin admitted to no wrongdoing or violation of law and paid Connecticut $85,000 for consumer-protection programs as part of a settlement.[31]
In 1997, the Attorney General of Pennsylvania sued Nu Skin, alleging that the company operated a pyramid scheme through a subsidiary, QIQ Connections. The Attorney General's office alleged that distributors paid for the right to market technology services which did not, in fact, exist. Nu Skin discontinued the QIQ subsidiary, allowing those who had paid QIQ to transition to Big Planet, another Nu Skin interest marketing Internet technology. The president of Big Planet described the pyramid-scheme allegations as a matter of "a few distributors who in their enthusiasm have been overzealous in some of their marketing activities."[7]
In 2010, Nu Skin was listed among Forbes "100 Most Trustworthy Companies".[32]
In 2012, Stanford University sent a cease and desist letter to halt the use of the name of one of its researchers in Nu Skin's advertising claims.[33] Stanford later released a statement regarding its long-standing, research-based relationship with Nu Skin explaining that the letter was sent to Nu Skin as a request by Stuart Kim, PhD, a professor at Stanford. Kim requested in the letter that his name be removed from Nu Skin's marketing materials as he is no longer involved with research funded by Nu Skin. However, the letter did not recognize the existing research relationship between Stanford and Nu Skin. Stanford apologized for any misunderstandings that may have resulted.[34]
Also in 2012, Citron Research issued a report "stating that Nu Skin's sales model on mainland China, the fastest growing market in direct-selling, amounted to an illegal multi-level marketing scheme."[33] Nu Skin dismissed the claims, calling its sales model in China kosher and stating that it had no plans to change its business model in China.[35] In January 2014, the Chinese government announced that it planned to investigate Nu Skin for allegedly operating an illegal pyramid scheme, causing the company's stock price to plunge. At least one analyst is optimistic about the outcome.[36] Following the investigation, it was announced in March 2014 that the Chinese government would fine Nu Skin for approximately $540,000 dollars due to illegal sales as well as making false product claims.[37]
In February 2014, a securities fraud class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Utah against Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc. on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired the common stock of the Company during the period from July 10, 2013 through January 16, 2014.[38]
Evaluation of supplements[edit]
The Pharmanex LifePak Anti-Aging supplement was tested by ConsumerLab.com, and was reported as failing the overall review due to failing to clearly indicate its total Vitamin A content per FDA requirements.[39]
Political activities[edit]
In 2011, two Utah-incorporated business entities linked to top executives of Nu Skin each made a $1 million contribution to Restore Our Future, a "Super PAC" established by former aides to US presidential candidate Mitt Romney to support his bid for the White House.[40][41]
Beginning in 1989 Jason Chaffetz worked as a professional spokesman for the company for about ten years.[42] Chaffetz was elected U.S. Representative of Utah's 3rd congressional district in 2008.

In the early 1990s, Nu Skin was investigated by the states of Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Florida, Illinois, Ohio, and Michigan over allegations of misleading marketing practices.[8] Ultimately, in 1992 the company settled with 5 of these states, admitting no wrongdoing but agreeing to pay the states' investigative costs, refund disgruntled distributors, and revamp its promotional practices.[25][26][27][28] However, the Connecticut Attorney General did not agree to those terms and sued Nu Skin, charging the company with misleading its distributors and operating a pyramid scheme.[8][29][30] Nu Skin admitted to no wrongdoing or violation of law and paid Connecticut $85,000 for consumer-protection programs as part of a settlement.[31]
In 1997, the Attorney General of Pennsylvania sued Nu Skin, alleging that the company operated a pyramid scheme through a subsidiary, QIQ Connections. The Attorney General's office alleged that distributors paid for the right to market technology services which did not, in fact, exist. Nu Skin discontinued the QIQ subsidiary, allowing those who had paid QIQ to transition to Big Planet, another Nu Skin interest marketing Internet technology. The president of Big Planet described the pyramid-scheme allegations as a matter of "a few distributors who in their enthusiasm have been overzealous in some of their marketing activities."[7]
In 2010, Nu Skin was listed among Forbes "100 Most Trustworthy Companies".[32]
In 2012, Stanford University sent a cease and desist letter to halt the use of the name of one of its researchers in Nu Skin's advertising claims.[33] Stanford later released a statement regarding its long-standing, research-based relationship with Nu Skin explaining that the letter was sent to Nu Skin as a request by Stuart Kim, PhD, a professor at Stanford. Kim requested in the letter that his name be removed from Nu Skin's marketing materials as he is no longer involved with research funded by Nu Skin. However, the letter did not recognize the existing research relationship between Stanford and Nu Skin. Stanford apologized for any misunderstandings that may have resulted.[34]
Also in 2012, Citron Research issued a report "stating that Nu Skin's sales model on mainland China, the fastest growing market in direct-selling, amounted to an illegal multi-level marketing scheme."[33] Nu Skin dismissed the claims, calling its sales model in China kosher and stating that it had no plans to change its business model in China.[35] In January 2014, the Chinese government announced that it planned to investigate Nu Skin for allegedly operating an illegal pyramid scheme, causing the company's stock price to plunge. At least one analyst is optimistic about the outcome.[36] Following the investigation, it was announced in March 2014 that the Chinese government would fine Nu Skin for approximately $540,000 dollars due to illegal sales as well as making false product claims.[37]
In February 2014, a securities fraud class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Utah against Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc. on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired the common stock of the Company during the period from July 10, 2013 through January 16, 2014.[38]
Evaluation of supplements[edit]
The Pharmanex LifePak Anti-Aging supplement was tested by ConsumerLab.com, and was reported as failing the overall review due to failing to clearly indicate its total Vitamin A content per FDA requirements.[39]
Political activities[edit]
In 2011, two Utah-incorporated business entities linked to top executives of Nu Skin each made a $1 million contribution to Restore Our Future, a "Super PAC" established by former aides to US presidential candidate Mitt Romney to support his bid for the White House.[40][41]
Beginning in 1989 Jason Chaffetz worked as a professional spokesman for the company for about ten years.[42] Chaffetz was elected U.S. Representative of Utah's 3rd congressional district in 2008.

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc. and NSE Products, Inc. v GLTEC Corporation









 
national arbitration forum
 
DECISION
 
Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc.
and NSE Products, Inc. v. GLTEC Corporation
Claim Number: FA1212001476883
PARTIES
Complainant
is Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc. and NSE Products, Inc. (“Complainant”),
represented by Janet Shih Hajek of Holland & Hart LLP,
Colorado, USA.  Respondent is GLTEC Corporation (“Respondent”), Vietnam.
 
REGISTRAR
AND DISPUTED DOMAIN NAME
The
domain name at issue is <nuskinbg.net>, registered with OnlineNIC,
Inc.
 
PANEL
The
undersigned certifies that he has acted independently and impartially and to
the best of his knowledge has no known conflict in serving as Panelist in this
proceeding.
 
David
A. Einhorn appointed as Panelist.
 
PROCEDURAL
HISTORY
Complainant
submitted a Complaint to the National Arbitration Forum electronically on December
20, 2012; the National Arbitration Forum received payment on December 20, 2012.
 
On
December 26, 2012, OnlineNIC, Inc. confirmed by e-mail to the National
Arbitration Forum that the <nuskinbg.net> domain name is
registered with OnlineNIC, Inc. and that Respondent is the current registrant
of the names.  OnlineNIC, Inc. has verified that Respondent is bound by the OnlineNIC,
Inc. registration agreement and has thereby agreed to resolve domain disputes
brought by third parties in accordance with ICANN’s Uniform Domain Name Dispute
Resolution Policy (the “Policy”).
 
On
December 27, 2012, the Forum served the Complaint and all Annexes, including a Written
Notice of the Complaint, setting a deadline of January 16, 2013 by which
Respondent could file a Response to the Complaint, via e-mail to all entities
and persons listed on Respondent’s registration as technical, administrative,
and billing contacts, and to postmaster@nuskinbg.net.  Also on December 27,
2012, the Written Notice of the Complaint, notifying Respondent of the e-mail
addresses served and the deadline for a Response, was transmitted to Respondent
via post and fax, to all entities and persons listed on Respondent’s
registration as technical, administrative and billing contacts.
 
Having
received no response from Respondent, the National Arbitration Forum
transmitted to the parties a Notification of Respondent Default.
 
On
January 28, 2013, pursuant to Complainant's request to have the dispute decided
by a single-member Panel, the National Arbitration Forum appointed David A.
Einhorn as Panelist.
 
Having
reviewed the communications records, the Administrative Panel (the
"Panel") finds that the National Arbitration Forum has discharged its
responsibility under Paragraph 2(a) of the Rules for Uniform Domain Name
Dispute Resolution Policy (the "Rules") "to employ reasonably
available means calculated to achieve actual notice to Respondent" through
submission of Electronic and Written Notices, as defined in Rule 1 and Rule 2.
Therefore, the Panel may issue its decision based on the documents submitted
and in accordance with the ICANN Policy, ICANN Rules, the National Arbitration
Forum's Supplemental Rules and any rules and principles of law that the Panel
deems applicable, without the benefit of any response from Respondent.
 
RELIEF SOUGHT
Complainant
requests that the domain name be transferred from Respondent
to Complainant.
 
PARTIES'
CONTENTIONS
A.
Complainant


Complainant,
      Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc., is an international innovator of anti-aging
      and skin care products. Complainant operates in 53 markets worldwide and
      has more than 825,000 independent distributors. 
Complainant
      owns and provides evidence of trademark registrations for the NU SKIN
      mark with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) (e.g.,
      Reg. No. 1,542,160, registered June 6, 1989) and the National Office of
      Industrial Property of Vietnam (“NOIP”) (e.g., Reg. No. 18, 304,
      registered March 1, 1995).  
Respondent’s
      <nuskinbg.net> domain name is confusingly similar to
      Complainant’s NU SKIN mark because it fully incorporates Complainant’s
      mark and merely adds the letters “BG,” which is a likely abbreviation for
      Complainant’s authorized distributor, Bryson International Group (a/k/a
      “Big Group”). 
Respondent has no rights or legitimate interests
      in the disputed domain name.


                                         
i.    Respondent
is not commonly known by the domain name where the WHOIS information identifies
“GLTEC Corporation” as the registrant, not an entity identified as “NU SKIN” or
“NU SKIN BG.” There is no relationship between Complainant and
Respondent giving rise to any license, permission or other right by which
Respondent could own or use any domain name incorporating Complainant’s mark.
                                        
ii.    Respondent
is clearly trading on the business reputation of Complainant by using
Complainant’s NU SKIN mark and company information. 
                                       
iii.    Respondent
is using the disputed domain name for a website in Vietnamese that presents
itself as “Big Group Vietnam,” which allegedly promotes the NU SKIN products
and prominently features Complainant’s NU SKIN trademarks throughout the
website. 


Respondent has registered and is using the
      disputed domain name in bad faith.


                                         
i.    Respondent
is disrupting Complainant’s business by diverting customers away from
Complainant to its impostor website and also to link to third-party consumer
sites unaffiliated with Complainant. 
                                        
ii.    Respondent
is using the disputed domain name to divert Internet users to a commercial
website that impersonates Complainant and Complainant’s authorized distributor
in order to create confusion with Complainant’s business.
                                       
iii.    Respondent is using the
disputed domain name to impersonate Complainant.
                                      
iv.    Respondent
clearly had notice of Complainant’s rights in the NU SKIN mark due to
Complainant’s prior and incontestable trademark registrations, worldwide use,
and favorable media coverage.


Respondent registered the <nuskinbg.net>
      domain name on July 23, 2012.



 
 
B.
Respondent
Respondent
failed to submit a Response in this proceeding.
 
PRELIMINARY
ISSUE: MULTIPLE COMPLAINANTS
 
In
the instant proceedings, there are two Complainants.  Paragraph 3(a) of the Rules for Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution
Policy (the “Rules”) provides that “[a]ny person or entity may initiate
an administrative proceeding by submitting a complaint.”  The National
Arbitration Forum’s Supplemental Rule 1(e) defines “The Party Initiating a
Complaint Concerning a Domain Name Registration” as a “single person or entity
claiming to have rights in the domain name, or multiple persons or entities who
have a sufficient nexus who can each claim to have rights to all domain names
listed in the Complaint.”  There are two Complainants in this matter: Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc. and NSE Products, Inc.
Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc. is the parent company of wholly-owned subsidiary NSE
Products, Inc.
 
Previous
panels have interpreted the Forum’s Supplemental Rule 1(e) to allow multiple
parties to proceed as one party where they can show a sufficient link to each
other.  For example, in Vancouver Org. Comm. for the 2010 Olympic and
Paralymic Games & Int’l Olympic Comm. v. Malik, FA 666119 (Nat. Arb.
Forum May 12, 2006), the panel stated:
 
It has been accepted that it is permissible for two
complainants to submit a single complaint if they can demonstrate a link between
the two entities such as a relationship involving a license, a partnership or
an affiliation that would establish the reason for the parties bringing the
complaint as one entity.
 
The
Panel accepts that the evidence in the complaint is sufficient to establish a
sufficient nexus or link between Complainants and will therefore treat them as
a single entity in this proceeding.
 
FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION
Paragraph
15(a) of the Rules instructs this Panel to "decide a complaint on the
basis of the statements and documents submitted in accordance with the Policy,
these Rules and any rules and principles of law that it deems applicable."
 
Paragraph
4(a) of the Policy requires that Complainant must prove each of the following
three elements to obtain an order that a domain name should be cancelled or
transferred:
 
(1) 
the
domain name registered by Respondent is identical or confusingly similar to a
trademark or service mark in which Complainant has rights; and
(2) 
Respondent
has no rights or legitimate interests in respect of the domain name; and
(3) 
the
domain name has been registered and is being used in bad faith.
 
In
view of Respondent's failure to submit a response, the Panel shall decide this
administrative proceeding on the basis of Complainant's undisputed
representations pursuant to paragraphs 5(e), 14(a) and 15(a) of the Rules and
draw such inferences it considers appropriate pursuant to paragraph 14(b) of
the Rules.  The Panel is entitled to accept all reasonable allegations and
inferences set forth in the Complaint as true unless the evidence is clearly
contradictory.  See Vertical Solutions Mgmt., Inc. v.
webnet-marketing, inc., FA 95095 (Nat. Arb. Forum July 31, 2000) (holding
that the respondent’s failure to respond allows all reasonable inferences of
fact in the allegations of the complaint to be deemed true); see also Talk
City, Inc. v. Robertson, D2000-0009 (WIPO Feb. 29, 2000) (“In the absence
of a response, it is appropriate to accept as true all allegations of the
Complaint.”).
 
Identical
and/or Confusingly Similar
 
Complainant
asserts that it is an international innovator of anti-aging and skin care
products. Complainant contends that it operates in 53 markets worldwide and has
more than 825,000 independent distributors. Complainant shows that it owns
trademark registrations for the NU SKIN mark with the USPTO (e.g., Reg.
No. 1,542,160, registered June 6, 1989) and the NOIP for the NU SKIN mark (e.g.,
Reg. No. 18,304, filed March 1, 1995).  The Panel notes that Respondent appears
to reside in Vietnam. Therefore, the Panel concludes that Complainant’s
registrations of the NU SKIN mark with the USPTO and the NOIP are sufficient to
establish its rights in the marks under Policy ¶ 4(a)(i). See Honeywell
Int’l Inc. v. r9.net, FA 445594 (Nat. Arb. Forum May 23, 2005) (finding the
complainant’s numerous registrations for its HONEYWELL mark throughout the
world sufficient to establish the complainant’s rights in the mark under the
Policy ¶ 4(a)(i)).
 
Complainant
asserts that Respondent’s <nuskinbg.net> domain name is confusingly similar to
Complainant’s NU SKIN mark because it fully incorporates Complainant’s mark and
merely adds the letters “BG,” which is a likely abbreviation for Complainant’s
authorized distributor, Bryson International Group (aka Big Group). The Panel therefore
finds that the addition of these letters does not distinguish Respondent’s
disputed domain name from Complainant’s mark under Policy ¶ 4(a)(i). Accordingly,
the Panel concludes that Respondent’s <nuskinbg.net> domain name is confusingly similar to
Complainant’s NU SKIN mark under Policy ¶ 4(a)(i). 
 
 
Rights or
Legitimate Interests
 
Complainant contends that Respondent is not commonly
known by the domain name since the WHOIS information identifies “GLTEC
Corporation” as the registrant, not an entity identified as “NU SKIN” or “NU
SKIN BG.”  Complainant asserts that Respondent has no trademark applications or
registrations known to Complainant for “NU SKIN.” Complainant also contends
that there is no relationship between Complainant and Respondent that would
give rise to any license, permission, or other right by which Respondent could
own or use any domain name incorporating the NU SKIN mark. The Panel notes that
Respondent has not submitted any evidence showing that it is commonly known by
the disputed domain name. Thus, the Panel determines that Respondent is not
commonly known by the disputed domain name under Policy ¶ 4(c)(ii). See Coppertown
Drive-Thru Sys., LLC v. Snowden,
FA 715089 (Nat. Arb. Forum
July 17, 2006) (concluding that the respondent was not commonly known by the
<coppertown.com> domain name where there was no evidence in the record,
including the WHOIS information, suggesting that the respondent was commonly
known by the disputed domain name).
 
Complainant further contends that Respondent is using
the disputed domain name for a website in Vietnamese that presents itself as
“Big Group Vietnam,” which allegedly promotes the NU SKIN products and
prominently features Complainant’s NU SKIN trademarks throughout the website.
Complainant asserts that the infringing website holds itself out to viewers as
if it is Complainant or a legitimate authorized distributor of Complainant.
Complainant states that the infringing website also copies, without permission,
photographs and images from Complainant’s website at <nuskin.com>,
including the photograph of five individuals sitting poolside looking over the
ocean. Additionally, Complainant notes that the resolving website’s “About Us”
page  includes a photograph and description of the founders of Complainant’s
company and speaks as it if it is Complainant. Complainant asserts that the
infringing  website in every way attempts to impersonate Complainant, its
founders and its authorized distributor, Big Group. Complainant contends that
Respondent is clearly trading on the business reputation of Complainant by
using Complainant’s NU SKIN mark and company information. Complainant asserts
that the only explanation for Respondent’s use of the NU SKIN mark as part of a
domain name is clearly to trade on the goodwill of Complainant and to appear as
if Respondent is Complainant or an authorized distributor of Complainant. The
Panel agrees, and finds that Respondent’s attempt to pass itself off as
Complainant is not a bona fide offering of goods or services under Policy
¶ 4(c)(i) or a legitimate noncommercial or fair use under Policy ¶ 4(c)(iii). See
Kmart
of Mich., Inc. v. Cone,
FA 655014 (Nat. Arb. Forum April 25, 2006) (The panel found the respondent’s
attempt to pass itself of as the complainant was not a bona fide
offering of goods or services pursuant to Policy ¶ 4(c)(i), or a legitimate
noncommercial or fair use pursuant to Policy ¶ 4(c)(iii) when the respondent
used the disputed domain name to present users with a website that was nearly
identical to the complainant’s website).
 
Thus,
Complainant has also satisfied Policy ¶
4(a)(ii).
 
Registration
and Use in Bad Faith
 
Complainant contends that Respondent clearly had notice
of Complainant’s rights in the NU SKIN mark due to Complainant’s prior and
incontestable trademark registrations, worldwide use, and favorable media
coverage. The Panel determines that Respondent had actual knowledge of Complainant's
mark and rights due to Complainant’s worldwide use of the NU SKIN mark and
Respondent’s aforementioned impersonation of Complainant, and therefore finds
that Respondent registered the disputed domain name in bad faith under Policy  
¶ 4(a)(iii). 
 
Complainant contends that Respondent is disrupting
Complainant’s business by diverting customers away from Complainant to its
impostor website and also linking to third party consumer sites unaffiliated
with Complainant. Complainant asserts that Respondent is utilizing a hotline
telephone number that is invalid. Complainant further contends that actions are
clearly being taken to disrupt Complainant’s business and to harm the
reputation and goodwill that Complainant has developed in its NU SKIN mark. The
Panel notes that Respondent’s disputed domain name resolves to a website that
presents itself as if it were Complainant or Complainant’s authorized
distributor and appears to offer skin products that directly compete with
Complainant. The Panel finds that Respondent’s use of the disputed domain name
to offer competing products disrupts Complainant’s business, evidencing bad
faith use and registration under Policy ¶ 4(b)(iii). See DatingDirect.com Ltd. v.
Aston, FA 593977 (Nat. Arb. Forum Dec.
28, 2005) (“Respondent is appropriating Complainant’s mark to divert
Complainant’s customers to Respondent’s competing business. The Panel found
this diversion is evidence of bad faith registration and use pursuant to Policy
¶ 4(b)(iii).”).
 
Complainant asserts that Respondent is using the
disputed domain name to divert Internet users to a commercial website that
impersonates Complainant and Complainant’s authorized distributor in order to
create confusion with Complainant’s business. Complainant contends that
Respondent is attempting to impersonate Complainant through its use of the NU
SKIN mark and the letters “BG” in its disputed domain name, which is a likely
abbreviation for Complainant’s authorized distributor, Bryson International
Group (aka Big Group). The Panel notes that Respondent’s disputed domain name
resolves to a website that appears to offer skin products that directly compete
with Complainant. The Panel finds that Respondent’s use of the disputed domain
name to intentionally divert Internet users for Respondent’s own commercial
benefit shows bad faith use and registration under Policy ¶ 4(b)(iv). See Computerized Sec. Sys.,
Inc. v. Hu,
FA 157321 (Nat. Arb. Forum June 23, 2003) (finding that the respondent’s use of
the <saflock.com> domain name to offer goods competing with the
complainant’s illustrates the respondent’s bad faith registration and use of
the domain name pursuant to Policy ¶ 4(b)(iv)).
 
Complainant
asserts that Respondent is using the disputed domain name to impersonate
Complainant.  Complainant contends that
Respondent’s resolving website, which is in Vietnamese, presents itself as “Big
Group Vietnam,” which allegedly promotes the NU SKIN products and prominently
features Complainant’s NU SKIN trademarks throughout the website. Complainant
asserts that the infringing website holds itself out to viewers as if it is
Complainant or a legitimate authorized distributor of Complainant. Complainant
states that the infringing website also copies, without permission, photographs
and images from Complainant’s website at <nuskin.com>, including the
photograph of five individuals sitting poolside looking over the ocean. Additionally,
Complainant notes that the resolving website’s “About Us” page lists includes a
photograph and description of the founders of Complainant’s company and speaks
as it if it is Complainant. Complainant argues that the infringing  website in
every way attempts to impersonate Complainant, its founders and its authorized
distributor, Big Group. The Panel finds that Respondent’s use of the
disputed domain name to impersonate and attempt to pass itself off as
Complainant evidences bad faith use and registration under Policy ¶ 4(a)(iii). See
Am. Int’l Group, Inc. v. Busby, FA 156251 (Nat. Arb. Forum May 30, 2003)
(finding that the disputed domain name was registered and used in bad faith
where the respondent hosted a website that “duplicated Complainant’s mark and
logo, giving every appearance of being associated or affiliated with
Complainant’s business . . . to perpetrate a fraud upon
individual shareholders who respected the goodwill surrounding the AIG mark”).
 
Thus, Complainant has also satisfied Policy ¶ 4(a)(iii).

 
DECISION
Having
established all three elements required under the ICANN Policy, the Panel
concludes that relief shall be GRANTED.
 
Accordingly,
it is Ordered that the <nuskinbg.net> domain name be TRANSFERRED
from Respondent to Complainant.

Nu Skin Enterprises is an American multilevel marketing company which develops and sells personal care products and dietary supplements (under the Pharmanex brand).[4] Nu Skin was founded in 1984 in Provo, Utah.[5] The company originated in the U.S. and began its first foreign operation in Canada in 1990. One year later, the company began operations in Asia with the opening of Hong Kong.[6] In 1996 the company listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The company markets its products in 54 markets through a network of approximately 1.2 million independent distributors.[3]
In the 1990s, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) investigated Nu Skin over complaints of its multilevel marketing practices.[7] In 1992, Nu Skin reached settlements with 5 states which had accused the company of deceptive advertising and overstating the income earned by distributors.[8] In 1994, following an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the company paid $1 million and signed a consent decree prohibiting it from making deceptive or unsubstantiated claims about its products.[9] In 1997, the company paid an additional $1.5 million to the FTC to settle ongoing allegations of unsubstantiated promotional claims.[10] In January 2014, the Chinese government announced that it was investigating Nu Skin following a People's Daily newspaper report calling it a "suspected illegal pyramid scheme." In 2016, Nu Skin settled $47 Million for operating a pyramid scheme after a being sued by China in a Utah federal court.[11] Nu Skin was also forced to pay another $750,000 for bribing a top Chinese official with funds from Nu Skin's charitable division after a US Securities and Exchange Commission probe.[12]

Brands and products[edit]
Under the Nu Skin and Pharmanex brands, the company develops and sells more than 200 personal care products marketed as helping people look and feel younger.[13] In the late 1990s, Nu Skin invested in Big Planet, a multi-level marketing company selling Internet services. The New York Times noted that Big Planet appeared to recruit people "even if they have little knowledge of the technology that they are supposed to be selling." A representative of the company stated: "I believe people who have never touched a computer before can become hugely wealthy in this business."[7]
In 1996, Nu Skin acquired Pharmanex, a dietary-supplement company.[14] A portion of proceeds from some product lines is donated internally to the Nu Skin Force for Good Foundation.[15] The company owns patent on a device developed by Pharmanex called a "BioPhotonic Scanner", which is designed to measure the carotenoid level in skin. According to Women's Health Letter, the device is a "scam" since it is designed merely to help sell more supplements: Nu Skin's 2002 annual report stated: "As customers track their skin carotenoid content, we believe they will be motivated to consistently consume LifePak for longer periods of time".[16]
In 2009, Nu Skin began working with LifeGen Technologies, a genomics company based in Madison, Wisconsin,[17] Nu Skin acquired LifeGen in December, 2011. LifeGen's genetic database aided in the development of Nu Skin's products, launching the ageLOC brand.[18]
Business model and sponsorships[edit]
Nu Skin Enterprises' utilizes a multi-level marketing business model. Each distributor markets products directly to potential customers, and can also recruit and train customers to become distributors. Distributors are paid from the retail markup on products they are able to sell personally, as well as a performance bonus based on the sales of distributors they have recruited.[19] Nu Skin states that it pays approximately 43 percent of its product revenue in sales compensation.[20]
Since the beginning of the 1992–93 professional basketball season, Nu Skin has sponsored the Utah Jazz Dancers.[21] Nu Skin also sponsors the Brigham Young University athletic program and the America's Freedom Festival at Provo, one of the nation's largest Independence Day celebrations.[22][23][24]
Scrutiny and reception[edit]
In the early 1990s, Nu Skin was investigated by the states of Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Florida, Illinois, Ohio, and Michigan over allegations of misleading marketing practices.[8] Ultimately, in 1992 the company settled with 5 of these states, admitting no wrongdoing but agreeing to pay the states' investigative costs, refund disgruntled distributors, and revamp its promotional practices.[25][26][27][28] However, the Connecticut Attorney General did not agree to those terms and sued Nu Skin, charging the company with misleading its distributors and operating a pyramid scheme.[8][29][30] Nu Skin admitted to no wrongdoing or violation of law and paid Connecticut $85,000 for consumer-protection programs as part of a settlement.[31]
In 1997, the Attorney General of Pennsylvania sued Nu Skin, alleging that the company operated a pyramid scheme through a subsidiary, QIQ Connections. The Attorney General's office alleged that distributors paid for the right to market technology services which did not, in fact, exist. Nu Skin discontinued the QIQ subsidiary, allowing those who had paid QIQ to transition to Big Planet, another Nu Skin interest marketing Internet technology. The president of Big Planet described the pyramid-scheme allegations as a matter of "a few distributors who in their enthusiasm have been overzealous in some of their marketing activities."[7]
In 2010, Nu Skin was listed among Forbes "100 Most Trustworthy Companies".[32]
In 2012, Stanford University sent a cease and desist letter to halt the use of the name of one of its researchers in Nu Skin's advertising claims.[33] Stanford later released a statement regarding its long-standing, research-based relationship with Nu Skin explaining that the letter was sent to Nu Skin as a request by Stuart Kim, PhD, a professor at Stanford. Kim requested in the letter that his name be removed from Nu Skin's marketing materials as he is no longer involved with research funded by Nu Skin. However, the letter did not recognize the existing research relationship between Stanford and Nu Skin. Stanford apologized for any misunderstandings that may have resulted.[34]
Also in 2012, Citron Research issued a report "stating that Nu Skin's sales model on mainland China, the fastest growing market in direct-selling, amounted to an illegal multi-level marketing scheme."[33] Nu Skin dismissed the claims, calling its sales model in China kosher and stating that it had no plans to change its business model in China.[35] In January 2014, the Chinese government announced that it planned to investigate Nu Skin for allegedly operating an illegal pyramid scheme, causing the company's stock price to plunge. At least one analyst is optimistic about the outcome.[36] Following the investigation, it was announced in March 2014 that the Chinese government would fine Nu Skin for approximately $540,000 dollars due to illegal sales as well as making false product claims.[37]
In February 2014, a securities fraud class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Utah against Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc. on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired the common stock of the Company during the period from July 10, 2013 through January 16, 2014.[38]
Evaluation of supplements[edit]
The Pharmanex LifePak Anti-Aging supplement was tested by ConsumerLab.com, and was reported as failing the overall review due to failing to clearly indicate its total Vitamin A content per FDA requirements.[39]
Political activities[edit]
In 2011, two Utah-incorporated business entities linked to top executives of Nu Skin each made a $1 million contribution to Restore Our Future, a "Super PAC" established by former aides to US presidential candidate Mitt Romney to support his bid for the White House.[40][41]
Beginning in 1989 Jason Chaffetz worked as a professional spokesman for the company for about ten years.[42] Chaffetz was elected U.S. Representative of Utah's 3rd congressional district in 2008.

Nu Skin Enterprises is an American multilevel marketing company which develops and sells personal care products and dietary supplements (under the Pharmanex brand).[4] Nu Skin was founded in 1984 in Provo, Utah.[5] The company originated in the U.S. and began its first foreign operation in Canada in 1990. One year later, the company began operations in Asia with the opening of Hong Kong.[6] In 1996 the company listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The company markets its products in 54 markets through a network of approximately 1.2 million independent distributors.[3]
In the 1990s, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) investigated Nu Skin over complaints of its multilevel marketing practices.[7] In 1992, Nu Skin reached settlements with 5 states which had accused the company of deceptive advertising and overstating the income earned by distributors.[8] In 1994, following an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the company paid $1 million and signed a consent decree prohibiting it from making deceptive or unsubstantiated claims about its products.[9] In 1997, the company paid an additional $1.5 million to the FTC to settle ongoing allegations of unsubstantiated promotional claims.[10] In January 2014, the Chinese government announced that it was investigating Nu Skin following a People's Daily newspaper report calling it a "suspected illegal pyramid scheme." In 2016, Nu Skin settled $47 Million for operating a pyramid scheme after a being sued by China in a Utah federal court.[11] Nu Skin was also forced to pay another $750,000 for bribing a top Chinese official with funds from Nu Skin's charitable division after a US Securities and Exchange Commission probe.[12]

Brands and products[edit]
Under the Nu Skin and Pharmanex brands, the company develops and sells more than 200 personal care products marketed as helping people look and feel younger.[13] In the late 1990s, Nu Skin invested in Big Planet, a multi-level marketing company selling Internet services. The New York Times noted that Big Planet appeared to recruit people "even if they have little knowledge of the technology that they are supposed to be selling." A representative of the company stated: "I believe people who have never touched a computer before can become hugely wealthy in this business."[7]
In 1996, Nu Skin acquired Pharmanex, a dietary-supplement company.[14] A portion of proceeds from some product lines is donated internally to the Nu Skin Force for Good Foundation.[15] The company owns patent on a device developed by Pharmanex called a "BioPhotonic Scanner", which is designed to measure the carotenoid level in skin. According to Women's Health Letter, the device is a "scam" since it is designed merely to help sell more supplements: Nu Skin's 2002 annual report stated: "As customers track their skin carotenoid content, we believe they will be motivated to consistently consume LifePak for longer periods of time".[16]
In 2009, Nu Skin began working with LifeGen Technologies, a genomics company based in Madison, Wisconsin,[17] Nu Skin acquired LifeGen in December, 2011. LifeGen's genetic database aided in the development of Nu Skin's products, launching the ageLOC brand.[18]
Business model and sponsorships[edit]
Nu Skin Enterprises' utilizes a multi-level marketing business model. Each distributor markets products directly to potential customers, and can also recruit and train customers to become distributors. Distributors are paid from the retail markup on products they are able to sell personally, as well as a performance bonus based on the sales of distributors they have recruited.[19] Nu Skin states that it pays approximately 43 percent of its product revenue in sales compensation.[20]
Since the beginning of the 1992–93 professional basketball season, Nu Skin has sponsored the Utah Jazz Dancers.[21] Nu Skin also sponsors the Brigham Young University athletic program and the America's Freedom Festival at Provo, one of the nation's largest Independence Day celebrations.[22][23][24]
Scrutiny and reception[edit]
In the early 1990s, Nu Skin was investigated by the states of Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Florida, Illinois, Ohio, and Michigan over allegations of misleading marketing practices.[8] Ultimately, in 1992 the company settled with 5 of these states, admitting no wrongdoing but agreeing to pay the states' investigative costs, refund disgruntled distributors, and revamp its promotional practices.[25][26][27][28] However, the Connecticut Attorney General did not agree to those terms and sued Nu Skin, charging the company with misleading its distributors and operating a pyramid scheme.[8][29][30] Nu Skin admitted to no wrongdoing or violation of law and paid Connecticut $85,000 for consumer-protection programs as part of a settlement.[31]
In 1997, the Attorney General of Pennsylvania sued Nu Skin, alleging that the company operated a pyramid scheme through a subsidiary, QIQ Connections. The Attorney General's office alleged that distributors paid for the right to market technology services which did not, in fact, exist. Nu Skin discontinued the QIQ subsidiary, allowing those who had paid QIQ to transition to Big Planet, another Nu Skin interest marketing Internet technology. The president of Big Planet described the pyramid-scheme allegations as a matter of "a few distributors who in their enthusiasm have been overzealous in some of their marketing activities."[7]
In 2010, Nu Skin was listed among Forbes "100 Most Trustworthy Companies".[32]
In 2012, Stanford University sent a cease and desist letter to halt the use of the name of one of its researchers in Nu Skin's advertising claims.[33] Stanford later released a statement regarding its long-standing, research-based relationship with Nu Skin explaining that the letter was sent to Nu Skin as a request by Stuart Kim, PhD, a professor at Stanford. Kim requested in the letter that his name be removed from Nu Skin's marketing materials as he is no longer involved with research funded by Nu Skin. However, the letter did not recognize the existing research relationship between Stanford and Nu Skin. Stanford apologized for any misunderstandings that may have resulted.[34]
Also in 2012, Citron Research issued a report "stating that Nu Skin's sales model on mainland China, the fastest growing market in direct-selling, amounted to an illegal multi-level marketing scheme."[33] Nu Skin dismissed the claims, calling its sales model in China kosher and stating that it had no plans to change its business model in China.[35] In January 2014, the Chinese government announced that it planned to investigate Nu Skin for allegedly operating an illegal pyramid scheme, causing the company's stock price to plunge. At least one analyst is optimistic about the outcome.[36] Following the investigation, it was announced in March 2014 that the Chinese government would fine Nu Skin for approximately $540,000 dollars due to illegal sales as well as making false product claims.[37]
In February 2014, a securities fraud class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Utah against Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc. on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired the common stock of the Company during the period from July 10, 2013 through January 16, 2014.[38]
Evaluation of supplements[edit]
The Pharmanex LifePak Anti-Aging supplement was tested by ConsumerLab.com, and was reported as failing the overall review due to failing to clearly indicate its total Vitamin A content per FDA requirements.[39]
Political activities[edit]
In 2011, two Utah-incorporated business entities linked to top executives of Nu Skin each made a $1 million contribution to Restore Our Future, a "Super PAC" established by former aides to US presidential candidate Mitt Romney to support his bid for the White House.[40][41]
Beginning in 1989 Jason Chaffetz worked as a professional spokesman for the company for about ten years.[42] Chaffetz was elected U.S. Representative of Utah's 3rd congressional district in 2008.

However, the letter did not recognize the existing research relationship between Stanford and Nu Skin. Stanford apologized for any misunderstandings that may have resulted.[34]
Also in 2012, Citron Research issued a report "stating that Nu Skin's sales model on mainland China, the fastest growing market in direct-selling, amounted to an illegal multi-level marketing scheme."[33] Nu Skin dismissed the claims, calling its sales model in China kosher and stating that it had no plans to change its business model in China.[35] In January 2014, the Chinese government announced that it planned to investigate Nu Skin for allegedly operating an illegal pyramid scheme, causing the company's stock price to plunge. At least one analyst is optimistic about the outcome.[36] Following the investigation, it was announced in March 2014 that the Chinese government would fine Nu Skin for approximately $540,000 dollars due to illegal sales as well as making false product claims.[37]
In February 2014, a securities fraud class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Utah against Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc. on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired the common stock of the Company during the period from July 10, 2013 through January 16, 2014.[38]
Evaluation of supplements[edit]
The Pharmanex LifePak Anti-Aging supplement was tested by ConsumerLab.com, and was reported as failing the overall review due to failing to clearly indicate its total Vitamin A content per FDA requirements.[39]
Political activities[edit]
In 2011, two Utah-incorporated business entities linked to top executives of Nu Skin each made a $1 million contribution to Restore Our Future, a "Super PAC" established by former aides to US presidential candidate Mitt Romney to support his bid for the White House.[40][41]
Beginning in 1989 Jason Chaffetz worked as a professional spokesman for the company for about ten years.[42] Chaffetz was elected U.S. Representative of Utah's 3rd congressional district in 2008.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
