“Whoa! It’s like Spotify but for academic articles.” -@Phil_Robichaud








Superposition of Broadcast and Unicast in Wireless Cellular Systems

            Donghee Kim, Donghee Kim; Khan, F.; Rensburg, C.; Zhouyue Pi, Zhouyue Pi; Seokhyun Yoon, Seokhyun Yoon
        

            Practical application of superposition coding in multiplexing broadcast and unicast for OFDM-based mobile cellular systems is discussed. Superposition coding, whose gain is increased as the superposed signals have larger difference in signal-to interference-plus-noise ratio, is well matched for unicast and broadcast in a single-frequency network configuration. Combined with interference cancellation technique, broadcast signals from multiple base stations can be cancelled in a single step, minimizing the interference from broadcast to unicast. Issues related with scheduling and strategy for time, frequency and power resource sharing between broadcast and unicast are discussed. The application of superposed broadcast and unicast is then extended to MIMO systems. Simulation results in a practical mobile cellular environment are also provided, showing significant throughput gain of superposed broadcast and unicast.

ELECTRONIC DEVICE INCLUDING LOOP-SHAPED ANTENNA



Publication number:  20170207519
                                            

Abstract:  An electronic device according to various embodiments of the present invention may comprise: a body which is made of a conductive material and has both ends curvedly extending to be adjacent to each other so as to have a loop shape; a communication module arranged on the body; a feeding line which extends from the communication module and is arranged to cross a gap between both ends of the body; and at least one connection terminal for connecting the feeding line to the body, wherein the body can receive a feeding signal from the communication module through the feeding line, and transmit/receive a wireless signal. The above-mentioned electronic device can be implemented variously according to embodiments.

Methods and apparatus to improve performance and enable fast decoding of transmissions with multiple code blocks



Patent number:  9590765
                                            

Abstract:  Resource elements from multiple code blocks are separated into different groups, and the code bits of the resource elements within each group are decoded without waiting for a completed reception of a transport block to start decoding. Coded bits from multiple code blocks are similarly separated into different groups, and code blocks containing coded bits within each group are decoded. A first CRC is attached to the transport block and a second CRC is attached to at least one code block from the transport block. An improved channel interleaver maps coded bits of different code blocks to modulation symbols, and maps modulation symbols to time, frequency, and spatial resources, to make sure each code block receives approximately the same level of protection.

Methods and apparatus for cyclic prefix reduction in MMwave mobile communication systems



Patent number:  9531573
                                            

Abstract:  To reduce the duration of a cyclic prefix used for a multiple input, multiple output (MIMO) communications channel, delay spread variations for different transmit/receive beam pair combination is estimated and used for fast beam switching and to support single user MIMO (SU-MIMO) even when the CP difference between two beams is large. Beam switching reference signals are employed to estimate delay spread exceeding current CP, and to support beam switching. CP covering sub-clusters within clusters for the MIMO channel are exploited to reduce the CP requirement and improve efficiency. Any one of a number of different CP durations may be selected for each different mobile station, using one of a finite set of subframe configurations for which the CP durations of different symbol locations within the subframe are predefined. Dynamically switching subframe configurations by the system accommodates high mobility.

Methods and apparatus to transmit and receive synchronization signals in a mobile communication system



Patent number:  9491755
                                            

Abstract:  Beam-steered millimeter wave signals transmitted in each of n sector slices include a sequence of primary synchronization (PSCH) symbols within predetermined symbol positions in at least one slot of a subframe. The symbols in consecutive symbol positions are each transmitted on a different one of the n slices, with the first symbol repeated on the same slice at the end. The sequence order rotates cyclically in each subframe so that two PSCH symbols are transmitted on one slice in a single subframe every nth subframe. Secondary synchronization (SSCH) and Broadcast Channel (BCH) symbols are transmitted in a predetermined pattern following the sequence of PSCH symbols. By transmitting consecutive PSCH symbols on different slices and repeating the first symbol, the mobile station can detect the best slice and beam by switching receive beams every subframe instead of every slot, relaxing time constraints on AGC adjustment while avoiding the start-at-the-edge problem.

Hierarchical channel sounding and channel state information feedback in massive MIMO systems



Patent number:  9414371
                                            

Abstract:  Time, frequency and spatial processing parameters for communications between a base station and a mobile station are selected by transmitting synchronization signals in multiple slices of a wireless transmission sector for the base station, and receiving feedback from the mobile station of at least one preferred slice of the multiple slices. In response to selection of one of the slices as an active slice for communications between the base station and the mobile station, reference signals are transmitted in the selected active slice using a corresponding selected precoder and/or codebook. The mobile station estimates and feeds back channel state information (CSI) based on those reference signals, and the CSI is then employed to determine communication parameters for communications between the base station and mobile station that are specific to the mobile station.
