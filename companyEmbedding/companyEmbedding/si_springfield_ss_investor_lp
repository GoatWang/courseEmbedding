Overview of Incorporation Service - Forming Your Business!
Incorporating may be the most important move you make for your business. It can help protect you and your family from the risks of personal liability and may make it easier to attract employees and investment. 

1. LegalForce's Incorporation Wizard, designed by corporate attorneys, makes it super easy for you to incorporate a business.
2. Your documentation will be well prepared and complete.
3. Fast, friendly service and 24/7 customer support. 
4. Take care of the bureaucratic details so you can focus on your business.

Why Incorporate?

1.  Protect your personal assets. By forming a corporation, you separate your personal assets from the company, and are typically not personally responsible for business debts. So creditors can't pursue your home or car to pay business debts.
 2. Tax and other savings. Corporations often gain tax advantages, such as savings on self-employment taxes, and deductions for health insurance premiums and life insurance.
 3. Attract investors. Incorporating is often a pre-requisite to getting outside investment, from sales of stock, or for borrowing money from professional investors or banks. It can also help you reach potential new customers and partners.
 4. Easier transfer and sale. An incorporated business provides more security for purchasers and therefore can also be easier to sell than an unincorporated business.
 5. Retirement planning. It can be easier to create retirement funds and qualified plans, like a 401(k) for yourself and employees. 









In the Standard Package, incorporating a business is easy and painless.
 You will receive: (1) LegalForce automated Incorporation Wizard helps you decide what corporate form is best for your business; (2) Legally compliant filing of Articles of Incorporation; (3) Customer service available at any time.
 Some states require your original signature before filing. For these states, we will send you the documents to sign and return to us. 








InCorporation Plus Package





InCorporation Gold Package






Incorporate Your Business in 3 Easy Steps
You provide basic information about your business, and we take care of filling out the right state forms, creating your corporate documents, and guiding you through the incorporation process. Our "Incorporation Wizard" will recommend an incorporation package based on what other businesses like yours usually choose. This is all you have to do: 
Step 1. Tell us about your business: 
Answer a couple of simple questions about your business. These are used by our "Incorporation Wizard" to recommend the state and type of incorporation that are most likely to meet your needs. You are free to make changes to these recommendations or to chose a different package.
 Step 2. Choose an Incorporation Package:
 Choose your package and fill out our simple form. We guide you through the information that your state of incorporation requires.
 Step 3. Customize for Your Business:
 Make any changes you want and submit your answers to us. 
LegalForce Does the Rest:
 We will prepare and file the appropriate documents with the state of incorporation. We also create bylaws and minutes to get your company started. When the state responds, we will send your incorporation documents to you and give you easy-to-follow instructions of what to do next.

"We've been extremely impressed by both the quality and coverage of Cortera's information. Their score has worked beautifully."
Jammye Reeves, Credit Manager





"Cortera Pulse enables us to go into a situation prepared with the information clearly communicated, allowing us to make a more informed decision. I would highly recommend using Cortera Pulse for your A/R monitoring and reporting needs."
Darlene Montgomery, A/R Manager





"Allied historically had not reported data to third parties. Cortera was the first service Allied used. We have been extremely impressed with the results and the daily updates on our debtors."
Gen Merritt-Parikh, Chief Operating Officer





"Cortera enables us to dramatically reduce the cost of credit scoring while at the same time improving our decision hit rate through better information coverage. Their no-nonsense approach combined with their reputation among our peers made our decision to move to Cortera an easy choice."
Norma Fetherman, Chief Credit Officer





"Our upper management really likes Cortera's monthly CFO report and I love the daily alerts. I am impressed with Cortera's information!"
Mary Jo Sieg, Customer Financial Services Manager





"Cargill has worked with Cortera for several years and the system keeps on delivering impressive results. We expect Cortera's technology to continue to help us achieve success."
Chuck Croes, Manager of Credit and Risk Management Solutions





"We selected Cortera's eCredit software because it provides the full range of features that most closely fits the needs of our credit department, eCredit allows us to streamline our credit analysis processes and gain increased visibility into our customers' ability to pay."
Dan Beal, Director of Credit





"I've tried all the other customer monitoring tools on the market. Hands down, Cortera is better than anything else available."
Richard T. Packard, Vice President / Portfolio Manager





"As a leader in the area of credit decision automation, Cortera provides our credit and collections analysts with powerful tools to minimize bad debt and identify previously lost revenue opportunities."
Walt Hannabass, Sr Vice President of Credit & Collections





"I have been very happy with Cortera. The information from Cortera is on par with what you get from D&B, only it's a heck of a lot cheaper. I use Cortera's $4 Risk Reports to gauge credit worthiness for my new customers. In my experience, using Cortera has been very impactful in helping me (and my organization) establish credit limits and determine a customer's ability to pay us."
Joe Mehrer, Credit & Collections Manager





"Cortera provides us with the high quality information we need to get the decision right every time. When it comes to credit reports, Cortera is our first choice."

Arne Antonsson, Chief Credit Officer, Group Treasury





"Thanks Cortera! Almost immediately after signing up for PULSE you caught a $300,000 Federal Tax Lien on an account. We were able to react and protect ourselves in time."
John Culbert, Vice President of Credit





"Cortera gives us relevant data, not just aggregate information. How a particular shipper is paying the electricity company is not as important to me as how this company is paying its freight bills. Cortera reports provide this valuable information."
Eric Votaw, Sr. Manager - Corporate Credit & Cash Application





"There are times when Pulse has saved us thousands of dollars by making us aware of these risks that would have otherwise gone unnoticed."
Nina Flurer, Regional Credit Manager





"We manage our Company's portfolio risk through the use of Cortera's monthly CFO reports. The data in the reports allows me to quickly and easily take action. Our CEO and CFO both view Cortera's monthly CFO Report and have stated that the data is presented in a very easy-to-read, digestible format, where you can clearly see what is going on with the overall financial health of your customers."
James Sarkkinen, Credit Manager





"We wanted the best credit and collections software to manage the relationships we've developed over the last 80 years and Cortera continues to deliver the fullest range of features and functionality we need."
David Schier, Credit Manager





"We've always believed that Cortera was the most innovative, technology focused and cost effective leader in the business credit reporting industry and those beliefs have only been strengthened through our use of Cortera PULSE."
Brian Duckworth, Senior Manager Freight Collections





"Combined with a strong track record in the electronics industry, Cortera offers the kind of flexibility that a fast-growing company like LGEUS needs."
ID Kim, Credit Director, LG Electronics USA, Inc., (LGEUS)





"Cortera offers unique benefits that no other credit management solutions provider could present."
David Morgan, Chief Financial Officer





"Our department has been using Cortera Pulse for about five years for credit data and risk management. While we use a number of different credit sources, the data available from Cortera provides very good value and often gives us earlier warning on risk scenarios such as bankruptcies. I like to recommend Cortera Pulse because the monthly CFO Report and Portfolio Reports are insightful and user friendly."
Glenn Lifrieri, Executive Chairman of the Board, National Chemical Credit Association





"Cortera is one of the true innovators in our market. We've worked with them for years and I have only great things to say. Their new community approach to credit reporting is yet another example of their industry leadership."
Tom Prendergast, Credit Manager





"Since deploying Cortera's eCredit solutions, Ryder has reduced the risk level of its customer portfolio by 5 percent...we are experiencing the lowest write-off volume in six years."
Douglas Hansen, Director of Receivables Management





"I run a Credit Department where we manage several thousand accounts. Cortera has helped us assess credit lines for our customers and also provided us with information regarding changes that may happen without our knowledge."
Ed Walsh, Credit Manager





"With Cortera we were able to cut our D&B contract by 50% this year and hope to cut it another 50% next year. We just love Cortera credit reports."
Debie Wangsgard CCE, Corporate Credit





"Why should I pay $50 for a report when I can get more data on the CPR for less. I recommend Cortera because they are a great company to work with and they are on my team."
Judy Waters, Director of Credit





"At Xerox Canada, we are continually looking at ways to make it easier for our customers to do business with us, and working with Cortera allows us to continue delivering on that important objective."
Tony Martino, Vice President, Business Strategy, Xerox Canada





"Cortera's technology and information are very strong, but what really distinguished Cortera was that I knew their people understood credit."
John Pomilio, Vice President, Customer Financial Services

Rock Music from Amazon.comRock music might have busted onto the scene in the 1950s, but it has roots in countless musical genres. Explosive sounds from electric guitars, fuzzy feedback loops, and powerful vocals all characterize this diverse and innovative genre. From Pete Townsend’s classic windmill guitar playing to The Beatles’ first appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show, rock music has never failed to catch listeners by surprise.With everything from breakneck percussion to twangy, lyric-driven songs and power chords and rootsy rhythm sounds, Amazon.com can help you find your favorite rock music and artists, whether you love Tool, Deep Purple, Creedence Clearwater Revival, The Rolling Stones, and many more. Our wide range of sub-genres includes blues, country, folk, jam bands, Latin, oldies and retro, power pop, progressive, rap, guitarists, roots, singer-songwriters, and funk rock. From Top 40 and beyond, you can find your favorite catchy songs.To help you take your favorite rock music wherever you go, Amazon.com offers a unique program called AutoRip. AutoRip automatically makes the hard copy of AutoRip-eligible albums you’ve just purchased available on your Amazon.com Cloud Player. Now you can have physical forms for your own personal collection, and you can listen to your favorite songs wherever you can access your Cloud Player. Whether you’re looking for new Black Sabbath, John Fogerty, or Boz Scaggs albums or classics like Rodriguez, the Velvet Underground, or Bread, you can purchase AutoRip-ready vinyl and CDs so you don’t have to wait to listen to your favorite songs.If you’d rather rock out to vinyl records, we offer a wide selection of easily searchable LPs so you can get everything from The Who, Jim Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, Big Star, and more. We also offer a huge selection of CDs, DVD audio, cassettes, and MP3s. You can even filter our rock music selection for new releases so you can pre-order upcoming records and browse new releases from the last 30 or 90 days. We also offer a handy edition filter so you can search for main albums, singles and EPs, live albums, imports, limited editions, box sets, and compilations.The Velvet Underground once said that life is saved by rock ‘n’ roll. With rock music from Amazon.com, you can tap into those “life-changing sounds.”

Springfield has been garnering much praise for their 1911s. This latest release, the Range Officer Operator is exactly what I was looking for.

Extremely accurate out of the box with a great trigger pull. Quality built throughout. I put 100 rounds through it without any sort of flaw. Smooth and precise. 

For the money, you will be hard pressed to find a better 1911.
