Job Details
               Evanston Golf Club, founded in 1898, occupies 150 acres nestled in Chicago's historic North Shore. Pioneering Scottish designer Donald Ross personally crafted our course nearly a century ago, and we've taken care to preserve his design while carefully updating the course over the years to suit the modern game. While we're proud to provide a world-class golfing experience, our club offers much more than fairways and greens. Our unparalleled blend of rich history, modern amenities, family activities and a truly welcoming atmosphere makes us a premier club for golfers and non-golfers alike. Our club offers tennis and paddle, along with shooting sports in the winter and family-friendly events all year long. Our clubhouse is the perfect venue for receptions and special events, and members and guests enjoy fine dining on our spacious patio overlooking the course. The new Evanston pool complex - scheduled to open in 2015 - will be among the finest in the Chicago area. Our facilities and amenities get plenty of attention, but what truly sets Evanston Golf Club apart is our relaxed, family-friendly and diverse atmosphere. Children have grown up and made memories here for generations, and women were encouraged to join and golf from the day we opened our doors. Our events & activities make sure members of all ages and interests are engaged and having fun throughout the year.
