DAVID L. DUNKEL is the Chairman and CEO of kforce.com, the web-based
evolution of the leading staffing services firm Romac International. Mr.
Dunkel has been associated with Romac for most of his professional
career and has been at the helm for almost 20 years, having served as
chief executive officer and a director of Romac International since its
formation in 1994, and as president and CEO of the predecessor firm
Romac-FMA for 14 years. He opened Romac’s Tampa office in 1980 in
partnership with his father, Albert M. Dunkel. In his current position,
Mr. Dunkel presides over the $680 million company, which employs more
than 2,000 field-service personnel, operates in 44 domestic and one
international market, and 109 total office locations. In part due to the

Mr. Dunkel’s career at Romac include the acquisition of specialty
staffing company Source Services in 1998 and the formation of kforce.com
