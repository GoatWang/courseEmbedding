E-Commerce China Dangdang Inc. Key Developments

Sadis & Goldberg LLP Files Class Action Suit against E-Commerce China Dangdang, Inc. for Going-Private Transaction
Nov 23 16
Sadis & Goldberg LLP announced that a class action has been commenced in the United States District Court of the Southern District of New York on behalf of former minority common stockholders of E-Commerce China Dangdang Inc. who held company common stock at any time between May 28, 2016 and the September 20, 2016 closing of a merger transaction. The complaint charges company, some of its affiliates, and certain of its officers and directors with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as well as common law claims for breach of fiduciary duties and misrepresentation. On May 28, 2016, company's board of directors agreed to sell Dangdang in a going private-merger to a buyers group that included its controlling stockholder and that held as a group over 80% of the voting power. The board did so while rejecting a higher offer from an independent third-party bidder. The complaint alleges that the defendants form 13E-3 and related disclosures, filed in June 2016 were materially misleading in claiming that the special committee that voted to accept the low bid from the controlling group had independent control of the sales process and that the merger was procedurally fair when in fact the special committee was not independent, did not engage the services of independent counsel, and the going-private merger was not entirely unfair. These misrepresentations violated Section 13(e) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13e-3 there under. Plaintiffs seek to recover damages on behalf of all holders of company common stock during the Class Period, including the fair value of their common stock cashed out in the Going-Private transaction.


E-Commerce China Dangdang Inc. Files Form 15
Oct 3 16
E-Commerce China Dangdang Inc. has announced that it has filed a Form 15 with the Securities and Exchange Commission to voluntarily deregister its Class A common shares, par value $0.0001 per share, American depositary shares, each representing five Class A common shares under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Buyer's Feedback


Easy Sourcing helps me trade easily!
As a new member to Made-in-China.com, I posted my first request on Easy Sourcing one month ago. Fortunately, I received the first quality quotation from supplier - Changzhou Ji****Co., Ltd. within 2 hours after submission! Finally I ordered Electronic Transformer from the supplier. In the past I had to spend several days to find a satisfied supplier. Now, I only need a few hours!

I have found several qualified suppliers through Easy Sourcing!
I have been a premium buyer with Made-in-China.com for many years. Since the first time posting sourcing request on Easy Sourcing, I have found several reliable suppliers, it's convenient for me to receive rapid quotations and compare the suppliers. Easy Sourcing has provided tremendous value to me. Now it's my favorite way to find Chinese suppliers.
