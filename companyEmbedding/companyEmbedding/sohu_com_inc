How Should Gaokao  Essay Topics Be Selected?


The diversification of Gaokao essay topics becomes a trend


 NO. 26 JUNE 29, 2017





(LI SHIGONG)
As always, the essay topics in the Chinese language test in this year's national college entrance examination soon became a hot topic for discussion after the two-day exam, commonly known as gaokao, finished in early June. This time, however, debates have been more heated than in the past, largely because this year marks the 40th anniversary of the examination's resumption after its suspension from 1966-76.
Essay writing is seen as a prime method to test students' language proficiency in gaokao. For many years, students were required to write an essay on a given topic. This method was widely criticized as preventing students from expressing themselves freely or fully, as any given topic may be familiar to some but not to others. In a recent development, some test papers have provided an alternative means by which students can create their essays. For example, a paper designed by the Ministry of Education for this year's exam listed a number of China-related keywords, any three of which students could select as subject material for their article. This reform has won acclaim as a major step toward allowing more room for creativity in essay writing.
Nonetheless, some complain that the choice of essay topics is not completely fair, particularly for students who come from underdeveloped rural areas. Reading materials or buzzwords that students living in large cities easily comprehend may be difficult for rural students. While the restrictions on what to write have been relaxed, fairness in the selection of essay topics remains important. Complaints, opinions and suggestions about gaokao essay topics have come from various quarters.
A step forward
Xiong Bingqi (Science and Technology Daily): For years, I have been suggesting that more than one topic should be offered for the gaokao essay, so that students can choose what they are most interested in. This year, in the short essay section, students in Beijing had the choice of three topics.
Also, this year, a test paper designed by the Ministry of Education presented several China-related keywords—such as the Belt and Road Initiative, panda, bicycle sharing, Peking Opera, air pollution, beautiful countryside, food safety, high-speed railway, mobile payment—and students were required to choose three of them and write an essay that would help foreigners better understand China.
The reform on gaokao essays should follow this trend. Students need to be offered more choices so that they will think more extensively and express themselves more freely. Meanwhile, students should also change their minds. They should not focus too much on exam-oriented writing skill training, but should express their true feelings in their essays.
More importantly, for students to feel really free in writing gaokao essays, it's also important to adopt diversified standards for assessment.
Editorial (Beijing Youth Daily): The essay part of the Chinese language paper can best reflect students' grasp of the language and culture. This year, students in many provinces were required to write an article after reading the material offered.
The purpose of offering reading materials is partly to encourage students to analyze and extract available information. In this way, they enjoy more freedom in writing the essay.
In addition, the test papers adopted by different provinces mostly offered more than one essay topic.
For years, it has been suggested that students should be given three to four topic choices for gaokao essays. On the basis of this year's examination, it seems that the education authorities have at long last heeded this call.
A striking feature of this year's gaokao essay is that the topics are quite closely related to social hot events, such as the 40th anniversary of the resumption of gaokao. Some people applaud this for its connection to real life, which is absolutely great. In my opinion, though, topics need not be so relevant to current affairs, as long as they offer enough space for students to think, analyze and write.
Forty years after gaokao was resumed, reform of this system is on the agenda. The gaokao system is expected to help students' healthy growth and encourage the development of their interest in many things. When they are faced with more and more choices, either in terms of essay topics or test scheduling—in Zhejiang Province, for example, students can take the English language test twice—students' individual potential will be further brought into play.
Luo Ke (www.sohu.com): We don't know how the gaokao essay topics are selected, but we hope students will be given more freedom in how to write the essay. Students rarely get a very low score for their gaokao essays, but full marks are also rarely given, which means the topic must be one that everyone feels they have something to say about. This is an appropriate choice.
Meanwhile, if the gaokao essay topics can focus more on hot issues and public affairs, they can serve to some degree as a guiding principle for school education.
It is conceivable that students will pay more attention to public affairs given that the gaokao essay topics incorporate more of such things. In this case, teachers and parents will guide students to think about, analyze and debate public affairs in an objective and rational manner. Students will, in turn, become more interested in social life, instead of submerging themselves in books. Gradually, they'll develop the ability to analyze social issues by themselves. This is undoubtedly a good way of citizenship education.
If students begin to analyze public affairs objectively in middle school and learn to offer solutions instead of complaining, then they will play a more constructive role in the nation's development. This is our expectation of gaokao essays.
Problems remain
Zhang Tianpan (The Economic Observer): This year, the essay task set in a test paper designed by the Ministry of Education provided keywords, three of which students were required to choose for the basis of their articles.
But in such keywords, we detect unfairness to students from rural areas. For those who come from remote and impoverished rural areas, or even from small towns, most of these words are unfamiliar. Particularly, concepts such as bicycle sharing and mobile payment are things those who do not have smartphones have never experienced. Besides, high-speed railway and food safety are also part of the concerns of residents in big cities. The only one that rural students understand well may be "beautiful countryside."
This is not a fresh problem. Complaints have been made for years about the hidden unfairness to rural students in the gaokao essay topics, but little improvement has occurred. For example, the 2016 gaokao essay topic in Zhejiang Province was about "virtual reality (VR) and reality." What an unfair topic! Even economically developed Zhejiang has deprived areas in its south and west. For students from rural areas and small towns in these parts, this is a strange and unfair topic. Many of them would have no idea what to write.
As far as gaokao essay topics are concerned, they should refrain from providing background materials and topics that bewilder rural students. To maximize fairness, they should adopt materials that every student has some knowledge of, instead of focusing on topics familiar only to urban students.

The politics of passing on in China

The Politics of Passing On: In China, the death of a esteemed comrade is never strictly a private matter.
By David Bandursky
Mourners gather in Beijing on May 18 for the memorial service of former foreign minister Qian Qichen.
When Lux Nayaran, the co-founder of content analytics company Unmetric Inc, fed 2,000 New York Times obituaries into a natural language processing program, he found that most all the people featured, famous or not, had used their talents for good. They had, he said, “made a positive dent in the fabric of life.” Had Nayaran instead run 2,000 obituaries from Chinese Communist Party leaders through his program, he might have found something astonishing — that they had all made more or less identical dents in the stiff fabric of Chinese politics.
Qian Qishen’s funeral portrait, as published in the official People’s Daily newspaper.
After the death this month of former Chinese foreign minister Qian Qichen (钱其琛), the official People’s Daily newspaper carried a terse synopsis of the man’s life, calling him an “excellent Party member,” a “time-tested fighter for the communist cause,” a “proletarian revolutionary,” and last but certainly not least (he was a diplomat, after all), an “outstanding leader on our country’s diplomatic front.”
But these superlatives were entirely run-on-the-mill. Qiao Shi (乔石), the former chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, had been similarly lionized after his death in June 2015, his official obituary calling him “an excellent member of Chinese Communist Party, a time-tested fighter for the communist cause, an outstanding proletarian revolutionary and politician, and an exceptional leader of the Party and the country.”
The January 2015 obituary of Yang Baibing (杨白冰), the People’s Liberation Army general who reportedly signed the order to fire on student demonstrators in Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989, had also extolled him as “an excellent Party member, a time-tested fighter for the communist cause, a proletarian revolutionary, and an outstanding leader of political work within our military.”
Students from the University of Politics and Law march to Tiananmen Square in April 1989 bearing an image of Hu Yaobang. The poster in the foreground writes out the constitutional rights to freedom of expression, association and demonstration.
Even over death, the Chinese Communist Party has the final word. The death of any “comrade” is a deeply political matter, and its meaning must be ascertained through the deadening discourse of the Party.
One important reason for this is of course that deaths can have an outsized impact on political life. Consider how the death of Hu Yaobang (胡耀邦) on April 15, 1989, “fell like a spark into the highly flammable atmosphere of elite division and popular disaffection.” Or consider how the immediate possibility of the death of Jiang Zemin (江泽民), whose political influence is an unknown quantity, has impended over Chinese politics for almost a decade.
When the memorial service for Qian Qichen (钱其琛) was held on May 18, media in Hong Kong noted the conspicuous absence of Jiang, under whom Qian had served for more than a decade. Jiang had been placed, along with President Xi Jinping (习近平), on the official roster of mourners. Could his absence be a sign that he was edging closer to death? If so, what would this mean for Chinese politics in the run-up to this year’s 19th National Congress?
Jiang will turn 91 on August 17 this year. Or won’t he?
Deaths conjure up legacies, and legacies are a core matter of ideology and legitimacy for the Chinese Communist Party. Which means a lot is riding on the official obituary. “Well then, is there any political logic in the obituary the follows the death of a leader?” a column at Sohu.com asked following Qian’s death on May 9. “The answer is: of course there is.”
In a column shortly after the death of Qiao Shi, the former NPC chairman, the “News Dig” section at Sina.com took a deep dive into the obituaries of 13 former members of the Politburo Standing Committee. Here is how “News Dig” characterized the practice of Party obituary writing generally:
The ruling party’s assessments of political figures who have passed away is not only about evaluating the person but is also an important political consideration made by the ruling party. The obituary is an extremely serious matter, and it can be said that every word is carefully weighed and has deep significance.
So who, then, is doing all of this careful weighing of deep significance? Well, that all depends.
The obituaries of Party and government leaders generally involve five major institutions — 1) the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, 2) the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, 3) the State Council, 4) the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference and 5) the Central Military Commission (CMC). But the deaths of different political figures will touch on these institutions in different ways or combinations. In the case of Qiao Shi, institutions 1–4 were all jointly involved, according to “News Dig.” For Yang Baibing, institution 5, the CMC, was naturally crucial, given his status as “an outstanding leader of political work within our military.”

Xinhua News Agency was responsible for releasing the official obituaries in both of the above cases. But that isn’t always the way it works either.
When reformer Hu Yaobang passed away in 1989, his obituary was released directly by the Central Committee. In other cases, as with the death of former premier Hua Guofeng (华国锋) in 2008, and PLA general Liu Huaqing (刘华清) in 2011, Xinhua can release official obituaries without the direct involvement of the above-mentioned institutions.



The official obituary of Chinese general Zhu De (朱德) appears on the front page of the July 7, 1976, edition of the People’s Daily. The obituary is clearly marked in the headline as coming from “the Central Committee of the CCP, the NPC Standing Committee and the State Council.”



At the level of the text, what do the various cuoci (措辞), or turns of phrase, in these official obituaries mean? And who gets what?
As you might imagine, it’s all very complicated.
The titles “excellent Party member” and “fighter for the communist cause” can be applied quite generally to Party and government leaders. The descriptors “time-tested” or “devoted” are often placed before “fighter for the communist cause,” as was the case for the obituaries of Deng Xiaoping, Hu Yaobang, Chen Yun (陈云) and others.
The phrase “proletarian revolutionary” is generally applied with either “great” or “outstanding” up front. Given a choice, any leader worth his salt should prefer to be “great” over “outstanding” — because this places him in the company of Deng Xiaoping, Ye Jianying (叶剑英), Chen Yun, Yang Shangkun (杨尚昆), Hu Yaobang, Peng Zhen (彭真) and Deng Yingchao (邓颖超). Slightly lesser figures, like former vice premier Yao Yilin (姚依林), must settle for “outstanding.”
Hua Guofeng, the former CCP chairman drop-kicked into retirement by Deng Xiaoping, ended his life in relative political obscurity. For him, then, there was no superlative up front — he was just (poor Hua) a “proletarian revolutionary and politician,” plain and simple.
The terms “outstanding proletarian revolutionary” (杰出的无产阶级革命家) and “proletarian revolutionary” (无产阶级革命家) are generally used for state-level deputy officials (副国级官员), also sometimes called “sub-national” leaders (those in second-tier Party or government positions).
Leaders who were responsible for work related to the military are generally appended with such titles as “military expert” (军事家), “commander” (指挥员) and “political worker” (政治工作者).
Leader’s obituaries may also, of course, make references to the areas in which they most clearly achieved. The official obituary for Peng Zhen, who had served as Secretary of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission in the 1980s, said that he was the “principal layer of the foundations of socialist rule of law in our country.”
After his death in 1997, Deng Xiaoping was called in his obituary, “the chief architect of socialist reform and opening and the building of modernization,” and referred to as “the creator of the theory of socialism with Chinese characteristics.”
Obviously, it is a special distinction to be designated in such a way as a trailblazer nonpareil.
A report two years ago in Jinan Daily, the official Party mouthpiece of Jinan Province, noted five distinct phrases in the official discourse to signal a leader’s adherence to the tenets of socialism. The heftiest of all was “great Marxist” (伟大的马克思主义者).

Beyond this, in apparent descending order, were: “outstanding Marxist” (杰出的马克思主义者), “staunch Marxist” (坚定的马克思主义者), “faithful Marxist” (忠诚的马克思主义者) and just plain-Jane “Marxist” (马克思主义者).
Only nine leaders in China’s history have been designated “great Marxists,” the last being Deng Xiaoping, who passed away on February 19, 1997.
The original “great Marxists” were of course Soviet leaders. The first appearance of “great Marxist” in China’s People’s Daily newspaper came on December 21, 1949, Stalin’s 70th birthday, when an article on the front page boomed: “Long Live Generalissimo Stalin! Long Live the Friendship Between China and the Soviet Union!”
This article, three years before Stalin’s death and more than a decade before Mao’s formal denunciation of the “revisionism” of the Soviet Union, brimmed with comradely good feeling:
We of the Chinese Communist Party fervently congratulate Comrade Stalin on his 70th birthday. Comrade Stalin is the greatest Marxist after Lenin. Under the leadership of Comrade Stalin, the people of the Soviet Union have built humanity’s first socialist society, and are progressing toward the realization of a Communist society.
The December 21, 1949, edition of the People’s Daily wishes Stalin a happy 70th birthday.
Being designated posthumously as a “Marxist,” the Jinan Daily article observed, is something Party leaders have long regarded as a mark of prestige.
It’s not difficult to imagine that Jiang Zemin, the leader who decided to admit capitalists to the Communist Party, might, when he does pass on, earn distinction as a “great Marxist,” or at the very least a “Marxist.”
When it comes to the discourse of the CCP, old habits die hard.

The politics of passing on Featured
In China, the death of a esteemed comrade is never strictly a private matter. 

2 months ago
By David Bandurski





Mourners gather in Beijing on May 18 for the memorial service of former foreign minister Qian Qichen.








When Lux Nayaran, the co-founder of content analytics company Unmetric Inc, fed 2,000 New York Times obituaries into a natural language processing program, he found that most all the people featured, famous or not, had used their talents for good. They had, he said, “made a positive dent in the fabric of life.” Had Nayaran instead run 2,000 obituaries from Chinese Communist Party leaders through his program, he might have found something astonishing —  that they had all made more or less identical dents in the stiff fabric of Chinese politics.
Qian Qishen’s funeral portrait, as published in the official People’s Daily newspaper.
After the death last month of former Chinese foreign minister Qian Qichen (钱其琛), the official People’s Daily newspaper carried a terse synopsis of the man’s life, calling him an “excellent Party member,” a “time-tested fighter for the communist cause,” a “proletarian revolutionary,” and last but certainly not least (he was a diplomat, after all), an “outstanding leader on our country’s diplomatic front.”
But these superlatives were entirely run-of-the-mill. Qiao Shi (乔石), the former chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, had been similarly lionized after his death in June 2015, his official obituary calling him “an excellent member of Chinese Communist Party, a time-tested fighter for the communist cause, an outstanding proletarian revolutionary and politician, and an exceptional leader of the Party and the country.”
The January 2015 obituary of Yang Baibing (杨白冰), the People’s Liberation Army general who reportedly signed the order to fire on student demonstrators in Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989, had also extolled him as “an excellent Party member, a time-tested fighter for the communist cause, a proletarian revolutionary, and an outstanding leader of political work within our military.”
Even over death, the Chinese Communist Party has the final word. The death of any “comrade” is a deeply political matter, and its meaning must be ascertained through the deadening discourse of the Party.
One important reason for this is of course that deaths can have an outsized impact on political life. Consider how the death of Hu Yaobang (胡耀邦) on April 15, 1989, “fell like a spark into the highly flammable atmosphere of elite division and popular disaffection.” Or consider how the immediate possibility of the death of Jiang Zemin (江泽民), whose political influence is an unknown quantity, has impended over Chinese politics for almost a decade.
When the memorial service for Qian Qichen (钱其琛) was held on May 18, media in Hong Kong noted the conspicuous absence of Jiang, under whom Qian had served for more than a decade. Jiang had been placed, along with President Xi Jinping (习近平), on the official roster of mourners. Could his absence be a sign that he was edging closer to death? If so, what would this mean for Chinese politics in the run-up to this year’s 19th National Congress?
Students from the University of Politics and Law march to Tiananmen Square in April 1989 bearing an image of Hu Yaobang. The poster in the foreground writes out the constitutional rights to freedom of expression, association, and demonstration.
Jiang will turn 91 on August 17 this year. Or won’t he?
Deaths conjure up legacies, and legacies are a core matter of ideology and legitimacy for the Chinese Communist Party. Which means a lot is riding on the official obituary. “Well, then, is there any political logic in the obituary that follows the death of a leader?” a column at Sohu.com asked following Qian’s death on May 9. “The answer is: of course there is.”
In a column shortly after the death of Qiao Shi, the former NPC chairman, the “News Dig” section at Sina.com took a deep dive into the obituaries of 13 former members of the Politburo Standing Committee. Here is how “News Dig” characterized the practice of Party obituary writing generally:
The ruling party’s assessments of political figures who have passed away is not only about evaluating the person but is also an important political consideration made by the ruling party. The obituary is an extremely serious matter, and it can be said that every word is carefully weighed and has deep significance.
So who, then, is doing all of this careful weighing of deep significance? Well, that all depends.
The obituaries of Party and government leaders generally involve five major institutions — 1) the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, 2) the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, 3) the State Council, 4) the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, and 5) the Central Military Commission (CMC). But the deaths of different political figures will touch on these institutions in different ways or combinations. In the case of Qiao Shi, institutions 1–4 were all jointly involved, according to “News Dig.” For Yang Baibing, institution 5, the CMC, was naturally crucial, given his status as “an outstanding leader of political work within our military.”

Xinhua News Agency was responsible for releasing the official obituaries in both of the above cases. But that isn’t always the way it works, either.
When reformer Hu Yaobang passed away in 1989, his obituary was released directly by the Central Committee. In other cases, as with the death of former premier Hua Guofeng (华国锋) in 2008, and PLA general Liu Huaqing (刘华清) in 2011, Xinhua can release official obituaries without the direct involvement of the above-mentioned institutions.
The official obituary of Chinese general Zhu De (朱德) appears on the front page of the July 7, 1976, edition of the People’s Daily. The obituary is clearly marked in the headline as coming from “the Central Committee of the CCP, the NPC Standing Committee, and the State Council.”
At the level of the text, what do the various cuoci (措辞), or turns of phrase, in these official obituaries mean? And who gets what?
As you might imagine, it’s all very complicated.
The titles “excellent Party member” and “fighter for the communist cause” can be applied quite generally to Party and government leaders. The descriptors “time-tested” or “devoted” are often placed before “fighter for the communist cause,” as was the case for the obituaries of Deng Xiaoping, Hu Yaobang, Chen Yun (陈云), and others.
The phrase “proletarian revolutionary” is generally applied with either “great” or “outstanding” up front. Given a choice, any leader worth his salt should prefer to be “great” over “outstanding” — because this places him in the company of Deng Xiaoping, Ye Jianying (叶剑英), Chen Yun, Yang Shangkun (杨尚昆), Hu Yaobang, Peng Zhen (彭真), and Deng Yingchao (邓颖超). Slightly lesser figures, like former vice premier Yao Yilin (姚依林), must settle for “outstanding.”
Hua Guofeng, the former CCP chairman drop-kicked into retirement by Deng Xiaoping, ended his life in relative political obscurity. For him, then, there was no superlative up front — he was just (poor Hua) a “proletarian revolutionary and politician,” plain and simple.
The terms “outstanding proletarian revolutionary” (杰出的无产阶级革命家) and “proletarian revolutionary” (无产阶级革命家) are generally used for state-level deputy officials (副国级官员), also sometimes called “sub-national” leaders (those in second-tier Party or government positions).
Leaders who were responsible for work related to the military are generally appended with such titles as “military expert” (军事家), “commander” (指挥员) and “political worker” (政治工作者).
Leaders’ obituaries may also, of course, make references to the areas in which they most clearly achieved. The official obituary for Peng Zhen, who had served as Secretary of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission in the 1980s, said that he was the “principal layer of the foundations of socialist rule of law in our country.”
After his death in 1997, Deng Xiaoping was called in his obituary “the chief architect of socialist reform and opening and the building of modernization,” and referred to as “the creator of the theory of socialism with Chinese characteristics.”
Obviously, it is a special distinction to be designated in such a way as a trailblazer nonpareil.
A report two years ago in Jinan Daily, the official Party mouthpiece of Jinan Province, noted five distinct phrases in the official discourse to signal a leader’s adherence to the tenets of socialism. The heftiest of all was “great Marxist” (伟大的马克思主义者).
Beyond this, in apparent descending order, were: “outstanding Marxist” (杰出的马克思主义者), “staunch Marxist” (坚定的马克思主义者), “faithful Marxist” (忠诚的马克思主义者), and just plain-Jane “Marxist” (马克思主义者).
Only nine leaders in China’s history have been designated “great Marxists,” the last being Deng Xiaoping, who passed away on February 19, 1997.
The original “great Marxists” were, of course, Soviet leaders. The first appearance of “great Marxist” in China’s People’s Daily newspaper came on December 21, 1949, Stalin’s 70th birthday, when an article on the front page boomed: “Long Live Generalissimo Stalin! Long Live the Friendship Between China and the Soviet Union!”
This article, three years before Stalin’s death and more than a decade before Mao’s formal denunciation of the “revisionism” of the Soviet Union, brimmed with comradely good feeling:
We of the Chinese Communist Party fervently congratulate Comrade Stalin on his 70th birthday. Comrade Stalin is the greatest Marxist after Lenin. Under the leadership of Comrade Stalin, the people of the Soviet Union have built humanity’s first socialist society, and are progressing toward the realization of a Communist society.
The December 21, 1949, edition of the People’s Daily wishes Stalin a happy 70th birthday.
Being designated posthumously as a “Marxist,” the Jinan Daily article observed, is something Party leaders have long regarded as a mark of prestige.
It’s not difficult to imagine that Jiang Zemin, the leader who decided to admit capitalists to the Communist Party, might, when he does pass on, earn distinction as a “great Marxist,” or, at the very least, a “Marxist.”
When it comes to the discourse of the CCP, old habits die hard.

2017-05-31 06:00来源:Echo陪你练口语

WUZHEN, China--The event was billed as a battle pitting man against machine. Yet the rematch between the world champion in the ancient strategy game of Go, Ke Jie of China, and artificial-intelligence player AlphaGo also offered Alphabet Inc.'s Google, the machine's owner, the chance to raise its profile in China seven years after it abandoned its search business here.

However, as the first game began Tuesday, there was one hitch: Chinese audiences were largely unable to watch the live stream of the event on Alphabet's Google and YouTube websites, both of which have been blocked in the country since 2010 after the U.S. company refused to submit to government censorship. 
On social media, Chinese Go fans expressed disappointment that the matches weren't live-streamed on sites they could view without using virtual private networks, or VPNs, that can circumvent the country's strict internet filters, known as the Great Firewall. 
"What a pity and this could be such a good chance to promote this ancient game originated from China," one user said on China's Twitter-like platform Weibo. 
"Why can't a Go game be broadcasted? I don't get this," said another user. 
A large entourage of Alphabet officials are here for the five-day event, including Eric Schmidt, the company's executive chairman. But they were hard-pressed to explain the event's lack of domestically accessible streaming, which has become ubiquitous in China..

"There is a lot of media interest so I'm hoping people will get to see this on various channels, however they need to do that," said Demis Hassabis, the chief executive and a co-founder of DeepMind, the Google subsidiary that created AlphaGo. 
There were originally plans to stream the event live in China, but they fell through for reasons that weren't immediately clear, according to people with knowledge of the event. 
One popular internet portal, Sohu.com, declined to say why it didn't live-stream the match. A representative said the site was still devoting extensive "words and pictures" to the event. 
Shaun Rein, the founder of China Market Research Group, called it a "missed opportunity" for Google to build cachet in China, given the buzz around the game and the fact that people under the age of 30 are avid consumers of live-streaming video here. 
Hua Xueming, leader of the China National Go team, found at least one silver lining: Not seeing the match, she said, lends more of an air of mystery to it. 
Go was invented around 2,500 years ago in China and remains popular across East Asia. The rules are simple: Players take turns placing black and white stones on a grid, seeking to capture patches of territory by surrounding them. However, the game has so many possible moves that programming a computer to take on a human opponent had long been one of the biggest challenges in artificial intelligence. 
Last year, AlphaGo beat South Korea's top player in a match that was streamed online and watched by an estimated 200 million viewers, according to DeepMind's website. 
The match between 19-year-old Mr. Ke and AlphaGo was the first of a series of three games that is scheduled to end Saturday. Mr. Ke stands to win about $1.5 million if he can beat AlphaGo, which previously bested him in a set of games early this year. 
Tuesday's game was watched by hundreds in a conference center in the eastern Chinese city of Wuzhen. Mr. Ke started the match calmly, playing moves similar to AlphaGo's strategy in the past and pensively fingering his black playing beads before placing them on the board. 
Still, as the match progressed and as AlphaGo's attacks intensified, he cupped his chin with his palms and stared intently at the board. 
More than four hours later, the game was over. AlphaGo had narrowly won the game by half a point.

China's Great Firewall Leaves Google With a Dry Stream During Man-vs.-Machine Showdown

23/05/2017 2:02pm
Dow Jones News


Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)Historical Stock Chart
2 Months : From May 2017 to Jul 2017



By Liza Lin and Alyssa Abkowitz 

     WUZHEN, China--The event was billed as a battle pitting man against machine. Yet the rematch between the world champion in the ancient strategy game of Go, Ke Jie of China, and artificial-intelligence player AlphaGo also offered Alphabet Inc.'s Google, the machine's owner, the chance to raise its profile in China seven years after it abandoned its search business here. 

     However, as the first game began Tuesday, there was one hitch: Chinese audiences were largely unable to watch the live stream of the event on Alphabet's Google and YouTube websites, both of which have been blocked in the country since 2010 after the U.S. company refused to submit to government censorship. 

     On social media, Chinese Go fans expressed disappointment that the matches weren't live-streamed on sites they could view without using virtual private networks, or VPNs, that can circumvent the country's strict internet filters, known as the Great Firewall. 

     "What a pity and this could be such a good chance to promote this ancient game originated from China," one user said on China's Twitter-like platform Weibo. 

     "Why can't a Go game be broadcasted? I don't get this," said another user. 

     A large entourage of Alphabet officials are here for the five-day event, including Eric Schmidt, the company's executive chairman. But they were hard-pressed to explain the event's lack of domestically accessible streaming, which has become ubiquitous in China.. 

     "There is a lot of media interest so I'm hoping people will get to see this on various channels, however they need to do that," said Demis Hassabis, the chief executive and a co-founder of DeepMind, the Google subsidiary that created AlphaGo. 

     There were originally plans to stream the event live in China, but they fell through for reasons that weren't immediately clear, according to people with knowledge of the event. 

     One popular internet portal, Sohu.com, declined to say why it didn't live-stream the match. A representative said the site was still devoting extensive "words and pictures" to the event. 

     Shaun Rein, the founder of China Market Research Group, called it a "missed opportunity" for Google to build cachet in China, given the buzz around the game and the fact that people under the age of 30 are avid consumers of live-streaming video here. 

     Hua Xueming, leader of the China National Go team, found at least one silver lining: Not seeing the match, she said, lends more of an air of mystery to it. 

     Go was invented around 2,500 years ago in China and remains popular across East Asia. The rules are simple: Players take turns placing black and white stones on a grid, seeking to capture patches of territory by surrounding them. However, the game has so many possible moves that programming a computer to take on a human opponent had long been one of the biggest challenges in artificial intelligence. 

     Last year, AlphaGo beat South Korea's top player in a match that was streamed online and watched by an estimated 200 million viewers, according to DeepMind's website. 

     The match between 19-year-old Mr. Ke and AlphaGo was the first of a series of three games that is scheduled to end Saturday. Mr. Ke stands to win about $1.5 million if he can beat AlphaGo, which previously bested him in a set of games early this year. 

     Tuesday's game was watched by hundreds in a conference center in the eastern Chinese city of Wuzhen. Mr. Ke started the match calmly, playing moves similar to AlphaGo's strategy in the past and pensively fingering his black playing beads before placing them on the board. 

     Still, as the match progressed and as AlphaGo's attacks intensified, he cupped his chin with his palms and stared intently at the board. 

     More than four hours later, the game was over. AlphaGo had narrowly won the game by half a point.

New rules aim to make online platforms take more responsibility for user content  - Global Times

 New rules aim to make online platforms take more responsibility for user content  


By Zhang Yu Source:Global Times Published: 2017/5/10 18:38:39 







 ○ A new regulation on Internet news services in China has sparked controversy○ Experts see it as the latest effort by cyberspace authorities in the past year to regulate online platforms○ But many we-media providers are worried that it will restrict their freedom to publish articles
 

China's new regulations on the administration of Internet news services come into effect on June 1. Photo: IC
China's new regulation on the administration of Internet news services, which comes into effect on June 1, made a splash on China's social media platforms when it was announced last week.According to Article 5 of the regulation, any group or individual that wants to provide news to the public through websites, applications, forums, blogs, microblogs, public accounts, instant messaging tools, online livestreaming and other such methods must obtain a "news information services" license. Launching an Internet news information service without a license or beyond the license's scope is banned.The regulation's definition of "news information" includes reporting and commentary on politics, economic, military matters, foreign affairs and other such public topics.The obliquely-worded regulation soon caused panic among China's netizens, especially "we-media" providers. "We-media" refers to online news sources run by individuals or small groups, often by non-professionals or on a part-time basis. Many fear that the difficulty of obtaining a license will mean the end of most we-media accounts.Different understandingsSome support the law, such as "Truth Brother," who runs a Sina Weibo account with 1.33 million followers. "It's meaningful in terms of clarifying public opinion, and it will alter the fact that everyone can be self-media and disturb online space by posting things arbitrarily … I think freedom is relative, and publishing without a firm political stance will disrupt China's Internet and is irresponsible for society," he told the Global Times.But some observers say most of the discussion about the regulations misses the point. Experts say the regulation is not targeted at we-media providers, but at the platforms themselves. One of things they point to is that the process for getting a license basically requires the applicant to have a full, professional media organization with registered premises, certain kinds of personnel and the "funds suited to the services." As this is clearly well beyond the scope of small-scale operations, experts say it shows that the regulation is not aimed directly at we-media."The subject of the regulation's most controversial clauses is actually social media platforms, rather than we-media accounts, either run by individuals or organizations, on these platforms. This isn't new, and the regulation is another attempt at increasing the platforms' responsibilities," Wang Sixin, a professor specializing in media law and regulations at the Communication University of China, told the Global Times.In other words, we-media accounts will likely not need a license to publish news or commentaries, but will face tighter controls from the platforms. "The platforms will strengthen their filtering of information that is illegal, politically incorrect, hurts people's mental and physical health or worsens the Internet environment," Wang said.In a press conference last week, an official at the National Internet Information Office told media the regulations were first drafted in 2005, but over the years needed to be revised to fit the changing times.He said in recent years, as Internet news has developed, there has been an abundance of fake news and illegal publications. Furthermore, as new technology and applications emerge, there's a need for adjustments to regulations. 


Testing the limitsChinese news websites can be loosely divided into two groups. Some are part of the official media system or are extensions of authority-backed news agencies, such as xinhua.com, the website of China's official news agency. These websites are allowed to publish their own reporting or commentaries. The other group is what Chinese regulators refer to as "news information websites," including major Internet portals like sina.com and 163.com. According to Chinese law, these sites can only reprint news stories generated by sanctioned media outlets and are not permitted to do their own reporting.Over the years, however, many news portals have been trying to get around these limits and publish reporting of their own. Dozens of news columns run by these websites have appeared in recent years, the most famous including 163.com's investigative journalism column "Signpost" and sohu.com's news column "hudunews." The former, in particular, has covered a range of in-depth stories about sensitive topics including the case of a school built using toxic materials in Changzhou, East China's Jiangsu Province. As livestreaming has become more popular, the emergence of livestreaming news websites became a new front for testing the limits of the reporting ban, as many accounts livestreamed public events.Just days after the new regulation was announced, Beijing cyberspace affairs officials gave verbal warnings to several websites including sina.com, 163.com, ifeng.com and Tencent for hosting livestreaming programs that they decided were violating the reporting ban.This isn't the first time that the capital's cyberspace affairs authorities have cracked down on news information websites and their products. Last July, for example, it asked sina.com, sohu.com, 163.com and ifeng.com to close or rectify eight internet news columns including Signpost and hudunews. This March, it again gave warnings to five Internet portals, asking them to close or rectify nine of their news columns that violated news publishing rules.Apart from these news websites, the authorities have also been tightening their supervision over online forums such as Baidu Tieba, the largest Chinese communication platform provided by the search engine company. This March, the cyberspace authorities criticized Baidu Tieba for hosting illegal and "unhealthy" information, and demanded it make rectifications.Self-monitoring"The new regulation will push the platforms to further tighten up their screening of information that's published and filter illegal content," Wang said.The authorities' growing concern over these online platforms in the past year has already lead the platforms to invest more time and effort into monitoring content generated by their users and deleting posts that violate the rules or might cause trouble.One of the best examples is probably WeChat, Tencent's massively popular instant messaging app. As of 2016, there were over 12 million registered WeChat public accounts, a 46.2 percent rise over 2015. That number is expected to grow to 14 million by the end of this year, says a report by iiMedia Research, a mobile Internet sector consulting firm.In the past two years, WeChat has been tightening its terms of services. For example, accounts that try to entice or coerce readers to follow their accounts or share their articles are prohibited. Accounts spotted violating this rule twice are shut down indefinitely.The website xiguaji.com, which monitors WeChat public accounts, has been tracking deleted accounts and posts on WeChat for over a year. Its statistics show that among the 1 million accounts that it monitors, around 20,000 to 40,000 posts are deleted each month for violating platform rules."We saw a rise in the number of posts being deleted in the second half of last year, peaking at 48,448 posts in November alone. This January and February, over Spring Festival, the number of posts being deleted dropped. After that it started to grow again to 31,739 in April," Qian Xi, business director of xiguaji.com, told the Global Times.Accounts that publish illegal content face suspension, but the process is far from consistent.In a recent report, Newrank, a big data company tracking new media and user-generated media, analyzed WeChat's suspensions. It followed the activities of a public account called "Chinese economist," which was suspended the morning after it published a commentary entitled "Huang Yiping: The Chinese economy won't survive this time" at around 8 pm on February 18. By 9 am the next morning, the account had been suspended.Newrank then searched for the keywords in the commentary's headline and found 12 articles with the same content, but not all the accounts had been suspended. It concluded that whether an account will be suspended has no clear link to an account's number of followers or views, or whether it's the source of an article deemed unacceptable."So far, we're not clear exactly what factors trigger WeChat's punishments. But whether users make complaints might be a major reason," Li Lan, a technical product researcher at Newrank, told the Global Times. Wang Gong (pseudonym), an editor of public WeChat account Yugong Tianxia, said many we-media providers have a feeling that WeChat's supervision has been getting harsher in the past year. The account, which has been running since last September, has been publishing light news analysis and news stories on a daily basis.Despite the growing monitoring, he says the account will not change their current course, even though they hope to make money in the long term and the changing policies might affect their profitability. "On one hand, we want to see how strictly the regulations are implemented, and on the other hand, we started out wanting to be an account on hot news topics and we don't want to change that," he told the Global Times.

Sohu.com Stock Tries to Earn Its Way Back
The Chinese dot-com pioneer lands on the high end of its quarterly revenue guidance, but that's not the case on the bottom line.











                Rick Munarriz
            

                (TMFBreakerRick)



            
            Apr 24, 2017 at 11:25AM
            
            





It's all about the little victories at Sohu.com (NASDAQ:SOHU) these days. The Chinese dot-com pioneer posted fresh financials on Monday morning, and it's easy to get disillusioned without the proper context.
Yes, revenue of $374.1 million for the first quarter is 8% lower than a year earlier as well as 9% lower sequentially. This is the sixth quarter in a row that Sohu posts a year-over-year decline in revenue. However, this is also the first time in more than a year that its top-line slide wasn't in the double digits. More importantly, $374.1 million lands Sohu near the top of its earlier range calling for $345 million to $375 million in revenue for the period. At the midpoint it would've been a nearly 13% decline in revenue. It's a relative victory, and on Wall Street it's all about how you stack up against expectations. 
The last several quarters have featured the same dynamic among Sohu's three businesses, with modest growth at its Sogou search engine being more than offset by sharp declines at Sohu's brand advertising segment as well as its Changyou (NASDAQ:CYOU) led online gaming business. It was more of the same this time around. 
Sohu's original brand advertising continues to be its biggest laggard, plunging 35% to $81 million. Sohu lays the blame on big declines in video and real estate advertising. The silver lining here is that brand advertising now accounts for less than 22% of the revenue mix. 
Online gaming revenue slipped 17% to $85 million, as Changyou's older games experience a natural decline in revenue. The rub, of course, is that Changyou's newer titles haven't been able to make up that lost ground.





Finally we get to Sogou, China's third most popular search engine. Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) dominates China's search market, but there's clearly room for smaller rivals. Sogou's revenue climbed 6% to $142 million, good enough to account for 38% of Sohu's business. Sohu credits strong growth in mobile traffic and improving monetization as the big drivers to Sogou's growth. Sohu also mentions that it gained ad revenue market share during the quarter, something to keep in mind when Baidu reports on Thursday.

The news doesn't get prettier on the bottom line. Sohu posted another quarterly loss, and its adjusted deficit of $1.75 a share is at the uglier end of its earlier outlook calling for a loss per share between $1.55 and $1.80. Red ink is the norm, as Sohu has offered up a deficit in 12 of the past 13 quarters.
Things won't get a lot better in the near term. Sohu's guidance on Monday morning calls for $390 million to $420 million in revenue for the current quarter, as double-digit percentage declines in brand advertising and Changyou will once again eat into the growth in Sohu's search-related revenue. Sohu is eyeing an 8% to 14% increase at Sogou, an encouraging sign for Baidu investors nervously awaiting that dot-com darling's report later this week. 
Sohu sees an adjusted quarterly loss between $1.80 and $2.05 a share for the second quarter. The mounting deficits are problematic, but Sohu did close out the quarter with $1.25 billion in cash and short-term investments. In other words, it has more than enough liquidity to see it through this rough patch.

Real-time prices are provided by Bats Exchange on individual U.S. equities quote pages. During market hours, the real-time Bats price displays and new trade updates are updated on the page (as indicated by a "flash"). Volume always reflects consolidated markets. If the symbol has pre-market or post-market trades, that information will also be reflected along with the last (closing) price from the symbol's exchange. Real-time prices are available during market hours (9:30 AM to 4:00 PM EST).  Note: The Bats Exchange currently accounts for approximately 11-12% of all U.S. equity trading each day. As a result, the real-time prices displayed may have minor discrepancies when comparing the information with other sites offering real-time data, or with brokerage firms. If you require comprehensive real-time bids/asks/quotes, we offer a no-risk trial to one of our real-time products. Summary Quoteboard The Summary Quoteboard displays snapshot quote data. When available, Bid and Ask information from the Bats exchange is updated as new data is received. Volume is also updated but is the delayed consolidated Volume from the symbol's exchange. Quoteboard data fields include:  Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session. Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram. Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session. Bid: The last bid price and bid size. Ask: The last ask price and ask size. Volume: The total number of shares or contracts traded in the current trading session. Average Volume: The average number of shares traded over the last 20 days. Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.  Chart Snapshot A thumbnail of a daily chart is provided, with a link to open and customize a full-sized chart.Barchart Technical Opinion The Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overally Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal." If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal." Business Summary Provides a general description of the business conducted by this company. Price Performance This section shows the Highs and Lows over the past 1, 3 and 12-Month periods. Click the "See More" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.Fundamentals For US Stocks, the Overview page includes key statistics on the stock's fundamentals, with a link to see more. Most Recent Earnings figures are based on Non-GAAP income from continuing operations. Market Cap: capitalization or market value of a stock is simply the market value of all outstanding shares. It is computed by multiplying the market price by the number of outstanding shares. For example, a publicly held company with 10 million shares outstanding that trade at $10 each would have a market capitalization of $100 million. Shares Outstanding: Common shares outstanding as reported by the company on the 10-Q or 10-K. P/E Ratio: Latest closing price divided by the earnings-per-share based on the Latest 12-Month EPS Change (LTM) of earnings. Companies with negative earnings receive an "NE." EPS: The basic annual EPS from total operations is the bottom line income after all expenses, divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. For example, if a company has $10 million in net income and 10 million in outstanding shares, then its EPS is $1. Beta: 36 Month Beta: Coefficient that measures the volatility of a stock's returns relative to the market (S&P 500). It is based on a 36-month historical regression of the return on the stock onto the return on the S&P 500. Earnings: The amount of latest Earnings Per Share (EPS) paid out to shareholders. Dividend Yield: A portion of a company's profit paid to shareholders, quoted as the dollar amount each share receives (dividends per share). Yield is the amount of dividends paid per share, divided by the closing price. Sectors: Links to the Industry Groups and/or SIC codes in which the stock is found.Support and Resistance This section shows a snapshot view of the Trader's Cheat Sheet with the Last Price, and four separate pivot points (2 Support Levels, and 2 Resistance Points). The Last Price shown is the last trade price at the time the quote page was displayed, and will not update every 10 seconds (as the Last Price at the top of the Quote page does). The Last Price will update only when the page is refreshed. Pivot points are used to identify intraday support, resistance and target levels. The pivot point and its support and resistance pairs are defined as follows, where H, L, C are the current day's high, low and close, respectively. Support and Resistance points are based on end-of-day prices and are intended for the current trading session if the market is open, or the next trading session if the market is closed.   Pivot Point: (P) = (H + L + C) / 3 First Resistance Level: (R1) = (2 * P) - L First Support Level: (S1) = (2 * P) - H Second Resistance Level: (R2) = P + (R1 - S1) Second Support Level: (S2) = P - (R1 - S1) Related Stocks For comparison purposes, find information on other symbols contained in the same sector.Most Recent Stories View the latest top stories from the Associated Press or Canadian Press (based on your Market selection).
