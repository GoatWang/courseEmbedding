About CannaSys, Inc.
CannaSys creates, develops and commercialises innovative technology to solve problems, create opportunities and streamline the connections between producer, seller, and consumer patient segments in the cannabis industry. To date, CannaSys has developed four distinct brands and is working toward industry adoption and monetizing of its current offerings, CannaCash, CannaTrade, ExchangeHemp and CannAssist. CannaCash is an affiliate-based membership rewards loyalty program. CannaTrade is a market-style wholesale cannabis matching service, initially being released in the state of Colorado. ExchangeHemp is a hemp marketplace based on the CannaTrade platform. CannAssist is a technology installation, service and support team serving the Cannabis industry.
In addition to releasing and monetizing its current products, CannaSys plans to develop, acquire and build partnerships in order to bring innovative software solutions to market in both established and developing medical and recreational cannabis states.
As the current cannabis industry grows and gains momentum around the country, technology needs for the industry have been largely underserved. CannaSys’s focus on this niche element of the industry creates many efficient and profitable tools for both industry owners and consumers.
CannaSys consists of 3 companies that together serve the entire cannabis industry from grower-wholesaler to end-user via the technologies CannaTrade and CannaCash. The company was initially funded by Dave Berlin, the principal of Berlin Investment Group. Mr. Berlin has been an investor in public and private investment vehicles since 1993. He has had numerous successful investments in startups and as a venture capital investor.
CannaTrade is the technology that will formalize the wholesale marketplace for cannabis and its related products by serving as a mobile and web-based service that licensed producers and retailers can facilitate a market rate based exchange. CannaTrade’s real-time trading platform will be unique to the industry and begin to facilitate the efficient marketplace that will ultimately occur as more states legalize marijuana.
Contrary to the current ‘craigslist style’ listing of products for sale, CannaTrade’s unique market-driven approach allows buyers and sellers in the industry to bid appropriately based on quality and retail product inventory management. This technology will allow owners and operators the ability to manage inventory for known periods of under-supply or over-supply conditions. No current technology exists that allows cannabis and cannabis related products to be traded on a transactional basis rather than through subscription services or the common mailing list approach. The ultimate outcome of this technology will be a real-time trading platform that will result in efficient pricing and live marketplace. This platform is also being reporposed to served the emerging hemp markets in the United States as ExchangeHemp.
CannaCash will fulfill the need of creating a dynamic gift card program and reward points system for recreational and medical cannabis consumers. The technology program will further assist in allowing retailers the ability to create loyalty programs that can be effectively managed and allow the retailers to reach a broader consumer base. CannaCash is also designed to allow the consumer an efficient way to populate a card with cash value and begin using the points-based rewards program. None of the current coupon-based competition allows for this “frequent flier” type program that delivers real cash rewards and leverages mobile and social networking in the marijuana consumer market.
CannAssist will fulfill the technology needs that are specific to the cannabis industry. With technicians licensed and approved by the state to operate in restricted ares, CannAssist will serve the needs of cannabis business to install, update and maintain critical systems for dispensaries, growers and processors of cannabis. From video surveillance installation and maintenance to network security and support, CannAssist serves a wide range of technology challenges unique to the industry.

Will Cannasys Inc (OTCMKTS:MJTK)’s Latest Product, Citizen Toke, Make A Mark In Cannabis Market?


 By Emily Gibson / in Marijuana / on Tuesday, 17 Jan 2017 04:04 AM / 0 Comment




Cannasys Inc (OTCMKTS:MJTK) is a company which is often termed as a player in the cannabis market. In the last quarter of 2016, the company launched it new product called Citizen Toke in the Colorado market. In the times when the legal cannabis debate is the hottest trend in the U.S. and there is so much of gamble riding in this industry, Citizen Toke is something that may or may not leave it imprint in the canvas of consumers’ mind. But, there is no harm in trying; isn’t it?
Conjunction of mobile platform and cannabis market
How easy would it be if a cannabis patient or a consumer finds the coupons or discount deals through his own mobile phone? Well, Citizen Toke is a new product of the company that brings easy deals and sells off discount coupons to the patients and consumers of the cannabis market through its unique text message based system. It is primarily a mobile web based platform, which ensures that its customers get a peep into the retail experience of this industry.
Of course, the company earns its value through download of this product. The consumers are presented with the incentives to download, while they can also redeem coupons on milestones or timely way.
Why Capital Toke remains devoid of finance?
Cannasys Inc had acquired this product from Betakillers, LLC in 2016 August. Since then, there has been recapitalization for Capital Toke, but without luck. The company is hoping for extensive market penetration of this product, which would mean that it may possibly generate income for the company.
Why Colorado? 
Colorado and also California are two places where legalization debate has remained a hot stuff among the citizens. The launch of Citizen Toke in Colorado came during the holiday break, with an objective of ensuring a successful launch.
The company CEO, Michael Tew calls it an “important and core product” of the company. The company made Colorado its beta launch partner with a hope to ensure that their product will work well. Let’s see what the times ahead bring for this one, now!

These risks and uncertainties include those relating to our liquidity requirements, the continued growth of the software industry, the success of our product development, marketing and sales activities, vigorous competition in the software industry, dependence on existing management, leverage and debt service (including sensitivity to fluctuations in interest rates), domestic or global economic conditions, the inherent uncertainty and costs of prolonged arbitration or litigation, and changes in federal or state tax laws or the administration of such laws.  Introduction  We create, develop, and commercialize innovative solutions for the expanding medical and recreational cannabis community. Our solutions enhance customer service and provider efficiency, including customer loyalty software applications; create producer and retailer opportunities through the distribution of our own retail brands; and assist with marketing and branding for product companies. We do not grow, distribute, or sell cannabis or products containing cannabis.  We began our cannabis industry activity with the organization of a predecessor privately held entity in late 2013 to create, develop, and commercialize innovative solutions to solve customer service and provider problems, create producer and retailer opportunities, build retail customer loyalty, and streamline the connections among the producer, seller, and consumer/patient segments for the growing medical and recreational cannabis community. Since organization, we have focused on raising capital, creating new products, building marketing and distribution capability and channels, and pursuing complementary strategic alliances and acquisitions.  In August 2014, Cannasys, Inc., then called Thermal Tennis, Inc., acquired our predecessor engaged in cannabis industry-related activities as noted above in a transaction recognized as a reverse acquisition of the company by the predecessor private company. This discussion relates to the financial statements of the privately held predecessor entity for all periods before the reverse acquisition.  Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2016,  Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2015  Revenue and Costs of Goods Sold  Our revenue was $66,849 and $119,325 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, a decrease of $52,476 or 43.9%. The decrease is largely attributed to a decrease in revenue from software development. Revenue has been generated through a combination of software development and consulting services related to custom-built software. We generate the majority of our revenue from custom software development related to CannaLIMS, ongoing recurring contracts for BumpUp Rewards, and custom development related to BumpUp Rewards white-label applications. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we did not generate a material amount of revenue from our strategic relationships.  Our cost of goods sold was $24,260 and $47,823 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Operating Expenses  Stock-based compensation expense was $697,523 and $904,125 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing a decrease of $206,602, or 22.8%, in 2016. Stock-based compensation expense is from warrants issued to officers, consultants, and other service providers. In the current year, fewer warrants were issued, thereby decreasing our expense.  Professional fees were $369,212 and $207,892 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing an increase of $161,320, or 77.5%, in 2016. The increase in 2016, as compared to 2015, can be largely attributed to increased legal and audit fees related to increased transactions, fundraising, and reporting activities.  Salary and wage expense was $230,176 and $491,223 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, a decrease of $261,047, or 53.1%, in 2016. The decrease in 2016, as compared to 2015, is due to a reduction in salaried employees in the beginning of 2016.  General and administrative expense was $347,514 and $231,033 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of $116,481, or 50.4%, in 2016. The increase in 2016, as compared to 2015, can be attributed to increased consulting and other outside service expense.  Other Income and Expense  For the year ended December 31, 2016, we had total other expense of $3,245,770, compared to $2,095,085 for the year ended December 31, 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded interest expense of $46,094, compared to $6,344 for the prior year, and an impairment loss on investment of $1,049,475, compared to $1,846,515 for the prior year. In addition, as a result of convertible promissory notes, we recorded interest expense on debt discount of $612,679 in 2016, compared to $85,250 for the prior year, and a loss on the issuance of convertible debt of $1,214,985, compared to $152,866 for the prior year.  Net Loss  For the year ended December 31, 2016, we had a net loss of $4,847,606, as compared to a net loss of $3,857,856 in the prior year, an increase of $989,750, or 25.6%, in 2016. This increase is the direct result of the additional expense attributable to the issuance of convertible notes.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  During the year ended December 31, 2016, we used cash of $457,380 in operating activities, as compared to $750,750 for the year ended December 31, 2015. We did not use cash in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $154,250 used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015. Financing activities provided cash of $456,750 during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $387,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015.  Our current business expenses average approximately $30,000 per month, excluding capital expenditures specific to new product launches. We continue to focus on reducing our monthly business expenses through cost reductions and operational streamlining. Currently, we do not have enough cash on hand to sustain our business operations and, alongside expected revenue, we expect to access external capital resources in the near future. At the moment, we are seeing increased adoption across our business lines, but we cannot guarantee this will continue.  We anticipate also accessing the capital markets in order to fund future research and development, as well as expand product offerings to include future versions of products and possible acquisitions of ancillary products and services. To the extent that funding is available, we have budgeted $550,000 for capital expenditures and other costs during the next 12 months, consisting of $200,000 for enhanced software development and marketing for AFN, $250,000 for debt retirement (and, if necessary, to provide for refinancing or extensions of our existing debt, including principal and any interest due under the terms of our current financing agreements with our capital partners), and $100,000 for legal, audit and accounting expenses. We may seek additional debt financing, although we cannot guarantee what structures our sources of financing may choose in the future, and there is no guarantee we will be able to secure additional funding. In addition, the vast majority of our debt is convertible into common stock, in which case we will not have to retire it; the investors are able to convert the debt into our shares. If we were to retire all of our outstanding debt, including the convertible promissory notes, and pay the maximum potential interest due, we would need to budget approximately $350,000.  We anticipate that we will fund a portion of these costs from proceeds from projected revenues, as well as from the sale of common stock to Kodiak Capital Group, LLC under our equity purchase agreement and other potential sources. It is possible that additional external cash will be required during the next 12 months, particularly if we seek to develop new products, need to fund new strategic relationships, or enter new markets not now anticipated or if projected revenues are not realized.  Our efforts are focused on increasing revenue while we explore external funding alternatives as our current cash is insufficient to fund operations for the next 12 months. Although our independent auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, we feel that our revenue potential is sufficient for our business to continue as a going concern. However, in order to expand our product offerings, we expect that we will require additional investments and revenue.  As we continue to develop new products and identify specific commercialization opportunities, we will focus on those product markets and opportunities for which we might be able to get external funding through joint venture agreements, strategic partnerships, or other direct investments.  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  As of December 31, 2016, there were no off balance sheet arrangements.  Critical Accounting Policies  We have identified the policies outlined below as critical to our business operations and an understanding of our results of operations. The list is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, with no need for management's judgment in their application. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations when such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see the notes to our December 31, 2016, financial statements. Note that our preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We cannot assure that actual results will not differ from those estimates.  Stock-based Compensation  We account for equity-based transactions with nonemployees under the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 505-50, Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees. ASC 505-50 establishes that equity-based payment transactions with non-employees shall be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The fair value of common stock issued for payments to nonemployees is measured at the market price on the date of grant. The fair value of equity instruments, other than common stock, is estimated using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. In general, we recognize the fair value of the equity instruments issued as deferred stock compensation and amortize the cost over the term of the contract.  We account for employee stock-based compensation in accordance with the guidance of ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, which requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. The fair value of the equity instrument is charged directly to compensation expense and credited to additional paid-in capital over the period during which services are rendered.  Revenue Recognition and Cost of Goods Sold  We follow ASC 605-10-S99-1, Revenue Recognition, for revenue recognition. We will recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. We consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer; (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable; and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.  During the fiscal year 2016, we generated revenue from: (1) customized software development (software developed for customers on a custom-made basis); and  We allocated cost of goods sold for both forms of revenue on a pro rata basis through either direct outsourcing of development resources or direct costs associated with our employees or contractors.  Income Taxes  We follow ASC 740-10-30, Income Taxes-Initial Measurement, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the fiscal year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the fiscal years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the Statements of Income in the period that includes the enactment date.  We adopted ASC 740-10-25, Income Taxes-Recognition. ASC 740-10-25 addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under ASC 740-10-25, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. ASC 740-10-25 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, and accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures. We had no material adjustments to our liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits according to the provisions of ASC 740-10-25.  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  In May 2014, August 2015, April 2016, and May 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) 2014-09-Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), ASU 2015-14-Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, ASU 2016-10-Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606):  In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16-Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments. Topic 805 requires that an acquirer retrospectively adjust provisional amounts recognized in a business combination during the measurement period. To simplify the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts, the amendments in the update require that the acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amount is determined. The acquirer is required to also record, in the same period's financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. In addition, an entity is required to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes to the financial statements the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. ASU 2015-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning December 15, 2015. The adoption of ASU 2015-16 is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements.  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17-Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. The new guidance requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. This update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. We do not anticipate the adoption of this ASU will have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02-Leases (Topic 842). The guidance in ASU 2016-02 supersedes the lease recognition requirements in ASC 840, Leases (FAS 13). ASU 2016-02 requires an entity to recognize assets and liabilities arising from a lease for both financing and operating leases, along with additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect this standard will have on our financial statements.  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15-Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230):  We have implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and we do not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
