This conference call is being recorded at the request of General Cable. Should you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. All participants have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question-and-answer period after the speakers' remarks. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.
Gavin Bell, Vice President, Investor Relations, General Cable, you may begin your conference.
Gavin Bell
Good morning, everyone, and welcome to General Cable's fourth quarter 2016 earnings conference call. I am Gavin Bell, Vice President, Investor Relations. Joining me this morning are Mike McDonnell, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Matti Masanovich, our Chief Financial Officer. 
Today's call will be accompanied by a slide presentation, which is available on our website at generalcable.com. If you have not downloaded a copy, we recommend that you do so as we will refer to the presentation throughout our prepared remarks today.
On today's call, Mike will provide an overview of our progress on our strategic roadmap, an overview of our fourth quarter performance, and first quarter outlook. Matti will then provide some additional details on our fourth quarter results and financial position. Before we get started, I want to call your attention to our Safe Harbor provision regarding forward-looking statements and Company-defined non-GAAP financial measures, as defined on slide number two as we will be making forward-looking statements and referring to adjusted results in today's call.
To begin, please turn to slide seven. And I will now turn the call over to Mike McDonnell.
Mike McDonnell
Thanks, Gavin. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us on the call today. Before we discuss the fourth quarter, I would like to say a few words about the substantial progress we have made across many fronts in 2016. And I would like to note that the progress we have seen this year wouldn't have been accomplished without the hard work and ongoing dedication of our General Cable team. I want to recognize and thank them for this.
We completed the first year of our three year strategic roadmap. We are focusing the company on its core strategic businesses, building scale and efficiency in the manufacturing network and supply chain, and driving targeted growth in selected markets. At the end of this transformation, we will become one of the most focused, efficient and innovative companies in our industry. We start to see some early benefits from the roadmaps but most of the key initiatives and impacts are ahead. We are especially pleased with the progress we have made in North America which was a primary focus of the strategic roadmap in the first year.
All of the roadmap initiatives in North America are in progress and many significant projects will be completed in Q3 and Q4 of this year. However, it is really nice to see some early results in our North American performance. We are working diligently to complete the North America work and continue the ramp up of roadmap initiatives in both Europe and Latin America. As you might remember our roadmap has four key elements; first, portfolio focus and optimization. We examine the businesses in our portfolio focusing on global growth markets and electric utility, industrial and communications against our previously disclosed criteria of market leadership, operating scale, ability to attain an industry leading cost structure and long term sustainable growth potential. 

We now have number one, number two or strong number three positions in approximately 80% of our revenue. The second element of our roadmap is developing industry leading cost and efficiency position. Our vision is to have focused efficient factories, an optimized supply chain and a substantial competitive advantage from an industry leading cost positions and this is critical for us as a manufacturing company. To achieve this we are doing two things. The first is implementing five major projects, the majority of which are in North America at this time to consolidate and streamline our manufacturing operations in order to drive scale and efficiency. For example, in our manufacturing operations nearly half of all of our plants are undergoing substantial project driven change. 
The second thing is implementing supply chain efficiencies including global procurement and a new logistic management system in North America that will leverage our substantial operating scale. These initiatives are also progressing well and on schedule. The third element of our roadmap is targeted growth, partly through targeted share recovery which is happening now. We are also positioning the business in faster growing markets such as renewables, data communications and grid connectivity. And we expect to see more impact from these targeted initiatives later this year. Finally, our growth initiatives based on product and service innovation will have an impact later in the three year plan. Finally the fourth and what I use the most important component of our roadmap, is cultivating a high performance culture. It is the people, not the plans that drive change in a company. And our team is already showing how a high performance culture based on share values can positively impact the business. 
On the ground I and the management team continue to experience a more energized, exciting organization and a talented set of team members that are even more invested in the growth and profitability of their company. This is a team that is capable of driving substantial change in General Cable. I look forward to seeing us accomplish this together. You know a key takeaway from this year is that in substantial transformation such as the one we are undergoing, progress is very seldom linear particularly in the early stages. 
We have had many successes so far and few challenges and we are learning from both as we continue to improve our performance. Our restructuring initiatives with the exception of one restructuring project in Europe are tracking with plan and making substantial progress. Overall we are on track and confident in our ability to deliver the $160 million of profit improvement from our roadmap. We all know that exceptional leadership drives exceptional results especially in the transformation. Our roadmap and importantly the momentum we built around it have enabled us to attract top talent to our management team. 
Over the last six months we have welcomed a new Chief Financial Officer, a new Chief Human Resources officer, a new leader for Latin America and just a few weeks ago, a new leader for our North American business among a number of others. I am confident that we have the right people in place who have deep talent and proven experience to help us achieve our goals of being more focused, efficient and innovative. We also expect our new leadership team to contribute to our revitalized culture by having high performance leaders to guide and inspire enthusiastic teams. 
This is a key piece of the new General Cable we are building. Now I would like to give a high level overview of our Q4 performance and outlook and then I will turn it over to Matti for a full discussion. Overall adjusted operating income was flat year over year as the impact of rising metal prices and stronger results in North America were offset by the substantial easing of our sub-sea project business in Europe and the continuing weak macro environment in Latin America. 

Unfortunately, relative to our expectations our performance for the quarter with the low end of our guidance range as we experienced an implementation delay for restructuring project in Europe. In North America we continue to build momentum. We are driving our restructuring initiatives forward while capturing projects in our electric utility and construction business as unit volume increased 10% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. We are pleased with the improvements we are seeing as we generated adjusted operating income of $32 million of the fourth quarter inclusive of the metals benefit. 
Sales and bookings activity as well as efficiency improvement have increased in each sequential month of the quarter. Overall North America's performance in 2016 was encouraged and we are executing well and beginning to see the early benefits of the strategic roadmaps. In Europe we recorded an adjusted operating loss of $4 million which was down $10 million year-over-year mainly due to the dropping of the sub-sea project business which we have anticipated and discussed for many quarters now. We have strong businesses in Europe with good market positions and excellent technology. 
We continue to experience strong demand for high voltage and extra high voltage turnkey projects. Our data communications business grew 35% this year. Our Sub-sea project business as anticipated is now at talk level. We are beginning to bring a stronger backlog for the future. At the same time one of our restructuring projects in Europe is behind schedule and still in the implementation phase. We have maintained our market position there, but we are experiencing higher operating cost at the moment. We are executing a plan to complete the project over the next few quarters and fully realize the benefits. 
We do expect to see sequential improvement in adjusted operating income in Europe as we move through 2017. In Latin America, we continue to operate around breakeven from an adjusted operating income perspective. While our volume for the fourth quarter was up year-over-year, principally driven by our lower value add product category such as R.O.D, we continue to expect a choppy and uneven demand environment that we have seen throughout the year. Excluding ROD sales unit volume was flat year-over-year for the fourth quarter. 
We had a focus plan to improve our performance in North America in the current challenging environment which consists of fixing the fundamentals of the business and optimizing our channels to market. We recently hired a very accomplished executive to lead the Latin American region on a dedicated basis. We also hired a very experienced executive to run our business in Brazil. With this refreshed team in place, I believe we will see steady progress in Latin America over the next year. 
And our plan calls for sequential growth in adjusted operating income through 2017. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2017 we are expecting unit volumes to be up low single digits year-on-year. In North America we continue to see the improved sales and booking trends continue into January. During my visits and conversations with customers over the last few months, many or most commented on the noticeable uptick in project and bidding activity. 
Let me summarize our outlook for key markets in North America. The utility segment outlook is positive. With particular strength in renewables and by the way we have a capacity addition coming later this year to help us serve the strong demand. The industrial segment we are seeing a strengthening backlog for Q1 and coding activity remains strong. In non-residential construction coding activity remains strong in December and again in January. One of our customers anecdotally noted that they saw more code activity in January than in all of first quarter of 2016. 

Now I want to emphasize that the uptick we are seeing here is incrementally modest but it is broad based across our customers and markets in North America. It is too early to tell if the recent improvement is sustainable but the trends I am seeing are encouraging. In Europe the overall growth is stable in the low single digits with a strong demand outlook in particular brought to rest flow turnkey project business. Latin America continues to be choppy and uneven similar to what we have experienced over the last year. 
Although progress in Europe and Latin America is lower than what we have expected at the beginning of 2016, I am confident that we are on the right track. As I said North America has been primary focus of the roadmap and its net worth exceeded most targets in 2016. By continuing to implement these successful initiatives across the whole of the business, we will have a more productive, efficient organization that will position us to more effectively compete and create value for shareholders. 
With those comments, I will now handover the call to Matti. 
Matti Masanovich
Thanks Mike. Turning to Slide 9; Q4 2016 key financial results. Net sales for the quarter were flat year-on-year as rising up prices and higher unit volume was offset by lower European Sub-sea project activity and the sale of the company's North America Ignition wired business which was completed at the end of the second quarter 2016.
Volume as measured in metal pounds was up 9% year-over-year as demand improved across all three regions driven principally by demand for electric utility, construction and ROD products. Adjusted operating income of $27 million was down $1 million versus the prior year as favorable metal cost impacts, higher unit volume and favorable North America operating performance helped to partially offset the impact of lower project activity in the European Sub-sea power business and in the sale of our North America nationwide Cable business. 
Turning to Slide 10, in North America net sales were flat year-over-year. Rising metal prices and higher unit volume helped to offset the impact of the sale of our Ignition wire business. Unit volume for the region was up 10% year-over-year. Our electric utility business including both transmission and distribution was up 12% year-over-year as spending improved for renewables and grid maintenance work. As compared to last year we experienced a sharp decline in demand in the end of the year. 
We continue to grow our position in our construction based product categories including both copper and aluminum building wire which are favorable year-over-year in the fourth quarter by 38% and 23% respectively. Demand for industrial cables including oil and gas was down year-over-year but the pace of decline has slowed substantially as these businesses were down on average 4% year-over-year for the fourth quarter. Throughout the year these businesses were down year-on-year on average in the range of 20% to 25% per quarter. 
On a full year basis, oil and gas was down 52%. Adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter of $32 million improved approximately $11 million year-on-year. Principally due to the impact of North America cost savings initiatives that are beginning to take hold with respect to lean manufacturing and purchasing savings as well the impact of selling lower average cost inventory into a higher metal cost environment and the impact of higher unit volumes due to growth in key product lines.
Overall demand of 2016 was flat versus 2015. We did however experience growth in jour electric utility, distribution and construction businesses as we capture projects for grid expansion and reinforcements and recapture share in our construction businesses. These trends were offset by the uneven market demand experienced throughout the year through our industrial and specialty cables business particularly those tied to oil and gas applications. We are monitoring order patterns closely as we are encouraged with the solid pace of shipments and bookings to the first month of the year. 

Turning to Slide 11, Europe; net sales were flat year-on-year as the impact of rising metal prices and higher unit volume helped to offset the impact of lower sub-sea project activity. Unit volume was favorable 6% year-on-year as the company and land based turn key projects for the electricity grid interconnection projects throughout Europe as well as its energy cable business. The base business for flow business comprised of industrial construction products continues to be under pressure throughout the region. 
Adjusted operating loss for the fourth quarter of $4 million was down $10 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, principally due to lower activity in the sub-sea cable business. As several major turnkey projects were completed and closed out. As Mike mentioned we are experiencing a lock in the sub-sea project activity as we work to replenish our backlog with solid tender activity. We are actively biding on a number of projects which include both longer term projects as well as shorter run smaller scale projects. 
Our project backlog including both sub-sea and land was $125 million at the end of the fourth quarter.
Turning to Slide 12, Latin America. Net sales increased year-on-year by 6% driven by rise in metal prices and higher unit volume. Unit volume improved 10% year-on-year of demand of ROD products which as Mike alluded have a lower margin profile. Excluding ROD shipments unit volume was flat year-on-year. Adjusted operating income continues to fluctuate around breakeven. While our results are clearly not where we need to be nor we expect them to be, we are making progress. Our businesses in both Chile and Colombia have performed well this year capturing volume and driving operational improvements. 
Overall our businesses throughout the region continue to face a challenging macro environment marked by weak construction spending and growth rates. We are continuing to implement our restructuring actions to drive savings and improve operational execution across the region. Briefly on our divestiture program, as of the end of the fourth quarter we have sold or liquidated a majority of our businesses in the Asia Pacific and Africa region generating $203 million of cash proceeds. 
In the fourth quarter, we completed the wind down of operations in South Africa. We are advancing down the path of exiting the remaining operations including China, Algeria and Angola. We are targeting total proceeds from divestitures in the range of $250 million to $300 million.
Turning to Slide 14, we provided a summary of our debt maturity profile position as of the fourth quarter. Net debt of $838 million was down $129 million from the end of 2015 due to continued tight management working capital and cash proceeds generated for divestitures. For the fourth quarter and full year 2016, we generated strong operating cash flow of $89 million and $155 million respectively which is consistent with our expectations. Capital spending for the fourth quarter and full year was $31 million and $84 million respectively.
Approximately 60% of our capital update for the year was invested in select areas to enable topline growth while the remaining balance represents spending on general maintenance purposes. We anticipate our capital spending for 2017 to be between $80 million $100 million and to be split along the same basis as 2016 with respect to growth and maintenance projects. 
This level of spending has been in line with our strategic roadmap. We currently have $399 million of availability under our North America and European based credit facility. We are well positioned upon the business including working capital requirements, restructuring activities, CapEx, quarterly dividends and other corporate obligations.

Before providing some additional color on our first quarter outlook I wanted to touch base on the segment of the FCPA matter on Slide 16. At the end of December we reached agreements with the DOJ and the SEC to resolve the respected FCPA related investigations as well as the SEC's separate accounting investigation related to the company's legacy financial re-statements for a total amount of approximately $82 million.
We recorded a charge of approximately $49 million in the fourth quarter 2016. The company made its first payment of approximately $33 million to the government in January of 2017. The second payment of approximately $18 million is due at the end of June and the final payment of approximately $31 million is due at the end of the year. The company expects to utilize cash and borrowings on its revolving credit facility to fund these payments. General Cable remains committed to ethical business practices and over the past two years, we have invested significant time and resources to implement a world class compliance program, an action that was recognized by the authorities itself. 
Finally on Slide 18, our first quarter outlook anticipates net sales in the range of $850 million to $900 million. Adjusted operating income in the range of $25 million to $40 million. And adjusted earnings per share of $0.05 to $0.20. Our guidance assumes copper and aluminum prices of $2.60 and $0.81 per pound respectively. Overall our guidance reflects a solid performance in North America and favorable metal cost impacts as well as lower average cost inventory as we sell lower cost inventory into the metal market with improving results in Latin America and Europe as we move throughout the year. That concludes our prepared remarks and I will turn the call back over to the operator who will assist us in taking your questions. 
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Shawn Harrison with Longbow Research. Please go ahead. 
Shawn Harrison
Hi good morning. 
Mike McDonnell
Good morning Shawn. 
Shawn Harrison
Hopefully an easy question first before I delve into some other restructuring but maybe if you could just talk about, are you I wouldn't think much of net importer of any substantial product into the USA and just kind of your thinking on Border Tax dynamics?
Matti Masanovich
Shawn its Matti. I will take the question. You know it's a little early to kind of make, have an opinion on what's going on because there is very different proposals out there. So it's pretty fluid and there is no clear direction on any law changes. There has been discussion on border adjustments. We do have a business in Mexico and we do have a business in Canada and we do import product into United States. So I would tell you though we have a large manufacturing presence in the United States and we could share the production to the USA. One of our major competitors in the automotive business are very similar situated to us. 
One of my background is also Automotive and the automotive business is pretty heavily invested in Mexico so I do think there is potential impact the percentage we are talking about is 20% but I think we have got the ability to ship production if need be. And/or you know I think it's a little too early to tell where it's going to land at this stage. 
Shawn Harrison
That's helpful Matti. Second just on the restructuring, if we could talk about where you are at in terms of dollars of savings generated to date. I thought it was something if I added everything up, $60 million on supply chain and logistics and the remainder on manufacturing adjustments to your total number and so if you could just walk me through of maybe what you think 2016 was in terms of run rates of both categories, where you expect 2017 to end up given the delay in Europe and what flows into 2018 if possible?

Mike McDonnell
Shawn I can give you some high color on that. First let me just point out we are one year into a three year plan and the progress here is never linear especially early on and the results are back end loaded by design. If we break that $160 million down which is our targeted profit improvement from our roadmap, approximately two-thirds of that is overall cost and in that cost bucket there is a manufacturing bucket and a supply chain bucket $40 million and $60 million respectively for the $100 million. And then the other $60 million is growth. $15 million of that $60 million is organic market growth and $45 million of that $60 million is from targeted growth initiatives both in terms of leveraging our channels, improving our service proposition customers and also innovation and technology of products and services of products. 
So kind of lay all of that out. And I have been saying for the last three quarters that we expected to begin the sea path late in 2016 and the first wave of savings would come from things like our lean initiatives, scrap initiatives, procurement which we have gotten some real traction on. And most of that savings in late 2016 coming in later in 2016 would be in North America, that's been the primary focus of the roadmap. As we move into 2017, we have these five major projects and a number of smaller ones too. They are all expected to be completed later in 2017 and by the end of 2017. There will be one or two going into 2018 but these five of the manufacturing side would be largely done late this year. 
Our savings will step up at that point in time and we will be capturing a big part of that manufacturing and supply chain set. We haven't mentioned that yet and we will do that soon. We plan to have an investor day later this year and we will take everybody through that and to upgrade our queue, to integrate detail where you are also introduce you to our management team. So right now we are pleased with what we have gotten in 2016 that was kind of our expectation. Late in the year, it was some procurement and some lean and little bit of the targeted share recovery that I talked about earlier. Expect that momentum to continue to build in North America, particularly in the second half of the year in North America where we will see a step change from these projects completing. 
These are projects like many of the consolidations we referred to, projects like our procurement, projects like our transportation management system, etcetera. They have a sizable impact, these projects and we have got great line of sight on this. In Europe we have got this restructuring project to be done, then there is more behind that in terms of our roadmap but that's not really right now front and center. We do expect to complete that over the next few quarters and then we will start to layer in more of the roadmap savings there. 
Then Latin America, we have got a good plan. A new management team there, a new leader. The first time we have ever had a dedicated leader for Latin America in our history and he brings tremendous experience and operational savvy to the region. He is living in the region and speaks the language as well. And so excited about the progress that we are going to make there. I think the way to look at both Europe and Latin America in 2017 is slow and steady progress, you know sequentially. 
And that will probably get most of the benefits in the year 2018 in the third year of the plan. So Shawn has that helped kind of lay out kind of where we are and what we are seeing where we expect to be. 
Shawn Harrison
It does Mike and if I may just, two brief follow ups. I think the last analyst you had kind of EBIT or EBITDA margin target for North America. It would be at the upper end of what you would be doing. It would be driving a lot of the company. Do you think it will close to where you want the EBIT margins to be exiting the year in North America?

Mike McDonnell
I think we are Shawn; again North America has been the primary focus of roadmap so far. That's not to say we haven't been working in Latin America and Europe and North America we got the majority of our resource base here, majority of the company so we wanted to make this the first place where we really made it successful and then leverage those earnings out into the second and third year so in Q4 I might add, we demonstrated 6.8% top ready margin in North America already which frankly a little bit ahead of my expectation. 
I think we saw a little bit more from our roadmap in Q4 than we expected. I am just really pleased with the North American business. It is performing and developing expectations and we will hit those targets. 
Shawn Harrison
Perfect. And then on Europe can you hit your targets without sub-sea coming back?
Matti Masanovich
Yes, because if you recall that investor day, and Shawn here we try to be as transparent as we can be. We backed out the peak to trough contribution from sub-sea in our 2015 results so if you remember that Shawn, that bridge, you know there is a big down. We backed down $40 million from sub-sea. Look anything we get from it now is upside to go against our $160 million target. But we are not counting on being the peak again. Remember that peak was associated with Baltic 1, Baltic 2, the biggest project, sub-sea project in our company's history and that is now completed. 
Mike McDonnell 
And I also think it's fair to say that there's no project as that project, there is some tender bid activity there, and is within our contrasted capability so we are seeing that in particular. So thanks Matti, we don't like to stay in troughs, we don't like troughs and neither does the team over there. They are fighting hard in fact; I am going to be there next week with them to review to the backlog which is beginning to grow again. But I don't want to get too ahead of our skies on that right now, we can do with where we at today. 
Shawn Harrison
Perfect, thanks so much. 
Mike McDonnell 
You are welcome Shawn. 
Operator
And your next question comes from the line of George Godfrey from C.L. King. Your line is open. 
George Godfrey
Thank you. Good morning gentlemen. Couple of questions. First question, looking at the three year roadmap for CapEx and cash flow, free cash flow. The CapEx figuring cumulative still targeting to be $300 million?
Matti Masanovich
Yes we are on track with our strategic roadmap to spend. That's correct, on track. 
George Godfrey
Okay, so $85 million this year, $100 million to the high end of next year so that would leave a bucket of about $115 million if need to?
Matti Masanovich
Correct. 
George Godfrey
Okay, thank you. And then if I look at the adjusted EPS of the first quarter the outlook there, the restructuring divestiture costs $8 million and $0.07 a share. Is that a reasonable estimate for the future quarters on where you think [indiscernible]?
Mike McDonnell 
Hey George, we are having difficulty hearing the question, could you repeat it? It is coming a little up on the line. 
George Godfrey
Yes, I am sorry. Hopefully this is better. In the Q1 outlook restructuring divestiture cost $8 million or $0.07 a share for Q1 2017, is that a reasonable baseline for quarters two, three & four or do you think that trends down as we go throughout the year?
Matti Masanovich
I think it's going to trend down throughout the year, that's kind of the roadmap spending and so that will trend down throughout the year. 
George Godfrey
Okay. And then following up on that, the Asia Pacific income lost $0.02 a quarter. Until that business is sold, is that a reasonable expectation as the year goes out by quarter?
Matti Masanovich
Yes, I would think that it is a reasonable expectation on go forward basis, correct.

George Godfrey
Okay. And then looking at the rest thing at those pieces in Asia Pacific and Africa, is that something you think you could have one by the end of this year or does this carry into 2018?
Matti Masanovich
My goal is to have that done by the end of this year. 
George Godfrey
Okay. And then just the last question. If we think of the demand picture in each of the three regional I understand what we said about Latin America and Europe being a slow steady improvement and North America perhaps being stronger. The visibility beyond the next six months in the 2018, does the historical trends in the business could make you think that 2018 could be a better year for 2017 or is that too early to tell. [Indiscernible] geographical areas?
Mike McDonnell 
You know we have good visibility three to six months out just given that half of our business is project based and so we have some pretty good visibility and I guess the thing I am encouraged about is the momentum we are seeing right now which I think speaks well to the potential for a better first half and that jury is still out in terms of how that momentum translates into later 2017 & 2018. There are lots of puts and takes here. You know overall, I talk to a lot of CEO's out there, I think we are feeling better about the future than we were feeling three or six months ago in terms of North America. And we are seeing the right kinds of things starting to happen. 
George Godfrey
Okay. Thank you very much. 
Mike McDonnell 
Sure. 
Operator
And that concludes our question and answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Gavin Bell.
Gavin Bell
