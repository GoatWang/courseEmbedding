How I can help you


	I have been involved with Sales and Sales Management for over 43 years involved with products sold to Restaurants, Hotels, Country Clubs, Caterers, Health Care operations serving the hospitality industry and food service operations. These products included Disposables, Tabletop, Cleaning and Maintanance, Smallwares and furniture and equipment. My background also included the management of the product category of Disposable products. I have been an avid pleasure boater on the Chesapeake Bay for over 25 years and was involved as a volunteer with the Coast Guard Auxiliary for 12 years. Setting attaining goals during my career for both my sales staff and myself as been key towards success.

The 30-Minute Interview 
By                     
 VIVIAN MARINO
 
OCT. 29, 2013

Mr. Brodsky, 56, is the president of Related Management, a division of the Related Companies that manages the developer’s 45,000 rental units, from affordable to work force to luxury, and more than six million square feet of commercial and retail space in 19 states. Interview conducted and condensed by
VIVIAN MARINOQ. You joined Related in 1982. What was your first job there?A. I was a development officer. We were looking at acquiring troubled assets and aggregating the funding necessary to create affordable housing. I was doing that for the first three or four years, then I became part of the property management group.I had first worked with my dad for three years — he was a very small affordable-housing developer — and I met Steve Ross through that connection and ultimately Steve asked if I would join Related.

Continue reading the main story

Q. Before that, you were an engineer.A. I went to work for Ford Motor Company in Detroit in the late ’70s during the oil crisis, when people were standing on line for gas, and when Pintos were blowing up. So that wasn’t a great career choice. Continue reading the main story

Q. So what specifically does Related Management do?A. If you want to be as simplified as possible, we collect the rent and make sure the building is maintained. We think of ourselves, however, as brand- and value-enhancing. So the goal is to take whatever there is that’s given to us and enhance it over time and add to the value of our asset.Q. Under your leadership you’ve added a few amenities and services, like free bicycle rentals.A. That’s part of the wellness commitment and there are many others. About 70 percent of the luxury brand has the bikes, and the residents are loving that. It actually started in our work force brand about three years ago.We have a number of amenities where we think people are framing what they believe is a sense of community in the apartment building, and that might be Internet lounges and roof terraces and libraries. And then you have our services which are delivered in a proprietary way through things like personal assistants and tech concierges.Q. Was it your idea to institute a smoking ban in all your rentals?A. I’d like to say that it was an organizational commitment. We needed somebody to push it and I think I was definitely a person who’s tried to do that. We initiated it actually in 2009 and test-marketed it and found it to be extremely well-received and so we went national with it this year.

Q. Has it been easy to enforce? A. It really isn’t as difficult as it sounds. If you are a noisy neighbor, everybody would know. With smoking it’s the same. You become aware of it, you have the conversation. The vast majority of people understand, and, frankly, it’s not causing us any stress between residents.The worst-case scenario has never occurred, and that is that we have to go to court and ask you to abide by the terms of the contract you signed or leave.

Q. What do you say to people who complain that their rights are being violated by this rule?A. If, for example, I was entirely libertarian and I said, you can do anything inside your apartment that is legally your option to do, I can understand that. However, smoking cannot be contained to your apartment, and so you are compromising somebody else. We have an obligation to address that person’s needs.We’re doing this as a commitment that follows the brand, so wellness is smoke-free.Q. Do you see the no-smoking rule eventually being put in place in your condominiums?

A. We managed 3,000 units of condos and we actually met with a board in Boston to help facilitate those discussions. And one of the boards in Boston just the other day voted on this: 60 percent of their residents voted to become a smoke-free building. They need 75 percent, but this was after two weeks of discussions, so it’s very possible that they’re moving in that direction.Q. So what is your occupancy rate portfoliowide?A. We’re almost exclusively fully occupied except for new buildings where we’re in the middle of lease-up. So vacancy rates are under 3 percent throughout the country.Q. And the range of rental rates?A. Oh my goodness! We have the most diverse portfolio in the United States. The affordable programs are subsidized rents and if their income is close to zero, they pay zero. And then, of course, our highest-income residents are paying full price and some are paying as much as $20,000 a month.Q. What percentage of Related’s portfolio is affordable?A. About 26,000 units of 45,000, so it’s a significant portion. We’re now the sixth-largest owner of affordable housing in the United States — probably something that’s not so obvious about Related.Q. What kinds of amenities do the affordable buildings get?A. You need to be best in class no matter what class — and we have a lot of classes. The more you pay the more you get. Look, affordable housing programs are not designed to provide for extreme levels of luxuries. Many of them will have clubhouses, playgrounds, fitness and computer centers and a whole bunch of other things, but not as exceptionally designed as we have in some of the other facilities.Q. Do you live in a Related property?A. I’m a Long Islander. I like my little piece of grass.
