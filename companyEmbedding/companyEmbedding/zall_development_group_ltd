BEIJING, March 17, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- LightInTheBox Holding Co., Ltd. (NYSE:   LITB) ("LightInTheBox" or the "Company"), a global online retail company that delivers products directly to consumers around the world, today announced that Zall Cross-border E-commerce Investment Company Limited ("Zall E-Commerce"), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Zall Development Group Ltd. (HKSE Code: 2098)("Zall Development"), a developer and operator of large-scale consumer-focused product wholesale shopping malls in China, has agreed to acquire a strategic equity interest in the Company. Both companies will explore opportunities in cross-border ecommerce and leverage each other's respective competitive advantages to jointly develop a global market for Chinese high-quality wholesale consumer-focused products.
Under the terms of the subscription agreement, the Company has agreed to issue and Zall E-Commerce has agreed to subscribe to a total of 42,500,000 ordinary shares, equivalent to 21,250,000 ADSs, accounting for a 30% equity interest in LightInTheBox on a fully diluted basis, at $1.80 per ordinary share, equivalent to $3.60 per ADS.  In addition, the Company has agreed to issue a warrant to Zall E-Commerce pursuant to which Zall Development may subscribe for up to 7,455,000 ordinary shares of the Company, equivalent to 3,727,500 ADSs, accounting for an additional 5% equity interest in LightInTheBox on a fully diluted basis, at an exercise price of $2.75 per ordinary share, equivalent to $5.50 per ADS, pursuant to the terms and conditions of such warrant. The warrant is exercisable starting six months after the closing and terminates 24 months after the closing. Under the terms of the agreement, Zall E-Commerce will have the right to appoint two directors to LightInTheBox's board of directors, among other things, and the Company will grant Zall Development certain registration and anti-dilution rights.
Mr. Zhi Yan, Co-chairman and CEO of Zall Development, commented, "I am excited to team up with LightInTheBox to jointly explore future cooperation opportunities and develop a global market for wholesale consumer-focused products made in China. Combining LightInTheBox's deep understanding of global ecommerce, extensive technological expertise and mobile internet capabilities with our vast portfolio of wholesale products and supply chain management systems will create new business opportunities for both parties. As Chinese manufacturing continues to move up the value chain, we believe that internet-driven innovation and cross-border ecommerce will provide traditional businesses like us with increased efficiency and new markets for growth. LightInTheBox is the ideal company for us to partner with as we jointly work to bring high-quality Chinese products to new markets across the globe."
Mr. Alan Guo, Chairman and CEO of LightInTheBox, commented, "I'd like to warmly welcome Zall Development as a strategic business partner and major shareholder. Zall Development has extensive experience and a deep understanding of supply chain management, high-quality product development and the Chinese consumer market, which I am confident will yield numerous business opportunities when combined with our technological expertise, big data analytics and global Internet DNA.
