CHICAGO, July  18, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FreightCar America, Inc. (NASDAQ:RAIL) announced today that its Board of Directors has appointed James R. Meyer as President and Chief Executive Officer, effective July 31, 2017. Mr. Meyer will succeed Joseph E. McNeely, who will leave the Company by mutual consent to pursue new opportunities.
Mr. Meyer, 56, has nearly 30 years of experience in the heavy equipment, automotive and consumer goods industries. He joins the Company from Commercial Specialty Truck Holdings, LLC, a commercial truck manufacturer, where he has served as Chairman of the Board and has been an investor and advisor since 2015. From 2012 to 2015, he served as Chief Operating Officer of Allied Specialty Vehicles, Inc., a manufacturer of specialty vehicles for the fire and emergency, commercial and recreation segments. Prior to that, Mr. Meyer held various leadership positions at Brunswick Corporation, a publicly held manufacturer of recreational products.  At different times from 2006 to 2012, he oversaw its Hatteras Yachts and Sealine International business units and its product development and supply chain functions.  Mr. Meyer also spent 16 years at Ford Motor Company where he held various executive positions.
"We are extremely pleased to name Jim Meyer as President and CEO and have him join the Board," said William D. Gehl, Chairman of the Board. "Jim has demonstrated outstanding leadership skills and we expect the Company to benefit from his extensive industry experience and solid financial expertise. Based on his proven leadership and experience, Jim is the ideal person to guide the Company in the future and I look forward to working with him as we continue to execute on our long-term growth strategy." Gehl continued, "On behalf of the Board, I would also like to thank Joe McNeely for his invaluable contributions to FreightCar America. We are grateful for all of his hard work and dedication and wish him all the best in his future endeavors."
FreightCar America, Inc. manufactures a wide range of railroad freight cars, supplies railcar parts and leases freight cars through its JAIX Leasing Company subsidiary. FreightCar America designs and builds high-quality railcars, including coal cars, bulk commodity cars, covered hopper cars, intermodal and non-intermodal flat cars, mill gondola cars, coil steel cars and boxcars.

The path to precision railroading isn't going to be smooth. CSX Corp. Chief Executive Hunter Harrison is warning shippers there will be "bumps in the road" as he tightens train schedules and puts into place new plans aimed at making the railroad leaner, faster and more profitable. The caution in a conference call on CSX's strong second-quarter earnings comes as the company is already seeing freight shipments slow down, the WSJ's Paul Ziobro reports, with some shippers reporting longer transit times and surveyed assessments of CSX service declining. The barbs that Mr. Harrison has favored cost-cutting over service have followed the veteran rail executive at other stops, and he dismisses that as an unjust perception. The effort is already improving CSX's financial results, and Mr. Harrison insists that after "a little pain and suffering" the railroad's network will work better for shippers as well. 
Trade talks starting next month between the U.S., Mexico and Canada could carry big stakes for the direction of supply chains. The word that the countries would formally open a potential overhaul of the North American Free Trade Agreement came after the Trump administration outlined key goals that include improving access for U.S. goods exported to Canada and Mexico, the WSJ's William Mauldin reports. That White House also wants much stronger labor standards in a new Nafta, an outcome that could raise labor costs in Mexico and change the economic measures manufacturers have used in shifting factory work from the U.S. to Mexico. That also could bring transportation issues to the table. Federal regulators have allowed a handful of Mexican truckers to continue to operate in the U.S. since a controversial test program called for under Nafta ended in 2014, and some trucking companies and the Teamsters union may raise new objections to the provision. 
India's new goods and services tax is upending traditional business processes, and that's just fine with the country's truckers. The freight and logistics sector has provided an important success for the government's major economic initiative, the WSJ's Corinne Abrams, Debiprasad Nayak and Anant Vijay Kala report, as checkpoints for collecting state taxes have come down and long delays and heavy costs that include bribery have retreated. India's state-tax system has been part of the country's notoriously inefficient transportation operations, and a successful overhaul could trigger bigger improvements in infrastructure and changes to lure new foreign investment. The GST's impact on supply chains hasn't been all sunny: the enormous textile industry has had disruptions as traders adjust, and some businesses are hunkering down as they get paperwork in order. But the fragmented and inefficient logistics industry is already counting financial gains, and a projected 20% savings in logistics costs could spur more shipping once the new tax system becomes clearer. 
TRANSPORTATION 
The legal dispute between Apple Inc. and chip supplier Qualcomm Inc. is turning into a battle across the electronics production supply chain. Several major smartphone makers, including contract manufacturers for Apple, are joining the company's claim that Qualcomm has charges excessive licensing fees and violates antitrust laws, the WSJ's Tripp Mickle reports, expanding a case that now covers some of the technology world's biggest factory operators. Taiwan-based contract manufacturers Foxconn Technology Group, Compal Electronics Inc. Pegatron Corp. and Wistron Corp. jumped into the fight with a lawsuit against Qualcomm filed in federal court in San Diego this week. That suit comes as Qualcomm filed a new complaint against Apple in Germany looking to stop the shipping of the company's new iPhone into the country -- mirroring the chip maker's moves earlier this month to block imports of some Apple devices into the U.S. Getting the contract manufacturers into the fray raises the stakes for both Qualcomm and Apple.

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors;
Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On July 18, 2017, FreightCar America, Inc. (the "Company") announced that, on
July 17, 2017, it appointed James R. Meyer as its President and Chief Executive
Officer effective July 31, 2017 (the "Effective Date"). Mr. Meyer will succeed
Joseph E. McNeely, who will leave the Company by mutual consent to pursue new
opportunities effective July 31, 2017 (the "Departure Date"). Mr. McNeely also
stepped down from the Board of Directors (the "Board") of the Company effective
July 31, 2017. Also on July 17, 2017, the Board elected Mr. Meyer to the Board,
effective the Effective Date, to fill the vacancy created by the departure of
Mr. McNeely and to serve until the Company's 2018 annual meeting of
stockholders.
Mr. Meyer, 56, has nearly 30 years of experience in the heavy equipment,
automotive and consumer goods industries. He joins the Company from Commercial
Specialty Truck Holdings, LLC, a commercial truck manufacturer, where he has
served as Chairman of the Board and has been an investor and advisor since 2015.
From 2012 to 2015, he served as Chief Operating Officer of Allied Specialty
Vehicles, Inc., a manufacturer of specialty vehicles for the fire and emergency,
commercial and recreation segments. Prior to that, Mr. Meyer held various
leadership positions at Brunswick Corporation. At different times from 2006 to
2012, he oversaw its Hatteras Yachts and Sealine International business units
and its product development and supply chain functions. Mr. Meyer also spent 16
years at Ford Motor Company where he held various executive positions.
In connection with Mr. Meyer's appointment, the Company and Mr. Meyer entered
into a letter agreement regarding Terms of Employment (the "Employment
Agreement") dated July 17, 2017 and effective the Effective Date. A description
of the material terms of the Employment Agreement is set forth below, which
description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Employment
Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1.
(1)        Term: Mr. Meyer's employment with the Company is not for a specified
term and there is no specified term for the Employment Agreement.
(2)        Base Salary: The Company will pay Mr. Meyer an initial base salary of
$500,000 per year, which is subject to annual review by the Company.
(3)       Bonus: Mr. Meyer will be entitled to participate in the Company's
annual cash incentive plan applicable to all similarly situated senior
executives (the "Bonus Plan") and to earn a bonus ("Bonus") for each fiscal year
of the Company ending during his employment. His target Bonus is 100% of his
base salary, upon achievement of a target level of performance set forth in the
Bonus Plan, and is payable within 2.5 months after the end of the relevant
fiscal year. Mr. Meyer's maximum bonus, to the extent earned under the Bonus
Plan, may be as much as 200% of his base salary. If there are Bonus payments
made under the Bonus Plan in respect of the 2017 calendar year or any other
partial year, then Mr. Meyer will be entitled to participate in a partial Bonus
payment prorated to align with his base salary earnings (as earned in each
measurement period) and actual performance during his employment.
(4)        Long-Term Incentive and Other Executive Compensation Plans: Mr. Meyer
will be entitled to participate in all of the Company's equity-based and
cash-based long-term incentive and other executive compensation plans. He will
receive a long-term incentive plan award on an annual basis with a fair value
equal to 100% of his base salary, payable 50% in performance shares (with fair
value based on the assumption that the target performance goals will be met) and
50% in restricted shares, and all awards granted will have performance goals and
vesting conditions similar to those of other executive officers of the Company.



2






(5)        Sign-On Award: On the Effective Date, Mr. Meyer will be granted
options in respect of 350,000 shares of the Company's common stock. The award
will feature a performance earning schedule based on a trailing 90-consecutive
calendar day average closing price of one share of the Company's common stock
(the "Stock Price"), which shall be earned in the proportions as set forth
below:
(a)         the first 34% of the options upon the first time the Stock Price is
equal to or greater than $5.00 per share above the Initial Stock Price (as
defined below);
(b)        another 33% of the options upon the first time the Stock Price is
equal to or greater than $10.00 per share above the Initial Stock Price; and
(c)         the final 33% of the options upon the first time the Stock Price is
equal to or greater than $15.00 per share above the Initial Stock Price.
The options will be treated as being fully earned upon a Change of Control (as
defined in the Company's Executive Severance Plan). Mr. Meyer will become fully
vested in the options on the date that he is treated as earning the options,
provided that he has remained in continuous employment with the Company. The
"Initial Stock Price" shall be the closing price of one share of the Company's
common stock on the Effective Date. The exercise price of the options shall be
the Fair Market Value (as defined in the FreightCar America, Inc. 2005 Long Term
Incentive Plan) of the shares of the Company's common stock for which the
options are exercised.
(6)        Other Amounts: Mr. Meyer will be entitled to participate in each of
the Company's employee retirement, savings, welfare and fringe benefit plans,
and perquisites, offered to similarly situated senior executives. He will be
entitled to paid annual vacation on a basis that is at least as favorable as
that provided to other similarly situated executives, but not less than four
weeks per year. On a special exception basis, as of the Effective Date, the
Company will provide Mr. Meyer with 14 paid vacation days during the remainder
of 2017. Mr. Meyer will be reimbursed for all business (including entertainment)
expenses incurred by him in connection with his duties.
(7)        Termination Payments: Mr. Meyer's employment may be terminated by the
Company or Mr. Meyer upon notice to the other party. Pursuant to the Employment
Agreement, upon a termination of Mr. Meyer's employment for any reason, he will
be entitled to (i) accrued base salary and accrued and unused vacation through
the date of termination, (ii) his prior and pro rated then current fiscal year
bonuses, to the extent earned and unpaid, and (iii) any accrued and vested
benefits and unreimbursed expenses incurred and unpaid on the date of
termination. In addition, Mr. Meyer will be a participant in and be entitled to
benefits under the Company's Executive Severance Plan, which, together with the
Employment Agreement, sets forth Mr. Meyer's benefits upon a termination of
employment or a change of control. Upon an involuntary termination without Cause
or resignation for Good Reason (each as defined in the Employment Agreement),
Mr. Meyer will be entitled to (1) continuation of base salary and certain health
benefits for a period of (a) 24 months in the event that he resigns for Good
Reason or a termination without Cause occurs within 24 months following a Change
of Control (as defined in the Executive Severance Plan) or (b) 12 months
following any other involuntary termination without Cause and (2)(a) in the
event that he resigns for Good Reason or a termination without Cause occurs
within 24 months following a Change of Control, an amount equal to two times the
average of the annual bonuses paid to him for the last two full years payable in
two equal installments on the first March 15 and the second March 15 following
the year of termination or (b) in the case of any other involuntary termination
without Cause, an amount equal to the average of the annual bonuses paid to him
for the last two full years payable on the first March 15 following the year of
termination.
(8)        Restrictive Covenants: Mr. Meyer has agreed to keep confidential
certain information and agreed to certain non-solicitation, non-competition and
non-disparagement restrictions that apply for one year following termination of
employment.



3






Mr. Meyer has signed a letter agreement to tender his resignation from the Board
in the event that: (i) a majority of the votes of the shares in an uncontested
election are designated to be "withheld" from, or are voted "against," his
election and the Board accepts his resignation following such election; or (ii)
he experiences a change in principal employment status, other than retirement,
and the Board accepts his resignation following such change in status.
In connection with Mr. McNeely's departure from the Company, the Company and Mr.
McNeely entered into a Separation Agreement and General Release dated July 17,
2017 (the "Separation Agreement") pursuant to which the Company has agreed to
provide to Mr. McNeely certain severance benefits in consideration for Mr.
McNeely's release of certain claims against the Company and his compliance with
the other terms of the Separation Agreement. Pursuant to the Separation
Agreement and subject to its terms and conditions, the Company will provide to
Mr. McNeely: (a) a lump sum payment equal to the sum of (i) Mr. McNeely's earned
but unpaid base salary through the Departure Date, (ii) any accrued but unpaid
vacation and (iii) any unreimbursed business expenses incurred by Mr. McNeely on
the Company's behalf prior to the Departure Date; (b) a lump sum payment equal
to the sum of 12 months' of Mr. McNeely's base salary in the total amount of
$400,000; (c) a lump sum payment equal to the average annual bonus paid to Mr.
McNeely for the last full two years prior to the Departure Date in the total
amount of $278,480; (d) a lump sum payment of $300,000; and (e) continuation of
certain health benefits for Mr. McNeely and his family members for a period of
12 months. The foregoing description of the Separation Agreement does not
purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the

Operations - Shoals/Cherokee, AL



Opened in 2008 and located in the Shoals region of Alabama, the state-of-the-art production facility was designed to build a wide variety of railcar types. FreightCar announced its sub-lease of 25% of the Navistar, Inc. facility in February 2013 and began producing railcars in the second half of that year. Further, in December 2014, FreightCar announced plans for a $10 million expansion to add an additional production line at the facility. The initial sub-lease and execution of the capacity expansion increased FreightCar’s investment to approximately $33 million, covering about one-third of the entire manufacturing facility.  Currently, FreightCar has the capacity to build up to 8,000 railcars per year at the Cherokee, AL facility.

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors;
Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On July 18, 2017, FreightCar America, Inc. (the "Company") announced that, on
July 17, 2017, it appointed James R. Meyer as its President and Chief Executive
Officer effective July 31, 2017 (the "Effective Date"). Mr. Meyer will succeed
Joseph E. McNeely, who will leave the Company by mutual consent to pursue new
opportunities effective July 31, 2017 (the "Departure Date"). Mr. McNeely also
stepped down from the Board of Directors (the "Board") of the Company effective
July 31, 2017. Also on July 17, 2017, the Board elected Mr. Meyer to the Board,
effective the Effective Date, to fill the vacancy created by the departure of
Mr. McNeely and to serve until the Company's 2018 annual meeting of
stockholders.
Mr. Meyer, 56, has nearly 30 years of experience in the heavy equipment,
automotive and consumer goods industries. He joins the Company from Commercial
Specialty Truck Holdings, LLC, a commercial truck manufacturer, where he has
served as Chairman of the Board and has been an investor and advisor since 2015.
From 2012 to 2015, he served as Chief Operating Officer of Allied Specialty
Vehicles, Inc., a manufacturer of specialty vehicles for the fire and emergency,
commercial and recreation segments. Prior to that, Mr. Meyer held various
leadership positions at Brunswick Corporation. At different times from 2006 to
2012, he oversaw its Hatteras Yachts and Sealine International business units
and its product development and supply chain functions. Mr. Meyer also spent 16
years at Ford Motor Company where he held various executive positions.
In connection with Mr. Meyer's appointment, the Company and Mr. Meyer entered
into a letter agreement regarding Terms of Employment (the "Employment
Agreement") dated July 17, 2017 and effective the Effective Date. A description
of the material terms of the Employment Agreement is set forth below, which
description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Employment
Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1.
(1)        Term: Mr. Meyer's employment with the Company is not for a specified
term and there is no specified term for the Employment Agreement.
(2)        Base Salary: The Company will pay Mr. Meyer an initial base salary of
$500,000 per year, which is subject to annual review by the Company.
(3)       Bonus: Mr. Meyer will be entitled to participate in the Company's
annual cash incentive plan applicable to all similarly situated senior
executives (the "Bonus Plan") and to earn a bonus ("Bonus") for each fiscal year
of the Company ending during his employment. His target Bonus is 100% of his
base salary, upon achievement of a target level of performance set forth in the
Bonus Plan, and is payable within 2.5 months after the end of the relevant
fiscal year. Mr. Meyer's maximum bonus, to the extent earned under the Bonus
Plan, may be as much as 200% of his base salary. If there are Bonus payments
made under the Bonus Plan in respect of the 2017 calendar year or any other
partial year, then Mr. Meyer will be entitled to participate in a partial Bonus
payment prorated to align with his base salary earnings (as earned in each
measurement period) and actual performance during his employment.
(4)        Long-Term Incentive and Other Executive Compensation Plans: Mr. Meyer
will be entitled to participate in all of the Company's equity-based and
cash-based long-term incentive and other executive compensation plans. He will
receive a long-term incentive plan award on an annual basis with a fair value
equal to 100% of his base salary, payable 50% in performance shares (with fair
value based on the assumption that the target performance goals will be met) and
50% in restricted shares, and all awards granted will have performance goals and
vesting conditions similar to those of other executive officers of the Company.



2






(5)        Sign-On Award: On the Effective Date, Mr. Meyer will be granted
options in respect of 350,000 shares of the Company's common stock. The award
will feature a performance earning schedule based on a trailing 90-consecutive
calendar day average closing price of one share of the Company's common stock
(the "Stock Price"), which shall be earned in the proportions as set forth
below:
(a)         the first 34% of the options upon the first time the Stock Price is
equal to or greater than $5.00 per share above the Initial Stock Price (as
defined below);
(b)        another 33% of the options upon the first time the Stock Price is
equal to or greater than $10.00 per share above the Initial Stock Price; and
(c)         the final 33% of the options upon the first time the Stock Price is
equal to or greater than $15.00 per share above the Initial Stock Price.
The options will be treated as being fully earned upon a Change of Control (as
defined in the Company's Executive Severance Plan). Mr. Meyer will become fully
vested in the options on the date that he is treated as earning the options,
provided that he has remained in continuous employment with the Company. The
"Initial Stock Price" shall be the closing price of one share of the Company's
common stock on the Effective Date. The exercise price of the options shall be
the Fair Market Value (as defined in the FreightCar America, Inc. 2005 Long Term
Incentive Plan) of the shares of the Company's common stock for which the
options are exercised.

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors;
Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On July 18, 2017, FreightCar America, Inc. (the "Company") announced that, on
July 17, 2017, it appointed James R. Meyer as its President and Chief Executive
Officer effective July 31, 2017 (the "Effective Date"). Mr. Meyer will succeed
Joseph E. McNeely, who will leave the Company by mutual consent to pursue new
opportunities effective July 31, 2017 (the "Departure Date"). Mr. McNeely also
stepped down from the Board of Directors (the "Board") of the Company effective
July 31, 2017. Also on July 17, 2017, the Board elected Mr. Meyer to the Board,
effective the Effective Date, to fill the vacancy created by the departure of
Mr. McNeely and to serve until the Company's 2018 annual meeting of
stockholders.
Mr. Meyer, 56, has nearly 30 years of experience in the heavy equipment,
automotive and consumer goods industries. He joins the Company from Commercial
Specialty Truck Holdings, LLC, a commercial truck manufacturer, where he has
served as Chairman of the Board and has been an investor and advisor since 2015.
From 2012 to 2015, he served as Chief Operating Officer of Allied Specialty
Vehicles, Inc., a manufacturer of specialty vehicles for the fire and emergency,
commercial and recreation segments. Prior to that, Mr. Meyer held various
leadership positions at Brunswick Corporation. At different times from 2006 to
2012, he oversaw its Hatteras Yachts and Sealine International business units
and its product development and supply chain functions. Mr. Meyer also spent 16
years at Ford Motor Company where he held various executive positions.
In connection with Mr. Meyer's appointment, the Company and Mr. Meyer entered
into a letter agreement regarding Terms of Employment (the "Employment
Agreement") dated July 17, 2017 and effective the Effective Date. A description
of the material terms of the Employment Agreement is set forth below, which
description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Employment
Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1.
(1)        Term: Mr. Meyer's employment with the Company is not for a specified
term and there is no specified term for the Employment Agreement.
(2)        Base Salary: The Company will pay Mr. Meyer an initial base salary of
$500,000 per year, which is subject to annual review by the Company.
(3)       Bonus: Mr. Meyer will be entitled to participate in the Company's
annual cash incentive plan applicable to all similarly situated senior
executives (the "Bonus Plan") and to earn a bonus ("Bonus") for each fiscal year
of the Company ending during his employment. His target Bonus is 100% of his
base salary, upon achievement of a target level of performance set forth in the
Bonus Plan, and is payable within 2.5 months after the end of the relevant
fiscal year. Mr. Meyer's maximum bonus, to the extent earned under the Bonus
Plan, may be as much as 200% of his base salary. If there are Bonus payments
made under the Bonus Plan in respect of the 2017 calendar year or any other
partial year, then Mr. Meyer will be entitled to participate in a partial Bonus
payment prorated to align with his base salary earnings (as earned in each
measurement period) and actual performance during his employment.
(4)        Long-Term Incentive and Other Executive Compensation Plans: Mr. Meyer
will be entitled to participate in all of the Company's equity-based and
cash-based long-term incentive and other executive compensation plans. He will
receive a long-term incentive plan award on an annual basis with a fair value
equal to 100% of his base salary, payable 50% in performance shares (with fair
value based on the assumption that the target performance goals will be met) and
50% in restricted shares, and all awards granted will have performance goals and
vesting conditions similar to those of other executive officers of the Company.



2






(5)        Sign-On Award: On the Effective Date, Mr. Meyer will be granted
options in respect of 350,000 shares of the Company's common stock. The award
will feature a performance earning schedule based on a trailing 90-consecutive
calendar day average closing price of one share of the Company's common stock
(the "Stock Price"), which shall be earned in the proportions as set forth
below:
(a)         the first 34% of the options upon the first time the Stock Price is
equal to or greater than $5.00 per share above the Initial Stock Price (as
defined below);
(b)        another 33% of the options upon the first time the Stock Price is
equal to or greater than $10.00 per share above the Initial Stock Price; and
(c)         the final 33% of the options upon the first time the Stock Price is
equal to or greater than $15.00 per share above the Initial Stock Price.
The options will be treated as being fully earned upon a Change of Control (as
defined in the Company's Executive Severance Plan). Mr. Meyer will become fully
vested in the options on the date that he is treated as earning the options,
provided that he has remained in continuous employment with the Company. The
"Initial Stock Price" shall be the closing price of one share of the Company's
common stock on the Effective Date. The exercise price of the options shall be
the Fair Market Value (as defined in the FreightCar America, Inc. 2005 Long Term
Incentive Plan) of the shares of the Company's common stock for which the
options are exercised.
(6)        Other Amounts: Mr. Meyer will be entitled to participate in each of
the Company's employee retirement, savings, welfare and fringe benefit plans,
and perquisites, offered to similarly situated senior executives. He will be
entitled to paid annual vacation on a basis that is at least as favorable as
that provided to other similarly situated executives, but not less than four
weeks per year. On a special exception basis, as of the Effective Date, the
Company will provide Mr. Meyer with 14 paid vacation days during the remainder
of 2017. Mr. Meyer will be reimbursed for all business (including entertainment)
expenses incurred by him in connection with his duties.
(7)        Termination Payments: Mr. Meyer's employment may be terminated by the
Company or Mr. Meyer upon notice to the other party. Pursuant to the Employment
Agreement, upon a termination of Mr. Meyer's employment for any reason, he will
be entitled to (i) accrued base salary and accrued and unused vacation through
the date of termination, (ii) his prior and pro rated then current fiscal year
bonuses, to the extent earned and unpaid, and (iii) any accrued and vested
benefits and unreimbursed expenses incurred and unpaid on the date of
termination. In addition, Mr. Meyer will be a participant in and be entitled to
benefits under the Company's Executive Severance Plan, which, together with the
Employment Agreement, sets forth Mr. Meyer's benefits upon a termination of
employment or a change of control. Upon an involuntary termination without Cause
or resignation for Good Reason (each as defined in the Employment Agreement),
Mr. Meyer will be entitled to (1) continuation of base salary and certain health
benefits for a period of (a) 24 months in the event that he resigns for Good
Reason or a termination without Cause occurs within 24 months following a Change
of Control (as defined in the Executive Severance Plan) or (b) 12 months
following any other involuntary termination without Cause and (2)(a) in the
event that he resigns for Good Reason or a termination without Cause occurs
within 24 months following a Change of Control, an amount equal to two times the
average of the annual bonuses paid to him for the last two full years payable in
two equal installments on the first March 15 and the second March 15 following
the year of termination or (b) in the case of any other involuntary termination
without Cause, an amount equal to the average of the annual bonuses paid to him
for the last two full years payable on the first March 15 following the year of
termination.
(8)        Restrictive Covenants: Mr. Meyer has agreed to keep confidential
certain information and agreed to certain non-solicitation, non-competition and
non-disparagement restrictions that apply for one year following termination of
employment.

he experiences a change in principal employment status, other than retirement,
and the Board accepts his resignation following such change in status.

FreightCar America Inc. plans to lay off 168 Roanoke employees, at least a third of its work force, this spring.The company revealed its plans in a recent letter to Virginia officials. Representatives of the Chicago-based manufacturer blamed a drop in orders for railcars, its main product.Pink slips will take effect between April 17 and May 17, the notice said.“While the company hopes and anticipates that this workforce reduction will be a temporary measure of limited duration, the company cannot predict a return-to-work date at the present time,” FreightCar told state work force officials.The plant on Campbell Avenue will release 87 welders, 72 fitters, six leaders and three painters, according to the announcement, which did not state total employment at the location. Virginia officials said the company employed between 250 and 499 people late last year. Assuming that hasn’t changed, a drop of 168 would displace a third of the work force at a minimum.Paul Winsauer, the company official who signed the job-cut announcement, did not respond to a voice message left at his office Thursday . His phone rang and cut off during two attempts to reach him later in the day.Company officials plan on Feb. 27 to publish fourth-quarter financial results and on Feb. 28 to discuss those results in a public phone conference.The railcar industry is struggling. FreightCar, one of the largest producers, shipped 57 percent fewer railcars during the third quarter of 2016 than during the third quarter of 2015, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. There were back orders, or cars awaiting construction, but virtually none of them were for coal cars, its top seller in earlier years. Coal carried by railroads, the company’s main customer group, has trended down for more than five years.
FreightCar has taken steps to diversify its product line, but it’s unclear whether the Roanoke plant will benefit. The company has concentrated investments at a new plant in Cherokee, Alabama.The Roanoke plant began production in 2005, a time of surging demand for coal, in facilities leased from Norfolk Southern. Since then, the company has adjusted its work force with product demand. In 2011, FreightCar announced new orders from Norfolk Southern and a work force expansion in Roanoke.Now, it says it must cut staff.In October, a former employee sprayed gunfire in the company facility. Police said the attacker killed one person and injured two others before killing himself. A fourth person was grazed by a bullet, police said.FreightCar stock closed Thursday at $14.43 a share, down 19 cents.

Manufacturing













FreightCar America designs and manufactures aluminum, steel and stainless steel bodied railcars along with hybrid steel, stainless steel and aluminum bodied railcars that transport a wide variety of bulk commodities, containerized freight and other products.
We manufacture a wide variety of railcar types for transportation of bulk commodities and containerized freight, including open top hoppers, covered hoppers, and gondolas along with intermodal and non-intermodal flat cars. In many instances, these railcars include application of our patented one-piece center sill, the main longitudinal structural component of the railcar. The one-piece center sill weighs significantly less than traditional multiple-piece center sills, providing for higher carrying capacity and enhanced railcar productivity. We also refurbish and rebuild railcars and sell forged, cast and fabricated parts for the railcars we produce, as well as those manufactured by others. Click here for more information on our Parts page.
Below is a list of the major types of railcar products that we offer. Any of our railcar products may be further developed to meet the specific characteristics of the bulk or containerized freight being transported and customer desired requirements and specifications.

Quality Program – FreightCar America

Quality Program













As we improve upon our long history of quality freight car production, we must provide quality services throughout FreightCar America. We focus on meeting and exceeding customer expectations through continuous improvement and we have incorporated a company-wide statement of that effort:


 





Pledge of Excellence“Committed to Being the Best”


We, the members of FreightCar America, Inc., are committed to being the best freight car producer and parts supplier in the world.
We will only manufacture products and provide services that exceed the requirements of both our external and internal customers.
We are committed to working with our suppliers as quality partners.
We will work together with respect for one another to provide a clean and safe working environment, fair compensation, necessary training, and equal opportunity for advancement.


 





Supplier Certification Process 








FreightCar America selects suppliers from our list of Approved Suppliers and has established a system for determining qualifications of a potential supplier. First, the selected supplier must meet the approval of our customer. Suppliers are selected based on their ability to meet specifications, quality requirements, and delivery schedules.
A vendor survey or source inspection maybe taken when a supplier has not established a quality history with FreightCar America or if the supplier’s qualifications and capabilities are unknown. We will query a supplier on its written manuals and procedures, processes, the manner of maintaining the required quality of its end product, and if required, its current certifications. We also assure that the supplier maintains adequate inspection, measuring, gauging, and testing equipment that is controlled and calibrated, and that functional testing is performed to current specifications. Our Source Inspector provides us with concise and complete information for evaluation and analysis.








 





Training and Certification Process 














FreightCar America makes an extreme effort to ensure our work force is the most knowledgeable in the business.
Employee training is a must at FreightCar America and is delivered in new and innovative ways such as interactive multimedia sessions in conjunction with hands-on laboratory training. Training is a way of life at FreightCar America and on-site high-tech training facilities are available for use at anytime.
Employee certifications are aggressively pursued in all areas of the enterprise from the American Welding Society’s Certified Welding Inspector (CWI) examination for Operations employees to the MicroSoft Certified Systems Engineer (MCSE) in the Information Technology Department. Certifications are just another way to show we take pride in what we do.


 
















A Dedication to Our Customers
Since 1901, FreightCar America has been Surpassing Customer Expectations, Providing Best-in-Class Freight Cars, Car Parts, and Customer Service.

                            Company Release - 7/18/2017 9:00 AM ET



CHICAGO, July  18, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FreightCar America, Inc. (NASDAQ:RAIL) announced today that its Board of Directors has appointed James R. Meyer as President and Chief Executive Officer, effective July 31, 2017. Mr. Meyer will succeed Joseph E. McNeely, who will leave the Company by mutual consent to pursue new opportunities.
Mr. Meyer, 56, has nearly 30 years of experience in the heavy equipment, automotive and consumer goods industries. He joins the Company from Commercial Specialty Truck Holdings, LLC, a commercial truck manufacturer, where he has served as Chairman of the Board and has been an investor and advisor since 2015. From 2012 to 2015, he served as Chief Operating Officer of Allied Specialty Vehicles, Inc., a manufacturer of specialty vehicles for the fire and emergency, commercial and recreation segments. Prior to that, Mr. Meyer held various leadership positions at Brunswick Corporation, a publicly held manufacturer of recreational products.  At different times from 2006 to 2012, he oversaw its Hatteras Yachts and Sealine International business units and its product development and supply chain functions.  Mr. Meyer also spent 16 years at Ford Motor Company where he held various executive positions. “We are extremely pleased to name Jim Meyer as President and CEO and have him join the Board,” said William D. Gehl, Chairman of the Board. “Jim has demonstrated outstanding leadership skills and we expect the Company to benefit from his extensive industry experience and solid financial expertise. Based on his proven leadership and experience, Jim is the ideal person to guide the Company in the future and I look forward to working with him as we continue to execute on our long-term growth strategy.” Gehl continued, “On behalf of the Board, I would also like to thank Joe McNeely for his invaluable contributions to FreightCar America. We are grateful for all of his hard work and dedication and wish him all the best in his future endeavors.” FreightCar America, Inc. manufactures a wide range of railroad freight cars, supplies railcar parts and leases freight cars through its JAIX Leasing Company subsidiary.

History[edit]
The company began operations in 1901, and is headquartered in Chicago, Illinois.[2] It is engaged in the business of building, repairing, and leasing freight cars, largely for the transportation of bulk materials like coal, metals, wood products and automobiles.[2] In addition to the freight cars it constructs, the company also manufactures parts for use in cars built by other companies.[2]
It owns three factories—one in Danville, Illinois, one in the Muscle Shoals, Alabama and one in Roanoke, Virginia.[3] The facility in Roanoke was closed in 2009 due to weak economic conditions,[3] but it was announced on 21 February 2011 that it would reopen after an order for 1,500 coal cars from the Norfolk Southern Railway.[4]
In 2008, the company produced 10,349 freight cars, but its output decreased to 3,377 cars in 2009.[4] During fiscal year 2010, FreightCar America had a profit of $36.52 million on revenue of $141.3 million.[1]
In June 2014 the Danville plant brought back over 100 employees with promises of work and being able to retire from the plant. They are set to be laid off indefinitely the end of February 2016.
In mid-February 2017 the company announced layoffs at its Roanoke plant.[5] This was followed by an announcement at the end of March 2017 that FreightCar America would idle the plant in June.[6]
2016 shooting[edit]
On October 25, 2016, a shooting occurred at a FreightCar America building in Roanoke, Virginia. Getachew Fekede, a 53-year-old former employee and Kenyan refugee who moved to the U.S. in 2011, fired ten rounds from a 9mm handgun, killing an employee and wounding three others. He then committed suicide. Police said the shooting appeared to be an act of workplace violence, but added that the possibility of terrorism will be investigated.[7][8]
