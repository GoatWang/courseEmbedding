SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Gap 
      Inc. (NYSE: GPS) today announced that Sonia Syngal has been selected 
      as Old Navy’s global president, effective immediately, to lead the 
      brand’s continued reinvention of the value space with quality, 
      accessible fashion for everyone. She will continue to report to Gap Inc. 
      Chief Executive Officer Art Peck.
    


      During her 12 year Gap Inc. tenure, Syngal has been a key driver in 
      evolving the company’s product-to-market model, and held leadership 
      roles where she honed her expertise in managing retail operations, 
      driving growth, and bringing brand experiences to life for customers. 
      The appointment marks Syngal’s return to Old Navy where she served as 
      senior vice president of the brand’s International division in 2013, 
      until being tapped to lead Gap Inc.’s enterprise-wide global supply 
      chain.
    

      “Sonia is an inspiring leader with a proven track record leading 
      transformation and driving product-to-market innovations,” said Art 
      Peck, chief executive officer, Gap Inc. “Following a comprehensive 
      search, I’m confident Sonia is the right leader to enable Old Navy to 
      realize its substantial, long-term growth potential.”
    

      Most recently, Syngal served as executive vice president of Global 
      Supply Chain and Product Operations for Gap Inc., responsible for 
      managing all aspects of global sourcing, logistics and product 
      operations across all of Gap Inc.’s brands and channels. In this role, 
      Syngal worked closely with Old Navy leadership to develop the company’s 
      newly evolved product-to-market model designed to increase speed and 
      flexibility, while delivering brand-right product in a systematic, 
      repeatable way across the enterprise.
    

      “Old Navy is truly changing the value space with great design and 
      quality apparel that the whole family loves, and I can't wait to focus 
      my energy on continuing to deliver that promise for our customers,” said 
      Syngal. “How we continue to transform our product engine, focused on 
      balancing amazing product with operational excellence, will be key to 
      unlocking Old Navy’s next phase of growth.”
    

      Before her time at Old Navy, Syngal led Gap and Banana Republic’s 
      European business for nearly two years, and spent almost three years 
      driving the international divisions for Gap Outlet and Banana Republic 
      Factory Stores. She also held various vice president-level roles across 
      the company’s global sourcing organization for four years. Prior to 
      joining Gap Inc., Syngal had a successful career in Fortune 500 
      companies having spent 10 years at Sun Microsystems and six years at 
      Ford Motor Company.
    

      Jill Stanton, who served as interim leader for Old Navy, will serve as a 
      strategic advisor to support a seamless transition as Syngal takes the 
      helm. Additionally, the company announced that two seasoned executives 
      will oversee Gap Inc.’s global supply chain and logistics functions. 
      Effective immediately, Michael Yee, will serve as executive vice 
      president, Global Supply Chain, Sourcing and Production and Shawn 
      Curran, as executive vice president, Global Supply Chain Logistics and 
      Product Operations. Both Yee and Curran will report to Peck and join the 
      senior leadership team.
    

      “We want to thank Jill for her leadership through this transition and 
      for all she’s done in building a strong product team,” said Peck. “I 
      look forward to working with Michael and Shawn in their new 
      roles and continuing to leverage their expertise across the enterprise.”

Art Peck
 President and CEO, Gap Inc.

Download Photo
Art Peck is Gap Inc.'s President and Chief Executive Officer. He joined Gap Inc. in 2005 and has held senior leadership positions across nearly every area of the company.
On October 8, 2014, Art was named Gap Inc. CEO, effective February 1, 2015.
From 2012 to January 2015, Art served as President of the company’s Growth, Innovation and Digital (GID) division, with responsibility for the digital strategy of our more than $2 billion e-commerce business across the 80 countries where the company serves customers online. He drove the innovation agenda for the company across its digital platforms and more than 3,000 stores around the world. Ultimately, Art and his team developed and deployed the industry-leading, omni-channel platform for consumers to bridge the physical and digital shopping experience.
In this broad operating role, Art guided the growth of the emerging brands Athleta, Piperlime and Intermix, which is particularly fitting given he led the internal efforts to acquire Athleta, in 2008, and Intermix, in 2012. Art also added responsibility for the Gap Inc. technology division, working closely with the company’s chief information officer to optimize innovative and business solutions.
In his prior role, Art served as president of Gap North America, with its fleet of more than 700 stores, from February 2011 to November 2012. A product resurgence during this period drew customers back to the company’s namesake brand and helped improve the division’s sales performance for six consecutive quarters during his tenure and thereafter.
Previously, from 2008 to 2011, Art led the Outlet division, delivering strong sales and earnings growth for the value expressions of Gap and Banana Republic. Among the strategic shifts during this time, the division expanded globally, including first-ever Outlet store openings in Canada and Europe.
Art joined the company as executive vice president of Strategy & Operations, and he made an immediate impact by launching the company’s first franchise business, which now has grown to about 400 Gap, Banana Republic and Old Navy franchise stores in 40 countries.
A champion of the company values to “do more than sell clothes,” Art has been a trustee on the board of Gap Foundation since 2008, and a long-time advocate for corporate social responsibility and the company’s philanthropic work. He played an integral role in Gap’s partnership with Product (RED) in 2006, in which a portion of product sales went to HIV/AIDS prevention efforts in Africa, and was a key supporter of the company’s decision in February 2014 to raise its minimum wage for U.S. employees.
Prior to joining Gap Inc., Art spent 20 years with The Boston Consulting Group, an international strategy and management consulting firm, where he ultimately served as a senior partner.
In 2013, Fast Company named Art one of its 100 Most Creative People in Business, which features global leaders in technology, design, media, music, movies, marketing, television, sports, and more.
He is a graduate of Occidental College in Los Angeles, and holds an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School.

SAN FRANCISCO, April 14 (UPI) -- Sonia Syngal has been named the new global president of Old Navy, Gap Inc. announced Thursday.
Syngal, who most recently was executive vice president of Global Supply Chain and Product Operations for Gap, will continue to report to Gap Inc. CEO Art Peck.
"Syngal will lead the brand's continued reinvention of the value space with quality, accessible fashion for everyone," the company said in a statement.
Stefan Larsson left last fall to become the CEO of Ralph Lauren. On Sept. 30, the share price of Gap took a dive following the announcement of the departure of Larrson, who turned Old Navy into Gap Inc.'s No. 1 brand. The Old Navy brand is contributing 42.2 percent of total revenue, compared with the Gap brand, which is just 36.4 percent of total sales, according to Seeking Alpha.
Syngal, who has worked for Gap Inc. for 12 years, returns to Old Navy where she was senior vice president of the brand's international division before being tapped to lead Gap's enterprise-wide global supply chain in 2013.
"Sonia is an inspiring leader with a proven track record leading transformation and driving product-to-market innovations," Peck said. "Following a comprehensive search, I'm confident Sonia is the right leader to enable Old Navy to realize its substantial, long-term growth potential."
Before joining Gap, Syngal spent 10 years at Microsystems and six years at Ford Motor Company.
"Old Navy is truly changing the value space with great design and quality apparel that the whole family loves, and I can't wait to focus my energy on continuing to deliver that promise to our customers," Syngal said. "How we continue to transform our product engine, focused on balancing amazing product with operational excellence will be key to unlocking Old Navy's next phase of growth."
Gap's fiscal year 2015 net sales were $15.8 billion. Other Gap brands are Banana Republic, Athleta and Intermix.
Sonia holds a master's degree in manufacturing systems engineering from Stanford University (1995) and a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from Kettering University (1993).
Jill Stanton, who served as interim leader at Old Navy, will become a strategic adviser to support a seamless transition as Syngal takes the helm.
