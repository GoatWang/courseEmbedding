Vertical market

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

A vertical market is a market in which vendors offer goods and services specific to an industry, trade, profession, or other group of customers with specialized needs. An example could be software that manages services in hotels—amenities solutions. It is distinguished from a horizontal market, in which vendors offer a broad range of goods and services to a large group of customers with a wide range of needs, such as businesses as a whole, men, women, households, or, in the broadest horizontal market, everyone.
The activities of participants within any given vertical market are typically similar in that they aim at solving the same or similar problems. These markets are typically competitive, because of the overlapping focuses of the products and services that are provided to the customers.
The single defining characteristic of the participants in a vertical market is competition within a well-defined segment.
Horizontal market participants often attempt to meet enough of the different needs of vertical markets to gain a presence in the vertical market. Their similar products/services tend to be less of a fit but also less expensive than specialized, vertical participant solutions.
Vertical market software is software aimed at addressing the needs of any given business within a discernible vertical market.

Comparison with horizontal markets[edit]
A vertical market meets the needs of a particular industry: for example, a piece of equipment used only by semiconductor manufacturers.[1] A vertical market can be subdivided into narrower niche markets. For example, the government vertical has niches, like candidates seeking office, and the pet market has niches, like dog training for hearing-impaired owners.[2][3]
A horizontal market meets a given need of a wide variety of industries, rather than a specific one: for example, word processing software[4] or machine-to-machine technologies. On occasion a horizontal market can be highly specialized at the same time. Consider the market for converting mainframe databases developed with the tools of a particular company. The market for such a database conversion service might involve many vertical markets (aerospace, manufacturing, banking, etc.) but nevertheless be labelled "niche" if the database technology is technically obsolete and no longer mainstream.
Professional Definitions of Vertical Markets[edit]
Governments and professional organizations have developed various standards for defining vertical markets. The United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics[5] maintains a taxonomy called the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) that has a tiered structure with numeric codes. Each additional digit in the numeric code represents a further subdivision of the industry.
The International Standard Industrial Classification has been maintained by the United Nations since the 1950s and was last updated in 2008[6]

Vertical market

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

A vertical market is a market in which vendors offer goods and services specific to an industry, trade, profession, or other group of customers with specialized needs. An example could be software that manages services in hotels—amenities solutions. It is distinguished from a horizontal market, in which vendors offer a broad range of goods and services to a large group of customers with a wide range of needs, such as businesses as a whole, men, women, households, or, in the broadest horizontal market, everyone.
The activities of participants within any given vertical market are typically similar in that they aim at solving the same or similar problems. These markets are typically competitive, because of the overlapping focuses of the products and services that are provided to the customers.
The single defining characteristic of the participants in a vertical market is competition within a well-defined segment.
Horizontal market participants often attempt to meet enough of the different needs of vertical markets to gain a presence in the vertical market. Their similar products/services tend to be less of a fit but also less expensive than specialized, vertical participant solutions.
Vertical market software is software aimed at addressing the needs of any given business within a discernible vertical market.

Comparison with horizontal markets[edit]
A vertical market meets the needs of a particular industry: for example, a piece of equipment used only by semiconductor manufacturers.[1] A vertical market can be subdivided into narrower niche markets. For example, the government vertical has niches, like candidates seeking office, and the pet market has niches, like dog training for hearing-impaired owners.[2][3]
A horizontal market meets a given need of a wide variety of industries, rather than a specific one: for example, word processing software[4] or machine-to-machine technologies. On occasion a horizontal market can be highly specialized at the same time. Consider the market for converting mainframe databases developed with the tools of a particular company. The market for such a database conversion service might involve many vertical markets (aerospace, manufacturing, banking, etc.) but nevertheless be labelled "niche" if the database technology is technically obsolete and no longer mainstream.
Professional Definitions of Vertical Markets[edit]
Governments and professional organizations have developed various standards for defining vertical markets. The United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics[5] maintains a taxonomy called the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) that has a tiered structure with numeric codes. Each additional digit in the numeric code represents a further subdivision of the industry.
The International Standard Industrial Classification has been maintained by the United Nations since the 1950s and was last updated in 2008[6]
Examples[edit]
Some common examples of vertical markets:

Automotive
Banking
Consumer
Education
Engineering
Energy

Oil and Gas


Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG)
Financial (Finance)
Food and beverage
Government - federal, state, local
Healthcare
Insurance
Legal
Manufacturing
Media
Online
Real estate
Religion
Retail
Jewelry
Technology
Telecommunications
Transportation (Travel)
Electronics

The activities of participants within any given vertical market are typically similar in that they aim at solving the same or similar problems. These markets are typically competitive, because of the overlapping focuses of the products and services that are provided to the customers.
The single defining characteristic of the participants in a vertical market is competition within a well-defined segment.
Horizontal market participants often attempt to meet enough of the different needs of vertical markets to gain a presence in the vertical market. Their similar products/services tend to be less of a fit but also less expensive than specialized, vertical participant solutions.
Vertical market software is software aimed at addressing the needs of any given business within a discernible vertical market.

Comparison with horizontal markets[edit]
A vertical market meets the needs of a particular industry: for example, a piece of equipment used only by semiconductor manufacturers.[1] A vertical market can be subdivided into narrower niche markets. For example, the government vertical has niches, like candidates seeking office, and the pet market has niches, like dog training for hearing-impaired owners.[2][3]
A horizontal market meets a given need of a wide variety of industries, rather than a specific one: for example, word processing software[4] or machine-to-machine technologies. On occasion a horizontal market can be highly specialized at the same time. Consider the market for converting mainframe databases developed with the tools of a particular company. The market for such a database conversion service might involve many vertical markets (aerospace, manufacturing, banking, etc.) but nevertheless be labelled "niche" if the database technology is technically obsolete and no longer mainstream.
Professional Definitions of Vertical Markets[edit]
Governments and professional organizations have developed various standards for defining vertical markets. The United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics[5] maintains a taxonomy called the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) that has a tiered structure with numeric codes. Each additional digit in the numeric code represents a further subdivision of the industry.
The International Standard Industrial Classification has been maintained by the United Nations since the 1950s and was last updated in 2008[6]
Examples[edit]
Some common examples of vertical markets:

Automotive
Banking
Consumer
Education
Engineering
Energy

Oil and Gas


Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG)
Financial (Finance)
Food and beverage
Government - federal, state, local
Healthcare

The Floating Record is a high-performance turntable that plays your records vertically through built-in, dynamic, full-range stereo speakers (or via RCA line out). We reimagined turntable technology that uses audiophile-grade materials and components. The result is a visually and mechanically sound way to experience vinyl music.


Floating Record Vertical Turntable Prototype




















Floating Record Maple Prototype


At Gramovox our design philosophy is to reimagine vintage audio design with modern technology. In this spirit, we sought to reimagine the record player. We yearned for a visceral vinyl experience that showcased the record as both art and a medium to produce analog sound. The result is a high-performance turntable that plays your records vertically—producing the illusion that it’s floating.


Floating Record Walnut Prototype




We designed the Floating Record for everyone from the first-time record listener 
to the seasoned vinyl enthusiast. You’ll be spinning tunes out of the box in a matter
 of minutes. You don't need to set up your cartridge or purchase additional outboard
 gear such as phono pre-amps, amplifiers and speakers (although you have the option to).
 All of these are included in our integrated design.








Floating Record Walnut Prototype


Don’t hide your vinyl. Show it off. The Floating Record allows you to showcase your vinyl while maintaining high-quality playback. 








Floating Record Maple Prototype


Traditional record players take up a lot of space and require additional 
components such as pre-amps, amps, integrated receivers, speakers and 
all the necessary cables. However, the Floating Record’s integrated design allows it to beautifully fit into most environments with ease.


Floating Record Walnut Prototype





Floating Record Maple Prototype









We’ve engineered the Floating Record to flawlessly play your vinyl vertically and output full-range stereo sound. We deconstructed the elements of a premium turntable setup and reconstructed them in a manner that maintains their high-performance standards. 


Floating Record MDF w/ Walnut Veneer (Production Version)





Floating Record MDF w/ Walnut Veneer (Production Version)





Floating Record MDF w/ Walnut Veneer (Production Version)















Listen in 33 ⅓ or 45 RPM


You can easily switch between 33 ⅓ or 45 RPM by moving the silicon belt over the inner or outer groove of the middle gear. We include record clamps for both types of records.







Floating Record MDF w/ Walnut Veneer (Production Version)


You can bypass the integrated speakers and use the Floating Record as a standalone Hi-Fi turntable for your own audio setup. 


RCA Line Out to External Speakers


You have the option of bypassing the internal amp and speakers and outputting an RIAA equalized line level signal from the built in phono-preamp via the "Line Out" RCA jacks. The switch is used to choose between Onboard and Line Out. The Onboard position activates the built-in phono stage--the 15 watt digital power amp and built-in speakers. The “Line Out” bypasses the internal amplifier and speakers, and takes the signal from our built-in phono-preamp to the “Line Out” RCA jacks. This allows the player to be used as a standalone Hi-Fi turntable. RCA out is a line level signal that is used to connect to an existing stereo system via the “Tape in” or “Aux In” inputs on your receiver, pre-amp or amp.


Floating Record Maple Prototype










Floating Record MDF w/ Walnut Veneer (Production Version)


The Floating Record comes with a dynamic, full-range audio system. We use two Tymphany 2” neodymium speakers driven by a
 15w per channel digital amplifier. The speaker cavities incorporate 
tuned bottom porting to offer superior bass response. We achieved the best possible sound without compromising aesthetics or performance.










We created a fully-adjustable, carbon-fiber tone-arm. This audiophile staple is perfectly balanced radially around its main pivot bearing axis. This allows it to be played in a vertical position and not flop to one side or the other.The tracking force is (dynamically) applied by a spring as opposed to the usual counterweights found in horizontal record players in which the arm is (statically) balanced. Spring loaded tracking force is beneficial in regards to consistency of the force applied—especially on warped records. Our tone-arms are factory-set at the optimal tracking force of ~2 grams.










Since our tonearm is perfectly balanced radially around its main pivot bearing axis, it does not skew or favor one groove side over the other. Typically, the modulations in the groove can cause friction and this contributes to centripetal force acting on the arm and causing it to skate towards the center of the record. Our rigorous testing ensured no performance issues. 









The Audio Technica AT95E is a warm sounding cartridge with a smooth high end, sweet mids and rich low end. The dual magnet cartridge comes with an elliptical diamond stylus. An elliptical stylus has many advantages over spherical styli. The elliptical stylus has two radii, the front radius being wider than the side radius. This allows the stylus to ride in the center of the groove, like the conical stylus, while the smaller side radius can more accurately track higher frequencies.Compared to the conical stylus, however, the elliptical stylus has a longer vertical contact area and a narrower front to back contact area within the record groove. The elliptical tip follows the groove modulations with more precision, providing improved frequency response, improved phase response, and lower distortion, specifically in the inner grooves of the record. 







We've developed a robust cueing mechanism that allows you to effortlessly cue your records. This helps reduce the risk of scratching your records or damaging your stylus. Now you can cue up your favorite track with ease. How Does It Work?1. Set your tone-arm2. Push cue lever3. Watch your stylus gracefully fall onto the record







Belt-Driven Turntable on Walnut Prototype


The Floating Record uses a belt drive system with a silicone belt to help isolate motor vibrations from the platter. We choose a high quality A/C synchronous motor and custom-designed a high precision motor control circuit to ensure silent operation and consistent speed. This is mounted with rubber isolation bushings to help decouple it from the base. Our main platter spindle is made from stainless steel and runs in bronze bushing with a teflon bottom. The plinth is CNC-machined out of high mass acrylic to help reduce resonance. The platter is also CNC-machined acrylic to add mass and help reduce resonance. All this works together to help our turntable achieve smooth, consistent playback.








The Floating Record’s base will be composed of a miter-folded MDF box finished with a genuine Maple or Walnut veneer. This method maintains our desired aesthetic, prevents warping and minimizes the waste factor. The finished product will look beautiful, sound great and maintain a high level of performance. Our construction method adheres to industry-tested best practices. Overall, our bases produce a rich aesthetic that beautifully complements your home or office.










We’re using world-class wood, metal and electronics suppliers to produce parts that meet our high-tolerances. The most crucial part—the final assembly—is handled by highly-trained electro-mechanical assembly engineers in Chicago. Each unit is thoroughly tested before being packaged and shipped out.

Vertical Market

What is a 'Vertical Market'
A vertical market is a group of companies that serve each other's specialized needs and that do not serve a broader market. A vertical market is tightly focused on meeting the needs of one specific industry. Vertical markets are focused on a single niche, such as creating payroll software for start-up Internet companies, whereas a horizontal market is able to sell its goods and services in more than one industry and is therefore focused on a wider range of business segments.

BREAKING DOWN 'Vertical Market'
      Vertical market providers are focused on specialized goods and services that meet the needs of a niche customer group. That niche customer group can be either a specific industry or a specific demographic. With this customer group the vertical market provider has the advantage of marketing its products to a specialized group, which can make marketing campaigns more direct and effective.Vertical Market MarketingWhile vertical markets are concentrated on a specific industry or demographic, these concentrated markets can have a wide customer base. While concentrated, a wide vertical market customer base is advantageous for vertical marketing because the greater the demand for a specific product, the greater the revenue opportunity. In vertical market marketing, marketers can prepare targeted marketing programs directed for their niche market. This can make marketing efforts more effective than a broader horizontal marketing program.In a vertical market, customers have a high level of spending power. This requires an important focus on the customer relationship by the vertical market provider. While there may be a wide customer base for a specified vertical market, each customer relationship is important because of the market’s narrow focus. Customers within a vertical market typically rely on a single service provider to meet their needs. These customers have a deep and long-term need, which makes the customer service relationship especially critical.ExampleOne example of a vertical market provider includes a company that manufactures automobile parts. This type of company would belong to a vertical market since it would have a limited market of auto manufacturers and mechanics for its products. A furniture manufacturer, on the other hand, would belong to a horizontal market because its customer base could include homeowners, apartment dwellers, offices, hotels, restaurants and more.Horizontal Market ComparisonCompanies who provide horizontal market services must take a different marketing approach. In a horizontal market, a company must be able to market to a wider clientele. This requires a broader marketing campaign that could include a much wider range of marketing tactics and channels. In a horizontal market, customer interaction can also vary considerably. As companies market to a broader horizontal market they often have a wider range of customers for which they may interact with less frequently. Horizontal market interaction may require providers to focus on different aspects of product marketing and customer service including a greater focus on product distribution.

The Floating Record is a high-performance turntable that plays your records vertically through built-in, dynamic, full-range stereo speakers (or via RCA line out). We reimagined turntable technology that uses audiophile-grade materials and components. The result is a visually and mechanically sound way to experience vinyl music.


Floating Record Vertical Turntable Prototype




















Floating Record Maple Prototype


At Gramovox our design philosophy is to reimagine vintage audio design with modern technology. In this spirit, we sought to reimagine the record player. We yearned for a visceral vinyl experience that showcased the record as both art and a medium to produce analog sound. The result is a high-performance turntable that plays your records vertically—producing the illusion that it’s floating.


Floating Record Walnut Prototype




We designed the Floating Record for everyone from the first-time record listener 
to the seasoned vinyl enthusiast. You’ll be spinning tunes out of the box in a matter
 of minutes. You don't need to set up your cartridge or purchase additional outboard
 gear such as phono pre-amps, amplifiers and speakers (although you have the option to).
 All of these are included in our integrated design.








Floating Record Walnut Prototype


Don’t hide your vinyl. Show it off. The Floating Record allows you to showcase your vinyl while maintaining high-quality playback. 








Floating Record Maple Prototype


Traditional record players take up a lot of space and require additional 
components such as pre-amps, amps, integrated receivers, speakers and 
all the necessary cables. However, the Floating Record’s integrated design allows it to beautifully fit into most environments with ease.


Floating Record Walnut Prototype





Floating Record Maple Prototype









We’ve engineered the Floating Record to flawlessly play your vinyl vertically and output full-range stereo sound. We deconstructed the elements of a premium turntable setup and reconstructed them in a manner that maintains their high-performance standards.

Floating Record MDF w/ Walnut Veneer (Production Version)















Listen in 33 ⅓ or 45 RPM


You can easily switch between 33 ⅓ or 45 RPM by moving the silicon belt over the inner or outer groove of the middle gear. We include record clamps for both types of records.







Floating Record MDF w/ Walnut Veneer (Production Version)


You can bypass the integrated speakers and use the Floating Record as a standalone Hi-Fi turntable for your own audio setup. 


RCA Line Out to External Speakers


You have the option of bypassing the internal amp and speakers and outputting an RIAA equalized line level signal from the built in phono-preamp via the "Line Out" RCA jacks. The switch is used to choose between Onboard and Line Out. The Onboard position activates the built-in phono stage--the 15 watt digital power amp and built-in speakers. The “Line Out” bypasses the internal amplifier and speakers, and takes the signal from our built-in phono-preamp to the “Line Out” RCA jacks. This allows the player to be used as a standalone Hi-Fi turntable. RCA out is a line level signal that is used to connect to an existing stereo system via the “Tape in” or “Aux In” inputs on your receiver, pre-amp or amp.


Floating Record Maple Prototype










Floating Record MDF w/ Walnut Veneer (Production Version)


The Floating Record comes with a dynamic, full-range audio system. We use two Tymphany 2” neodymium speakers driven by a
 15w per channel digital amplifier. The speaker cavities incorporate 
tuned bottom porting to offer superior bass response. We achieved the best possible sound without compromising aesthetics or performance.










We created a fully-adjustable, carbon-fiber tone-arm. This audiophile staple is perfectly balanced radially around its main pivot bearing axis. This allows it to be played in a vertical position and not flop to one side or the other.The tracking force is (dynamically) applied by a spring as opposed to the usual counterweights found in horizontal record players in which the arm is (statically) balanced. Spring loaded tracking force is beneficial in regards to consistency of the force applied—especially on warped records. Our tone-arms are factory-set at the optimal tracking force of ~2 grams.










Since our tonearm is perfectly balanced radially around its main pivot bearing axis, it does not skew or favor one groove side over the other. Typically, the modulations in the groove can cause friction and this contributes to centripetal force acting on the arm and causing it to skate towards the center of the record. Our rigorous testing ensured no performance issues. 









The Audio Technica AT95E is a warm sounding cartridge with a smooth high end, sweet mids and rich low end. The dual magnet cartridge comes with an elliptical diamond stylus. An elliptical stylus has many advantages over spherical styli. The elliptical stylus has two radii, the front radius being wider than the side radius. This allows the stylus to ride in the center of the groove, like the conical stylus, while the smaller side radius can more accurately track higher frequencies.Compared to the conical stylus, however, the elliptical stylus has a longer vertical contact area and a narrower front to back contact area within the record groove. The elliptical tip follows the groove modulations with more precision, providing improved frequency response, improved phase response, and lower distortion, specifically in the inner grooves of the record. 







We've developed a robust cueing mechanism that allows you to effortlessly cue your records. This helps reduce the risk of scratching your records or damaging your stylus. Now you can cue up your favorite track with ease. How Does It Work?1. Set your tone-arm2. Push cue lever3. Watch your stylus gracefully fall onto the record







Belt-Driven Turntable on Walnut Prototype


The Floating Record uses a belt drive system with a silicone belt to help isolate motor vibrations from the platter. We choose a high quality A/C synchronous motor and custom-designed a high precision motor control circuit to ensure silent operation and consistent speed. This is mounted with rubber isolation bushings to help decouple it from the base. Our main platter spindle is made from stainless steel and runs in bronze bushing with a teflon bottom. The plinth is CNC-machined out of high mass acrylic to help reduce resonance. The platter is also CNC-machined acrylic to add mass and help reduce resonance. All this works together to help our turntable achieve smooth, consistent playback.








The Floating Record’s base will be composed of a miter-folded MDF box finished with a genuine Maple or Walnut veneer. This method maintains our desired aesthetic, prevents warping and minimizes the waste factor. The finished product will look beautiful, sound great and maintain a high level of performance. Our construction method adheres to industry-tested best practices. Overall, our bases produce a rich aesthetic that beautifully complements your home or office.










We’re using world-class wood, metal and electronics suppliers to produce parts that meet our high-tolerances. The most crucial part—the final assembly—is handled by highly-trained electro-mechanical assembly engineers in Chicago. Each unit is thoroughly tested before being packaged and shipped out.
