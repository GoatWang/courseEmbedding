            After being named senior vice president of  human resources in September 2009, it didn't take Patricia Stumpp long to start having a big impact on  Invacare Corp. A few months after getting the promotion, Ms. Stumpp took on a leadership role in an effort to transform the Elyria-based wheelchair maker from a loosely connected group of companies into a unified corporation. Ms. Stumpp and Invacare president and CEO Gerald Blouch, who at the time was the company's president and chief operating officer, led the effort to redesign the company's management structure. Some of the challenges she faced were related to staffing: For instance, she recruited an executive to lead global product development and another to head up operations and supply chain management — functions previously handled on a regional basis.  Ms. Stumpp also led the organization design, process mapping and communications for the initiative, ensuring that it “transformed from words on paper into a live strategic action plan,” according to a statement Mr. Blouch made in the nomination.  “Without a doubt, my most valuable business partner throughout this transformation has been Patti,” he stated.
