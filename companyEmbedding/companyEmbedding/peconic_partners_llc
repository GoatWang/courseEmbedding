Firm



	    Peconic Partners is a registered investment advisor managing proprietary and client capital through long/short equity hedge fund strategies.
	

Our investment objective remains constant: producing long-term positive results, regardless of market conditions. We navigate with an awareness of short-term economic trends while maintaining a long-term perspective, allowing us to maximize earnings and minimize risk. We believe that our long-term track record, history of capital generation, and past ability to generate alpha are all testaments to the vision, insight, and patience deriving from our experience.
The Peconic Partners investment strategy has 20+ years history, beginning with our predecessor firm, which was managed by Peconic founder William Harnisch from the late 1970s until 1997, when the long-only business was sold to a privately-held financial services firm seeking to expand its asset management business. Mr. Harnisch and his partners continued to retain exclusive ownership of the hedge business, and in December 2004, he and the current Peconic team separated to form Peconic Partners, as a dedicated continuation of the successful and disciplined hedge fund strategy that has been practiced since the late 1970s. 









Leadership
Peconic’s leadership provides the experience and infrastructure to support a team of industry specialists, who work synergistically across sectors for idea generation and are versed in fundamental, quantitative, and technical analyses.

Philosophy



	    Our investment philosophy is the set of core values that provide the foundation for our approach:
	

Discipline and flexibility. Analysis and humanism. 
Our portfolio managers are passionate about both analytics and social-behavioral trends that create paradigm shifts and new opportunities. We travel extensively, researching, collecting, and observing, in pursuit of new insights and new opportunities to leverage our in-depth fundamental, quantitative, and technical analytics. 
Innovation. Evolution.
Our disciplined thematic approach to investing is rooted in the understanding that the world is constantly evolving and that the most compelling opportunities and themes arise as a result of change and innovation, not stasis. 
Vision. Insight. Experience.
The benefit to our hands-on approach and passion for research is that every piece of information we interact with becomes an opportunity. We see the world and consume information differently. This insight drives the evolution of our investment themes, which in turn continue to shape the way that we see and gain knowledge from the world around us. 
Consistency, not blind adherence.
The development of long-term macro investment themes that transcend investment cycles requires a disciplined methodology, which necessarily means that our investment themes shift and evolve to keep pace with, and even anticipate, technological advancements and globalization. 









Firm
Our long-term track record originates from a consistent and disciplined investment approach focusing on a top-down view of the markets balanced by a bottom-up approach to risk management and strong fundamental stock selection.
