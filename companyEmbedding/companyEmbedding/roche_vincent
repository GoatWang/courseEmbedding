Vincent Roche is President and Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board of Directors of Analog Devices. Mr. Roche is only the third CEO to lead the company since its founding in 1965. He began his career at ADI in 1988 and has been part of the senior management team since 2001.
Mr. Roche has held senior positions for ADI in Ireland, Massachusetts, and California, progressively gaining responsibility in product line management, strategic marketing, and business unit management roles. Mr. Roche’s first role at ADI was as a senior marketing engineer in Limerick, Ireland, where he created and managed several emerging analog businesses, generating significant revenue and positioning ADI in many new product categories. Mr. Roche was promoted to Marketing Director for ADI’s analog semiconductor division in 1994. In 1996, as Product Line Director, Mr. Roche led the company’s development of application-specific analog products for disk drive electronics. In 1998, he was named head of ADI’s San Jose, California, operations, which included engineering and marketing for precision amplifiers, interface, optical, and power management technology. During this period of rapid expansion for high technology, Mr. Roche successfully deepened engagement with customers and partners throughout Silicon Valley and in 2001 was given responsibility for global sales and marketing as Vice President of Worldwide Sales. In this role he was responsible for direct customer sales, distribution, and e-commerce for all product lines, as well as corporate marketing and the company’s industry-leading web site, www.analog.com.
In 2009, Mr. Roche was named Vice President for the newly created Worldwide Sales and Strategic Market Segments Group, where he focused on integrating ADI technology into optimized solutions for industrial, automotive, and infrastructure customers, gaining share with the world’s leading electronics brands, and ensuring a clear path for all customers to engage with ADI’s world-class engineering and manufacturing operations. In this position he was also responsible for the worldwide sales organization, which represents ADI’s portfolio of ten thousand products across all markets around the world.
Mr. Roche was promoted to President of ADI in 2012, taking responsibility for all R&D, sales, marketing and business development. In May 2013, he was appointed President and Chief Executive Officer.
Mr. Roche also serves on the Board of Directors of Acacia Communications, Inc., a leading developer of high-speed coherent optical interconnect products that transform communications networks through improvements in performance and capacity and a reduction in associated costs.
Mr. Roche earned a Bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering from University of Limerick in Ireland.
