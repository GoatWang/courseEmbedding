Company Description (as filed with the SEC)
CBL & Associates Properties, Inc. ("CBL") was organized on July 13, 1993, as a
Delaware corporation, to acquire substantially all of the real estate properties
owned by CBL & Associates, Inc., which was formed by Charles B. Lebovitz in
1978, and by certain of its related parties.  On November 3, 1993, CBL completed
an initial public offering (the "Offering"). Simultaneously with the completion
of the Offering, CBL & Associates, Inc., its shareholders and affiliates and
certain senior officers of the Company (collectively, "CBL's Predecessor")
transferred substantially all of their interests in its real estate properties
to CBL & Associates Limited Partnership (the "Operating Partnership") in
exchange for common units of limited partner interest in the Operating
Partnership. The interests in the Operating Partnership contain certain
conversion rights that are more fully described in   Note 7   to the
consolidated financial statements.  ... More ...
