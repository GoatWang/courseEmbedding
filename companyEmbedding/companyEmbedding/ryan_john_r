Biography[edit]
A native of Mountainhome, Pennsylvania, Ryan graduated from the United States Naval Academy in June 1967 with his twin brother, Vice Admiral Norbert Ryan Jr., USN. After designation as a naval aviator, his initial assignment was to Patrol Squadron EIGHT.[1] From 1972 to 1975, he was assigned to the Candidate Guidance Office at the Naval Academy. He then served two years aboard the USS Nimitz as Assistant Navigator followed by a department head tour in Patrol Squadron TWENTY-SIX.
Ryan received a Master of Science Degree in Administration from George Washington University, Washington D.C. in 1975. He has also completed the program for Senior Executives in National and International Security at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University.
Prior to the selection for flag rank, Ryan commanded Patrol Squadron ELEVEN, Patrol Squadron THIRTY-ONE, and Patrol Wing TEN. Other Shore assignments included the Strategic Concepts Group in the Office of Chief of Naval Operations, Military Assistant to the Executive Secretary in the immediate office of the Secretary of Defense, Executive Assistant to the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (Air Warfare), and Executive Assistant to the Commander in Chief, United States Pacific Command.
Flag assignments[edit]
In March 1991, he was promoted to rear admiral and served as the Director, Logistics and Security Assistance (J4) for the Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Command. In August 1993, Ryan assumed his duties as Commander, Patrol Wings, U.S. Pacific Fleet/Commander, Anti-Submarine Warfare Forces, U.S. Pacific Fleet.
Ryan served as the United States Naval Academy's Superintendent for four years before retiring. He assumed his duties as the 32nd President of the State University of New York Maritime College on June 14, 2002.
Concurrent with his duties at the Maritime College, Ryan briefly filled in as Interim President of the University at Albany.[2]
Ryan was named Acting Chancellor of the State University of New York System in April 2005.[3] and assumed the full role in December of that year.[4]
On March 7, 2007, Ryan announced that he would step down as Chancellor on May 31, 2007 to become the president and CEO of the Center for Creative Leadership headquartered in Greensboro, N.C.[5]
Ryan is married to the Diane L. Ryan (née Ackerman) of Bangor, Pennsylvania. They have three adult daughters: Tricia, Kelly, and Julie.

Biography[edit]
A native of Mountainhome, Pennsylvania, Ryan graduated from the United States Naval Academy in June 1967 with his twin brother, Vice Admiral Norbert Ryan Jr., USN. After designation as a naval aviator, his initial assignment was to Patrol Squadron EIGHT.[1] From 1972 to 1975, he was assigned to the Candidate Guidance Office at the Naval Academy. He then served two years aboard the USS Nimitz as Assistant Navigator followed by a department head tour in Patrol Squadron TWENTY-SIX.
Ryan received a Master of Science Degree in Administration from George Washington University, Washington D.C. in 1975. He has also completed the program for Senior Executives in National and International Security at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University.
Prior to the selection for flag rank, Ryan commanded Patrol Squadron ELEVEN, Patrol Squadron THIRTY-ONE, and Patrol Wing TEN. Other Shore assignments included the Strategic Concepts Group in the Office of Chief of Naval Operations, Military Assistant to the Executive Secretary in the immediate office of the Secretary of Defense, Executive Assistant to the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (Air Warfare), and Executive Assistant to the Commander in Chief, United States Pacific Command.

Concurrent with his duties at the Maritime College, Ryan briefly filled in as Interim President of the University at Albany.[2]
Ryan was named Acting Chancellor of the State University of New York System in April 2005.[3] and assumed the full role in December of that year.[4]
On March 7, 2007, Ryan announced that he would step down as Chancellor on May 31, 2007 to become the president and CEO of the Center for Creative Leadership headquartered in Greensboro, N.C.[5]
Ryan is married to the Diane L. Ryan (née Ackerman) of Bangor, Pennsylvania. They have three adult daughters: Tricia, Kelly, and Julie.

Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.
