 December 27, 2011Montville, CT utility hopes converting coal plant to biomass will bring jobs to town
By  Jeffrey A. Johnson - The DayOfficials from the parent company that owns Montville Power LLC believe that a plan to convert one of its generation units into a biomass system would bring jobs to the town at a time when AES Thames is closing.
About three years ago, New Jersey-based NRG Energy Inc. presented its plan to the town to convert the smaller of Montville Power LLC’s two generation units from a natural gas and oil-based unit to one that burns clean wood.
The approximately $100 million project has stalled as NRG has been unable to find a company to purchase the power. An NRG spokesman said there is no state regulatory process in place under which utility companies could purchase the power that would be produced by the biomass system.
