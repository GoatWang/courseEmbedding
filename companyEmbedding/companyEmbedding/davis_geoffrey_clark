Geoffrey Clark Davis (born October 26, 1958) is a former U.S. Representative for Kentucky's 4th congressional district, serving from 2005 to 2012. He is a member of the Republican Party. The district includes 24 counties in the northeastern part of the state, stretching from the fringes of the Louisville area to the West Virginia border. Most of its vote, however, is cast in the counties bordering Cincinnati. On December 15, 2011, Davis announced he would not seek reelection in 2012.[3] On July 31, 2012, he announced his resignation from Congress effective immediately.[4]

Early life, education, and business career[edit]
Davis was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada to American parents (one of few House members to be born in Quebec). After graduating from high school, he enlisted in the United States Army and later received an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point. At West Point, Davis studied national security and international affairs, as well as the Arabic language. In the U.S. Army he served as an aviation officer, eventually becoming an Assault Helicopter Flight Commander in the 82nd Airborne Division.[1] Davis also ran U.S. Army aviation operations for peace enforcement between Israel and Egypt. During his U.S. Army career, he attained both Senior Parachutist and Ranger qualification.[5][6]
Before running for the U.S. House of Representatives, he owned a consulting firm specializing in lean manufacturing and systems integration.[5]
U.S. House of Representatives[edit]
Elections[edit]
2002[edit]
In the 2002 elections, Davis challenged Ken Lucas, the Democratic incumbent but was narrowly defeated 51%–48%.[7]
2004[edit]
Lucas declined to run for re-election, honoring a promise to serve only three terms. In the 2004 race for the open seat, Davis defeated his Democratic opponent Nick Clooney, father of actor George Clooney, 54%–44%.[8]
2006[edit]
See also: United States House of Representatives elections in Kentucky, 2006 § District 4; United States House of Representatives elections in Kentucky, 2008 § District 4; and United States House of Representatives elections in Kentucky, 2010 § District 4
On January 30, 2006, Lucas announced he would challenge Davis later that year. The announcement instantly turned the race into one of the hottest in the campaign cycle, even though the 4th is considered the most Republican district in Kentucky. Despite a substantial Democratic advantage in voter registration, the influence of the heavily Republican northern Kentucky suburbs kept the district in Republican hands from 1967 until Lucas won the seat in 1998. In August Congressional Quarterly rated this race as "Lean Republican." In late July the Washington Post also rated the race as a toss-up.[9] A SurveyUSA poll released on July 25, 2006 showed Lucas leading 50% to 41%.[10] However, the most recent independent SurveyUSA poll shows Davis up by two percentage points (46% Davis – 44% Lucas).[11] Davis has a decisive lead in fundraising.[12] The Cook Political Report, an independent non-partisan newsletter, rated the race for Kentucky's 4th Congressional District as a "Republican Toss-Up", meaning either party has a good chance of winning.[13]
Davis won re-election 52%–43%, a margin of 17,023 votes.[8]
2008[edit]
Davis won re-election with 63% of the vote, defeating Michael Kelley.[14][15]
2010[edit]




Davis campaigning with Sen. Rand Paul, Sen. Jim DeMint and Rep. Ron Paul in 2010


Davis was challenged by Democrat John Waltz, whom he defeated with 69% of the votes cast.[16][17]
Tenure[edit]
Davis has a solidly conservative voting record; according to his congressional website, he has positioned himself as pro-life and in favor of industrial deregulation.
In November 2005, Davis made headlines for his response to Pennsylvania representative John Murtha's call for withdrawal from Iraq, saying, "Ayman Zawahiri, Osama bin Laden's deputy, as well as Abu Musab Zarqawi, have made it quite clear in their internal propaganda that they cannot win unless they can drive the Americans out. And they know that they can't do that there, so they've brought the battlefield to the halls of Congress. And, frankly, the liberal leadership have put politics ahead of sound, fiscal and national security policy. And what they have done is cooperated with our enemies and are emboldening our enemies." Davis faced harsh criticism for his remarks, including, for example, from the Democratic Veterans of Northern Kentucky, and sparked a drive led by national Democratic Party leaders to get Ken Lucas to run against him in 2006.[18][19][20]
Davis is a staunch advocate of a federal prohibition of online poker. In 2006, he supported H.R. 4411, the Goodlatte-Leach Internet Gambling Prohibition Act.[21] In 2008, he opposed H.R. 5767, the Payment Systems Protection Act (a bill that sought to place a moratorium on enforcement of the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act while the U.S. Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve defined "unlawful Internet gambling").
In October 2009, Davis filed the REINS (Regulations from the Executive In Need of Scrutiny) Act which would give Congress an up or down vote on major rules. On December 7, 2011, the bill was passed in the House. The President has threatened to veto it if it comes to his desk.[22][23]
In 2011, Davis voted for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 as part of a controversial provision that allows the government and the military to indefinitely detain American citizens and others without trial.[24]

The Davis campaign has received contributions from the Americans for a Republican Majority Political Action Committee (ARMPAC), which was led by former Texas Congressman Tom DeLay. As of June 30, 2006, according to the Federal Election Commission, of the $2.4 million contributed to the Davis campaign for the current 2006 electoral cycle, $10,000 was contributed by ARMPAC.[25] Tom DeLay is the subject of indictments sought by Ronnie Earle, the district attorney for Travis County, Texas, alleging violations of Texas campaign-finance law. Judge Pat Priest has dismissed one indictment against DeLay, the second has not yet come to trial.[26] The charges against DeLay are considered by some to be politically motivated.[27][28] Democrats have indicated that they consider the ARMPAC contributions to be a campaign issue.[29] Davis was never accused of any misconduct.
Davis has received donations from Republican Duke Cunningham, who pleaded guilty to federal charges of conspiracy to commit bribery, mail fraud, wire fraud, and tax evasion. Davis has not chosen to give back the money from Cunningham, while many other recipients have.[30][31] Davis received a donation from Congressman Bob Ney, who pleaded guilty for bribery and his involvement with convicted felon Jack Abramoff.[32]
Controversies[edit]
On April 12, 2008, at a Northern Kentucky Lincoln Day dinner, Davis compared the campaign slogans of Barack Obama to the sales pitch of a "snake oil salesman". He said in his remarks at the GOP dinner that he participated in a "highly classified, national security simulation" with Obama.
"I'm going to tell you something: That boy's finger does not need to be on the button," Davis added. "He could not make a decision in that simulation that related to a nuclear threat to this country." [33]
Davis also made reference to Obama as being put into the Senate by someone who will probably spend many years of his life in prison (presumably a reference to Tony Rezko) and that Obama had never had a real job before. [34]
Davis later apologized for his comment in a letter:

Dear Senator Obama:
On Saturday night I gave a speech in which I used a poor choice of words when discussing the national security policy positions of the Presidential candidates. I was quoted as saying "That boy's finger does not need to be on the button."
My poor choice of words is regrettable and was in no way meant to impugn you or your integrity. I offer my sincere apology to you and ask for your forgiveness.
Though we may disagree on many issues, I know that we share the goal of a prosperous, secure future for our nation. My comment has detracted from the dialogue that we should all be having on legitimate policy differences and in no way reflects the personal and professional respect I have for you.

Sincerely,
Geoff Davis[35]
Resignation[edit]
On July 31, 2012, Geoff Davis resigned from Congress due to family health issues, effective immediately. Governor Steve Beshear called for a special election to fill the seat to occur the same day as the general election in November, which would allow the winner to be sworn in immediately.

Early life, education, and business career[edit]
Davis was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada to American parents (one of few House members to be born in Quebec). After graduating from high school, he enlisted in the United States Army and later received an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point. At West Point, Davis studied national security and international affairs, as well as the Arabic language. In the U.S. Army he served as an aviation officer, eventually becoming an Assault Helicopter Flight Commander in the 82nd Airborne Division.[1] Davis also ran U.S. Army aviation operations for peace enforcement between Israel and Egypt. During his U.S. Army career, he attained both Senior Parachutist and Ranger qualification.[5][6]
Before running for the U.S. House of Representatives, he owned a consulting firm specializing in lean manufacturing and systems integration.[5]
U.S. House of Representatives[edit]
Elections[edit]
2002[edit]
In the 2002 elections, Davis challenged Ken Lucas, the Democratic incumbent but was narrowly defeated 51%–48%.[7]
2004[edit]
Lucas declined to run for re-election, honoring a promise to serve only three terms. In the 2004 race for the open seat, Davis defeated his Democratic opponent Nick Clooney, father of actor George Clooney, 54%–44%.[8]
2006[edit]
See also: United States House of Representatives elections in Kentucky, 2006 § District 4; United States House of Representatives elections in Kentucky, 2008 § District 4; and United States House of Representatives elections in Kentucky, 2010 § District 4
On January 30, 2006, Lucas announced he would challenge Davis later that year. The announcement instantly turned the race into one of the hottest in the campaign cycle, even though the 4th is considered the most Republican district in Kentucky. Despite a substantial Democratic advantage in voter registration, the influence of the heavily Republican northern Kentucky suburbs kept the district in Republican hands from 1967 until Lucas won the seat in 1998. In August Congressional Quarterly rated this race as "Lean Republican." In late July the Washington Post also rated the race as a toss-up.[9] A SurveyUSA poll released on July 25, 2006 showed Lucas leading 50% to 41%.[10] However, the most recent independent SurveyUSA poll shows Davis up by two percentage points (46% Davis – 44% Lucas).[11] Davis has a decisive lead in fundraising.[12] The Cook Political Report, an independent non-partisan newsletter, rated the race for Kentucky's 4th Congressional District as a "Republican Toss-Up", meaning either party has a good chance of winning.[13]
Davis won re-election 52%–43%, a margin of 17,023 votes.[8]
2008[edit]
Davis won re-election with 63% of the vote, defeating Michael Kelley.[14][15]
2010[edit]

Davis was challenged by Democrat John Waltz, whom he defeated with 69% of the votes cast.[16][17]
Tenure[edit]
Davis has a solidly conservative voting record; according to his congressional website, he has positioned himself as pro-life and in favor of industrial deregulation.
In November 2005, Davis made headlines for his response to Pennsylvania representative John Murtha's call for withdrawal from Iraq, saying, "Ayman Zawahiri, Osama bin Laden's deputy, as well as Abu Musab Zarqawi, have made it quite clear in their internal propaganda that they cannot win unless they can drive the Americans out. And they know that they can't do that there, so they've brought the battlefield to the halls of Congress. And, frankly, the liberal leadership have put politics ahead of sound, fiscal and national security policy. And what they have done is cooperated with our enemies and are emboldening our enemies." Davis faced harsh criticism for his remarks, including, for example, from the Democratic Veterans of Northern Kentucky, and sparked a drive led by national Democratic Party leaders to get Ken Lucas to run against him in 2006.[18][19][20]
Davis is a staunch advocate of a federal prohibition of online poker. In 2006, he supported H.R. 4411, the Goodlatte-Leach Internet Gambling Prohibition Act.[21] In 2008, he opposed H.R. 5767, the Payment Systems Protection Act (a bill that sought to place a moratorium on enforcement of the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act while the U.S. Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve defined "unlawful Internet gambling").
In October 2009, Davis filed the REINS (Regulations from the Executive In Need of Scrutiny) Act which would give Congress an up or down vote on major rules. On December 7, 2011, the bill was passed in the House. The President has threatened to veto it if it comes to his desk.[22][23]
In 2011, Davis voted for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 as part of a controversial provision that allows the government and the military to indefinitely detain American citizens and others without trial.[24]

The Davis campaign has received contributions from the Americans for a Republican Majority Political Action Committee (ARMPAC), which was led by former Texas Congressman Tom DeLay. As of June 30, 2006, according to the Federal Election Commission, of the $2.4 million contributed to the Davis campaign for the current 2006 electoral cycle, $10,000 was contributed by ARMPAC.[25] Tom DeLay is the subject of indictments sought by Ronnie Earle, the district attorney for Travis County, Texas, alleging violations of Texas campaign-finance law. Judge Pat Priest has dismissed one indictment against DeLay, the second has not yet come to trial.[26] The charges against DeLay are considered by some to be politically motivated.[27][28] Democrats have indicated that they consider the ARMPAC contributions to be a campaign issue.[29] Davis was never accused of any misconduct.
Davis has received donations from Republican Duke Cunningham, who pleaded guilty to federal charges of conspiracy to commit bribery, mail fraud, wire fraud, and tax evasion. Davis has not chosen to give back the money from Cunningham, while many other recipients have.[30][31] Davis received a donation from Congressman Bob Ney, who pleaded guilty for bribery and his involvement with convicted felon Jack Abramoff.[32]
Controversies[edit]
On April 12, 2008, at a Northern Kentucky Lincoln Day dinner, Davis compared the campaign slogans of Barack Obama to the sales pitch of a "snake oil salesman". He said in his remarks at the GOP dinner that he participated in a "highly classified, national security simulation" with Obama.
"I'm going to tell you something: That boy's finger does not need to be on the button," Davis added. "He could not make a decision in that simulation that related to a nuclear threat to this country." [33]
Davis also made reference to Obama as being put into the Senate by someone who will probably spend many years of his life in prison (presumably a reference to Tony Rezko) and that Obama had never had a real job before. [34]
Davis later apologized for his comment in a letter:

Dear Senator Obama:
On Saturday night I gave a speech in which I used a poor choice of words when discussing the national security policy positions of the Presidential candidates. I was quoted as saying "That boy's finger does not need to be on the button."
My poor choice of words is regrettable and was in no way meant to impugn you or your integrity. I offer my sincere apology to you and ask for your forgiveness.
Though we may disagree on many issues, I know that we share the goal of a prosperous, secure future for our nation. My comment has detracted from the dialogue that we should all be having on legitimate policy differences and in no way reflects the personal and professional respect I have for you.

Sincerely,
Geoff Davis[35]
Resignation[edit]
On July 31, 2012, Geoff Davis resigned from Congress due to family health issues, effective immediately. Governor Steve Beshear called for a special election to fill the seat to occur the same day as the general election in November, which would allow the winner to be sworn in immediately.

The district includes 24 counties in the northeastern part of the state, stretching from the fringes of the Louisville area to the West Virginia border. Most of its vote, however, is cast in the counties bordering Cincinnati. On December 15, 2011, Davis announced he would not seek reelection in 2012.[3] On July 31, 2012, he announced his resignation from Congress effective immediately.[4]

Early life, education, and business career[edit]
Davis was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada to American parents (one of few House members to be born in Quebec). After graduating from high school, he enlisted in the United States Army and later received an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point. At West Point, Davis studied national security and international affairs, as well as the Arabic language. In the U.S. Army he served as an aviation officer, eventually becoming an Assault Helicopter Flight Commander in the 82nd Airborne Division.[1] Davis also ran U.S. Army aviation operations for peace enforcement between Israel and Egypt. During his U.S. Army career, he attained both Senior Parachutist and Ranger qualification.[5][6]
Before running for the U.S. House of Representatives, he owned a consulting firm specializing in lean manufacturing and systems integration.[5]
U.S. House of Representatives[edit]
Elections[edit]
2002[edit]
In the 2002 elections, Davis challenged Ken Lucas, the Democratic incumbent but was narrowly defeated 51%–48%.[7]
2004[edit]
Lucas declined to run for re-election, honoring a promise to serve only three terms. In the 2004 race for the open seat, Davis defeated his Democratic opponent Nick Clooney, father of actor George Clooney, 54%–44%.[8]
2006[edit]
See also: United States House of Representatives elections in Kentucky, 2006 § District 4; United States House of Representatives elections in Kentucky, 2008 § District 4; and United States House of Representatives elections in Kentucky, 2010 § District 4
On January 30, 2006, Lucas announced he would challenge Davis later that year. The announcement instantly turned the race into one of the hottest in the campaign cycle, even though the 4th is considered the most Republican district in Kentucky. Despite a substantial Democratic advantage in voter registration, the influence of the heavily Republican northern Kentucky suburbs kept the district in Republican hands from 1967 until Lucas won the seat in 1998. In August Congressional Quarterly rated this race as "Lean Republican." In late July the Washington Post also rated the race as a toss-up.[9] A SurveyUSA poll released on July 25, 2006 showed Lucas leading 50% to 41%.[10] However, the most recent independent SurveyUSA poll shows Davis up by two percentage points (46% Davis – 44% Lucas).[11] Davis has a decisive lead in fundraising.[12] The Cook Political Report, an independent non-partisan newsletter, rated the race for Kentucky's 4th Congressional District as a "Republican Toss-Up", meaning either party has a good chance of winning.[13]
Davis won re-election 52%–43%, a margin of 17,023 votes.[8]
2008[edit]
Davis won re-election with 63% of the vote, defeating Michael Kelley.[14][15]
2010[edit]

Davis was challenged by Democrat John Waltz, whom he defeated with 69% of the votes cast.[16][17]

The Davis campaign has received contributions from the Americans for a Republican Majority Political Action Committee (ARMPAC), which was led by former Texas Congressman Tom DeLay. As of June 30, 2006, according to the Federal Election Commission, of the $2.4 million contributed to the Davis campaign for the current 2006 electoral cycle, $10,000 was contributed by ARMPAC.[25] Tom DeLay is the subject of indictments sought by Ronnie Earle, the district attorney for Travis County, Texas, alleging violations of Texas campaign-finance law. Judge Pat Priest has dismissed one indictment against DeLay, the second has not yet come to trial.[26] The charges against DeLay are considered by some to be politically motivated.[27][28] Democrats have indicated that they consider the ARMPAC contributions to be a campaign issue.[29] Davis was never accused of any misconduct.
Davis has received donations from Republican Duke Cunningham, who pleaded guilty to federal charges of conspiracy to commit bribery, mail fraud, wire fraud, and tax evasion. Davis has not chosen to give back the money from Cunningham, while many other recipients have.[30][31] Davis received a donation from Congressman Bob Ney, who pleaded guilty for bribery and his involvement with convicted felon Jack Abramoff.[32]
Controversies[edit]
On April 12, 2008, at a Northern Kentucky Lincoln Day dinner, Davis compared the campaign slogans of Barack Obama to the sales pitch of a "snake oil salesman". He said in his remarks at the GOP dinner that he participated in a "highly classified, national security simulation" with Obama.
"I'm going to tell you something: That boy's finger does not need to be on the button," Davis added. "He could not make a decision in that simulation that related to a nuclear threat to this country." [33]
Davis also made reference to Obama as being put into the Senate by someone who will probably spend many years of his life in prison (presumably a reference to Tony Rezko) and that Obama had never had a real job before. [34]
Davis later apologized for his comment in a letter:

Dear Senator Obama:
On Saturday night I gave a speech in which I used a poor choice of words when discussing the national security policy positions of the Presidential candidates. I was quoted as saying "That boy's finger does not need to be on the button."
My poor choice of words is regrettable and was in no way meant to impugn you or your integrity. I offer my sincere apology to you and ask for your forgiveness.
Though we may disagree on many issues, I know that we share the goal of a prosperous, secure future for our nation. My comment has detracted from the dialogue that we should all be having on legitimate policy differences and in no way reflects the personal and professional respect I have for you.

Sincerely,
Geoff Davis[35]
Resignation[edit]
On July 31, 2012, Geoff Davis resigned from Congress due to family health issues, effective immediately. Governor Steve Beshear called for a special election to fill the seat to occur the same day as the general election in November, which would allow the winner to be sworn in immediately.

Specialists
Geoffrey Clark, DVM, DACVS
Dr. Clark is a 1986 graduate of the University of California-Davis School of Veterinary Medicine.  He completed a 13-month internship at the Animal Medical Center in New York City and then successfully completed a 3-year residency in small animal surgery at Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine.  In 1992, Dr. Clark became board certified in surgery by the American College of Veterinary Surgeons certifying examination.  He served as staff surgeon for 5 years at the Animal Surgical Clinic of Seattle and also served as chairman of the continuing education committee for the Seattle-King County Veterinary Medical Association.  Upon returning to the Northeast in 1996, he joined the staff at Dover Veterinary Hospital in Dover, NH.
Dr. Clark was the founder and editor of Canine Sports Medicine Update and served as contributing veterinary editor for Field Trial Magazine.  He has published numerous scientific papers on a variety of surgical topics and authored chapters in four veterinary textbooks.  Dr. Clark has been an invited speaker at more than 70 veterinary meetings in the United States and Canada, including the New England Veterinary Medical Association meetings in 2007, 2008 and 2010.
Dr. Clark resides with his wife and two daughters in NH.  Their home is shared with two cats, named Simba and Apollo, an English Setter named Willow, a Yellow Lab named Mabel and Francis, the Wonder Pug. 
Dr. Clark's surgical expertise is now available at the Gardner Animal Care Center.  He is available by appointment for surgical consultations, orthopedic surgery and soft tissue surgery.



Dr. David Sobel, DVM, MRCVS
David Sobel, DVM, MRCVS began his veterinary training at the University of Glasgow in Scotland before returning to the US to receive his DVM from Tufts Veterinary School in 1992. He was on the staff of the Dover Veterinary Hospital during which time he received advanced training in human endoscopic surgery at the New England Medical Center in Boston. He later served on the staff of the Hanover Veterinary Clinic before starting his mobile outreach service, Metropolitan Veterinary Consultants, in 2000. This is his effort to make his services accessible to small animal patients and practices across Vermont, New Hampshire and Massachusetts. He also is a consultant, providing referral services at the Veterinary Referral Center of NH at CAVES in Concord, NH and the Small Animal Veterinary Emergency Services (SAVES) in Lebanon, NH.
Dr. Sobel also serves as a consultant at the Elands Veterinary Clinic, in England where he has worked with his colleague, Philip Lhermette, to introduce non and minimally invasive surgery to small animal practices across the United Kingdom. David was one of the first practitioners to begin incorporating the use of diode lasers into minimally invasive surgery for dogs and cats, taking what had previously been purely diagnostic procedures into the realm of interventional surgical endoscopy.
He has lectured on endoscopy, endoscopic surgery and laser endoscopic surgery worldwide, including the North American Veterinary Conference, the North Carolina VMA annual meeting, the Pennsylvania VMA annual meeting, American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine annual meeting, the Western College of Veterinary Medicine, Bristol University Veterinary School (UK), University of Sydney (Australia), Royal Veterinary College (UK), Hawaii VMA annual meeting, BSAVA Congress (UK), and many others.
Dr. Sobel has served as a reviewer of the journal Veterinary Surgery and has worked with many corporate and industrial colleagues on developing and marketing products for the veterinary endoscopy market.
He is the co-editor and author of the recently published BSAVA Manual of Small Animal Endoscopy and Endosurgery as well as having written extensively for other volumes on small animal endoscopic surgery. He is licensed to practice in New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts and the United Kingdom.
An accomplished triathlete with four Ironman completions to his credit, David lives in Hanover, New Hampshire with his wife and four children, a dog, cat, and turtle.
