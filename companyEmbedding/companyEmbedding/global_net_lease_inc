Global Net Lease: Same Song, Second Verse - Global Net Lease, Inc. (NYSE:GNL) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Global Net Lease: Same Song, Second VerseJul. 6.15 | About: Global Net (GNL) Brad Thomas Dividend growth investing, REITs, newsletter provider, valueMarketplaceREIT BeatSummaryWhile Global Net Lease, no longer has the scarlet letters – ARC – it does have a seemingly cozy association with its external manager.I believe a larger force behind GNL’s price decline has been the rush to the door sparked by other Realty Capital Securities products.Maybe this is no “sucker yield” (yet) but all the glitters isn’t gold!I can see why American Realty Capital Global Trust, previously a non-traded REIT, decided to change its name to Global Net Lease, Inc. (NYSE:GNL), a new publicly-traded Net Lease REIT that began its first day of trading on June 3, 2015.
With a name similar to American Realty Capital Properties (ARCP), it's easy to associate the first three words (American Realty Capital) for a distrusted brand in which investors fell victim to illusions disguised by seemingly healthy dividend coverage.
However, prompting that telegraphed fear related to ARCP's unsustainable dividend, I opted to hit the brakes, blasting ARCP management for a flaw that seemed to be almost prophetic words a week later. I screamed: sucker yield. As I explained on Investopedia, a "sucker yield" means that the dividend is "too good to be true" so "when a company is paying a dividend beyond its earnings power it is essentially eroding capital."
Accordingly, Global Net Lease opted to list shares without the American Realty Capital association, hoping to create distance from the damaged Net Lease brand and its creator, Nicholas Schorsch. Back in November 2014, Schorsch had his hands in a lot of pies:

So now Mr. Market has adopted new this "kid on the block," and while the so-named REIT, Global Net Lease, no longer has the scarlet letters - ARC - it does have a seemingly cozy association with its external manager. GNL has a fully integrated external management team and sub-advisor by the name of AR Capital. Guess who leads AR Capital?


Withstanding the fact that Global Net Lease has very close ties with AR Capital, the Global Net Lease management team has another cozy relationship with an existing non-traded REIT by the name of ARC Global Trust II. As of Q1-15, ARCG2 owned 4 properties, and when you click on the Realty Capital Securities website, you will see the first fund identified:

Now if you click on ARCG2, you can see that the non-traded REIT is attempting to raise $3.125 billion in $25 per-share increments.

Where am I going with this?
It's simple. GNL may have changed its name, but the newly-listed REIT is being externally managed by ARC Capital. In addition, there are ongoing conflicts of interest in that GNL is competing directly with its non-traded REIT, American Realty Capital Global II. Furthermore, and as I alluded in a previous article, American Finance Trust, Inc. (Pending:AFIN), also a non-traded REIT, has the wheels in motion to list shares of its vintage ARCT5 fund.
By disguising AFIN as a hybrid commercial mortgage REIT, AFIN touts it will own both net lease properties as well as high risk commercial paper. By combining the existing ARCT5 assets, AFIN hopes to aggregate debt obligations to balance the portfolio with a pro-forma debt/asset percentage of around 65 percent (1x to 2x debt/equity).

If you like, you can read my previous article on AFIN (here), and while I see considerable flaws in the proposed monetization, the purpose for my article today is to explore the risks and rewards related to Global Net Lease.

What is Global Net Lease?
As noted above, Global Net Lease listed shares around a month ago, and here's how the scorecard looks (since the listing):

As typical to many non-traded REIT listings, GNL launched a tender offer to acquire a maximum of $125 million of its shares of common stock at $10.50 per share. On June 30th, DST Systems Inc., the tender offers paying agent and depositary, reported that a total of 127,904,350 shares of GNL's common stock were validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, including 1,266,536 shares that were tendered through notice of guaranteed delivery.
GNL's portfolio consists of over 300 net lease properties and around 16.5 million square feet. GNL's total capitalization is $2.377 billion, and here's how that compares to the peer group:

It's interesting that GNL does not list ARCP in the latest investor presentation. I'm not sure why that's the case. Many of GNL's US properties were acquired in 2013 and 2014 - when ARCT and Cole Capital were also aggressively acquiring net lease properties. GNL has 79 tenants doing business in 35 industries:


GNL owns around 38 percent of its properties outside of the US, primarily the United Kingdom (21.6 percent), Germany (9.9 percent), Netherlands (3.4 percent), and Finland (3.1 percent).

As noted above, GNL relies on AR Capital (Schorsch & Co) to source and acquire US properties, and outside of the US (in Europe), GNL looks to Moor Park Capital Partners to vet out deals. In terms of a peer set closest to GNL, I use W.P. Carey (NYSE:WPC) and Gramercy Property (NYSE:GPT) - recently announced merger with Chambers Street (NYSE:CSG) - see my recent article here.

In GNL's investor presentation, the company states that it "is well-positioned to capitalize on incremental investment opportunities in the US and Western Europe." In Europe, GNL suggests there are over $4.5 trillion properties available with no publicly-traded REITs in Europe to compete.


GNL also says that it focuses on the strongest European markets identified by the Sovereign Debt Ratings below:

As a result of the large European exposure, many of GNL's top tenants are located abroad:

As I begin to dissect the GNL portfolio, I become increasingly alarmed. As noted above, GNL is competing with many well-known US REITs in the US, but is also competing directly with its affiliated non-traded REIT as well as American Finance Trust Inc. While GNL appears to be targeting most of its growth in Europe, the external managers are in control of sourcing new deals.
GNL's base management fee is .75 percent of AUM (assets under management) reduced by .03 percent for every $1 billion of AUM above $3 billion to a floor of .40 percent. GNL has capped AUM fees at 1.25 percent until reaching $5 billion (should internalize before that, I hope).
GNL says (in the investor presentation) that it has "access to broader real estate pipeline provided by acquisitions team structured to source deals" and that the "sponsors scale (250 employees) have deep due diligence experience…" What about conflicts of interest?
For example, GNL's #3 tenant is Family Dollar, representing around 4.8 percent of GNL's portfolio. As I reviewed many of the free-standing Family Dollar stores (owned by GNL), it became clear to me that GNL has no experience managing the smaller (around 6,000 sf) stores. While many of GNL's European properties are larger industrial and office properties, I question how GNL can effectively manage such a diverse business where its management team has limited experience.

As I studied GNL's 300+ unit portfolio, it became clear to me that the public listing was the only liquidity alternative. Given the diverse portfolio assembled as a non-traded REIT. I could see no other REIT (or private investor) willing to acquire the whole portfolio. It's simply a mish-mash of net leased buildings scattered everywhere. Here's a random property (Con-Way Freight) in Illinois:

How would you like to own this Con-Way Freight in Uhrichsville, OH (population 5,413)?

Or what about this Con-Way Freight in Waite Park, MN (population 7,469)?

Here's my point: GPT has a weighted average remaining lease term of 11.2 years. Sounds good?

What happens when the lease expires or when a tenant vacates early (due to BK)? Is there a dedicated management team that can manage the retention risk?


It's easy to be 100 percent occupied when you have no track record:

Having the best investment grade rated portfolio is not a sign that signals outperformance. Just take a look at Chambers Street below:

Also, GNL has over 57 percent invested in office properties. That means that there will be more cap-ex related costs in future years (when leases burn off). Again, just another risk to consider.

The argument that external management is better because G&A costs are lower than peers is foolish. Let's see. GNL is located at 405 Park Avenue - 14th Floor in NYC and AR Capital is also located at 405 Park Avenue in NYC. Translation: GNL investors are paying AR Capital fees to buy and sell real estate. If you add the fees to GNL's G&A costs, an intelligent investor can see that there is no bargain.

The Balance Sheet

Here's how GNL's debt compares with the Net Lease peers:

Because of GNL's exposure in Europe, the company invests in multiple currencies: USD, Euro, and Pound Sterling. Most of GNL's debt is fixed-rate:

GNL's capital stack is around 60 percent equity and 40 percent debt.

Here's how GNL compares to similar peers:

Another Monthly Dividend Payer
As noted, GNL did not include ARCP in its recent Investor Presentation. I'm not sure why…
Perhaps, it was because GNL is a similar incubator to ARCP when it listed. Remember that ARCP listed and grew into a massive consolidator that paid out monthly dividends. Although GNL is not run by Nicholas Schorsch, it has close ties with its external manager, AR Capital. In addition, Realty Capital Securities is raising equity for American Realty Capital Global II - an all but familiar story for ARCP.

Remember the music? GNL seems to be the same song, just a second verse.
GNL pays a monthly dividend of 0.0592 per share and that translates into $.7104 per year. That's 8.10 percent based on the latest share price:

In terms of dividend safety, GNL's AFFO payout ratio (based on its 2015 run-rate) is 87 percent. While that's not a "sucker yield" ratio, it's higher than I would like to see for a newly-listed REIT (especially since AR Capital is affiliated and externally advised). GNL also has higher leverage than most peers (above 40 percent), and the company has significantly more office exposure (higher cap-ex required).

I don't fear a near-term dividend cut, but without a track record to rely on, I cannot recommend the safety of the dividend. Technically, GNL has no employees, so I have little confidence that an investor's interest are aligned (remember that GNL's CEO is also the CEO of American Realty Capital Global II). Here's how GNL's P/FFO compares with the peers (note: I used GNL's 2015 run-rate):

In my opinion, the market is valuing GNL's shares fairly. I suspect that some of the sell-off is related to the overall under-performance of Net Lease REITs - down around 11.8 percent since January 1.


However, I believe a larger force behind GNL's price decline has been the rush to the door sparked by other Realty Capital Securities products. While Nicholas Schorsch is no longer the Chairman at RCS, he is a shareholder and investor (to the best of my knowledge). So when a GNL (non-traded REIT) investor decides to sell shares and reinvest in another non-traded REIT (likely because the broker suggests it), one is likely paying 10 to 15 percent (in fees) to own shares in yet another illiquid REIT, setting the stage for another round of "same song, second verse."
Be careful with Global Net Lease. While I see no reason to call this REIT by the "sucker yield" name (yet), there are enormous conflicts that could cause unwitting investors to succumb to illogical investing tactics. As Frank J. Williams warned (If You Must Speculate, Learn The Rules), "people of he dupe are hypnotized by the glare of gold" and he offered these words of wisdom:
An investor us one who buys sound securities where he knows his principal will be safe and he will get a fair income return on his money.
We all know the song by now...be careful of the Fool's Gold!

NEW YORK, July 25, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Global Net Lease, Inc. ("GNL") (NYSE:    GNL) announced today the close of a new unsecured credit facility ("New Facility") to replace its previous credit facility.  The New Facility is comprised of a $500 million Senior Unsecured Multicurrency Revolving Credit Facility ("Revolver"), and a €194.6 million ($225 million equivalent) Senior Unsecured Term Loan ("Term Loan") maturing on July 24, 2022.  The Revolver matures in four years and has a one-year extension option.  Up to $225 million in additional commitments may be added under the Revolver and/or the Term Loan facility, for a total of $950 million.








Under the New Facility, the borrowing spread is based on corporate leverage ratios and ranges from 1.60% to 2.20% over LIBOR.  The terms of the New Facility provide for a decrease in the interest rate if the company receives an investment grade rating.  The Revolver provides for borrowings denominated in U.S. Dollars, Euros, British Pound Sterling, Canadian Dollars and Swiss Francs.
"We are pleased with the successful completion of our new credit facility.  We'd like to thank our lending group, led by KeyBank, for their support, which we believe reflects their recognition of the overall quality of GNL's portfolio," said Nick Radesca, Chief Financial Officer for GNL. "The new facility provides us with a competitively priced and highly flexible unsecured facility that forms a foundation for our balance sheet, which we believe is well-positioned to support our disciplined growth strategy well into the future."  
Additional details regarding the New Facility will be available in GNL's Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 25, 2017.
A total of six lenders are participating in the New Facility, including KeyBank National Association as Joint-Lead Arranger and Administrative Agent, along with BMO Harris Bank, N.A., Capital One National Association, Citizens Bank, N.A., Mizuho Bank, LTD., and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
