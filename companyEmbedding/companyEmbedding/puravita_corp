New 8 oz. Size Golden Flax $7.99/BagLimited Time Offer

Company BackgroundPura Vida of North America, LLC., started as a vision by co-founders Thomas and Donna Stacy after visiting Costa Rica on a trade mission and realizing the need for increased support of environmental consciousness. Pura Vida, meaning "pure life", was started as a marketing arm of their ongoing Organic Foods, Inc. business located in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The Stacy's founded Organic Foods, Inc., in early 1991 by introducing vegan vegetarian food at the Minnesota State Fair. Their food was so well received that their organic food business was born. Organic Foods, Inc. produced all their vegan vegetarian fast food in a company owned plant and delivered it across the Midwest and eventually began shipping it nationally.After Thomas passed away in late 2004, Donna made the difficult decision to close the Organic Foods business, move to Portland, Oregon, and concentrate on Pura Vida of NA, which had already started developing the packaging and marketing plans for Sprout RevolutionTM. Donna's daughter, Michelle, stepped into her Dad's role to help build the business and a "mother/daughter team" was born. Since then, Donna's son, Tom, has become involved in the business which is now a wholly owned and run family business much as the co-founders had originally envisioned.Since flax is a natural and renewable source for Omega-3, it fit the environmental criteria of the co-founder's corporate mission. Pura Vida of NA, LLC, is the exclusive distributor of Sprout RevolutionTM which is manufactured in Canada. Our manufacturer has pioneered and patented the development of bio-activated, sprouted flax and other sprouted products. Our proprietary, patented sprouted flax seed powders are a result of over 20 years of research into the chemical effects and nutritional benefits of bio-activating seeds through germination.Pura Vida of NA, LLC as a family owned company is dedicated to providing the highest quality health and food products throughout North America and the world. Our production facilities and products are GMP compliant and certified organic through OCCP-Pro Certification. Years of research and expertise have resulted in the most bio-available products on the market. We want to change the way the world looks at flax and other sprouted products soon to be introduced by Pura Vida of NA, LLC.

Notes : 
  
(1) The category of General Working Capital may include, but not be limited 
to—effecting a business combination including but not limited to- printing 
costs, postage, communication services, overnight delivery charges, 
additional professional fees, consulting fees, and other general operating 
expenses. The search for a merger/acquisition candidate will not be limited 
to any industry or nature. No negotiations have been entered into or targets 
identified. This amount in escrow will only be available to the Company 
post-acquisition and that there are no known uses other than as general 
working capital at this time and such amount cannot be used for salaries or 
reimbursement of expenses. 
  
(2) Limited to use in effecting a business combination as 
defined in (1).


The Company will remain an insignificant participant among the firms which 
engage in the acquisition of business opportunities. There are many 
established venture capital and financial concerns which have significantly 
greater financial and personnel resources and technical expertise than the 
Company. In view of the Company's combined extremely limited financial 
resources and limited management availability, the Company will continue to be 
at a significant competitive disadvantage compared to the Company's 
competitors.


Company Description
Puravita Corporation ("Puravita Corporation" or the "Company"), incorporated 
in the State of Delaware on March 2, 2011, to engage in any lawful Corporation 
undertaking, including, but not limited to, selected mergers and acquisitions. 
The Company has been in the developmental stage since


 inception and has no 
operations to date. Other than issuing shares to its original shareholder, the 
Company never commenced any operational activities. 

The Company’s financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company 
will continue as a going concern. As shown in the accompanying financial 
statements, the Company has a negative current ratio and Company has incurred 
an accumulated deficit from inception.  These conditions raise substantial 
doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. 

The Company was formed by Rory O'Dare, the initial director, for the purpose 
of creating a Corporation which could be used to consummate a merger or 
acquisition Mr. O'Dare serves as President, Secretary, Treasurer and Director 
Mr. O'Dare determined next to proceed with filing a Form S-1. 

Mr. O'Dare, the President and Director, elected to commence implementation of 
the Company's principal business purpose.As such, the Company can be defined 
as a "shell" company, whose sole purpose at this time is to locate and 
consummate a merger or acquisition with a private entity. 

The proposed business activities described herein classify the Company as a 
"blank check" company. Many states have enacted statutes, rules and 
regulations limiting the sale securities of "blank check" companies in their 
prospective jurisdictions. Management does not intend to undertake any efforts 
to cause a market to develop in the Company's securities until such time as 
the Company has successfully implemented its business plan described herein In 
order to provide further assurances that no trading will occur in the 
Company's securities until a merger or acquisition has been consummated, each 
current shareholder has agreed to place his/her respective certificates in 
escrow until such time as legal counsel has confirmed that a merger or 
acquisition has been successfully consummated.  However, while management 
believes that the procedures established to preclude any sale of the Company’s 
securities prior to closing of a merger or acquisition will be sufficient, 
there can be no assurances that the procedures established herein will 
unequivocally limit any shareholder’s from selling their respective securities 
before such closing.  Mr. O'Dare as the sole officer and director and sole 
signatory on this registration statement is bound thereby by Rule 419 (and by 
the escrow agreement to which he is a party) as it relates the the sale of his 
shares. Any subscribers will be notified of in writing a minimum of 20 days 
prior to the beginning of any extension in the offering period. 
------

Puravita Corporation’s operations and Corporation offices are located at 
3211 Ocean Drive Vero Beach, FL 32963, with a telephone number of (772) 
584-3308.
