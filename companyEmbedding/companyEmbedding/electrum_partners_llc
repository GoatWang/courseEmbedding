With a global reputation for leadership and vision, Electrum Partners is an advisory services firm specializing in medical and recreational cannabis and ancillary businesses, founded by Leslie Bocskor, former investment banker known for success, leadership and disruption in emerging markets, technologies and finance.  The experienced senior leadership team takes great pride in engineering the underpinnings of successful business entries and exits across the full spectrum of cannabis business verticals, and helping to develop policy and regulatory frameworks with an acute understanding and knowledge of regulatory complexities.









WHAT WE DO

We partner with private and public companies, policy-makers, governments, entrepreneurs and investors looking for an edge to improve and maximize shareholder value and liquidity, as well as companies that are looking to make the private-to-public transition.  We know that cannabis is not a single industry but dozens of sub-industries, each with its own barriers-to-entry, capital requirements, unique market traits, and paths to success. As we help bring your ideas to fruition, we draw upon our ability to identify opportunities and create wins. You can count on Electrum Partners to help grow your business’ value and footprint, assisting you to navigate through markets where tumultuous dynamics are at work.

Brutal honesty.   Subject mastery.   Purpose.We are driven to help companies become winners in a crowded landscape by putting experienced leaders into your value chain to help shape your future success.  We will help you develop strategies from a competitive context, bringing powerful solutions for growth, added value, and the knowledge to forge a path forward (or the awareness and confidence to pivot away). We respect big ideas and worship attention to detail, diligence, expertise and planning, but also thrive on seizing opportunity, and gracefully navigating hurdles when the moment calls.   We value questions as much as answers, consider teamwork the highest calling, and believe wisdom is best served with a side of humility and humanity.  We help turn winners into leaders and we turn them loose.

LEADERSHIP













  
  
  
 


Leslie Bocskor
President







 
 Most folks in the cannabis industry for any length of time know Bocskor by face, name and for his exuberant laugh and immaculate three-piece suits. But don’t be fooled by his formidable frame. This Transylvanian-descended Renaissance man does not intimidate, he leads by example by embracing an open source collaborative model unrestricted by time zones and geographies. Bocskor’s boldness enables him to assume a leadership role, mentor, and share the spotlight with other leaders, and fuel the industry’s ascent to a global financial and social phenomenon.
	 
	Bocskor’s insights, expertise, and global stature make him the man who policy makers, investors, and entrepreneurs seek out for future planning and immediate fixing. He is the undisputed choice as the voice on cannabis issues and business, from state-of-the-art technology and best practices, to policy, industry financing and expansion.  Committed to a culture of compassion at Electrum Partners and throughout the industry, he takes pride in ushering in changes that rewrite history, whether it’s the empathic opening of patient access, or the invention of a national innovation funding reset button.
	 
	His far-reaching banking and entrepreneurial experience and inimitable style are bolstered with his knowledge of any cannabis vertical — from domestic and international policy to finding your niche investing opportunity, from supercritical extraction to ERP solutions, from seed-to-sale to the entourage effect of strategic business integration. Bocskor has become one of the most influential people in the cannabis space, guiding policy and reform.

 Most folks in the cannabis industry for any length of time know Bocskor by face, name and for his exuberant laugh and immaculate three-piece suits. But don’t be fooled by his formidable frame. This Transylvanian-descended Renaissance man does not intimidate, he leads by example by embracing an open source collaborative model unrestricted by time zones and geographies. Bocskor’s boldness enables him to assume a leadership role, mentor, and share the spotlight with other leaders, and fuel the industry’s ascent to a global financial and social phenomenon.
	 
	Bocskor’s insights, expertise, and global stature make him the man who policy makers, investors, and entrepreneurs seek out for future planning and immediate fixing. He is the undisputed choice as the voice on cannabis issues and business, from state-of-the-art technology and best practices, to policy, industry financing and expansion.  Committed to a culture of compassion at Electrum Partners and throughout the industry, he takes pride in ushering in changes that rewrite history, whether it’s the empathic opening of patient access, or the invention of a national innovation funding reset button.
	 
	His far-reaching banking and entrepreneurial experience and inimitable style are bolstered with his knowledge of any cannabis vertical — from domestic and international policy to finding your niche investing opportunity, from supercritical extraction to ERP solutions, from seed-to-sale to the entourage effect of strategic business integration. Bocskor has become one of the most influential people in the cannabis space, guiding policy and reform.

Mentor Capital Invests Second Tranche in Electrum Partners | Business Wire
























































Mentor Capital Invests Second Tranche in Electrum Partners




Cannabis CEO Leslie Bocskor Leads “Green Gold” Growth Between Seed 
      and Mezzanine Funding Rounds Provided by Mentor






April 28, 2017 10:22 AM Eastern Daylight Time



SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mentor Capital, Inc. (OTCQB: MNTR) is pleased to announce it has again 
      provided $100,000 in special project financing for cannabis advisory 
      leader Electrum Partners, LLC. “Since our first $100,000 round of 
      Electrum funding in March 2014, the Mentor team has gained great 
      confidence in the business model developed by Leslie Bocskor, who now 
      sits on the board of directors of GB Sciences (OTCQB:GBLX) and Grow 
      Solutions Holdings (OTCQB:GRSO),” affirms Mentor Capital CEO, Chet 
      Billingsley. “Electrum now also holds interests in Signal Bay 
      (OTCQB:SGBY), Indoor Harvest (OTCQB:INQD), with options in MassRoots 
      (OTCQB:MSRT), Attis Trading, Infinite Message, and Island Breeze, plus 
      advisory relationships with Kush Bottles (OTCQB:KSHB) and other cannabis 
      leaders. Mentor’s initial 5% convertible debt position has been nicely 
      rewarded by these great advances by Electrum which made the request for 
      a second $100,000 an easy one for us to say yes to.”
    


      Electrum’s founder is similarly positive, “Based on past successes over 
      nearly a decade of working with Chet Billingsley and Mentor Capital, I 
      am excited to build additional enterprise value in our future endeavors 
      together.” Bocskor explains this fit, “Billingsley’s finance strategies 
      for larger businesses in the legal cannabis industry create a path for 
      liquidity and access to the capital markets for both investors and 
      founders. We have confidence that Mentor’s strategy to efficiently bring 
      together the capital markets and cannabis industry leaders is critical 
      to funding the newly emerging major growth we now see in this sector.”
    

      Mentor CEO Billingsley adds, “We refer to the larger medical marijuana 
      and cannabis companies that we are helping to efficiently move into the 
      public market as core holdings and segregate these into a major pure 
      play pool. We at Mentor certainly see Electrum Partners as a great 
      pending candidate for us to work with in this regard.”
    

About Mentor Capital: The Company seeks to come alongside and 
      assist private medical marijuana and cannabis companies and their 
      founders in meeting their liquidity and financial objectives, to add 
      protection for investors and to help incubate private cannabis 
      companies. Additional important information for investors is presented 
      at: www.MentorCapital.com.
