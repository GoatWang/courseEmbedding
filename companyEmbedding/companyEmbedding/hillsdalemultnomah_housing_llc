Ross William Hamilton/The OregonianHillsdale Terrace in 2007Home Forward, the new name for Housing Authority of Portland, has been awarded an $18.5 million grant to redevelop the troubled Hillsdale Terrace  public housing project in Multnomah Village.      The grant is from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.      “We’re honored to receive our third HOPE VI grant, and are pleased that HUD recognized the tremendous need for this revitalization project,” said Steve Rudman, executive director of Home Forward.       “This grant represents a significant investment in one of Portland’s oldest neighborhoods,” said Mary McBride, HUD’s northwest regional administrator, “expanding the supply and the mix of housing, creating new economic opportunity and linkages and making sure that it’s a vibrant, integral part of 21st century Portland.”    Portland City Commissioner Nick Fish said the grant was great news for the city. 
“It will improve the lives of families living at Hillsdale Terrace, create family-wage construction jobs, strengthen connections to the surrounding community and continue Portland’s tradition of leadership in green buildings,” Fish said.     Built more than 40 years ago, Hillsdale Terrace is beyond repair and in serious need of attention, housing officials said.      The property is in a six-acre, bowl-like setting at 6775 S.W. 26th Ave., and is home to very-low-income residents.      The 60 three-bedroom units will be removed and replaced with 122 units with varying numbers of bedrooms. An additional seven homes, developed in partnership with Habitat for Humanity, will be available elsewhere for first-time homeowners.       The development will incorporate sustainable and green building features, a community garden, a community center for residents and neighbors, and more open space and play area.       Neighborhood House will provide Head Start and early childhood programs. 
The total cost of the project is estimated to be $47.3 million. Low-income housing tax credits will provide $12.2  million, and the city will kick in $5 million. The housing agency will provide the rest.       The agency will help current residents of Hillsdale Terrace find new places to live during construction, plus help with moving.      This is the third HOPE VI Revitalization grant that the housing authority has won. It landed a $16.9 million grant in 2005 to build Humboldt Gardens and a $35 million grant in 2001 to build New Columbia.           --James Mayer
