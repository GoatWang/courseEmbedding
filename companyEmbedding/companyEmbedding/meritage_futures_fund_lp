 Managed Future Funds Fees & Expenses Class Action Lawsuit 

 
  

In November 2013, Bloomberg published a startling report about the fees and expenses some fund managers charge investors in “managed-futures” funds.  The conclusion was that in dozens and dozens of managed futures funds, the managers charged fees and expenses that totaled 89% of all the profit of that given fund.
A managed-futures fund  is an alternative investment, which is often defined as an investment other than cash, stocks, or bonds.  Typically these investments are sold to investors through brokers and many large brokerage houses have there own proprietary managed futures investments.  BarcalyHedge estimates that over $331 billion was invested in managed accounts in mid 2013.

SEC reporting requirements 
One difference between managed futures funds and say typical stocks and bonds is that in general managed futures funds are not required to file with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The SEC does however require that all managed futures funds with more than 500 investors and more than $10 million in assets file financial reports within 120 days of their fiscal year’s end.  Bloomberg as part of its investigation concluded that there are currently 63 managed-futures funds that fit into this category. The vast majority of managed-futures funds, therefore, have no reporting requirement, as they are not subject to the 500 Investor Rule.

	Bloomberg’s big ciscovery regarding managed futures funds fees and expenses
Bloomberg concluded that managed-futures funds can charge clients 7% to 9% each year of the investment amount in the fund plus 20 percent of the funds’ profits.  (Hedge funds typically only charge a 2% management fee plus 20% of investor profits.)
Bloomberg next concluded that for the period from Jan. 1, 2003 to Dec. 31, 2012, a stunning 89% of the $11.51 billion of gains in these 63 managed-futures funds went to fees, commissions and expenses collected by the fund managers—not to investors. 

	One example: Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Spectrum Technical L.P.
30,000 people invested approximately $797 million in Morgan Stanley's managed-futures fund called Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Spectrum Technical L.P. From 2002 through 2012, the fund made approximately $490 million in trading gains and interest income. However, investors ended up losing money because those profits were depleted by over $498 million in commissions, expenses and fees paid to fund managers and Morgan Stanley. Despite the fund's value increase of approximately $490 million, investors ended up losing approximately $8 million over the course of those 10 years.
