NIB Environmental Bonds: a product for environmentally conscious investors




Environmental or other theme bonds have become a well-established asset for a growing number of investors in recent years. Like other supranational institutions, the Nordic Investment Bank issues environmental bonds. Pursuant to its mandate, the Bank is particularly well equipped to offer investments targeted at projects which contribute to environmental improvements.
NIB has an explicit environmental mandate. This means the Bank strives to promote environment-friendly projects in its financing. Last year, NIB financed projects expected to reduce CO2 emissions by 300,000 tonnes and discharges of phosphorus into the Baltic Sea by 130 tonnes. The latter is equivalent to discharges from a wastewater treatment plant covering an area of approximately 7.4 million inhabitants.
In 2010, NIB created a framework for the issuance of NIB Environmental Bonds, or NEBs. It provides that the proceeds from NEBs be used for lending to solutions for renewable energy, energy efficiency and public transport, and for the reduction of emissions into the air or water. Since a substantial part of the Bank’s lending is already classified as environmental loans, one of the main tasks within the NEB framework is to define how the projects to be financed by environmental bonds are selected.
The analysis of the environmental impact of each project financed by NIB is an integral aspect of the loan approval process. In the assessment of the environmental impact of a project, the Bank also looks at the implementation risk of the anticipated positive effects on the environment. Both aspects are taken into account when selecting projects to be financed under the NEB programme.
How does the NEB programme work?
Rather strict rules have been set for loans to qualify for the programme; only projects which receive a high score on environmental impact and a low score on implementation risk can qualify. The duration of the loan and the maturity of the bond do not need to match exactly, which gives the programme enough flexibility to respond to investors’ duration preferences without compromising the goal of only financing the best projects by NEBs.
Transparency is an important aspect of NIB’s daily work. The same applies to disclosing the use of the proceeds from issuing NEBs. The proceeds are held in a separate portfolio until they are disbursed to an eligible project. A list of projects financed from the NEB proceeds is available here.
The issues of the NIB Environmental Bonds carry the same AAA/Aaa rating as any other debt issues made by the Bank.
How do NIB Environmental Bonds fit into the Bank’s overall funding strategy?
While strict eligibility rules put a limit on the issuance volume, NIB is committed to the environmental bond market and aims to continue offering this product to the market.
“NEBs offer a sustainable investment opportunity for investors and raise NIB’s profile as an environmentally conscious Bank in the capital markets,” says Alexander Ruf, Senior Funding Manager at NIB.

Rapid changes are occurring in the financial services industry, even as the expected time to market for new lending products and services has decreased. Banks and lenders need rigorous information management practices to survive and first-rate analytics technology to thrive. They also need to comply with strict regulations governing credit ratings, loan approval standards, and liquidity requirements. Meeting these requirements has become increasingly difficult in the wake of new government regulations, from Basel III guidelines to Money Market Fund Reform rules, which happened after the global financial meltdown. Nordic Investment Bank (NIB) has standardized on Information Builders' WebFOCUS business intelligence (BI) and analytics platform to meet these business challenges head on.
Headquartered in Helsinki, Finland, NIB is an international financial institution jointly owned by Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. NIB borrows funds on the international capital markets and offers long-term lending to private and public entities to complement commercial lending. Its bonds enjoy the highest possible credit rating.
"We depend on Information Builders' technology and local InfoBuild services to provide insights to lending, finance, accounting, risk management, treasury, and other parts of the organization," says Aini Joensuu, chief systems officer at NIB. "WebFOCUS is essential for information management and compliance."
WebFOCUS for Interactive Reporting
Joensuu and her team implemented a portal with dashboards for accounting, treasury, administration, planning, and risk management. The portal lets authorized users access current information on demand. Users easily explore data via reports, graphs, and charts. These analytics assets leverage many core WebFOCUS features, such as WebFOCUS ReportCaster, to send information directly to people’s e-mails. "We depend on WebFOCUS parameterization and Active Technologies across all our departments," Joensuu notes. "Nearly everybody in the organization can access WebFOCUS. We have more than 250 users."
Information Builders calls interactive analytics applications InfoApps™ since they allow people to visualize data in charts and graphs and easily drill into the data. Users can find and compare relevant data elements, and then select an output format to save, display, or analyze the data, including HTML, Excel, and PDF.
"WebFOCUS puts our data in a very accessible form," says Jaana Ijas, a senior system specialist at NIB who spearheads much of the WebFOCUS development. "If users want to examine lending data in a particular sector, they start with a portfolio at the summary level, and drill down to the detail level as they examine the information."
Addressing Regulatory Compliance
All banks face tough lending standards and conservative guidelines for capital reserves. As an international finance institution, NIB ensures that it complies with regulations. NIB also tracks its lending activity by business areas, such as energy and environment; infrastructure, transportation, and telecom; industries and services; and financial institutions and small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs). Officers in the Treasury and Risk departments use WebFOCUS to analyze liquidity as they monitor the inflow and outflow of funds by sector, time period, portfolio, and other variables. An InfoApp™ computes liquidity buffer survival horizons – projections of financial liquidity based on current and expected lending activity.
"As our lending system establishes payment plans, funding officers need to compare what actually comes in with what is expected to come in," Ijas explains. "What are the expected distributions against the expected amounts of these loans over a particular time period?"
This same logic applies to treasury instruments. WebFOCUS lets treasury officers calculate risk patterns for inflows and outflows among any group of customers, ensuring that NIB maintains adequate survival horizons. Other WebFOCUS reports enable the accounting department to reconcile balances and verify that transactions have been correctly posted from sub-ledgers to the general ledger. "Cash flow and compliance are dependent on the ability to access and analyze this information," Ijas adds.
DataMigrator Prepares the Data
WebFOCUS acquires data from a Microsoft SQL Server data warehouse, which is periodically loaded with operational information from an SAP enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, a customized lending system, a treasury system, and other operational databases, including text files and CSV files. Every day, iWay DataMigrator, also from Information Builders, grabs relevant information from these source systems and loads it into the warehouse, merging relational data with flat-file data and putting it all into a common format, behind the scenes. DataMigrator handles all necessary conversions and transpositions to ensure consistent financial and operational reporting.
WebFOCUS pre-aggregates the data into a reporting warehouse to ensure that users obtain results quickly. Users in each department and corporate domain are authorized to see only certain portions of the database, based on their specific needs and the controls built into the security profile. WebFOCUS also accesses data directly from the source systems. Having a combination of real-time and staged data sources gives NIB personnel flexibility to satisfy reporting and analytics needs. ReportCaster automatically generates standard reports and places them in the reporting library for auditing purposes. ReportCaster also sends reports to e-mail addresses and printers, and distributes files for other processes, but mainly reports are run on demand.
"We can access various kinds of data and combine it as we need it," Joensuu confirms. "WebFOCUS has been a huge timesaver."
For example, risk officers must submit information to oversight boards three times per year to verify liquidity recovery ratios. Previously, they had to manually pull information from several different information systems and load it into Excel tables to calculate these ratios, which was cumbersome and time-consuming. "Now people use WebFOCUS reports for this, ensuring accuracy and saving many hours of work," Joensuu says. "They can see the data any time rather than merely at these periodic intervals. WebFOCUS not only makes it easy to get the data we need, but also improves this business process."
Evolving With the Data
Emerging market trends, shifting industry regulations, and new competitive forces necessitate new types of reporting, analysis, and information management. In response, NIB has developed a more robust enterprise data warehouse. It plans to use DataMigrator to load the warehouse and WebFOCUS to add new types of reports, dashboards, and InfoApps™ to the portal – as well as to explore Information Builders' master data management (MDM) technology to automate data enrichment and data quality initiatives.
"We work with InfoBuild on an ongoing basis, and we are satisfied with their ability to implement Information Builders’ technology," Joensuu concludes. "Their consultants have a good handle on our needs and Information Builders continues to supply advanced technology for our needs."

Logo of the Nordic Investment Bank.


The Nordic Investment Bank (NIB) is an international financial institution founded in the mid-1970s by the five Nordic countries: Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. In 2005, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania became members of the Bank. NIB’s headquarters are located in Helsinki, Finland. NIB acquires the funds for its lending by borrowing on the international capital markets.

Strategy[edit]
To improve competitiveness of its member countries, the NIB-financed projects support productivity growth through

technical progress and innovation
development of human capital
improvements in infrastructure
increased market efficiency

In terms of the environment, NIB lends to projects that lead to

improved resource efficiency
development of a competitive low carbon economy
protection of the environment and its ecosystem services
development of clean technology

NIB has a significant environmental loan portfolio outside its member countries, including the Baltic Sea and Barents regions.
Projects considered for financing are viewed from a sustainable growth perspective. NIB analyses their impact on competitiveness and the environment as well as their indirect effects on the economy and society.
NIB acquires the funds for its lending by borrowing on international capital markets. The Bank’s bonds enjoy the highest possible credit rating, AAA/Aaa, with the leading rating agencies Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s.
Structure and management[edit]




Members of NIB in 2005


Each member country designates a Governor to the Bank's Board of Governors, which is the supreme decision-making body. The Control Committee is the Bank's supervisory body. The Board of Directors makes policy decisions concerning the operations and approves the financial transactions proposed by NIB's President. NIB's President is responsible for the conduct of the current operations of the Bank. The President is assisted in his or her work by the Executive Committee, Asset and Liability Committee, Credit Committee, Finance Committee and ICT Council.
The Bank has some 180 employees from all the member countries. NIB has its headquarters in Helsinki, Finland. The Bank's official languages are English and Swedish.
NIB promotes transparency, predictability, accountability, responsibility and disclosure as general principles enhancing and furthering good governance.
Legal framework[edit]
NIB is governed by its constituent documents, namely the Agreement among its member countries and the Statutes, as well as the Headquarters Agreement concluded between NIB and the Government of Finland. These establish that NIB is the member countries' common international financial institution, having the same status as other legal persons conducting similar operations within and outside the member countries. Furthermore, the constituent documents stipulate that NIB has the status of an international legal person with full legal capacity, define the immunities and privileges of the Bank and its personnel and set out the structure for the governance of the Bank.
Cooperation[edit]
NIB places great importance on its cooperation with other financing institutions. The Bank's aim is to create added value for its customers by supplementing other sources of finance with long-term loans and guarantees. NIB cooperates and cofinances projects with other international financial institutions and regional multilateral banks as well as with public and private sector lenders such as export credit institutions, development cooperation authorities and commercial banks. NIB belongs to the Nordic Finance Group consisting of four international financial institutions located together in Helsinki, Finland. NIB channels its financing to small and medium-sized enterprises through local intermediaries.
NIB participates actively in the Northern Dimension Environmental Partnership (NDEP). As regards environmental cooperation, NIB has also signed the declaration European principles of the environment together with four other European international financial institutions. NIB hosts the Secretariat of the Northern Dimension Partnership on Transport and Logistics (NDPTL) established in 2009.
NIB has established cooperation with international financial institutions such as the Asian Development Bank (ADB); the African Development Bank (AfDB); the Council of Europe Development Bank (CEB); the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD); the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB); as well as the IBRD, IDA, and IFC within the World Bank Group. Furthermore, NIB has cooperation agreements with three regional multilateral banks: the Black Sea Trade & Development Bank, the Central American Bank for Economic Integration CABEI and the Andean Development Corporation CAF. Through these institutions, NIB can operate also in countries where it has no agreement on financial cooperation.

Strategy[edit]
To improve competitiveness of its member countries, the NIB-financed projects support productivity growth through

technical progress and innovation
development of human capital
improvements in infrastructure
increased market efficiency

In terms of the environment, NIB lends to projects that lead to

improved resource efficiency
development of a competitive low carbon economy
protection of the environment and its ecosystem services
development of clean technology

NIB has a significant environmental loan portfolio outside its member countries, including the Baltic Sea and Barents regions.
Projects considered for financing are viewed from a sustainable growth perspective. NIB analyses their impact on competitiveness and the environment as well as their indirect effects on the economy and society.
NIB acquires the funds for its lending by borrowing on international capital markets. The Bank’s bonds enjoy the highest possible credit rating, AAA/Aaa, with the leading rating agencies Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s.
Structure and management[edit]




Members of NIB in 2005


Each member country designates a Governor to the Bank's Board of Governors, which is the supreme decision-making body. The Control Committee is the Bank's supervisory body. The Board of Directors makes policy decisions concerning the operations and approves the financial transactions proposed by NIB's President. NIB's President is responsible for the conduct of the current operations of the Bank. The President is assisted in his or her work by the Executive Committee, Asset and Liability Committee, Credit Committee, Finance Committee and ICT Council.
The Bank has some 180 employees from all the member countries. NIB has its headquarters in Helsinki, Finland. The Bank's official languages are English and Swedish.
NIB promotes transparency, predictability, accountability, responsibility and disclosure as general principles enhancing and furthering good governance.
Legal framework[edit]
NIB is governed by its constituent documents, namely the Agreement among its member countries and the Statutes, as well as the Headquarters Agreement concluded between NIB and the Government of Finland. These establish that NIB is the member countries' common international financial institution, having the same status as other legal persons conducting similar operations within and outside the member countries. Furthermore, the constituent documents stipulate that NIB has the status of an international legal person with full legal capacity, define the immunities and privileges of the Bank and its personnel and set out the structure for the governance of the Bank.
Cooperation[edit]
NIB places great importance on its cooperation with other financing institutions. The Bank's aim is to create added value for its customers by supplementing other sources of finance with long-term loans and guarantees. NIB cooperates and cofinances projects with other international financial institutions and regional multilateral banks as well as with public and private sector lenders such as export credit institutions, development cooperation authorities and commercial banks. NIB belongs to the Nordic Finance Group consisting of four international financial institutions located together in Helsinki, Finland. NIB channels its financing to small and medium-sized enterprises through local intermediaries.

As regards environmental cooperation, NIB has also signed the declaration European principles of the environment together with four other European international financial institutions. NIB hosts the Secretariat of the Northern Dimension Partnership on Transport and Logistics (NDPTL) established in 2009.
NIB has established cooperation with international financial institutions such as the Asian Development Bank (ADB); the African Development Bank (AfDB); the Council of Europe Development Bank (CEB); the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD); the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB); as well as the IBRD, IDA, and IFC within the World Bank Group. Furthermore, NIB has cooperation agreements with three regional multilateral banks: the Black Sea Trade & Development Bank, the Central American Bank for Economic Integration CABEI and the Andean Development Corporation CAF. Through these institutions, NIB can operate also in countries where it has no agreement on financial cooperation.

Logo of the Nordic Investment Bank.


The Nordic Investment Bank (NIB) is an international financial institution founded in the mid-1970s by the five Nordic countries: Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. In 2005, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania became members of the Bank. NIB’s headquarters are located in Helsinki, Finland. NIB acquires the funds for its lending by borrowing on the international capital markets.

Strategy[edit]
To improve competitiveness of its member countries, the NIB-financed projects support productivity growth through

technical progress and innovation
development of human capital
improvements in infrastructure
increased market efficiency

In terms of the environment, NIB lends to projects that lead to

improved resource efficiency
development of a competitive low carbon economy
protection of the environment and its ecosystem services
development of clean technology

NIB has a significant environmental loan portfolio outside its member countries, including the Baltic Sea and Barents regions.
Projects considered for financing are viewed from a sustainable growth perspective. NIB analyses their impact on competitiveness and the environment as well as their indirect effects on the economy and society.
NIB acquires the funds for its lending by borrowing on international capital markets. The Bank’s bonds enjoy the highest possible credit rating, AAA/Aaa, with the leading rating agencies Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s.
Structure and management[edit]




Members of NIB in 2005


Each member country designates a Governor to the Bank's Board of Governors, which is the supreme decision-making body. The Control Committee is the Bank's supervisory body. The Board of Directors makes policy decisions concerning the operations and approves the financial transactions proposed by NIB's President. NIB's President is responsible for the conduct of the current operations of the Bank. The President is assisted in his or her work by the Executive Committee, Asset and Liability Committee, Credit Committee, Finance Committee and ICT Council.
The Bank has some 180 employees from all the member countries. NIB has its headquarters in Helsinki, Finland. The Bank's official languages are English and Swedish.
NIB promotes transparency, predictability, accountability, responsibility and disclosure as general principles enhancing and furthering good governance.
Legal framework[edit]
NIB is governed by its constituent documents, namely the Agreement among its member countries and the Statutes, as well as the Headquarters Agreement concluded between NIB and the Government of Finland. These establish that NIB is the member countries' common international financial institution, having the same status as other legal persons conducting similar operations within and outside the member countries. Furthermore, the constituent documents stipulate that NIB has the status of an international legal person with full legal capacity, define the immunities and privileges of the Bank and its personnel and set out the structure for the governance of the Bank.
Cooperation[edit]
NIB places great importance on its cooperation with other financing institutions. The Bank's aim is to create added value for its customers by supplementing other sources of finance with long-term loans and guarantees. NIB cooperates and cofinances projects with other international financial institutions and regional multilateral banks as well as with public and private sector lenders such as export credit institutions, development cooperation authorities and commercial banks. NIB belongs to the Nordic Finance Group consisting of four international financial institutions located together in Helsinki, Finland. NIB channels its financing to small and medium-sized enterprises through local intermediaries.
NIB participates actively in the Northern Dimension Environmental Partnership (NDEP). As regards environmental cooperation, NIB has also signed the declaration European principles of the environment together with four other European international financial institutions. NIB hosts the Secretariat of the Northern Dimension Partnership on Transport and Logistics (NDPTL) established in 2009.
NIB has established cooperation with international financial institutions such as the Asian Development Bank (ADB); the African Development Bank (AfDB); the Council of Europe Development Bank (CEB); the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD); the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB); as well as the IBRD, IDA, and IFC within the World Bank Group. Furthermore, NIB has cooperation agreements with three regional multilateral banks: the Black Sea Trade & Development Bank, the Central American Bank for Economic Integration CABEI and the Andean Development Corporation CAF. Through these institutions, NIB can operate also in countries where it has no agreement on financial cooperation.
Nordic Finance Group[edit]
NIB is part of the Nordic Finance Group, consisting of four international financial institutions located in the same block in Helsinki, Finland. The institutions within the group offer different types of financing and competences. In addition to NIB, the following institutions belong to the group:

Nordic Development Fund (NDF)

Main article: Nordic Development Fund
NDF is a multilateral development finance organisation, providing grant financing for climate projects in poor developing countries.

Nordic Environment Finance Corporation (NEFCO)

NEFCO is a risk capital institution financing environmental projects in Central and Eastern Europe.

Nordic Project Fund (Nopef)

Nopef is an organisation that works to strengthen the international competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises by providing loans on favourable terms for cofinancing feasibility studies.
NDF, NEFCO and Nopef are owned by the five Nordic countries.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
