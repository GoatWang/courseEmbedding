Virginia Union University awarded him the honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters in May 1987. The following excerpt was taken from The History of Norfolk State University 1935-1938 by Samuel Fischer Scott and Constance J. Spencer (a student from the first class): The October 11, 1984 issue of The Virginia Pilot, “Norfolk Compass” titled an article referring to Samuel Scott, ‘FIRST NSU HEAD GETS NAME ON NEW DORM’ and related: Samuel F. Scott, who in 1935 started from scratch the school that became Norfolk State University, was honored recently when the University’s Board of Visitors named a new men’s dormitory for him.

Matters of race and equality can stir uncomfortable emotions in any setting. Start talking about these challenging community issues with a room full of cops...WATCH OUT! I recently attended a seminar Dr. Moore presented for Iowa law enforcement executives. Dr. Moore did an outstanding job of providing valuable information but also directing an important discussion. Dr. Moore often says that when it comes to issues of diversity in America, "We all have work to do." He includes himself in that statement and does a fantastic job of creating a learning environment which allows everyone in the room to self evaluate and learn. I have served as a peace officer for nearly 23 years. This was the best diversity seminar I have ever attended. Dr. Moore is the real deal and is committed to intelligent and honest dialogue.”— Michael W. Tupper, Chief of Police, Marshalltown Police Department

RICHMOND - Virginia State University's 123rd commencement, held at the Richmond Coliseum yesterday, marked the end of an era. It was the last ceremony for parting VSU President Eddie N. Moore Jr. "As the 12th president, I was honored to serve for the past 17 years," a visibly moved Moore said in front of 570 graduates and their friends and families. "As many of you know, this is the last commencement I preside over. I will leave my duties on June 30th." Richmond Mayor Dwight C. Jones, the commencement speaker, called yesterday's ceremony the conclusion of the Moore era. "Virginia State University has experienced a renaissance under president Moore," Jones said. "His tenure has taken Virginia State to a new level of excellence and reputation. The Moore years will be called 'golden' when history will be written," he said. "We congratulate this great man for the great job that he has done," Jones added, earning applause from both the graduates and the audience. "Moore will leave here with the stories of thousands of people from VSU." Moore chose Jones to give the keynote address because of their shared history. "He has been a friend of mine for 50 years and he is also my senior pastor," Moore said. Moore added that he had long planned to invite Jones, with whom he had gone to high school, to speak. "I missed him as keynote speaker at high school graudation, because I had already gone off to college," Moore said. Fifty years later, Jones would make up for it. In an inspirational and passionate speech that only a pastor could deliver, Jones gave the Class of 2010 a wake-up call. "We as Americans are facing a new reality in the 21st century," he said. "Our nation is growing, but our world is shrinking. You will no longer be competing with our neighboring states, but with countries like China. You leave here knowing that you can no longer blame others for the direction this world is going, because now you are in charge." Jones also said that the graduates had already taken the first step towards their personal success by chosing to attend VSU. "Education is the currency of the 21st century," he said. "Your journey will not be easy, but you have got the tools to compete in the global arena. Don't be afraid of challenge and don't be afraid of risk." The musical program was performed by the VSU concert band and choir. - Markus Schmidt may be reached at 722-5172 or mschmidt@progress-index.com.
