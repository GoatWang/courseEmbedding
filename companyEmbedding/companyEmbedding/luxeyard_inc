Luxeyard, Inc. To Be Deleted From Other OTC
Dec 21 16
Luxeyard, Inc.'s common stock was deleted from Other OTC, effective December 21, 2016. The deletion was due to revocation of registration by SEC under section 12(j).


SEC Orders Hearings On Registration Suspension Or Revocation Against Luxeyard For Failure To Make Required Periodic Filings
Aug 31 16
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC or the commission) instituted public administrative proceeding to determine whether to revoke or suspend for a period not exceeding twelve months the registration of each class of the securities of Luxeyard, Inc. for failure to make required periodic filings with the Commission. In this Order, the Division of Enforcement (Division) alleges that the company was delinquent in its required periodic filings with the Commission. In this proceeding, instituted pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(j), a hearing will be scheduled before an Administrative Law Judge. At the hearing, the judge will hear evidence from the Division and the company to determine whether the allegations of the Division contained in the Order, which the Division alleges constitute failures to comply with Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 there under, are true. The judge in the proceeding will then determine whether the registrations pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12 of each class of the securities of the company should be revoked or suspended for a period not exceeding twelve months. The Commission ordered that the Administrative Law Judge in this proceeding issue an initial decision not later than 120 days from the date of service of the order instituting proceeding.

Consumer reviews about LUXEYARD INC




Jenn`










		    Feb 5, 2013
		




no actual products
This company “sells” things that they actually do not have on the market. And they just let you pay for the item, but you’ll never receive anything, even an email from them. Useless to contact them.
