Strategy
In addition to focusing on investment opportunities in profitable segments of the market, the Talanta Investment Group, LLC uses a general cash flow based “value” investing strategy. This investment strategy is derived from the investment philosophy known as “value investing” which has outperformed the market over the past 75 years. The intellectual framework of this investment philosophy was introduced in the 1930’s through the teachings of Ben Graham and David Dodd at Columbia Business School. 
The basic premise of value investing is that most companies have a true intrinsic value to owners that can be determined and often becomes disconnected from current market prices. Profitable investments are made below intrinsic value. This spread is what Graham termed the “margin of safety” for the investor.
The value investing discipline has been practiced successfully by many of Graham’s students, including Warren Buffett, Walter Schloss, and Irving Kahn as well as by other disciples such as Mario Gabelli of Gabelli Asset Management, Martin Whitman of the Third Avenue Value Fund, and Joel Greenblatt of Gotham Capital.
The Talanta Investment Group, LLC seeks to define intrinsic value based on identified assets and proven cash flows. It is this metric that ultimately determines the value of a company. Cash earned by a company provides the returns for the long-term investor irrespective of variations in short-term market valuations. John Burr Williams summed up this approach in his 1930’s classic, The Theory of Investment Value:
“If a man buys a security below its investment value he need never lose, even if its price should fall at once, because he can still hold for income and get a return above normal on his cost price; but if he buys it above its investment value his only hope of avoiding a loss is to sell to someone else who must in turn take the loss in the form of insufficient income.”
– John Burr Williams, October 1, 1937
