Private Equity
Putting Capital to Work, Making Companies Stronger.





Overview Our investments span a wide range of industries around the world in established and growth-oriented businesses alike. Playing a vital role in helping companies realize their growth potential, we uncover value by identifying great companies and enhancing their performance by providing patient capital and operating support to strong management teams. Our approach helps our portfolio companies grow core businesses, launch new initiatives, make transformative acquisitions and upgrade technologies and systems to support their long-term strategy.   
We provide more than just capital. We seek to make the companies we invest in stronger through a bottoms-up strategy of transformation. Crucially, we bring the expertise of our Portfolio Operations Group to provide strategic guidance on a variety of operational improvements, including revenue growth, procurement, leadership development, lean process and IT optimization, energy sustainability, and employee health care.
  







				A Message from Joe Baratta, Global Head of Private Equity
			










DRIVING
Transformative Impact  We strive to create value by investing in great businesses where our capital, strategic insight, global relationships and operational support can drive transformation that unlocks the company’s potential. In addition to benefiting our investors, the improvements in growth and global competitiveness benefit workers, communities and other stakeholders. 
We are patient investors who practice the art of the long view, and are committed to achieving the best long-term outcomes for our businesses and our investors. 
 


DISCIPLINED
Due Diligence  Our investment approach is based on a disciplined due diligence process that measures risk while identifying the catalysts for increased value. We purposefully engage only in friendly transactions and work with talented management teams to achieve transformative results. Our specialized Portfolio Operations Group helps to maximize value by improving processes across varied elements of a business’s operations.    
The returns that these investments earn for our investors – pension funds, academic and charitable institutions, governments and other institutions, as well as retail investors – help to secure and grow the assets needed to support retirees and fund essential programs.
 











$100 billion AUM

Blackstone is a global leader in private equity, with $100 billion in assets under management through our opportunistic and private equity segments.






82 Portfolio

 Over 250 Private Equity

All numbers are as of June 30, 2017. 








 $37.5billion
Available Capital to Invest




“ “We are constantly looking for situations where we see something, or we are able to add value in a way that our competitors don't. Our people feel the obligation to go out there and find special situations where we can intervene to drive change.”  - Joseph Baratta Global Head of Private Equity   











   
Pro-active, targeted sourcing  Sector-based, theme-driven deal sourcing is the primary responsibility and mandate of our investment professionals. We aim to source high-quality and proprietary investment opportunities by proactively developing and leveraging strong relationships with companies and key deal intermediaries. At regular pipeline meetings with sector teams, we review potential opportunities and determine what resources – both internal and external – are best suited to pursue those opportunities.  




   
Value-oriented discipline In determining value for new investments, we focus on a business’s current outlook and judge the predictability of that outlook over time, while also factoring in what we can do for the business to drive even better outcomes after our acquisition. 
  




   
Transformational operating improvements 
We actively target companies in which significant value can be created through clear strategic and operational change, and created our Portfolio Operations Group to provide hands-on support to help our portfolio companies become more productive, efficient and valuable. Once a company joins the portfolio, we help management craft a plan to reach their full potential over the long term, and provide assistance as they put this plan into practice.  




Our Portfolio


We are proud of Blackstone’s role as a positive economic catalyst for the companies in our Corporate Private Equity portfolio. We work to identify, invest in and enhance the value of great businesses.


Global in scope, our Corporate Private Equity group has offices in Toronto, New York, London, Dusseldorf, Mumbai, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Sydney. As of June 30, 2017, our Corporate Private Equity funds held interests in 82 companies.

Traditional Leveraged Buyouts 












Traditional Leveraged Buyouts 

We pursue control leveraged buyouts of both large and mid-cap companies globally

                Our large buyouts tend to be in companies of global scale with strong brands and high relative market shares, where we can still drive growth and operating improvements.  Our mid-cap buyouts tend to be of companies that are differentiated vs. larger competitors and have protected market niches and multiple avenues of growth and operating improvements.

Buy and Build Platforms

Smaller companies, scalable platforms, backable management teams

                In our “buy-and-build” transactions we tend to invest in smaller companies that have scalable platforms and backable management teams in large, fragmented industries, where we believe there are substantial revenue and margin benefits from sector consolidation.

Section 3.5 Exculpation and
Indemnification . (a)  Liability to Members .
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, whether
express or implied, to the fullest extent permitted by law, no
Member nor any of such Member’s representatives, agents or
advisors nor any partner, member, officer, employee,
representative, agent or advisor of the Company or any of its
Affiliates (individually, a “ Covered Person ”
and, collectively, the “ Covered Persons ”)
shall be liable to the Company or any other Member for any act or
omission (in relation to the Company, this Agreement, any related
document or any transaction or investment contemplated hereby or
thereby) taken or omitted by a Covered Person (other than any act
or omission constituting Cause) unless there is a final and
non-appealable judicial determination and/or determination of an
arbitrator that such Covered Person did not

act in good faith and in what such Covered
Person reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best
interests of the Company and within the authority granted to such
Covered Person by this Agreement, and, with respect to any criminal
act or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that such
Covered Person’s conduct was unlawful. Each Covered Person
shall be entitled to rely in good faith on the advice of legal
counsel to the Company, accountants and other experts or
professional advisors, and no action taken by any Covered Person in
reliance on such advice shall in any event subject such person to
any liability to any Member or the Company. To the extent that, at
law or in equity, a Member has duties (including fiduciary duties)
and liabilities relating thereto to the Company or to another
Member, to the fullest extent permitted by law, such Member acting
under this Agreement shall not be liable to the Company or to any
such other Member for its good faith reliance on the provisions of
this Agreement. The provisions of this Agreement, to the extent
that they expand or restrict the duties and liabilities of a Member
otherwise existing at law or in equity, are agreed by the Members,
to the fullest extent permitted by law, to modify to that extent
such other duties and liabilities of such Member.

(b) Indemnification . To the
fullest extent permitted by law, the Company shall indemnify and
hold harmless (but only to the extent of the Company’s assets
(including, without limitation, the remaining Commitments of the
Members) each Covered Person from and against any and all claims,
damages, losses, costs, expenses and liabilities (including,
without limitation, amounts paid in satisfaction of judgments, in
compromises and settlements, as fines and penalties and legal or
other costs and reasonable expenses of investigating or defending
against any claim or alleged claim), joint and several, of any
nature whatsoever, known or unknown, liquidated or unliquidated
(collectively, “ Losses ”), arising from any and
all claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings, civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, in which the Covered
Person may be involved, or threatened to be involved, as a party or
otherwise, by reason of such Covered Person’s management of
the affairs of the Company or which relate to or arise out of or in
connection with the Company, its property, its business or affairs
(other than claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings, civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of any act
or omission of such Covered Person constituting Cause);
provided , that a Covered Person shall not be entitled to
indemnification under this Section with respect to any claim, issue
or matter if there is a final and non-appealable judicial
determination and/or determination of an arbitrator that such
Covered Person did not act in good faith and in what such Covered
Person reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best
interest of the Company and within the authority granted to such
Covered Person by this Agreement, and, with respect to any criminal
act or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that such
Covered Person’s conduct was unlawful; provided
further , that if such Covered Person is a Member or a
Withdrawn Member, such Covered Person shall bear its share of such
Losses in accordance with such Covered Person’s Profit
Sharing Percentage in the Company as of the time of the actions or
omissions that gave rise to such Losses. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, expenses (including legal fees) incurred by a
Covered Person (including, without limitation, the Managing Member)
in defending any claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding may,
with the approval of the Managing Member, from time to time, be
advanced by the Company prior to the final disposition of such
claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding upon receipt by the
Company of a written undertaking by or on behalf of the Covered
Person to repay such amount to the extent that it shall be
subsequently determined that the Covered Person is not entitled to
be indemnified as authorized in this Section, and the Company and
its Affiliates shall have a continuing right of offset against such
Covered Person’s interests/investments in the Company and
such Affiliates and shall have the right to withhold amounts
otherwise distributable to such Covered Person to satisfy such
repayment obligation. If a Member institutes litigation against a
Covered Person which gives rise to an indemnity obligation
hereunder, such Member shall be responsible, up to the amount of
such Member’s Interests and remaining Commitment, for such
Member’s pro rata share of the Company’s
expenses related to such indemnity obligation, as determined by the
Managing Member. The Company may purchase insurance, to the extent
available at reasonable cost, to cover losses, claims, damages or
liabilities covered by the foregoing indemnification provisions.
Members will not be personally obligated with respect to
indemnification pursuant to this Section 3.5(b).

Section 3.6 Representations of
Members . (a) Each Regular and Special Member by execution
of this Agreement (or by otherwise becoming bound by the terms and
conditions hereof as provided herein or in the LLC Act) represents
and warrants to every other Member and to the Company, except as
may be waived by the Managing Member, that he is acquiring each of
his Interests for his own account for investment and not with a
view to resell or distribute the same or any part thereof, and that
no other person has any interest in any such Interest or in the
rights of such Member hereunder; provided, that a Member may
choose to make transfers for estate and charitable planning
purposes (in accordance with the terms hereof). Each Regular and
Special Member represents and warrants that he understands that the
Interests have not been registered under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended from time to time, and therefore such Interests
may not be resold without registration under such Act or exemption
from such registration, and that accordingly such Member must bear
the economic risk of an investment in the Company for an indefinite
period of time. Each Regular and Special Member represents that he
has such knowledge and experience in financial and business
matters, that he is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of
an investment in the Company, and that he is able to bear the
economic risk of such investment. Each Regular and Special Member
represents that his overall commitment to the Company and other
investments which are not readily marketable is not
disproportionate to the Member’s net worth and the Member has
no need for liquidity in the Member’s investment in
Interests. Each Regular and Special Member represents that to the
full satisfaction of the Member, the Member has been furnished any
materials that he has requested relating to the Company and the
offering of Interests and has been afforded the opportunity to ask
questions of representatives of the Company concerning the terms
and conditions of the offering of Interests and any matters
pertaining thereto and to obtain any other additional information
relating thereto. Each Regular and Special Member represents that
the Member has consulted to the extent deemed appropriate by the
Member with the Member’s own advisors as to the financial,
tax, legal and related matters concerning an investment in
Interests and on that basis believes that an investment in the
Interests is suitable and appropriate for the Member.

(b) Each Regular and Special Member
agrees that the representations and warranties contained in
paragraph (a) above shall be true and correct as of any date
that such Member makes a capital contribution to the Company, and
such Member hereby agrees that such capital contribution shall
serve as confirmation thereof.

(c) Each Regular or Special Member
certifies that (A) if such Member is a United States person
(as defined in Section 7701 of the Code) (x) such
Member’s name, social security number (or, if applicable,
employer identification numb

representative, agent or advisor of the Partnership or any of its
affiliates (individually, a “ Covered Person ”
and collectively, the “ Covered Persons ”) shall
be liable to the Partnership or any other Partner for any act or
omission (in relation to the Partnership, this Agreement, any
related document or
 

13
 

any transaction or investment
contemplated hereby or thereby) taken or omitted by a Covered
Person (other than any act or omission constituting Cause), unless
there is a final and non-appealable judicial determination and/or
determination of an arbitrator that such Covered Person did not act
in good faith and in what such Covered Person reasonably believed
to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Partnership
and within the authority granted to such Covered Person by this
Agreement, and, with respect to any criminal act or proceeding, had
reasonable cause to believe that such Covered Person’s
conduct was unlawful. Each Covered Person shall be entitled to rely
in good faith on the advice of legal counsel to the Partnership,
accountants and other experts or professional advisors, and no
action taken by any Covered Person in reliance on such advice shall

for its good faith reliance on the provisions of this Agreement.
The provisions of this Agreement, to the extent that they expand or
restrict the duties and liabilities of a Partner otherwise existing

indemnify and hold harmless (but only to the extent of the
Partnership’s assets (including, without limitation, the

against any and all claims, damages, losses, costs, expenses and
liabilities (including, without limitation, amounts paid in
satisfaction of judgments, in compromises and settlements, as fines
and penalties and legal or other costs and reasonable expenses of
investigating or defending against any claim or alleged claim),
joint and several, of any nature whatsoever, known or unknown,
liquidated or unliquidated (collectively, “ Losses
”), arising from any and all claims, demands, actions, suits
or proceedings, civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
in which the Covered Person may be involved, or threatened to be
involved, as a party or otherwise, by reason of such Covered
Person’s participation in the affairs of the Partnership or
which relate to or arise out of or in connection with the
Partnership, its property, its business or affairs (other than
claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings, civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of any act or omission
of such Covered Person constituting Cause); provided , that
a Covered Person shall not be entitled to indemnification under
this Section with respect to any claim, issue or matter if there is
a final and non-appealable judicial determination and/or
determination of an arbitrator that such Covered Person did not act
in good faith and in what such Covered Person reasonably believed
to be in, or not opposed to, the best interest of the Partnership
and within the authority granted to such Covered Person by this
Agreement, and, with respect to any criminal act or proceeding, had

conduct was unlawful; provided further , that if such
Covered Person is a Partner or a Withdrawn Partner, such Covered
Person shall bear its share of such Losses in accordance with such
Covered Person’s Profit Sharing Percentage in the Partnership
as of the time of the actions or omissions that gave rise to such
Losses. To the fullest extent permitted by law, expenses (including
legal fees) incurred by a Covered Person (including, without
limitation, the General Partner) in defending any claim, demand,
action, suit or proceeding may, with the approval of the General
Partner, from time to time, be advanced by the Partnership prior to
the final disposition of such claim, demand, action, suit or
proceeding upon receipt by the Partnership of a written undertaking
by or on behalf of the Covered Person to repay such amount to the
extent that it shall be subsequently determined that the Covered
Person is not entitled to be indemnified as authorized in this
Section, and the Partnership and its affiliates shall have a
continuing right of offset against such Covered Person’s
interests/investments in the Partnership and such affiliates and
shall have the right to withhold amounts otherwise distributable to
such Covered Person to satisfy such repayment obligation. If a
Partner institutes litigation against a Covered Person which gives
rise to an indemnity obligation hereunder, such Partner shall be
responsible, up to the amount of such Partner’s Interests and
remaining Commitment, for such Partner’s pro rata
share of the Partnership’s expenses related to such indemnity
obligation, as
 

14
 

determined by the General Partner. The
Partnership may purchase insurance, to the extent available at

ARTICLE IV

CAPITAL OF THE
PARTNERSHIP

4.1. Capital Contributions
by Partners . (a) Except as agreed by the Managing Member
and a Regular Member, such Limited Partner shall not be required to
make capital contributions to the Partnership at such times and in
such amounts as are required to fund the Required Amounts, as
determined by the General Partner from time to time; provided, that
(i) such additional capital contributions may be made pro rata
among the Limited Partners based upon the allocation of the Carried
Interest in each BREP International II Investment by the General
Partner and (ii) additional capital contributions in excess of
Required Amounts which are to be used for ongoing business
operations (as distinct from financing legal or other specific
liabilities of the Partnership) (including those specifically set
forth in Sections 4.1(d) and 5.8(d)); provided further, that the
General Partner may excuse any Nonvoting Limited Partner from
making capital contributions to fund Required Amounts as provided
in the books and records of the Partnership. Limited Partners
(other than Special Limited Partners) shall not be required to make
additional capital contributions to the Partnership except
(i) as a condition of an increase in such Limited
Partner’s Profit Sharing Percentage, or (ii) as
specifically set forth in this Agreement; provided, however, that
the General Partner and any Limited Partner (other than a Special
Limited Partner) may agree from time to time that such Limited
Partner shall make an additional capital contribution to the
Partnership; provided further, that each Investor Limited Partner
shall maintain its capital account at a level equal to the product
of (i) its Profit Sharing Percentage from time to time and
(ii) the total capital of the Partnership; provided further,
that the foregoing in no way limits any other provision of this
Agreement (including without limitation, Sections 5.8(d) and
(e) and 6.5) or of any written agreement between a Partner and
the Partnership or an affiliate thereof which requires the making
of any such additional capital contribution. If required by
applicable law, the maximum amount of capital a Limited Partner is
obligated to contribute to the Partnership shall be disclosed in a
Certificate filed in accordance with the Partnership Act; and
provided further, that the General Partner shall be required to
make a maximum capital contribution of (U.S.)$10. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the unfunded amount
 

15
 

of any Limited Partner’s
commitment to make capital contributions to the Partnership (such
Limited Partner’s “Unfunded Commitment”) may be
determined and redetermined by the General Partner from time to
time (including, without limitation, any redetermination that
results in a reduction in such Limited Partner’s Unfunded
Commitment, which reduction may be retroactive); provided, that
each Limited Partner agrees to make capital contributions in the
full amount of such Limited Partner’s Unfunded Commitment at
any time, on condition that the General Partner does not thereafter
make a redetermination that results in a reduction in such Limited
Partner’s Unfunded Commitment and subject to all other terms
and conditions set forth herein and/or in any other agreement
relating thereto; and provided further, that, following an initial
determination of a Limited Partner’s commitment such Limited
Partner’s Unfunded Commitment shall not be increased without
the consent of such Limited Partner. Any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, no capital contribution
shall become due and payable or be required to be made by any
Partner, unless and until it shall be called by the General Partner
for the purposes set forth herein or in the Commitment Agreement or
SMD Agreement of such Partner.

(b) Each capital contribution
by a Partner shall be credited to the appropriate capital account
of such Partner in accordance with Section 5.2.

(c) The General Partner may
elect on a case by case basis to (i) cause the Partnership to
loan any Partner (including any additional Partner admitted to the
Partnership pursuant to Section 6.1 but excluding any Partner
that is an executive officer of The Blackstone Group) the amount of
any capital contribution required to be made by such Partner or
(ii) permit any Partner (including any additional Partner
admitted to the Partnership pursuant to Section 6.1) to make a
required capital contribution to the Partnership in installments in
kind, in each case on terms (including valuation of contributed
property in the case of in kind contributions permitted by the
General Partner) determined by the General Partner.

(d) (i) The Partners and the
Withdrawn Partners have entered into the Trust Agreement, pursuant
to which certain amounts of the distributions relating to the
Carried Interest will be paid to the Trustee(s) for deposit in the
Trust Account (such amounts to be paid to the Trustee(s) for
deposit in the Trust Account constituting a “ Holdback
”). The General Partner shall determine, as set forth below,
the percentage of each distribution of Carried Interest that shall
be withheld for each Partner Category (such withheld percentage
constituting such Partner Category’s “ Holdback
Percentage ”). The applicable Holdback Percentages
initially shall be 15% for Existing Partners (other than the
General Partner), 0% for the Holdings, 21% for Retaining Withdrawn
Partners and 24% for Deceased Partners (the “ Initial
Holdback Percentages ”).

(ii) The Holdback Percentage
may not be reduced for any individual Partner as compared to the
other Partners in his Partner Category (except as provided in
clause (iv) below). The General Partner may only reduce the
Holdback Percentages among the Partner Categories on a
proportionate basis; provided, that the Holdback Percentage
applicable to Holdings may not be increased or decreased without
its consent. For example, if the Holdback Percentage for Existing
Partners is decreased to 12.5%, the Holdback Percentage for
Retaining Withdrawn Partners and Deceased Partners shall be reduced
to 17.5% and 20%, respectively. Any reduction in the Holdback
Percentage for any Partner shall apply only to distributions
relating to Carried Interest made after the date of such
reduction.

(iii) The Holdback Percentage
may not be increased for any individual Partner as compared to the
other Partners in his Partner Category (except as provided in
clause (iv) below). The General Partner may not increase the
Retaining Withdrawn Partners’ Holdback Percentage beyond 21%
unless the General Partner concurrently increases the Existing
Partners’ Holdback Percentage to 21%. The General Partner may
not increase the Deceased Partners’ Holdback
 

16
 


Percentage beyond 24% unless
the General Partner increases the Holdback Percentage for both
Existing Partners and Retaining Withdrawn Partners to 24%. The
General Partner may not increase the Holdback Percentage of any
Partner Category beyond 24% unless such increase applies equally to
all Partner Categories. Any increase in the Holdback Percentage for
any Partner shall apply only to distributions relating to Carried
Interest made after the date of such increase. The foregoing shall
in no way prevent the General Partner from proportionately
increasing the Holdback Percentage of any Partner Category
(following a reduction of the Holdback Percentages below the
Initial Holdback Percentages), if the resulting Holdback
Percentages are consistent with the above. For example, if the
General Partner reduces the Holdback Percentages for Existing
Partners, Retaining Withdrawn Partners and Deceased Partners to
12.5%, 17.5% and 20%, respectively, the General Partner shall have
the right to subsequently increase the Holdback Percentages to the
Initial Holdback Percentages.

(iv) (A) Notwithstanding
anything contained herein to the contrary, the Partnership may
increase or decrease the Holdback Percentage for any Partner in any
Partner Category (in such capacity, the “ Subject
Partner ”) pursuant to a majority vote of the Special
Limited Partners and of the special limited partners of BRE
Associates (a “ Holdback Vote ”); provided,
that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
the Holdback Percentage applicable to the General Partner shall not
be increased or decreased without its prior written consent;
provided further , that a Subject Partner’s
Holdback Percentage shall not be (I) increased prior to such
time as such Subject Partner (x) is notified by the
Partnership of the decision to increase such Subject
Partner’s Holdback Percentage and (y) has, if requested
by such Subject Partner, been given 30 days to gather and provide
information to the Partnership for consideration before a second
Holdback Vote (requested by the Subject Partner) and (II) decreased
unless such decrease occurs subsequent to an increase in a Subject
Partner’s Holdback Percentage pursuant to a Holdback Vote
under this clause (iv); provided further , that such
decrease shall not exceed an amount such that such Subject
Partner’s Holdback Percentage is less than the prevailing
Holdback Percentage for such Subject Partner’s Partner
Category; provided further , that a Partner or a
special limited partner of BRE Associates shall not vote to
increase a Subject Partner’s Holdback Percentage unless such
voting partner determines, in his good faith judgment, that the
facts and circumstances indicate that it is reasonably likely that
such Subject Partner, or any of his successors or assigns
(including his estate or heirs) who at the time of such vote holds
the Partnership interest or otherwise has the right to receive
distributions relating thereto, will not be capable of satisfying
any Recontribution Amounts that may become due.

 


 
(B)
A Holdback Vote shall take place at a Partnership meeting,
which shall also include the special limited partners of BRE
Associates. Each Special Limited Partner or special limited partner
of BRE Associates shall be entitled to cast one vote with respect
to the Holdback Vote regardless of such Special Limited
Partner’s interest in the Partnership or special limited
partner of BRE Associates’ interest in BRE Associates, as the
case may be. Such vote may be cast by any such Special Limited
Partner or special limited partner in person or by
proxy.



 


 
(C)

If the result
of the second Holdback Vote is an increase in a Subject
Partner’s Holdback Percentage, such Subject Partner may
submit the decision to an arbitrator, the identity of which is
mutually agreed upon by both the Subject Partner and the
Partnership; provided , that if the Partnership and the
Subject Partner cannot agree upon a mutually satisfactory
arbitrator



 

17
 



 

within 10 days of the
second Holdback Vote, each of the Partnership and the Subject
Partner shall request its candidate for arbitrator to select a
third arbitrator satisfactory to such candidates; provided
further , that if such candidates fail to agree upon a
mutually satisfactory arbitrator within 30 days of such request,
the then sitting President of the American Arbitration Association
shall unilaterally select the arbitrator. Each Subject Partner that
submits the decision of the Partnership pursuant to the second
Holdback Vote to arbitration and the Partnership shall estimate
their reasonably projected out-of-pocket expenses relating thereto
and each such party shall, to the satisfaction of the arbitrator
and prior to any determination being made by the arbitrator, pay
the total of such estimated expenses (i.e., both the Subject
Partner’s and the Partnership’s expenses) into an
escrow account to be controlled by Simpson Thacher &
Bartlett LLP, as escrow agent (or such other comparable law firm as
the Partnership and Subject Partner shall agree). The arbitrator
shall direct the escrow agent to pay out of such escrow account all
expenses associated with such arbitration (including costs leading
thereto) and to return to the “victorious” party the
entire amount of funds such party paid into such escrow account. If
the amount contributed to the escrow account by the losing party is
insufficient to cover the expenses of such arbitration, such
“losing” party shall then provide any additional funds
necessary to cover such costs to such “victorious”
party. For purposes hereof, the “victorious” party
shall be the Partnership, if the Holdback Percentage ultimately
determined by the arbitrator is closer to the percentage determined
in the second Holdback Vote than it is to the prevailing Holdback
Percentage for the Subject Partner’s Partner Category;
otherwise, the Subject Partner shall be the
“victorious” party. The party that is not the
“victorious” party shall be the “losing”
party.




 


 
(D)
In the event of a decrease in a Subject Partner’s
Holdback Percentage (1) pursuant to a Holdback Vote under this
clause (iv) or (2) pursuant to a decision of an
arbitrator under paragraph (C) of this clause (iv), the
Partnership shall release and distribute to such Subject Partner
any Trust Amounts (and the Trust Income thereon (except as
expressly provided herein with respect to using Trust Income as
Firm Collateral)) which exceed the required Holdback of such
Subject Partner (in accordance with such Subject Partner’s
reduced Holdback Percentage) as though such reduced Holdback
Percentage had applied since the increase of the Subject
Partner’s Holdback Percentage pursuant to a previous Holdback
Vote under this clause (iv).



(v) (A) If a Partner’s
Holdback Percentage exceeds 15% (such percentage in excess of 15%
constituting the “ Excess Holdback Percentage
”), such Partner may satisfy the portion of his Holdback
obligation in respect of his Excess Holdback Percentage (such
portion constituting such Partner’s “ Excess
Holdback ”), and such Partner (or a Withdrawn Partner
with respect to amounts contributed to the Trust Account while he
was a Partner), to the extent his
 

18
 


Excess Holdback obligation
has previously been satisfied in cash, may obtain the release of
the Trust Amounts (but not the Trust Income thereon which shall
remain in the Trust Account and allocated to such Partner or
Withdrawn Partner) satisfying such Partner’s or Withdrawn
Partner’s Excess Holdback obligation, by pledging or
otherwise making available to the Partnership, on a first priority
basis (except as provided below), all or any portion of his Firm
Collateral in satisfaction of his Excess Holdback obligation. Any
Partner seeking to satisfy all or any portion of the Excess
Holdback utilizing Firm Collateral shall sign such documents and
otherwise take such other action as is necessary or appropriate (in
the good faith judgment of the General Partner) to perfect a first
priority security interest in, and otherwise assure the ability of
the Partnership to realize on (if required), such Firm Collateral;
provided , that in the case of entities listed on
Partnership’s books and records, in which Partners/members
are permitted to pledge their interests therein to finance all or a
portion of their capital contributions thereof (“
Pledgable Blackstone Interests ”), to the extent a
first priority security interest is unavailable because of an
existing lien on such Firm Collateral, the Partner or Withdrawn
Partner seeking to utilize such Firm Collateral shall grant the
Partnership a second priority security interest therein in the
manner provided above; provided further , that
(x) to the extent that neither a first priority nor a second
priority security interest in Pledgable Blackstone Interests is
available, or (y) if the General Partner otherwise determines
in its good faith judgment that a security interest in Firm
Collateral (and the corresponding documents and actions) are not
necessary or appropriate, the Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall
(in the case of either clause (x) or (y) above)
irrevocably instruct in writing the relevant partnership, limited
liability company or other entity listed on Exhibit A to remit any
and all net proceeds resulting from a Firm Collateral Realization
on such Firm Collateral to the Trustee(s) as more fully provided in
clause (B) below. The Partnership shall, at the request of any
Partner or Withdrawn Partner, assist such Partner or Withdrawn
Partner in taking such action necessary to enable such Partner or
Withdrawn Partner to use Firm Collateral as provided
hereunder.

 


 
(B)
If upon a sale or other realization of all or any portion of
any Firm Collateral (a “ Firm Collateral Realization
”), the remaining Firm Collateral is insufficient to cover
any Partner’s or Withdrawn Partner’s Excess Holdback
requirement, then up to 100% of the net proceeds otherwise
distributable to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner from such Firm
Collateral Realization (including distributions subject to the
repayment of financing sources as in the case of Pledgable
Blackstone Interests) shall be paid into the Trust Account to fully
satisfy such Excess Holdback requirement (allocated to such Partner
or Withdrawn Partner) and shall be deemed to be Trust Amounts for
purposes hereunder. Any net proceeds from such Firm Collateral
Realization in excess of the amount necessary to satisfy such
Excess Holdback requirement shall be distributed to such Partner or
Withdrawn Partner.



 


 
(C)

Upon any
valuation or revaluation of Firm Collateral that results in a
decreased valuation of such Firm Collateral so that such Firm
Collateral is insufficient to cover any Partner’s or
Withdrawn Partner’s Excess Holdback requirement (including
upon a Firm Collateral Realization, if net proceeds therefrom and
the remaining Firm Collateral are insufficient to cover any
Partner’s or Withdrawn Partner’s Excess Holdback
requirement), the Partnership shall provide notice of the foregoing
to such



 

19
 



 

Partner or Withdrawn
Partner and such Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall, within 30 days
of receiving such notice, contribute cash (or additional Firm
Collateral) to the Trust Account in an amount necessary to satisfy
his Excess Holdback requirement. If any such Partner or Withdrawn
Partner defaults upon his obligations under this clause (C), then
Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall apply thereto; provided , that
the first sentence of Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be deemed
inapplicable to a default under this clause (C); provided
further , that for purposes of applying
Section 5.8(d)(ii) to a default under this clause (C):
(1) the term “Defaulting Party” where such term
appears in such Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as
“defaulting party” for purposes hereof and (2) the
terms “Net Recontribution Amount” and
“Recontribution Amount” where such terms appear in such
Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as the amount due
pursuant to this clause (C).




(vi) Any Partner or Withdrawn
Partner may (i) obtain the release of any Trust Amounts (but
not the Trust Income thereon which shall remain in the Trust
Account and allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) or Firm
Collateral, in each case, held in the Trust Account for the benefit
of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner or (ii) require the
Partnership to distribute all or any portion of amounts otherwise
required to be placed in the Trust Account (whether cash or Firm
Collateral), by obtaining a letter of credit for the benefit of the
Trustee(s) (an “ L/C ”) in such amounts. Any
Partner or Withdrawn Partner choosing to furnish an L/C to the
Trustee(s) (in such capacity, an “ L/C Partner
”) shall deliver to the Trustee(s) an unconditional and
irrevocable L/C from a commercial bank whose (A) short-term
deposits are rated at least A-1 by S&P and P-1 by Moody’s
(if the L/C is for a term of 1 year or less), or (B) long-term
deposits are rated at least A+ by S&P or A1 by Moody’s
(if the L/C is for a term of 1 year or more) (each a “
Required Rating ”). If the relevant rating of the
commercial bank issuing such L/C drops below the relevant Required
Rating, the L/C Partner shall supply to the Trustee(s), within 30
days of such occurrence, a new L/C from a commercial bank whose
relevant rating is at least equal to the relevant Required Rating,
in lieu of the insufficient L/C. In addition, if the L/C has a term
expiring on a date earlier than the latest possible termination
date of BREP International II, the Trustee(s) shall be permitted to
drawdown on such L/C if the L/C Partner fails to provide a new L/C
from a commercial bank whose relevant rating is at least equal to
the relevant Required Rating, at least 30 days prior to the stated
expiration date of such existing L/C. The Trustee(s) shall notify
an L/C Partner 10 days prior to drawing on any L/C. The Trustee(s)
may (as directed by the Partnership in the case of clause
(1) below) draw down on an L/C only if (1) such a
drawdown is necessary to satisfy an L/C Partner’s obligation
relating to the Partnership’s obligations under the Clawback
Provisions or (2) an L/C Partner has not provided a new L/C
from a commercial bank whose relevant rating is at least equal to
the relevant Required Rating (or the requisite amount of cash
and/or Firm Collateral (to the extent permitted hereunder)), at
least 30 days prior to the stated expiration of an existing L/C in
accordance with this clause (vi). The Trustee(s), as directed by
the Partnership, shall return to any L/C Partner his L/C upon
(1) termination of the Trust Account and satisfaction of the
Partnership’s obligations, if any, in respect of the Clawback
Provisions, (2) an L/C Partner satisfying his entire Holdback
obligation in cash and Firm Collateral (to the extent permitted
hereunder), or (3) the release, by the Trustee(s), as directed
by the Partnership, of all amounts in the Trust Account to Partners
or Withdrawn Partners. If an L/C Partner satisfies a portion of his
Holdback obligation in cash and/or Firm Collateral (to the extent
permitted hereunder) or if the Trustee(s), as directed by the
Partnership, release a portion of the amounts in the Trust Account
to the Partners or Withdrawn
 

20
 


Partners in the Partner
Category of such L/C Partner, an L/C Partner’s L/C may be
reduced by an amount corresponding to such portion satisfied in
cash and/or Firm Collateral (to the extent permitted hereunder) or
such portion released by the Trustee(s), as directed by the
Partnership; provided , that in no way shall the general
release of any Trust Income cause an L/C Partner to be permitted to
reduce the amount of an L/C by any amount.

(vi) (A) Any in-kind
distributions by the Partnership relating to Carried Interest shall
be made in accordance herewith as though such distributions
consisted of cash. The Partnership may direct the Trustee(s) to
dispose of any in-kind distributions held in the Trust Account at
any time. The net proceeds therefrom shall be treated as though
initially contributed to the Trust Account.

 


 
(B)
In lieu of the foregoing, any Existing Partner may pledge with
respect to any in-kind distribution the Special Firm Collateral
referred to in asset category 9 in the Partnership’s books
and records; provided , that the initial contribution of
such Special Firm Collateral shall initially equal 130% of the
required Holdback Amount for a period of 90 days, and thereafter
shall equal at least 115% of the required Holdback Amount.
Paragraphs 4.1(d)(viii)(C) and (D) shall apply to such Special
Firm Collateral. To the extent such Special Firm Collateral exceeds
the applicable minimum percentage of the required Holdback Amount
specified in the first sentence of this clause (vii)(B), the
related Partner may obtain a release of such excess amount from the
Trust Account.



(viii) (A) Any Partner or
Withdrawn Partner may satisfy all or any portion of his Holdback
(excluding any Excess Holdback), and such Partner or a Withdrawn
Partner may, to the extent his Holdback (excluding any Excess
Holdback) has been previously satisfied in cash or by the use of an
L/C as provided herein, obtain a release of Trust Amounts (but not
the Trust Income thereon which shall remain in the Trust Account
and allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) that satisfy
such Partner’s or Withdrawn Partner’s Holdback
(excluding any Excess Holdback) by pledging to the Trustee(s) on a
first priority basis all of his Special Firm Collateral in a
particular Qualifying Fund, which at all times must equal or exceed
the amount of the Holdback distributed to the Partner or Withdrawn
Partner (as more fully set forth below). Any Partner seeking to
satisfy such Partner’s Holdback utilizing Special Firm
Collateral shall sign such documents and otherwise take such other
action as is necessary or appropriate (in the good faith judgment
of the General Partner) to perfect a first priority security
interest in, and otherwise assure the ability of the Trustee(s) to
realize on (if required), such Special Firm Collateral.

 


 
(B)

If upon a
distribution, withdrawal, sale, liquidation or other realization of
all or any portion of any Special Firm Collateral (a “
Special Firm Collateral Realization ”), the remaining
Special Firm Collateral (which shall not include the amount of Firm
Collateral that consists of a Qualifying Fund and is being used in
connection with an Excess Holdback) is insufficient to cover any
Partner’s or Withdrawn Partner’s Holdback (when taken
together with other means of satisfying the Holdback as provided
herein (i.e., cash contributed to the Trust Account or an L/C in
the Trust Account)), then up to 100% of the net proceeds otherwise
distributable to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner from
such



 

21
 



 

Special Firm Collateral
Realization (which shall not include the amount of Firm Collateral
that consists of a Qualifying Fund and is being used in connection
with an Excess Holdback) shall be paid into the Trust (and
allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) to fully satisfy
such Holdback and shall be deemed thereafter to be Trust Amounts
for purposes hereunder. Any net proceeds from such Special Firm
Collateral Realization in excess of the amount necessary to satisfy
such Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback) shall be distributed
to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner. To the extent a Qualifying
Fund distributes Securities to a Partner or Withdrawn Partner in
connection with a Special Firm Collateral Realization, such Partner
or Withdrawn Partner shall be required to promptly fund such
Partner’s or Withdrawn Partner’s deficiency with
respect to his Holdback in cash or an L/C.




 


 
(C)
Upon any valuation or revaluation of the Special Firm
Collateral and/or any adjustment in the Applicable Collateral
Percentage applicable to a Qualifying Fund, if such Partner’s
or Withdrawn Partner’s Special Firm Collateral valued at less
than such Partner’s Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback)
as provided in the books and records of the Partnership, taking
into account other permitted means of satisfying the Holdback
hereunder, the Partnership shall provide notice of the foregoing to
such Partner or Withdrawn Partner and, within 10 business days of
receiving such notice, such Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall
contribute cash or additional Special Firm Collateral to the Trust
Account in an amount necessary to make up such deficiency. If any
such Partner or Withdrawn Partner defaults upon his obligations
under this clause (C), then Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall apply
thereto; provided , that clause (A) of the first
sentence of Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be deemed inapplicable to
such default; provided further , that for purposes of
applying Section 5.8(d)(ii) to a default under this clause
(C): (I) the term “Defaulting Par
