Tampon Tribe is changing the way women buy tampons and pads

CREDIT: Getty Images










You probably have heard of the Dollar Shave Club, but did you know there is something similar for feminine hygiene products? It turns out that the average woman uses 9,600 tampons in her lifetime (adding up to $5,600 worth of feminine hygiene products). This is one reason why New York City now offers free menstrual products in all public schools, shelters and jails and has carved out a sales tax exemption for tampons for everyone. Tampons are expensive and not exactly "optional." But even these tampons are manufactured with bleaches and other toxic chemicals, and the average box of organic tampons retails for about twice what conventionally produced tampons sell for - putting them out of reach for many.
Enter Tampon Tribe, the $8 per month 100% organic tampon and pad subscription service. It is disrupting this established industry by providing affordable feminine hygiene products that are toxin free, plastic free, and completely compostable. The products, according to founder Jennifer Eden, cost considerably less than anything similar and offer far superior quality.
Eden insists hers is not a company, but in fact "an energetic social impact project." As a result, the "company's" commitment to social good is impressive. Each purchase supports homeless women by providing a daily tampon pack for those in need, and a portion of each sale goes to Girls INC, a nonprofit organization dedicated to helping girls grow up "strong, smart and bold." The company is also committed to employing ex-felons and the homeless.
The following is an excerpt of Eden's interview with Inc.com.
Kate L. Harrison: How did you get the idea for your company? What was the need and how did you get to this solution?
Jennifer Eden: I came across the idea from both a personal health and a convenience business point of view. First of all, every woman in the world runs out of tampons each month, even if you've had your period since you were 12. It just happens. You run out and then you're rushing to the store under stress, or you're getting your partner to rush to the store to buy you tampons.
My first idea was to simply create the 'Dollar Shave Club' for tampons. Tampons are an essential item for 70% of women in the U.S. I thought, "Wouldn't it be great if they just arrived at my front door every month?"
The more reading I did, the more I realized there were other issues to be addressed, like toxic shock syndrome, and environmental impact. Our search for materials changed as we segued over to the organic components, especially certified organic cotton. I thought, "Wouldn't it be great if we could do this with organic products and still keep the price low enough?" We're still looking at a 55% profit margin relative to our costs, and that's only at low purchasing levels.
Secondly, health reasons became important to us. On a personal level, I went through a health situation myself. Many of my friends had been touched in some way by cancer, which does actually hit one in two people in the world. We made a commitment to organic products as we became more concerned -- and more conscious -- about what we were putting into our body or allowing to touch our skin. This focus on health helped us move forward in our business.
Then I thought, "How can we create a business that is more inclusive?" I wanted to create a great ecosphere of people who want to get involved with our charitable endeavors. In this way, I hoped to create this great tribe of people who want to give back -- and we have. We're quite different from anyone else in the market, in that aspect as well. People want to get on board become a part of Tampon Tribe. They want to wear the t-shirt. They want people to talk about tampons. They don't want this common feminine product to be a taboo anymore. It's something we should have out in the open more, to reduce self-consciousness and body shaming.
Harrison: How are you funded?
Eden​: We are currently doing an equity crowdfunding raise on WeFunder: wefunder.com/tampontribe. Tampon Tribe is a community, as well as a very viable business. It empowers women and adds to the organic feminine hygiene market in a significant way. We wanted to enable investment opportunities for both accredited and non-accredited investors, so we decided to go with crowdfunding. It's changing the landscape of investment.
Harrison: How does it work?
Eden​: Think Dollar Shave Club for 100% certified organic cotton tampons and pads that are also plastic-free and completely biodegradable and compostable. Selections are customizable: new customers sign up for a subscription, make their selection from either 4 sizes of tampons, in any 16-tampon box configuration, or opt for pads day/night. First month orders arrive in a cute burlap bag, designed to be original and attractive. Monthly refills arrive in recycled paper. For every month ordered, we give a Period Pack to a homeless woman: 2 tampons, 2 pads, a feminine wipe and biodegradable waste bag. A user account is created where Tribe members can adjust/pause/add to their monthly order.
Harrison: What's in it for consumers?
Eden​: Everything! Most importantly, our Tribe members have access to organic feminine hygiene products that are usually expensive and hard to find, or not available at all. We believe that every woman has the right to choose organic products for her body, regardless of her income, so our monthly cost of $8 includes delivery to your door. We are also passionate about completely eliminating plastics from feminine hygiene products. Our applicators are a thin smooth cardboard tube, the tampons are wrapped in recycled paper, pads are wrapped in a starch-film and the adhesive is a biopolymer. We will also be incorporating a strong social-impact employment mission that includes adults in retraining programs, older workers, vets, and intellectually-challenged adults. We know that we can really make a significant contribution to our society, and that our company will be strong and complete with a diverse team.
Harrison: How is it going?
Pontes: Our first month went great, with presales reaching almost $6,000, which we are really excited about. We are also on track to meet our delivery schedule. We are now crowdfunding our Friends and Family equity round on WeFunder. We hit our first target in our first week, and have moved up now to Tier 2!
Harrison: What has been your biggest challenge?
Eden​: Balancing everything that needs to be done in a bootstrap startup! From meeting investors to building our brand, attending events, growing corporate sales and relations, to fundraising -- it's a fast-paced exciting time.
Harrison: Any early lessons for other founders?
Eden: Listen closely to people in your target market , and segue when needed. Our pre-sale push saw us adjust our product mix to meet demand, and also incorporate a more immediate give-back so we can have a greater impact on the ground. Both of these moves were strategic decisions that greatly enhanced what TamponTribe can now offer.

Feminine Hygiene is a $3 Billion Market in the U.S. Alone
The global market is worth $16 billion and is estimated to grow to $42 billion by 2022.

Tampons, pads, and other feminine hygiene products are essentials. Already, 70% of U.S. women say they use tampons every month and spend an average of $120 every year on pads and tampons.

How We're Different: 100% Cotton + Non-Toxic
Common, store-bought tampons contain toxins, perfumes, dyes and chemicals.

We did an experiment where we placed our tampons along with store-bought tampons into water. Our tampons stayed in-tact, they absorbed the liquid and you could wring the liquid out. But the storebought tampons broke up and released fibers everywhere. The same thing could happen inside of a woman's body—which is why we create only the highest quality products.

Hear From Our Customers
Customers love high-quality products with their bodies and the environment in mind.




"Love Tampon Tribe for so many reasons! Their tampons are
100% certified organic cotton and toxic-free. No chemical
bleaches, no perfumes, dyes or yucky material in your most
sensitives area. All of their products and packaging are
manufactured sustainably made from recycled materials and compostable.”- My Faves Journal




"Organic tampons are so important to use! Cotton is the dirtiest crop we have, full of pesticides. 85% of tampons contain Monsanto's glyphosate. An ingredient in their Roundup herbicide that has been ruled a likely carcinogen by the World Health Organization. We demand organic food, skincare, even clothing, sheets & towels...why not tampons?" - Green with Tiffany




Hear From the Experts
Organic is the leading trend and personal hygiene is the next niche to tackle.




"Organic tampons represents the most promising breakthrough in recent times, which is generating significant market interest supported by rising concerns regarding synthetic tampons and the unsettling statistics of toxic shock syndrome (TSS) cases reported in the past."- Global Industry Analysts, Inc




"A 2015 study on the U.S. Organic Industry found that sales of organic non-food products, for 8% of the organic market, posted the biggest percentage gain in six years. Among non-food items, the survey showed that fiber and organic personal care items were the standout categories." - Non-Wovens Industry

                  What does Tampon Tribe do?
                  



Tampon Tribe is an online monthly subscription service for 100% certified organic, cotton tampons. They're toxic free, plastic free and completely compostable. We came into being to fill the very big void in the market that currently exists in terms of organic feminine hygiene. I started looking for organic products myself and realized that they're really hard to find and are extremely expensive.

Our mission is to disrupt the market and provide affordable access to organic feminine hygiene for women everywhere. In southern California, we can go to Whole Foods if we have the money and buy a couple of the options they have there, though they are limited. Many people don’t live near a Whole Foods or have $15 to $20 a month to spend on an organic product.




                  Tell us about your tampons and what makes them different.
                  



Our product is 100% organic cotton. It has a woven core so it doesn’t contain glues. No dyes. No toxins. No plastics. In addition to our mission of having women's bodies be as healthy and as toxic-free as possible, we're also concerned about the environment. Most women use plastic applicators on a tampon. They’ll use about 9,600 tampons in their lifetime. Multiply it by the millions of women in the U.S. that use regular tampons and that's a lot of plastic going into our waterways and our landfills. Plastic has a huge environmental impact.

We use a smooth, thin, cardboard applicator that is completely compostable. Our packaging is made with recycled paper. We don't use boxes in our packaging. When you subscribe to Tampon Tribe, your first order arrives in a burlap bag, designed to look nice and fit inside your bathroom cabinet, or on the shelf. Then, every month, you get a refill pack, in a recycled paper bag. You can select your combination online depending on what size tampon you need and what your flow is. You let us know ahead of time what you need for that month's delivery will be and that's what we send out for you. It's completely customizable and affordable. Our monthly subscription is $8, including shipping and includes 16 tampons. If you're going to a CVS, a comparable (but non-organic) product would be about the same price, $6.99 to $8.99.




                  Can you take us back to the beginning? How did you get started?
                  



I came across the idea from both a personal health and a convenient business point of view. First of all, every woman in the world runs out of tampons every month, even if you've had your period since you were 12. It just happens. You run out and you're always rushing to the store or you're getting your partner to rush to the store to buy you tampons. My first idea was to create the Dollar Shave Club of tampons. Tampons are an essential item for 70% of women in the U.S. I thought “Wouldn't it be great if you just arrived at my front door every month?”The more reading I did, the more I realized and came to find out about toxic shock syndrome, and about the environmental impact. Our search changed a little bit and segued over to the organic and the certified organic cotton. I thought, "Wouldn't it be great if we could do this with organic products and still keep the price low?" We're still looking at a 55% profit margin on our costs and that's only at low purchasing levels. Secondly, health reasons came into it. From a personal level, I went through a health situation myself. As I started to speak to more and more of my friends who had been touched in some way by, normally, cancer, which does actually hit one in two people in this world, we start, then, looking more toward organic products and being a lot more conscious about what we put into our body or touches our skin. Those two things combined to move forward with the business. Then I thought, "How can we create a business that is more inclusive?" A business that creates this great ecosphere of people, people who want to get involved with our charitable aspects and get involved with our giving back and create this great tribe. We're quite different from anyone else on the market, in that aspect as well. People want to get on board and just be part of Tampon Tribe. They want to wear the t-shirt. They want people to talk about tampons. They don't want this to be a taboo anymore. It's a product that pretty much everyone either buys or buys for someone else or knows someone who needs it. It's something we should have out a bit more in the open.



                  Who are your customers?
                  



Our product resonates with different consumers. Some people just want the convenience. Some people are really keen on the organic aspect and some people want the toxic free, environmental aspect of it. We find it also resonates really well with men, anyone who is a dad. As soon as you talk about the toxins, they want to sign up their daughters and their wives and their sisters and everything. We’re talking about a $16 billion global expected to grow to $42 billion in less than ten years. Most women spend between $6 to $10 a month on their feminine hygiene products, some more when you look at the average. A cheap bag of tampax is still about $5 or $6. Then, you buy some pads to go with it or something like that. For organic, you go to Whole Foods, there are a couple of options, but limited in terms of their size and they don't have applicators, they can range from $8.99 up.



                  Who are your competitors?
                  



Online, there are about four companies who are our competitors. The main competitor is a company called My Lola. They do cotton tampons and they've got plastic applicators and plastic packaging. They don't have that tribe mentality. It's just a product. They’re a little more expensive, as well. There are a couple of other organic cotton products but they're very expensive and they don't deliver monthly. Ours is a $8 price point. Theirs is about $15, $12, $20 and then, they're very heavily packaged. They're targeting the executive market, which, of course, is our market as well but we want to target everybody. We don't need someone that needs to spend $20 a month on their feminine hygiene. We come in at an affordable level and we tick all the boxes when it comes to organic, toxic free, and, of course, we want people to feel like they want to be part of Tampon Tribe. It's like Dollar Shave Club, people want to be part of a club.



                  How do you differentiate from the competitors?
                  



We're coming into the market with a wider range of product. We don't just do tampons. We're also doing pads. As I found out, a lot of people don't use tampons, so we're also coming up with a range of feminine hygiene, which will be really exciting because there are no subscription feminine hygiene pads on the market whatsoever.We’re all about protecting our bodies and the environment and being convenient, as well. Like Dollar Shave Club, you get your little razors in a small bag and you use them. Ours is the same. You get a refill each month rather than getting brand new packaging every month and you get to use your original packaging. That's a differentiator.We also come under other subscription prices. My Lola is $9 a month for their basic product which is not organic. Kali Box is about $14.99.



                  What do you understand that your competitors don’t get?
                  



A lot of tampons are made with a range of different materials, like a synthetic rayon. They contain chlorine bleach. Chlorine has dioxin, which has been directly linked to cervical cancer. They have perfumes and dyes in them and the cotton has not been grown in an organic way, which means that the GMO's or any of the fertilizers in the soil come into your body. Toxic shock is a real thing. We like to do a little test. If you put the tampons inside water, ours is cotton so it just absorbs the liquid and you can squeeze it out, not that you would do this with a tampon! None of the fibers come off. With a more generic tampon, the fibers actually break off. They stay in the woman's body. If they have a toxin in it, they may cause toxic shock. I've met a few people that have reached out to me over the course of the last few months asking or letting me know their story where they had gotten toxic shock from tampons. One of them is a model from Venice and she lost her leg. People have had hysterectomies at 13. We don't like to market the scary side to much because we don't want to scare into purchasing. At the same token, there's a very real health risk in putting products in or on your body that has chemicals and toxins.



                  Why is the subscription model right for tampons and other feminine hygiene products?
                  



The subscription model has been proven with Dollar Shave Club and the one billion dollar buyout very recently. Unilever just bought Seventh Generation. That's showing a shift and a recognition of organic cleaning products and household products. It's a big recognition that larger companies are starting to acquire these more grassroots, organic, green companies. We've received a lot of positive feedback about the fact that our product is organic, compostable, and without plastic. A lot of people don't know about the other subscription services yet. It's all too new. We're going to come in with a better product, with better prices, and with a better strategy to be able to dominate that sector.



                  Tell us about your production process.
                  



We're producing out of Europe. Our manufacturing partner is ICEA-certified, which means ethically produced and organic, every single part of the production process has to meet really strict European standards. The standards in Europe are a lot higher that the standards in America. In terms of ethics, it means that they can't overuse water in the process. They can't put any chemicals or fertilizers on the product. They have a quick turnaround, as well.



                  How do you acquire customers?
                  



At the moment, we're in pre-launch. We've managed to build up all of our mailing lists and all of our followers by, mainly, social media. This is where you find the people who are passionate about health, fitness, organics, the environment. We’ve reached out to the influencers in the health and fitness industry, the women's business industry, the women's empowerment groups. We've got quite a few of them on board that are very happy to support us. People are very keen to get behind us because of all the different aspects and the boxes that we tick. In terms of a breakdown of customer acquisition we're relying more on viral marketing, influencers, and social media. Most of our customers are online and using social media. They're very active on Facebook and Instagram. We've also been approached by quite a few of these gift box services. We can partner with them by putting our products in their monthly gift boxes.



                  What ideas do you have for growth in the next 3 months? 12 months?
                  



At the moment, we're working with a 56% margin but we know we can get that higher into the 60%, 65% as soon as our units go up past 10,000. The other market we're going to tackle are large, corporate health organizations. For example, Equinox is a gym. They have tampons in all of their bathrooms across America. And we have just partnered with Yoga Works. This not only increases our sales but increases our marketing outreach because people will see Tampon Tribe everywhere and associate that with yoga, with the Equinox, with 24-hour fitness, with anything to do with health. Then, you've got the corporate market. Most companies now are starting to put feminine hygiene in the bathroom for women. We want to make sure that Tampon Tribe is there. I think that's another area in term of business that we're going into that our competitors don't look at.



                  Why will you win?
                  



First and foremost, we're creating a little bit more than just a business. We keep people involved at every level. A lot of people want to support the green, individual, smaller business. They don't want to support Proctor and Gamble. That's our market. We're looking at one to five percent of the entire market who have already converted to the organic sphere. We also have a social outreach side. We've just partnered with Girls Inc as our first charitable partner. We want to be able to help change people's lives by partnering with charities who change young girls and boys lives for the better. We’ve also been working these past few months on our Period Pack Project where we get feminine hygiene products to women on our streets.In terms of our employment strategy, we are looking at partnering with organizations in LA., such as Chrysalis, who do retraining programs. We’re also focusing on hiring veterans who are often under-utilized. Special needs adults will also help make our team complete.We have a holistic view of everything we do. We're completely transparent and when it comes to people who are buying and purchasing in this sector, that's important to them. They buy ethically.



                  What’s been your largest challenge so far? Why are you raising money now?
                  



My biggest concern is having enough inventory, and that's why we're looking for funding. We know the demand can grow quickly. We know that once it's out there and in the sorority with young women, we can explode. But we don’t want to have 50,000 orders and no inventory to fulfill them. We’re going to use this fundraise to bolster our production and scale.
