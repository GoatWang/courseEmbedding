Ramius and Margate Capital Form Strategic Partnership to Launch Long 
      Short Equity Strategy




Samantha Greenberg, Veteran of Paulson & Co. and Goldman Sachs 
      Founds Margate Capital






April 12, 2016 08:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Ramius LLC (“Ramius”), the global investment management business of 
      Cowen Group, Inc. (“Cowen”) (Nasdaq:COWN), today announced a partnership 
      with Samantha Greenberg's newly-launched Margate Capital (“Margate”). 
      Margate, a multi-sector equity long/short alternative asset manager, 
      will leverage the institutional infrastructure and operational expertise 
      of Ramius, which is providing seed capital to the new venture.
    


      Founded this year, Margate will pursue a fundamental long/short equity 
      strategy emphasizing catalysts and sector themes and will deploy a 
      rules-based risk approach to protect capital and reduce volatility. 
      Samantha Greenberg is the Managing Partner and Chief Investment Officer 
      of Margate, a woman-owned investment management business. Before she 
      founded Margate, Ms. Greenberg served as partner and media/consumer 
      sector head on the investment team of Paulson & Co. Inc., where she 
      managed equity investments in media, cable, consumer discretionary and 
      staples sectors from 2009-16. Ms. Greenberg previously worked in Goldman 
      Sachs’ Special Situations Group and at Chilton Investment Company 
      investing in TMT and consumer industries. Ms. Greenberg has been named 
      to the Hedge Fund Journal/Ernst & Young’s “50 Leading Women in 
      Hedge Funds.” She holds an MBA from Stanford University’s Graduate 
      School of Business and a B.S. in Economics, summa cum laude, with 
      dual concentration in Finance and Strategic Management, from the Wharton 
      School of the University of Pennsylvania.
    

      “We are excited to partner with Ramius, whose track record of 
      successfully identifying and supporting emerging managers makes them the 
      ideal strategic partner for Margate,” said Ms. Greenberg. “We are 
      fortunate to benefit from Ramius’ expertise and capital, and our 
      seasoned investment team looks forward to providing investors with our 
      disciplined catalyst-focused absolute return strategy.”
    

      Michael Singer, Chief Executive Officer of Ramius said, "Samantha has 
      proven herself an astute and skilled investor, and we believe her 
      talents are well-suited to markets where alpha generation is in short 
      supply. As Samantha's partner, we are committed to doing everything we 
      can to build a successful business together. We believe that Samantha’s 
      formidable investment skills and talents will benefit our institutional 
      and high net worth clients worldwide."
    

      Margate will initially manage proprietary capital for Cowen and will 
      launch a commingled product in coming months.

Ramius and Margate Capital to launch long/short equity strategy

Launches & Fundraising











Investment manager Ramius has partnered with Samantha Greenberg's newly-launched Margate Capital, a multi-sector equity long/short alternative asset manager. Ramius is providing seed capital to the new joint-venture.
Founded this year, Margate will pursue a fundamental long/short equity strategy emphasising catalysts and sector themes and will deploy a rules-based risk approach to protect capital and reduce volatility. Greenberg is the Managing Partner and Chief Investment Officer of Margate, a woman-owned investment management business. Before she founded Margate, Greenberg served as partner and media/consumer sector head on the investment team of Paulson & Co Inc, where she managed equity investments in media, cable, consumer discretionary and staples sectors from 2009-16. Greenberg previously worked in Goldman Sachs’ Special Situations Group and at Chilton Investment Company investing in TMT and consumer industries. Greenberg has been named to the Hedge Fund Journal/Ernst & Young’s “50 Leading Women in Hedge Funds.” She holds an MBA from Stanford University’s Graduate School of Business and a BS in Economics, summa cum laude, with dual concentration in Finance and Strategic Management, from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.
“We are excited to partner with Ramius, whose track record of successfully identifying and supporting emerging managers makes them the ideal strategic partner for Margate,” says Greenberg. “We are fortunate to benefit from Ramius’ expertise and capital, and our seasoned investment team looks forward to providing investors with our disciplined catalyst-focused absolute return strategy.”
Michael Singer, Chief Executive Officer of Ramius, says: "Samantha has proven herself an astute and skilled investor, and we believe her talents are well-suited to markets where alpha generation is in short supply. As Samantha's partner, we are committed to doing everything we can to build a successful business together. We believe that Samantha’s formidable investment skills and talents will benefit our institutional and high net worth clients worldwide."
Margate will initially manage proprietary capital for Cowen and will launch a commingled product in coming months.

Margate Capital Partners Fund LP SEC Filing Form D  4/2016, submited: 2016-10-07<< back to list of filingsForm DA filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) required for companies that are selling securities in reliance on a Regulation D exemption or Section 4(6) exemption provisions. 

Form D is a brief notice of a company's executive officers and stock promoters, in lieu of the regular reports required when no exemption under Regulation D exists. 

Form D must be filed no later than 15 days after the first sale of securities.

Form D is also known as the Notice of Sale of Securities and is a requirement under Regulation D, Section 4(6) and/or the Uniform Limited Offering Exemption of the Securities Exchange Act of 1933. 

This act, often referred to as the "truth in securities" law, requires that these registration forms, providing essential facts, are filed to disclose important information upon registration of a company's securities. This helps the SEC achieve the objectives of this act - requiring investors to receive significant information regarding securities offered and prohibiting fraud in the sale of the offered securities.

* This undertaking does not affect any limits Section 102(a) of the National Securities Markets
        Improvement Act of 1996 ("NSMIA") [Pub. L. No. 104-290, 110 Stat. 3416 (Oct. 11, 1996)] imposes on the ability of States to
        require information. As a result, if the securities that are the subject of this Form D are "covered securities" for purposes 
        of NSMIA, whether in all instances or due to the nature of the offering that is the subject of this Form D, States cannot
        routinely require offering materials under this undertaking or otherwise and can require offering materials only to the
        extent NSMIA permits them to do so under NSMIA's preservation of their anti-fraud authority.
