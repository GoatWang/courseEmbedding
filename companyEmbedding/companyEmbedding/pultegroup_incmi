	ITEM 2.06 MATERIAL IMPAIRMENTS









	On May 3, 2017, as further described in the press release discussed in Item 9.01 below and attached to this report, PulteGroup, Inc. (the “Company”) committed to a plan to sell select non-core and underutilized land parcels following a strategic review of its land portfolio. The Company determined that it will sell certain currently inactive land parcels, representing approximately 4,600 lots, and work to monetize two small communities representing an additional 400 lots. These land parcels are located in diverse geographic areas and no longer fit into the Company's strategic plans. The land parcels identified for sale include: land requiring significant additional development spend that would not yield suitable returns; land in excess of near-term need; and land entitled for certain product types that are inconsistent with the Company’s primary offerings. Actions required to complete the planned sales have been or will soon be initiated, but the timing of completing the dispositions is unknown. The Company will seek to redeploy the proceeds and related tax benefits from these dispositions into higher returning projects.









	As a consequence of its change in strategy with respect to the future use of these land parcels, the Company expects to recognize pretax impairment charges in the range of $95 million to $125 million in the second quarter ending June 30, 2017. The estimated fair values of these land parcels were generally based on comparisons to market comparable transactions, letters of intent, estimated future net cash flows discounted for inherent risk associated with each underlying asset, or similar information. The Company expects that the cash outflows, if any, required to complete the disposition of these assets will not be material.

	PULTEGROUP ANNOUNCES PLANS TO SELL SELECT NON-CORE ASSETS




	FOLLOWING A STRATEGIC REVIEW OF ITS LAND PORTFOLIO









	ATLANTA - May 8, 2017


	 - PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE: PHM) announced today that, following a recently completed thorough review of its land portfolio, the Company plans to dispose of select non-core and underutilized assets. Based on its review, the Company has determined it will sell certain currently inactive land parcels, representing approximately 4,600 lots, and work to monetize two small communities representing an additional 400 lots.




	“Since being named CEO last September, I have talked about making adjustments to our land strategy that are consistent with our goal of delivering higher returns over the housing cycle,” said Ryan Marshall, President and CEO. “Based on an analysis of our entire land portfolio, Company management, with the support of our Board of Directors, determined that by taking action on these specific land positions we can accelerate the realization of these long-term assets and related tax benefits. We will then seek to redeploy the resulting capital into higher returning projects consistent with our investment and land holding goals.”









	The Company's planned actions will add to the $425 million previously realized from its sale of certain non-core assets since 2011, as it seeks to drive greater asset efficiency and higher returns on invested capital. As a consequence of its change in strategy with respect to the future use of these land parcels, the Company expects to recognize a pre-tax impairment charge in the range of $95 million to $125 million in the second quarter ending June 30, 2017.









	The land positions identified for sale include: land requiring significant additional development spend that would not yield suitable returns; land in excess of near-term need; and land entitled for certain product types that are inconsistent with the Company’s primary offerings.









	"Selling these assets shortens the duration of our land pipeline and moves the Company toward its long-term goal of owning three years and optioning three years of lots," added Marshall.    "Having a shorter and more efficient land pipeline supports our efforts to generate better returns on invested capital over the housing cycle.” 














	Forward-Looking Statements




	This press release includes "forward-looking statements." These statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results, performance, prospects or opportunities, as well as those of the markets we serve or intend to serve, to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, these statements. You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate to matters of a strictly factual or historical nature and generally discuss or relate to forecasts, estimates or other expectations regarding future events. Generally, the words “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “project,” “may,” “can,” “could,” “might,” "should", “will” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, including statements related to the


























	impairment charge with respect to certain land parcels and the impacts or effects thereof, expected operating and performing results, planned transactions, planned objectives of management, future developments or conditions in the industries in which we participate and other trends, developments and uncertainties that may affect our business in the future.









	Such risks, uncertainties and other factors include, among other things: interest rate changes and the availability of mortgage financing; competition within the industries in which we operate; the availability and cost of land and other raw materials used by us in our homebuilding operations; the impact of any changes to our strategy in responding to the cyclical nature of the industry, including any changes regarding our land positions and the levels of our land spend; the availability and cost of insurance covering risks associated with our businesses; shortages and the cost of labor; weather related slowdowns; slow growth initiatives and/or local building moratoria; governmental regulation directed at or affecting the housing market, the homebuilding industry or construction activities; uncertainty in the mortgage lending industry, including revisions to underwriting standards and repurchase requirements associated with the sale of mortgage loans; the interpretation of or changes to tax, labor and environmental laws; economic changes nationally or in our local markets, including inflation, deflation, changes in consumer confidence and preferences and the state of the market for homes in general; legal or regulatory proceedings or claims; our ability to generate sufficient cash flow in order to successfully implement our capital allocation priorities; required accounting changes; terrorist acts and other acts of war; and other factors of national, regional and global scale, including those of a political, economic, business and competitive nature. See PulteGroup's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 and other public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) for a further discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties applicable to our businesses. We undertake no duty to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or changes in our expectations.

Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

* New home sales increase 0.8 percent in June. * May, April, March sales pace revised down. * Housing inventory rises 1.1 percent. By Lucia Mutikani. New U.S. single-family home sales increased in June as purchases in the West surged to a near 10-year high, but downward revisions to the sales pace for the prior three months pointed to a housing market that is struggling to gain momentum.

                                                    PulteGroup trims margin forecast on discounts, higher lumber prices

PulteGroup Inc (PHM) cut its full-year gross margin forecast, mainly due to increased discounting in its Pulte brand amid increased competition and higher lumber prices following wildfires in Canada. The homebuilder's second-quarter profit, however, beat estimates as it sold more homes at higher average prices.

Investors may have overbuilt U.S. housing stocks as data has yet to match up with the homebuilder sector's biggest rally in five years. The S&P 1500 Homebuilding index of homebuilder companies has surged 32 percent this year and hit a decade-high earlier this week.

                                                    8:58 AM ET 06/16/2017
                                                


* Housing starts fall 5.5 percent in May. * Building permits drop 4.9 percent. * Housing completions increase 5.6 percent. By Lucia Mutikani. U.S. homebuilding fell for a third straight month in May to the lowest level in eight months as construction activity declined broadly, suggesting that housing could be a drag on economic growth in the second quarter.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.

PulteGroup, Inc (Pulte Homes) is a homebuilding company founded in 1950 by Bill Pulte in Oakland County, Michigan. It is now based in Buckhead, Atlanta, Georgia, United States.
History[edit]
In 2009, the company, then known as Pulte Homes Inc., bought rival Centex — creating the nation's largest homebuilding company — in a stock transaction worth $3.1 billion, including $1.8 billion of debt. [1] Pulte completed the acquisition of Centex February 23, 2010.[2][3]
In June 2013, Pulte announced it would move its headquarters to Buckhead, Atlanta, citing a better economic climate outside Metro Atlanta.[4]
In September 2016, Ryan Marshall was appointed CEO, replacing Richard J. Dugas Jr, who will be the executive chairman of the board through 2017.[5][6]
