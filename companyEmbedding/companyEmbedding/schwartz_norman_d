Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Bio-Rad Laboratories, Incorporated Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants' are in listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. And instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.
I'd now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ron Hutton, Treasurer. Please go ahead.
Ronald W. Hutton - Treasurer & Vice President
Thank you. Before we begin the call, I would like to caution everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements about management's goals, plans and expectations, our future financial performance and other matters. Because our actual results may differ materially from these plans and expectations, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and I encourage you to review our filings with the SEC, where we discuss in detail the risk factors in our business. The company does not intend to update any forward-looking statements made during the call today.
With that, I'd like to turn over the call to Christine Tsingos, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
Christine A. Tsingos - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Ron. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today we will review the fourth quarter and full year financial results for 2015 as well as provide some insight into our thinking for 2016. With me today are, Norman Schwartz; John Goetz; Shannon Hall, President of our Life Science Group; and John Hertia, President of our Diagnostics Group.
Let's start with a review of the quarterly results. We are pleased to report net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 of $570.6 million, a decrease of 4.6% when compared to the year ago period sales of $598.2 million.
On a currency neutral basis however, quarterly sales actually grew 2.8%. This dramatic difference represents a currency headwind of more than $44 million on the top line.
During the quarter, we experienced good currency neutral sales growth across many of our product lines, most notably in our Life Science group including continued strong sales of our Droplet Digital PCR products, process media, and our Cell Biology product line.
Our Diagnostics Group also posted good growth for the quarter with strong sales of our diabetes monitoring, autoimmune and blood typing products as well as quality control.
The consolidated gross margin for the quarter was in-line with expectation at 54.1% and compares to last year's gross margins of 53.1%. The improvement in gross margin is largely the result of approximately $8.4 million of one-time cost in the fourth quarter of last year associated with the discontinuation of a small product line.
In addition, during this fourth quarter, we've recorded a total of approximately $6.6 million in cost of goods sold for the non-cash purchase accounting expenses related to acquisition. This compares to $7 million of amortization expense in the year ago period.
SG&A expense for the fourth quarter was $193.1 million or 33.9% of sales compared to $207.5 million, or 34.7% of sales last year. When compared to last year, the current quarter SG&A includes benefit related to currency translations which effectively lowered SG&A on a reported basis by about $11 million.

In addition, the current quarter includes a contingent consideration benefit of $4.9 million. And finally in SG&A, the amortization of intangibles related to prior acquisitions in the fourth quarter was approximately $1.6 million, down slightly from the year ago period.
Research and development expense in Q4 was 9.8% of sales, or $55.9 million versus $59.3 million last year. This decrease in R&D spending from last year is primarily related to the completion of key projects as well as expense taken in 2014 for the discontinuation of a product line.
With the strong sales growth, improved gross margin and lower operating spend, the reported operating margin for the fourth quarter was better than expected at 10.4% and compares to 8.5% in the fourth quarter of last year. However, when thinking about last year, we remember that the fourth quarter of 2014 included one-time expenses related to the shutdown of certain product lines as well as contingent consideration charges.
Interest and other for the quarter was a net expense of approximately $5.3 million compared to $4.8 million last year. The effective tax rate used in the fourth quarter was significantly lower than expected at 8.7%, a result of the reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit for 2015, a reduction in certain tax reserves and a tax benefit from excess foreign tax credits related to a dividend from one of our foreign subsidiaries.
Reported net income for the fourth quarter was $49.5 million, or $1.68 per share on a fully diluted basis, compared to $39 million last year or $1.34 per share. Excluding the discrete tax items I just mentioned, we estimate that earnings per share would have been $1.31.
And now for certain segment information. Our Life Science Group reported strong sales for the fourth quarter of $218.1 million. This represents a decline of 2.5% versus last year. However on a currency neutral basis, sales increased 3.4% for the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, these quarterly results reflect continued strong sales of our Digital PCR systems and consumables as well as process media and our family of cell biology and western blotting products. On a geographic basis, currency neutral sales grew across many regions of Life Science, most notably North America, China and Europe.
You may recall that during the third quarter, Life Science sales were negatively impacted by system and productivity challenges associated with the go live of our second deployment of SAP. And on the last earnings call, we signaled some caution regarding the group's ability to catch up the backlog especially in the face of sizeable Q4 demand. Today we are pleased to report that the system-related challenges have been substantially remediated.
Our Clinical Diagnostics Group also achieved good sales for the quarter of $348.6 million, compared to $370.3 million last year, a decrease of 5.9% on a reported basis but growth of 2.5% currency neutral. These sales were led by continued strong performance in the quality control and diabetes product line as well as solid growth for blood typing and BioPlex 2200 revenue.
On a geographic view, diagnostic currency neutral sales for the quarter increased most notably in China, North America and the emerging markets, while sales in Europe continued to decline.
Looking at the full year financial results, we are pleased to report annual revenues of $2.019 billion. While this represents a decrease of 7.2% versus the last year on a reported basis. On a currency neutral basis, sales for the year grew 1.6%. This dramatic swing reflects a currency headwind to sales of more than $190 million for the full year.
Our Life Science Group posted annual sales of $695 million, a decline of 4.6% versus 2014 and growth of 2.5% currency neutral with the swing representing $52 million of currency headwind. This growth was fueled by continued strong sales of our Digital PCR instruments and consumable. We also saw good annual growth in our western imagers and reagent, cell biology and process media products.

From a geographic view, sales in North America, Europe and China were the biggest contributors to year-over-year growth for the Life Science Group. For the year, clinical diagnostic sales were $1.310 million, a decline of 8.5% on a reported basis, but growth 1.1% on a currency neutral basis, a currency headwind of $138 million for the full year. This growth was fueled by continued momentum in quality controls, autoimmune and diabetes monitoring products.
On a geographic view, sales of North America, China and Latin America were the biggest contributors to year-over-year currency neutral growth for the Diagnostics Group.
Total company gross margins for the full year of 2015 were in line with guidance at 55.5% and compares to 54.2% in 2014. The increase in margin versus last year is primarily the results of a more favorable product mix as well as the one-time charges for the discontinuation of small product lines and consolidation of small manufacturing operations during 2014. Also, important to note, total amortization of intangibles and purchase accounting recorded in cost of goods sold for 2015 was $27.4 million.
SG&A expense as a percent of sales was 37.7% for the year, or $762 million and compares to $808 million in 2014. The decrease in spend year-over-year relates to benefit associated with the stronger dollar as well as the reduction in overall contingent consideration and the absence of the FCPA related settlement accrual taken during 2014. And finally in SG&A, total expense for acquisition related amortization was $7.4 million for the full year.
Research and development expense in 2015 was $193 million or 9.6% of sales and compares to $220 million, or 10.1% of sales last year. This decrease is a result of the discontinuation of an underperforming product line in 2014 as well as the wind down of spending for new instruments for blood typing and diabetes monitoring that were launched earlier in 2015.
Looking to 2016, R&D expenses as a percentage of sales will likely stay at that 9% to 10% level, as we move a number of investments through the product development pipeline.
Net income for the full year was $113 million versus last year's net income of $88.8 million. Fully diluted earnings per share for the year were $3.85. The effective tax rate for the full year 2015 was 22.5% and lower than our 2014 full year tax rate of 32.5% due to the previously mentioned discrete items affecting the fourth quarter as well as the mix of sales in lower tax jurisdiction. For 2016, we expect the effective tax rate excluding any discrete items that may occur to be in the 30% to 32% range.
For 2015, Bio-Rad's balance sheet remains strong. As of December 31, total cash and short-term investments were $790 million compared to $698 million at the end of last year. Net cash generated from operations during the fourth quarter was $36 million and $186.2 million for the full year 2015.
This compares to net cash generated from operations in 2014 of $273 million. The year-over-year decrease in cash flow is substantially related to the lower sales on a reported basis and includes approximately $31 million of currency headwinds and receivables. EBITDA for 2015 remained strong at nearly $300 million, which includes $94 million of EBITDA generated in the fourth quarter. The EBITDA margin improved to 14.8% of sales and compares to 14% in 2014.
Net capital expenditures were $28 million for the quarter and $112 million for the full year, slightly below the $120 million to $130 million range estimated on our last call. Looking to 2016, we estimate that CapEx spending will increase to the $140 million to $150 million range as we continue to invest in our global ERP and other systems as well as some foundational projects in Europe. Finally, depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $33.9 million and $131.8 million for the full year.

Looking to 2016, we see several opportunities for growth on the topline. The momentum we are seeing in many of our Life Science product lines is encouraging for future growth. In addition, funding for research around the world seems to be improving. As such, we are targeting an increase in the Life Science growth to be in the 4% to 5% range.
On the Diagnostics side of the business, we also see opportunities for currency neutral growth in many of our core businesses, including an increase in consumable sales associated with our new instruments for the blood typing and diabetes monitoring markets. Offsetting much of this expected growth, we continue to face some sizable challenges in the diagnostic market, including a continued decline in Europe, price pressure in government tenders and lab consolidation in selected markets around the world.
As such, we are targeting the diagnostic currency neutral growth rate to be similar to the 2015 rate of 1% to 1.5%. Overall, the combined result of the opportunities and challenges across both businesses, leads us to the expectation of sales growth in 2016 of around 2.5% to 3% on a currency neutral basis for the full year.
With regard to margin, you can see that we made solid currency neutral improvement to our profitability in 2015, even in light of another year of significant spending for new technologies and systems. During 2015, we improved the gross margin by more than 100 basis points and are targeting to maintain, if not slightly improve those levels in 2016.
In thinking about the operating margin for 2016, we continue to see sizable investment in the pipeline as we move our global ERP project to Europe, our most complex region from an operating standpoint. During the year, we will not only be investing in the ERP design and implementation, we will also be investing in new infrastructure and organizational improvement to ready the region for a more efficient footprint and transaction flow post-SAP. All of these projects require a significant increase in spending.
Having said that, we do not want to take away the gains made during 2015 and we will work hard to maintain a currency neutral operating margin around 8% to 8.5% for the full year.
On a reported basis, the strong U.S. dollar will continue to have a negative impact on our reported results for 2016 at least for the first half of the year. As many of you know Bio-Rad is a very global company in terms of both sales and operation and currency can have a significant impact on our reported result.
More than 65% of our sales are non-U.S. dollar and we estimate that around 35% or 40% of our expenses are non-U.S. dollar. As such with today's strong dollar environment, currency can have a significant negative impact to our financial outlook.
As I mentioned during the 2015 results comments, changes in foreign currency negatively impacted our revenue by more than $190 million for the year. And as I mentioned, our outlook for currency neutral sales growth in 2016 is 2.5% to 3%. However, if we use exchange rates as of December 31, currency could actually result in a revenue headwind of $50 million to $75 million and perhaps flat year-over-year reported sales.
And while we do have some natural hedge with the non-dollar expenses this currency headwind could impact our expected operating margin by 50 basis points or more and essentially mask the great progress that we made with operating profit.
In closing, let me just say that despite a relatively flat outlook for 2016 profitability, we will remain highly committed to focusing on ways to create greater leverage in our operating expenses, while at the same time continuing our investments in new technologies and systems. It is through these new products and technologies and a more efficient footprint that we can improve our gross profit, and it is through changes in our organizational structure and implementing new global IT systems that we can reduce our overall operating cost, all of which will ultimately contribute to a significant improvement in our operating margin in the years to come.

And now I'll turn things over to Norman for a few comments.
Norman D. Schwartz - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Christine. So, I think it's fair to say, while currency had an overwhelming effect on the reported results, I mean, I think you can see from Christine's comments that we did make progress on many fronts, kind of the underlying currency neutral sales growth did benefit from a wave of new products that were not only introduced in late 2014, but also supplemented by some of the notable introductions and regulatory clearances that we had from 2015, and certainly we expect continued travel from those.
I think that internally much of our attention was focused on our ERP project, deployment two in this last year and also completing the restructuring of our operations. With the implementation of these global systems, we saw the opportunity to move to what we think of as a more functional structure which we spent much of 2015 implementing. I would say the two most notable or principle changes we made were to globalize our commercial or the selling operation and to globalize our supply chain. We spent much of the year establishing the structure filling the positions created by this change. I think we were fortunate in this regard to have some good bench strength and feel the majority of these positions from within.
We do see much potential from this organization. The product groups can now focus their attention to our markets and ensure we continue to develop the innovative quality products that we are known for. And the globalization of our sales and service organization should allow us to think more globally. And really to better serve our increasing number of global customers.
And finally, our new supply chain organization which encompasses procurement, manufacturing and distribution. I think for us functionalizing these areas and globalizing these areas gives us many opportunities to drive both efficiency and effectiveness for the company. Obviously, it will take some time to see the results. But, we do expect them to be measurable. I do feel we have now largely completed this transition and it appears that everyone's excited about what we can accomplish for the company going forward.
So with that, I guess we will open it up to questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you ladies and gentlemen. Our first question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with Leerink. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Dan L. Leonard - Leerink Partners LLC
Thank you. First of all, on the ERP, is there any way to think about – if you had any boost in the fourth quarter from resolving some backlog that was left over from the third quarter issues? Or do you consider the fourth quarter organic sales growth to be a run rate number?
Christine A. Tsingos - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Dan, that's a really great question. And you may remember on the third quarter call, we were kind of estimating that disruption could have been $5 million to $10 million range and it's really hard to pinpoint that number. But I think we made up at least 90% of whatever that number was, pick something in the middle, $7 million, $8 million. I think that was part of the growth in Q4, but it's difficult to pinpoint exactly how much is make up from Q3 and how much is Q4.
Without a doubt, we knew going into Q4 where the orders were coming in and the demand wave that was in front of us. So I don't want to take away from the organic nature of the fourth quarter either.
Dan L. Leonard - Leerink Partners LLC
Got it. And I know you said China grew across both Diagnostics and Life Sciences, can you quantify the growth rate at least ballpark. Was it mid-single digits? Was it high single digits? And what's your expectation for China in 2016?

Christine A. Tsingos - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Sure, so I'll talk a little bit about 2015 and then maybe John and Shannon want to chime in on 2016, and you know, Dan we don't talk about sales specifically per region or growth rate per region, what I can tell you is that Diagnostics continues to grow at a really nice double-digit rate in China.
Life Science I think because of a lot of what happened in the beginning of the year, some slowing has been system related. Much of that impacted China. They ended up with a growth rate in China that's in the single digits for the year, which was probably lower than what we would have expected at the beginning of the year. But both exited 2015 with pretty decent momentum in China. I don't know if there's anything – 2016 China?
John Hertia - EVP & President-Clinical Diagnostics Group
For Diagnostics, this is John Hertia. China continues to represent good opportunities in immunology and quality control and diabetes. There's still a little bit of a challenge with respect to registration they have, the China FDA. And that's a little bit of a wild card going into 2016. So we're probably a little conservative on how that could impact us going into the next year.
Christine A. Tsingos - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, good point.
Dan L. Leonard - Leerink Partners LLC
Got it. And then my final question I guess for you John. How are you contemplating the potential introduction of the IH 1000 in the U.S.? How is that being contemplated in the guidance for 2016? Could that present potential upside to guidance or is that the kind of launch that would take a little bit longer to fully show-up in numbers?
John Hertia - EVP & President-Clinical Diagnostics Group
So we were targeting three FDA approvals for 2015. We did get two of them in. We got T100 cleared in December and the infinity blood typing system also cleared in December. The FDA did ask for some additional data, the North American gel and the IH 1000, we're in the process of getting that back to them. And we'll just have to wait for some additional guidance from them. From the time that we get clearance to introduction isn't a very long runway.
Christine A. Tsingos - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
And I think in terms of the outlook in the plan, Dan, we don't have the clearance yet, I think we remain very optimistic that we will receive it. But at the time as we've said all along coming into the North American market with the gel technology while quite compelling for the customers. It is a long sales cycle and not something that happens overnight. So I think we've been very conservative in our expectations all along as to how quickly we would ramp up and take share in the U.S. market, and I think that's true for the 2016 plan as well.
Dan L. Leonard - Leerink Partners LLC
Got it. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. . Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Good afternoon.
Christine A. Tsingos - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Hi, Brandon.
Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC
Christine, did you disclose the impact on the operating profit dollar line from currency in the fourth quarter?
Christine A. Tsingos - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
I don't think I said what the...
Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC
But do you have it on – at your fingertips? Or do you have it at your fingertips by chance?
Christine A. Tsingos - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
If I can get this stack of papers. Yeah, I think the operating margin was – well, that's year-to-date. Wait a minute, you want the quarter?

Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC
Yeah. Just the fourth quarter number.
Christine A. Tsingos - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I think the operating margin was closer to 11% for the quarter instead of the 10.5% on a currency neutral basis.
Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC
Okay. So maybe about – okay, all right. A question on the Propel flow cytometer acquisition. Could you speak to the financial implications of that? Is that dilutive near-term and sort of what do you see is the competitive differentiation of that system? And do you think there is an opportunity to bundle it with the (29:19) you picked up back in 2012?
Christine A. Tsingos - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
So in terms of – in terms of impact on operating expense, going into 2016 is all included within our outlook. In terms of market opportunity, you are talking about the new flow cytometer?
Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC
Yeah. The press release you put out I think last week or two weeks ago?
Christine A. Tsingos - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. So I think Shannon's probably a better person to speak about the opportunity and how it fits in our product family.
Shannon Hall - Executive VP & President-Life Science Group
So, we've been pursuing the cell biology market as an area for growth for Bio-Rad, it fits really closely with our overall approach to doing protein and DNA and RNA analysis at the bench. Our cell biology portfolio was oriented towards accessing a broader user base which is part of what S3 is about and the cytometer builds on that by offering a user centric cytometer that offers features really aimed at creating an accessible cytometer across multiple levels of users and multiple levels of analytical capabilities.
Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC
Christine, any chance you can quantify the near-term drag on the OP line from that?
Christine A. Tsingos - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
It's about $10 million in the fourth quarter.
Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC
All right. I think that's all I got. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. And I am showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Christine for any closing remarks.
Christine A. Tsingos - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Okay, well thank you everyone for taking the time to join us today. We appreciate your interest and of course, we are available for any follow-up questions that you may have. Bye-bye.
Operator

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Bio-Rad Laboratories, Incorporated Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants' lines are in a listen-only mode to reduce background noise, but later we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. Instructions will follow at that time.
I would now like to introduce your first speaker for today, Ron Hutton. You have the floor, sir.
Ronald W. Hutton - Treasurer & Vice President
Thank you, Andrew. Before we begin the call, I would like to caution everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements about management's goals, plans and expectations, our financial future performance and other matters. Because our actual results may differ materially from these plans and expectations, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and I encourage you to review our filings with the SEC, where we discuss in detail the risk factors in our business. The company does not intend to update any forward-looking statements made during the call today.
With that, I'd like to turn over the call to Christine Tsingos, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
Christine A. Tsingos - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Ron. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Net sales for the third quarter of 2015 were $470 million, a decrease of 11.4% on a reported basis and versus the same period last year sales of $530.6 million. The currency headwind to sales was more than $49 million for the quarter.
On a currency neutral basis, sales decreased 2.2% when compared to last year. You may remember that on the second quarter earnings call we cautioned that the continued challenges in Europe coupled with seasonality could make for a tough quarter, especially for our Diagnostics group, and that certainly was the case.
In addition, our Life Science group also faced challenges, primarily related to a slowing of growth in various emerging markets as well as system and productivity challenges associated with the go-live of our new ERP. Even with these challenges, during the quarter we did experience good currency-neutral sales growth across some our key Life Science and Diagnostic product lines, including sales of our Digital PCR consumables and our western blotting workflow products as well as our quality controls product line.
The reported gross margin for the quarter was slightly better than expected at 56.1% and compares to 54.4% in the year-ago period. This improvement in margin versus last year is related to a more favorable product mix, lower cost as a result of the manufacturing operations and product lines that were shut down during 2014 and a decrease in amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. The total non-cash purchase accounting expense recorded in cost of goods sold related to prior acquisitions was $6.7 million for the quarter, which compares to $8.1 million in the year-ago period.
SG&A expenses for the third quarter were $187.4 million or 39.9% of sales compared to $202.6 million and 38.2% of sales last year. The year-over-year decrease in expense relates to foreign currency translation as well as one-time items contained in the third quarter of 2014, including an accrual of $9.6 million in connection with the final settlement of the FCPA matter and a $3 million benefit related to the valuation of the purchase consideration for prior acquisitions. And finally, quarterly SG&A includes a total of $1.9 million for the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles.

Research and development expense in Q3 was 9.2% of sales, or $43.3 million, down both sequentially and versus last year. This comparison reflects a decline in spending associated with the completion of key projects as well as some reduction related to currency translation. Going forward, we expect R&D expense to continue to be in the 9% to 10% of sales range.
During the quarter, interest and other income was a net expense of $7.3 million compared to $10.8 million last year. This improvement is partially the result of foreign currency exchange losses, which were substantially lower this year versus last year. And as a reminder, the third quarter of last year included an additional $2.4 million of accrued interest associated with the FCPA matter.
The effective tax rate used for the third quarter was approximately 32% and in line with our guidance. Excluding any discrete items that may occur, we continue to expect the full year tax rate to be in the 31% to 33% range. This range excludes any impact from the potential reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit which, once reinstated, will have a significant positive impact on the rate.
Net income for the third quarter was $17.4 million, which compares to $11.5 million in the year-ago period. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.59. Life Science reported sales for the third quarter decreased 13% to $150.4 million. On a currency-neutral basis, sales declined 5.9% versus last year. Sales of our Droplet Digital PCR products continue to do well along with our V3 Western Workflow product family.
However, revenue growth for the Life Science group overall during the quarter was significantly impacted by a slowdown in our supply chain activity in the wake of the go-live of our second deployment of SAP. The temporary disruption in productivity while adapting to new systems and processes is not atypical, although the impact to the third quarter revenue was sizeable, especially in North America. We believe that this negatively impacted Life Science sales in the quarter by $5 million to $10 million. The good news is that bookings remained strong during the third quarter and much of the disrupted revenue was likely a matter of timing and not a change in demand.
Our Clinical Diagnostic group posted quarterly sales of $316.2 million, a decrease of 10.9% compared to last year. On a currency neutral basis, sales were down slightly about 0.5%. Growth during the quarter was primarily fueled by good demand in our quality control products as well as our Bio-Plex business.
On a geographic view, North America posted good growth with nearly every product line up versus the year-ago period. Looking outside the U.S., our European markets continue to be negatively impacted by the challenges from lab consolidation and pricing pressure. And as I mentioned earlier, seasonality was also a factor in our slower growth.
And now for a quick review of the balance sheet. As of September 30, total cash and short-term investments were $786 million. Net cash generated from operations during the quarter was $82 million compared to $38 million last quarter and $91 million in the third quarter of last year. This decrease in cash flow versus last year is substantially related to the decrease in reported sales and includes approximately $42 million of currency headwinds in receivables.
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $65 million, or 14% of sales. Net capital expenditures for the quarter were $24.7 million, which represents a decrease both sequentially and year-over-year. The decrease in spend for the current quarter is related to the timing of payments and will likely be paid before year end. However, given the year-to-date run rate, our full-year expectation for CapEx is now slightly lower, in the $120 million to $130 million range. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $33.6 million.

Moving to our outlook for the remainder of the year, we continue to anticipate strong currency headwinds to the top line. Year-to-date, that headwind has been more than $146 million. On a currency neutral basis, year-to-date sales growth is 1.2% and below our original annual guidance of 3%. Given the third quarter results and the continuing market challenges in Europe and coupled with our own systems-related issues in our Life Science group, we now expect full-year currency neutral sales growth in the 1% to 1.5% range for the full year.
As I mentioned earlier, the slowdown in our supply chain processes is likely a matter of timing and not lost sales, but it may take us into early next year to fully regain the tempo in recognized revenue. And finally, let's not forget that sales in the fourth quarter of last year were substantial, which could make for a tougher comparison.
From a profitability standpoint, our guidance has been for consolidated gross margins of 55% and an operating margin of 9% on a currency-neutral basis. While year-to-date results are running at or slightly above our margin guidance, remember that historically our margins tend to drift down in the fourth quarter as product mix shifts more towards instrument sales and spending for projects becomes fully ramped. As has been our practice in prior years, we will share our thinking and outlook for 2016 in February during the fourth quarter earnings call.
And now we are happy to take your questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
And our first question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Your line is open.
Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC
Thanks. I guess maybe this is a better question for John. Could you elucidate some of the issues that occurred with the ERP rollout in the quarter? If I think back to the second quarter call in August, which was probably a month and a half after the initial rollout, it didn't sound like there were any disruptions or issues that had occurred at that time. What changed really between now and then?
John Goetz - Chief Operating Officer
Yeah, this is John Goetz. I guess what we've found is that the process timing, being able to take an order and get a product shipped, has taken a lot longer than we really realized at the time of the call. And really what that's done is it's moving shipments and sales recognition out beyond probably I think somewhere around two weeks. So that's what we're looking at there.
In addition I think the adoption of the system in our manufacturing plants has gone a little rockier than we've experienced during the first rollout. During the first rollout, we really had only one manufacturing plant come online. With this one, this brought up all of the rest of our Diagnostic manufacturing as well as all of our Life Science manufacturing here in the United States, so this has added quite a bit of complexity.
So the amount of time and effort that we've had to be able to cover the questions and requests to respond to some of the concerns of our users has just taken us a little bit longer to get a handle on.
Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC
Which outstanding issues, if any, are still to be resolved? And, Christine, why would it necessarily take several quarters for the revenue trend to normalize?
Christine A. Tsingos - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Sure. So I think a lot of this, Brandon, is just people getting used to how to use a brand new system. And we know from the first deployment that it takes six months to nine months for people to really get good at doing their jobs again with new processes, new screens, et cetera.
I think what we're facing here different in deployment two than deployment one, as John said, it really brings in our entire Life Science group, and much of their manufacturing is here and they ship to many places around the world, so it can ripple to a lot of locations around the world. And people need to, as they get used to the processes, then things start flowing more quickly.

So part of the caution on how long it'll take is a little bit based on what we experienced with the first one, but also knowing that the complexity of this second deployment and the complexity of our Life Science business is even that much greater and could take more time to normalize. And part of it, frankly, is that demand has been quite strong and so there was a lot hitting on the system at the same time people were getting used to these new processes.
Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC
Okay. And then in Life Science business, Christine, could you give us a sense of how the process chromatography media performed in the period? I believe you lapped a pretty tough comp there. Was curious if that was an incremental headwind for the segment as well?
Christine A. Tsingos - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Sure. And Shannon Hall, our President of Life Science, is here. So I'm going to let her talk about that as well in terms of the process media, a tough compare year-over-year.
Shannon Hall - Executive VP & President-Life Science Group
Yeah, that period is a tough-to-compare period. But...
Christine A. Tsingos - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. It's a lumpy business.
Shannon Hall - Executive VP & President-Life Science Group
Yeah, very much so. It's been a solid year so far. We continue to see great demand in that area, so I'd say it'd be easier to look at on a full-year basis.
Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC
Okay. And then last one finally, Christine or maybe this is a better one for Ron, I've been getting quite a number of questions from investors recently about your exact exposure to Sartorius. And I believe in your last Q for the first time you called out an unrealized gain of about $400 million which you attributed to the preferreds. Was curious if you could quantify your exact exposure in terms of the preferred stock, either in number of shares or any round numbers?
Christine A. Tsingos - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
So, historically we really haven't disclosed exactly what we own in preferred shares. We do talk about what's on the books versus – the carrying value versus the estimated market value. And as a reminder, the voting shares we are holding at cost, the preferred shares we mark-to-market and I think certainly they continue to do well and so the unrealized gain on our investment continues to increase as well.
Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC
Super. I'll hop back in the queue. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Engler from Great Lakes Advisors. Your line is open.
Bryan Langsam Engler - Great Lakes Advisors LLC
My question has been answered. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Matthews from RAM Partners. Your line is open.
Jeffrey L. Matthews - RAM Partners LP
Hi. Can you hear me?
Ronald W. Hutton - Treasurer & Vice President
Yes.
Christine A. Tsingos - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Hi, Jeff.
Jeffrey L. Matthews - RAM Partners LP
Hi. Aside from the currency and the ERP, what were the big surprises operationally in the quarter, would you say?
Norman D. Schwartz - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
I think those are the two big ones. I think that the continued softness in Europe, I think that probably when we went into the year we were a little more optimistic about maybe being farther through the cycle, especially in France, with this lab consolidation, but it appears that we've got a ways to go with that.
Christine A. Tsingos - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah...
Jeffrey L. Matthews - RAM Partners LP
Excuse me, why do you think that is, Norm? What's happening that keeps this ball rolling?
Norman D. Schwartz - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer

It's just the continuous consolidation of labs, especially in France.
Christine A. Tsingos - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
I think, remember, Jeff, we had a very strong market share position in France compared to some of our competitors. So as that market has consolidated in terms of the number of labs, we've probably felt a disproportional impact compared to other IBD providers in France because we had such a strong market share position there.
And I think some of the economic woes of the region are bleeding into Eastern Europe and that may be more than we would have anticipated at the beginning of the year. And you know regulatory changes continue throughout much of the emerging market world, both in Eastern Europe and Asia-Pacific.
Jeffrey L. Matthews - RAM Partners LP
Okay. And that leads to my next question which is, what have you seen in China and Japan this last quarter? What's new and different?
Norman D. Schwartz - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Not much is new and different, I would say. Japan continues to hobble along at a slow pace for both Life Science and Diagnostics. China, it's kind of running about the same as it has been. Certainly I think some of the slowdown that we have experienced in China this quarter has been related to the ERP implementation and being able to ship products and recognize the revenue in the quarter, but I think the underlying market is still about the same.
Jeffrey L. Matthews - RAM Partners LP
Okay. So I guess ERP-wise then, IBM is happy to get to keep all their people there and spend a lot more time trying to help you out.
Norman D. Schwartz - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I would say it's largely a learning curve. The system is running. I think it's running pretty well. It's just our adapting to the way it works and changing our mindset around the discipline of this system is probably the biggest challenge.
Jeffrey L. Matthews - RAM Partners LP
It sounds like what John was saying earlier, you went from the first iteration, you added one plant. This time you added multiple plants. And I would imagine it's mainly just a function of the scale of it. Is there anything that you see in it that makes you any less enthusiastic about what you're thinking the outcome will be, or does it change your timing of the rollout in Europe?
Norman D. Schwartz - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
No, I think we're still enthusiastic about it. I think the people who are using it see the benefits of it. It's just a matter of getting used to it and learning to use it as a tool. It's kind of like when you pick up a hammer or a saw for the first time, it takes a while to get acclimated to it and to learn how to use it. I think it's the same thing with this system.
Jeffrey L. Matthews - RAM Partners LP
And how about timing on the European implementation? Any change there?
Christine A. Tsingos - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, we've been continuing to talk about going live in Europe during 2017 and we'll spend much of 2016 doing the design. With each deployment, the complexity increases as we take it to more complex pieces of our business. And without question, the life science business model is much more complex than a diagnostic business model and the number of products is at least three times. And so the second deployment was a big implementation for us. That'll actually help us a little as we go to Europe, because most of the products will be in the system already. So hopefully we'll be able to stay on the projected timeline of going live in a series of deployments during 2017 as we roll through Europe.
Jeffrey L. Matthews - RAM Partners LP
Okay, thanks. And final question and I don't know what you can say about this, but this whistle blower case related to the FCPA stuff seems to be creating new precedents into law. Has this continuation of it in its current iteration had any impact on your settlement? Is there anything that could come out of this that could affect the P&L that we should be aware of, or is this just a side issue?

Norman D. Schwartz - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
I think it's probably better not to comment on items that are currently open litigation.
Jeffrey L. Matthews - RAM Partners LP
Understood. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. It looks like we have a follow-up from Mr. Couillard from Jefferies. This is Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Your line is open.
Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Go all the way around the horn, a question for John Hertia. Could you give us an update on where the IH 1000 stands with the FDA, whether you've had any dialogue or feedback from the Agency, which seems to be holding up the approval?
And then in terms of the BioPlex 2200, would love to get a status update on where you stand in terms of the menu rollout and any round numbers you can give us in terms of placement growth activity year-to-date.
John Hertia - EVP & President-Clinical Diagnostics Group
Sure. Brandon, this is John. Maybe we'll address the IH 1000 first. So we are in constant dialogue with the FDA. Still pretty optimistic that we'll get news before the end of the year on the IH 1000 and the North American gel launch and also the infinity System, which is targeted at our mid-volume laboratories.
On BioPlex, we're seeing I would say increased traction in autoimmune. We've had really good response to celiac and our measles panel, also the addition of vitamin D and HIV. And we're seeing a wave of, let's say, increased requests for second and third placements within accounts that had BioPlex upfront and that's been really good news.
Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC
Great. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Matthews from RAM Partners. Your line is open.
Jeffrey L. Matthews - RAM Partners LP
Hi. Thanks. Norman, Theranos seems to be imploding. I don't know if you were as surprised as I was reading about it. Wondered if you had any thoughts about what it means for what they were ultimately trying to do. Does it cast doubt on the whole notion of this liquid biopsy explosion or is it a one-off bad business model kind of thing?
Norman D. Schwartz - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
I don't know. It's really hard to say. I guess I would put this down to maybe growing pains. And it seems like any young company goes through a few of these things. I think there's certainly some value in what they're trying to do and the audience that they're trying to reach and so we'll have to see how they navigate it.
Jeffrey L. Matthews - RAM Partners LP
All right. Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard from Leerink. Your line is open.
Dan L. Leonard - Analyst, Leerink Partners LLC
Thanks. And I hopped on late, so apologies if it's been asked already. But you called out Digital PCR again as a growth lever in the Life Sciences business. Can you give us an update on how large that business is, either in terms of revenue or placements and then also any insights into the Droplet next-gen sequencing instrument that you might be able to offer?
Christine A. Tsingos - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
So, Dan, as you know, we don't give out details of our revenue by our various product lines. We believe it continues to do very well, both in terms of revenue and the instrument placements all over the world and another encouraging sign is how our customers are using the product itself and the papers that continue to be published which then has a kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy of generating even more demand for that product. But it's not something we've given out specific information on in terms of the size of that business.
Dan L. Leonard - Analyst, Leerink Partners LLC
But it does sound like you continue to expect it to be a good growth driver going forward?

Norman D. Schwartz - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yes.
Christine A. Tsingos - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah.
Dan L. Leonard - Analyst, Leerink Partners LLC
Got it. And then the Droplet sequencing instrument, is there any updates to be had there?
Christine A. Tsingos - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Development and...
Norman D. Schwartz - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Okay. Well, certainly that continues to be under development. They're making good progress. I don't have an exact schedule for you, but it's still a little ways off.
Dan L. Leonard - Analyst, Leerink Partners LLC
Got it. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Wilkin from UBS. Your line is open.
Scott Wilkin - UBS Global Asset Management
Thank you and good afternoon. I was just hoping – I think maybe John is probably the best equipped to answer this. I was just curious if you could put a little more color on the lost sales of $5 million to $10 million in the quarter and how you're confident that that's not business that's going elsewhere?
I understand maybe you're slow to be able to ship the revenue. It's just when I think about researchers doing experiments and ordering product, they're doing it as they need to do the experiments, right? And so how is this not leading to lost business as opposed to a delay?
John Goetz - Chief Operating Officer
Okay. Well, we're very close to our customers, number one. And through this launch of the system, we've been monitoring customer satisfaction pretty closely. And we have the ability to, let's say, flex a little bit about where products can go. And so if I think about what the impact has been, it's just added time for us to get products shipped. And the adoption has also caused us a little bit of problem with backorders.
The combination of those two things has caused what we're thinking about in this $5 million to $10 million range. But in terms of, do we think we're going lose the business? We don't believe we will. Bookings are strong and, as I said, we're staying very, very close to our customers.
Christine A. Tsingos - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah...
Scott Wilkin - UBS Global Asset Management
Go ahead, Christine.
Christine A. Tsingos - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Scott, I would also add that a lot of this is instrument-related and there it's not so much the day-to-day I need more consumables for my experiments that I really need that instrument. And for us, the larger instruments need to not only be delivered but also accepted by the customers, et cetera. And so as the timeline gets pushed out, it can push sales from one period to the next.
Scott Wilkin - UBS Global Asset Management
I see. So what you're saying is, you expect the backorder to persist through Q4 and it's more instrument-related so it's not a daily consumable issue.
Christine A. Tsingos - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Some level could persist. Since this quarter-end, we have been tracking it in great detail every single week and see with each passing week it's getting better and better. But there's a fair amount of demand. I guess that's the good news in it.
Scott Wilkin - UBS Global Asset Management
Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. We will hold for one moment to see if anyone else wants to queue up. And that looks like all the questioners that we're going to have for today, so I'd like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.
Christine A. Tsingos - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Okay. Great. Thank you, Andrew. And thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Bye-bye.
Operator

All in the family / Bio-Rad, 50 years later, is still doing business in its own way

1 / 2


Back to Gallery
















Long before the genome was mapped, before investors went Internet crazy, even before color television, David and Alice Schwartz started a scientific supply company called Bio-Rad Laboratories. 
Now, 50 years later, they still preside over a family-run biotech firm that stands out in an industry dominated by young companies run by professional managers. 
Founded in 1952 in West Berkeley, Bio-Rad today is an $817 million company that sells thousands of different chemical supplies, DNA instruments and diagnostic tests to hospitals and biotech laboratories in 32 countries. 



Latest news videos




 
Roughly 4,000 employees ultimately report to David Schwartz, 78, who has trained his son, Norman, 51, to take over the family business in which Alice, 76, still plays a role at the board level. 
During a recent interview at his Hercules headquarters, David reminisced about doing business the Bio-Rad way. 
"When we first started, nuclear energy was the big thing," said David, shuffling slowly down the carpeted hall toward his office. 
"One of our first products was amino acids tagged with carbon 14. You'd swallow it, and the researcher would follow it through your body with a Geiger counter," he said, motioning with his hands. "That's where the 'Rad' in Bio- Rad came from. It was short for radiation." 
David said in contrast to today's quick-growth startups, Bio-Rad took its time and bootstrapped everything. 
"It took us almost 15 years to reach a million dollars in sales," he said. 
In 1966, when Bio-Rad finally broke the million-dollar mark, the company took its second leap into the modern corporate world -- it went public. Once again, however, the Schwartz family did the IPO its way. 
Rather than pay an investment banking firm, David said he and Alice drafted an offering document, got it approved by the California Corporations Commission, and offered the shares to the people they presumed knew Bio-Rad best -- its customers. 
"We mimeographed an order blank and sent it out to 3,000 people in California," David chuckled. "We raised $125,000." 
If self-reliance was a virtue, complacency was the enemy. David said Bio- Rad prospered by shifting its supply focus from nuclear, to aerospace, to electronics and today, to biotechnology. 
"These waves of innovation have kept going, and it's always easy to settle back into doing something you know," he said. "What drove us ahead was interesting technology. We looked for something in a bottle that people could use to simplify their experiments." 
In 1985, Bio-Rad passed $100 million in sales. It hit $400 million in 1995. The company's recent 2001 results showed its earnings grew 42 percent to $44.2 million ($3.58 per share) on sales of $817.5 million. 
Selling off a semiconductor instrumentation division in 2000 left Bio-Rad focused on two biotech markets. In the arena for laboratory instruments and chemicals, Bio-Rad competes with the likes of Foster City's Applied Biosystems. 
Bio-Rad's other big market is selling clinical diagnostic kits to detect many ailments. One current hit is a test for mad cow disease. 
Bio-Rad's earnings are starting to attract attention on Wall Street, which still doesn't know what to make of this family company. 
"I have an attractive rating out on the stock," said Scott Greenstone at Thomas Weisel Partners in New York. "What I like about them is they derive about 70 percent of their income from chemistry supplies." These are consumables that aren't as prey to fluctuations as equipment sales. 
But Greenstone said several issues make it difficult for Wall Street to embrace the stock. For one thing, Bio-Rad has such a low average trading volume that big investors can't get in and out without making waves. Bio-Rad sought to address the liquidity issue by approving a 2-for-1 stock split this month, but Greenstone said that's only a start. 
Another issue that makes Wall Street somewhat leery of the stock is the fact that Bio-Rad's voting shares are controlled by the family, insulating the board and management from the takeover threats that face most corporate leaders. 
As Bio-Rad's heir apparent, Norman Schwartz said he has thought a lot about the pluses and minuses of family ownership. 
"It certainly is, in this day and age, a rare model to have a company where you can't throw the rascals out, so to speak," he said. "But what do you get in return for that? You get a management with real commitment." 
Greenstone said Bio-Rad also suffers at the moment from the absence of a chief financial officer. Bio-Rad's shares took a dip after CFO Tom Chesterman departed in December. The company had to issue a statement in January saying it was not aware of any reason for the volatility. 
Reached at his home office in the East Bay, Chesterman said he left Bio- Rad to help start a new biotech company, and was quick to dismiss the idea that his departure might have anything to do with any accounting irregularities. "There's no Enron here," he said, calling Bio-Rad "a business to be proud of." Bio-Rad says it is searching for a replacement. 
Jim Bennett, a longtime Bio-Rad manager, urged me not to overlook the role of Alice Schwartz, who shuns the spotlight these days. But she was the chemistry maven of Bio-Rad's early years and, later, the money manager who balanced David Schwartz's relentless curiosity. 
"The yin and yang of those two is something to behold," Bennett said. 
Of course, the next chapter in the Bio-Rad saga can't be written until David and Alice Schwartz turn over the company to their eldest son. Succession is a sore point in many family firms, and David is vague about exactly when the scepter will pass to his son. 
But at one point, as David was showing me through Bio-Rad's research lab, he observed that 76 is the average life expectancy of the American male. "At 78," he quipped, "I'm on borrowed time."
