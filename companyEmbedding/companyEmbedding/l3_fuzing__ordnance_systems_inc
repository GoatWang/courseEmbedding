L-3 Fuzing & Ordnance  Systems Wins the FMU-160 Award


L-3 FOS Awarded M734A1 and M783  Contract Extension
              L-3 Fuzing and Ordnance Systems,  Inc., (L-3 FOS) has won a $34,179,840 Army contract modification to provide the M734A1  and M783 fuzes in Cincinnati, Ohio. The Pentagon expects that work to finish by  Aug. 31, 2014. The Army Contracting Command’s office in Picatinny, NJ, is the  contracting activity for the firm-fixed-price contract. L-3 FOS was the  incumbent contract holder.


The Army Research, Development, and Engineering Center (ARDEC) created  the initial design for the M734A1 fuze. An integrated product team, consisting  of L-3 FOS, EDC, and ARDEC Technical Specialists, developed a production fuze  configuration incorporating a fully integrated Monolithic Microwave Integrated  Circuit (MMIC) front end and a mixed-mode (analog/digital) Signal Processor  I.C. Operating as a FM/CW Directional Doppler Ranging (DDR) proximity sensor,  the fuze constitutes state-of-the art munition deployment.


L-3 FOS to Supply Missile ESADs to Raytheon for AIM-9X
              The U.S. Naval Air Warfare Center  Aircraft Division awarded Raytheon Missile Systems - Air Warfare Systems a $97.1  million modification under a previously awarded contract N00019-11-C-0001 for  the Lot 12 low rate initial production (LRIP 2) of 139 AIM-9X Block II All Up  Round tactical missiles. This award is for the governments of Korea and Saudi  Arabia under the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program. L-3 FOS will supply  Raytheon with the Electronic Safety and  Arming Devices (ESADs) for the AIM-9X missile system.


The  AIM-9X, ESSM, and GMLRS are the first tactical ESADs to utilize commercial  plastic components, Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), solid-state high  voltage switches, and a Low Energy Exploding Foil Initiator (LEEFI). The Naval  Air Warfare Center (NAWC) Weapons Division, China Lake developed and qualified  these LEEFI devices. The attainment of high reliability for ESAD missile fuzing  is characterized by simplicity, no moving parts, and positive responsive design that anticipates environmental  influences.


L-3 FOS to Supply ESADs to Raytheon for AIM-9X
              The U.S. Naval Air Warfare Center  Aircraft Division awarded Raytheon Missile Systems - Air Warfare Systems - a  $39.6 million firm-fixed-price modification under a previously awarded contract  N00019-11-C-0001 for the low rate initial production (LRIP) Lot 12 of 47 AIM-9X  Block II all up round (AUR) tactical missiles. L-3 FOS will supply Raytheon  with the Electronic Safety and Arming  Devices (ESADs) for the AIM-9X missile system.


The  AIM-9X, ESSM, and GMLRS are the first tactical ESADs to utilize commercial  plastic components, Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), solid-state high  voltage switches, and a Low Energy Exploding Foil Initiator (LEEFI). The Naval  Air Warfare Center (NAWC) Weapons Division, China Lake developed and qualified  these LEEFI devices. The attainment of high reliability for ESAD missile fuzing  is characterized by simplicity, no moving parts, and positive responsive design that anticipates environmental  influences.


L-3 FOS Awarded M1040 Contract
              The  U.S. Army Joint Munitions and Lethality Life Cycle Management Command (JM&L  LCMC) at Picatinny Arsenal awarded L-3 Fuzing & Ordnance Systems (L-3 FOS)  (Lancaster, PA) a five-year, $47.9 million firm-fixed-price, ID/IQ contract to  provide quantities of the M1040 105mm Anti-Personnel (APERS) cartridges. L-3  FOS was the incumbent contract holder.  The M1040 Canister Cartridge antipersonnel ammunition  provides the Stryker Mobile Gun System [MGS] with a new and unique capability  to provide rapid, lethal fire against dismounted infantry/insurgents. 


L-3 FOS Awarded FMU-139 Contract
              The U.S. Naval Air Systems Command,  Headquarters (NAVAIR HQ) awarded L-3 Fuzing & Ordnance Systems (L-3 FOS) a  $36 million firm-fixed-price contract for the procurement of 20,000 FMU-139C/B  electronic bomb fuzes; 200 FMU-139C/B D-2 dummy fuzes; 100 FMU-139C/B D-5  cutaway fuzes; and 3,000 accessory kits. L-3 FOS was the incumbent contract  holder.
The  FMU-139 C/B Bomb Fuze is an electronic impact/impact delay fuzing system  developed for use by both the U.S. Navy and the Air Force in the MK 80 series  and M117 low drag and high drag, guided or unguided, high-explosive bombs. In  addition to impact/impact delay, the fuze is capable of accepting a signal from  a separate proximity sensor. 


L-3 FOS to Supply Raytheon with Fuzes for Excalibur
              The U.S. Army Joint Munitions and  Lethality Life Cycle Management Command awarded Raytheon Missile Systems -  Projectiles a $36.1 million cost-plus-incentive-fee modification (P00021) under  a previously awarded contract to exercise option 2 for M982 Excalibur Ib Phase  II 155 mm precision engagement projectiles. L-3 FOS will supply Raytheon with  the fuzes for the Excalibur system.


Excalibur is the world's only  deployed extended-range Global Positioning System (GPS) guided artillery round.  It has been fired more than 300 times in theater since its early fielding in  2007. Both the U.S. Army and Marine Corps have increased their use of this  life-saving weapon over the past year.

L-3 Fuzing and Ordnance Systems, Inc. Company Profile

   L-3 Fuzing & Ordnance Systems (formerly BT Fuze Products) ensures that shells, bombs, and missiles blow up. . .but only
   
    if
   
   and
   
    when
   
   they are supposed to. The days of lighting fuzes by hand and watching them burn down with growing drama are long gone; today's electronic, mechanical, and electro-mechanical fuzes are highly engineered products used to detonate tank, artillery, bombs, and mortar shells with precision timing. L-3 Fuzing & Ordnance Systems (FOS) also makes arming and safe devices for artillery; canister munitions; rockets; and air, ground, and anti-ship missiles.

L-3 Fuzing & Ordnance Systems (formerly BT Fuze Products) ensures that shells, bombs, and missiles blow up. . .but only if and when they are supposed to. The days of lighting fuzes by hand and watching them burn down with growing drama are long gone; today's electronic, mechanical, and electro-mechanical fuzes are highly engineered products used to detonate tank, artillery, bombs, and mortar shells with precision timing. L-3 Fuzing & Ordnance Systems (FOS) also makes arming and safe devices for artillery; canister munitions; rockets; and air, ground, and anti-ship missiles. FOS, which traces its roots to the Bulova Watch Company, is a subsidiary of L-3 Communications.
