Business Description
Fonar Corp. (NASDAQ:FONR) is an advanced medical technology company specializing in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). CEO Raymond V. Damadian's claim to fame is the invention of the technology that led to the MRI scanner back in the 1970s. His ground-breaking invention led Damadian to the founding of his own firm. Fonar now operates through a fully-owned subsidiary, Health Management Corporation of America (HMCA), providing non-medical support such as repair and maintenance, management and clerical services, and directly through Fonar Corp. in the manufacturing and selling of MRI products.
Business Direction
The company designs, sells and services MRI scanners and imaging centers. The MRI industry is extremely competitive and largely controlled by an oligopoly of 5 companies (Siemens (OTCPK:SIEGY), General Electric (NYSE:GE), Philips (NYSE:PHG), Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF) and Hitachi (OTCPK:HTHIY)). These 5 electrical giants together control 95% of the MRI market share.

This is a depressing statistic at first, because it appears Fonar would be unable to compete with the big players. This isn't completely true, though; Fonar's patent-protected "Upright MRI" is the only product that can compete with other imaging technologies that are threatening to replace existing MRI scanners. The conventional MRI scanner requires patients to lie on their back while a somewhat terrifying and noisy machine scans and generates images. Unfortunately, fixing patients in this position often means the source of the problem is never found. New technologies using X-ray, gamma or sound energy can accommodate patients in multiple positions, and are therefore more likely to identify the source of a patient's problem. Unlike companies using traditional MRI scanners, Fonar will not need to compete with these new products. The Upright MRI scanner can accommodate any number of positions, and reduces the risk of radiation that is present in technologies using X-rays or Gamma. This product is a key differentiator for Fonar, and the product is protected through a series of patents. Companies have tried and failed to use Fonar technology in the past. In 1992, GE and Hitachi were both sued by Fonar for the violation of its patents, proving that these big-name competitors cannot compete in its niche space.

Fonar Corp. revenue comes from manufacturing and selling the "Upright Multi Position MRI" scanner. Sales took a dip in 2014, and the market overreacted to the poor sales revenue. However, the company still posted revenue growth overall and solid profits in all other areas, proving that sales isn't the biggest driver. MRI sales are hard to come by, so management reacted to decreasing sales by redirecting resources to two of its main divisions; the Field Service division and, more significantly, the company's management subsidiary, Health Management Corporation of America.
HMCA
The contractual obligation with clients to provide servicing and upgrades provides a recurring revenue stream of more than $11m annually. HMCA provides physician management and diagnostic service, and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fonar. HMCA and its subsidiaries run 25 MRI scanning centers in New York and Florida, and generate revenue through upgrading and expanding the existing MRI scanning centers. HMCA is a key area for growth, and over the last 2 years, its revenue has drastically increased, as the number of HMCA-managed MRI centers has more than doubled since March 2013.

Figure 2: Depiction of HMCA firm structure, information from FY13 10-K
Operating earnings and revenue have consistently increased for each of the last 5 years, despite the inconsistent sales revenue, and consistent growth like this is a sign that management is conducting a solid business with a clear plan to grow and realize shareholder value.

Fonar-360
The "Upright Multi Position MRI" scanner enables Fonar to compete in the MRI space, because the product is simply better than traditional MRI scanners. It is quieter and much more comfortable, since it allows patients to be in any of multiple possible positions. These advances mean fewer patients experience claustrophobia, and a higher success rate in pinpointing the source of a patient's problem. Fonar scanners are even able to identify certain types of cancer that would previously require an X-ray product.
The new Fonar-360, the patient-friendly MRI, isn't just advancement in technology - it's a game changer. The Fonar-360 is an open-concept, full-sized room with magnetic poles in the centre. Patients can stay in any position, parents can accompany children to hold and comfort them, and patients can even watch TV to distract themselves. Surgeons will have 360-degree access to patients in any angle or position. Fonar scanners will be the only ones able to accommodate obesity (an epidemic growing very quickly), and will be able to detect certain diseases and cancers that normally require an upright X-ray. The company is yet to realize revenue from this product, but as it continues to market and advertise it, this will be a matter of time, and a potential catalyst for brand recognition and earnings growth in the future.
Reason for Opportunity
As previously mentioned, sales of MRI scanners and scanning facilities fell in 2014. But Fonar usually has a large backlog of orders to fulfill, and even without the MRI sales, the physician services and HMCA maintain a consistently increasing revenue stream and has seen massive growth in the last 2 years. The fact is that this fantastic performance is hidden behind declining sales revenue. A close look at the income statement shows how quickly this firm is really growing. The operating margin and net profit margin tell a story of their own, since even with the decrease in revenue from MRI sales, the company still maintains margins above 15% and remains consistently profitable.


Figure 4: Table is my own, data from Yahoo Finance and Bloomberg
A second reason is the company size compared to the competition. David is always available for good odds when he's up against Goliath - so up against 5 Goliaths means he's available at really good odds. It would be completely understandable to see Fonar Corp. available at low multiples if it were actually competing with these 5 big players in the MRI space; but thanks to this completely unique and patent-protected product, Fonar is out there alone, with a far superior product to anyone else in the industry. It may take time for brand recognition to build up and the market to notice the company, but management are certainly going about it the right way. In May 2014, a former NFL quarterback was treated thanks to the Fonar Upright MRI scanner. The product has received a lot of press coverage, and this shows an area where the product can be extremely competitive.
Key Stakeholders
A number of hedge funds and asset management firms own large stakes in Fonar. This provides added pressure on management to deliver full value to shareholders. The track record of these companies, particularly the hedge fund Renaissance Technologies, speaks volumes to the potential of this investment opportunity.

Competitive Analysis
Fonar Corp. is a fairly unique company operating in a niche space, so it was difficult to perform a meaningful competitive analysis. It operates in the Advanced Medical Technology & Equipment industry, so taking a couple of companies that operate in this industry, albeit in separate niche markets, gives an initial insight to the relative value of FONR:


Figure 6: Table is my own, data from Yahoo Finance and Bloomberg
Cyberonics' (NASDAQ:CYBX) business model revolves around VNS therapy systems. I'm not an expert in medical technology, but in its most simplistic description, it's comparable to the MRI business. Similarly, Digirad Corp. (NASDAQ:DRAD) is involved in diagnostic imaging (although, not including MRI scanners). So, I'm using Digirad and Cyberonics for this first look at peer fundamentals. Whichever metric you use (EV/EBITDA, P/E, P/B), Fonar is incredibly cheap. Due to the difference in the business models, it wouldn't make sense to draw a valuation from these comparisons, but it's an encouraging sign.
The MRI business, as mentioned before, is dominated by an oligopoly of 5 big firms that take up a combined market share of 95% (Siemens, GE, Philips, Toshiba and Hitachi). A snapshot of each of these firms' fundamentals is below:

Figure 7: Table is my own, data from Yahoo Finance and Bloomberg
All 5 of these companies play in a space far wider than just MRI scanners and medical technology, so this competitive analysis will be used to get a "thumb in the air" fair value, and not our actual intrinsic value of the stock. I find this a useful check, since some companies appear cheap on paper, but often are in line with industry averages. It's only when comparing them that you can draw some conclusions.


Figure 8: Chart is my own, data from Yahoo Finance and Bloomberg
I used some pretty basic statistics to determine which multiples historically have had the strongest relationship with market price. Regression analysis is great for that - an R2 value indicates how much of the variation in the data can be explained by the response data. Without going into the specifics, P/E and EV/EBITDA multiples share a strong positive coefficient with the market price, so I'm weighting each of them equally in generating an implied fair value for FONR shares. The P/B seems to bear no weight on the market price in this case, so I'm assigning it a 0% weighting.

Figure 9: Table is my own, data from Yahoo Finance and Bloomberg
Fonar shares will never trade at the same multiples as those of GE or Siemens for numerous reasons (small market cap, niche market and small market share, for example), so the implied share price of $22.06 is overly optimistic. I do, however, believe that due to the patent protection surrounding Fonar's business and products, there is added security here, so trading at a 126% discount to peers simply will not last.
Valuation
Many key fundamentals point to FONR shares being undervalued. The P/E of 5.26 and EV/EBITDA of 3.90 are significantly lower than that of competitors, its earnings yield of 19% is better than that of most companies on the Nasdaq (Ford Equity Research ranks it in the top 1% of equities), and Fonar's ROC (although falling) is still greater than 20%, as is the ROA consistently around the 20% mark. However you look at this company, it appears cheap and well managed.


Figure 10: Table is my own, data from Yahoo Finance and Bloomberg
FONR's EV/EBITDA multiple had been increasing for 5 years to a high of over 6, before falling to the current levels of 3.90. The competitive analysis revealed that in the MRI market, trading with an EV/EBITDA multiple of above 6 is in line with the industry average, so I don't believe the price drop had anything to do with a correction which we sometimes see for overvalued companies.
The shares currently trade at an EV/EBITDA multiple of 3.90, versus an average of 5.21 since fiscal year-end 2013. Based on this average, the intrinsic value of a share in Fonar is $13.00 - a premium of 33.45% to the current share price and, I believe, a fair value for Fonar Corp. which provides a good margin of safety for this investment.
It is worth noting here that Fonar's earnings yield is very high and consistent, sales were down last year, but its earnings remained strong. I assume a few factors here, in order to come up with a rough forward valuation:

Earnings yield 15% for the next 2 fiscal years; this is still below the average, so I think relatively conservative, and would imply FONR shares trade at a forward 2016 P/E of 3.98.
EBITDA growth of 25% for FY2016 and 15% for FY2015; again, conservatively below the historical average, as well as being below analyst estimates, but this implies an EV/EBITDA ratio for FY2017 of 2.71.

Equal weighting to each of these forward values prices FONR shares at $16.79, representing an ROI of 72.39% in 2 years.
I estimate each of these valuations to be conservative, because for a small cap company like this, growth is hard to predict. It wouldn't be a surprise to see this firm grow faster than expected and exceed these values.
Entry Point
As a fundamental analyst, I believe the market is semi-strong form efficient, and therefore, I don't use technical analysis as a technique to beat the market. I do, however, realize that technical analysis can offer good insights into the short-term momentum of price swings, so there are one or two indicators I look at when determining an entry point. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows investors when a stock is overbought (and therefore, potentially overvalued) or oversold (and therefore, potentially undervalued). In this case, the RSI moved below 30 (generally the mark where we say the stock is oversold), so in the short term, I'm expecting a rebound in price. Now could be a good time to initiate a position or add to a position.


Figure 11: Data from Recognia
It's worth noting that the RSI has previously been a good indicator of short-term performance for Fonar shares. In December 2014, the stock became oversold, and the share price rose more than 20% until February 2015. In February and March 2015, the stock became overbought, and the price then fell around 25%. It's not flawless, and I won't allow it to change my view on the long term value of Fonar, but it's a good sign of an entry point.
Mitigating the Risks
Any small cap stock carries with it the additional risk of volatility, illiquidity and uncertainty. The normal risks of a small market cap are somewhat mitigated here by the fact that the company has a track record of consistent earnings and revenue growth, and that its products are patent-protected to ensure minimal competition in its niche market.
An obvious risk that stands out is that Fonar is pretty much completely reliant on one man. Damadian owns around 60% of the voting shares, and is probably responsible for the innovation and manufacture of the Upright MRI scanner. There would probably be a negative reaction if he decided to leave the firm or retire, and who knows if the company could be as effective and innovative if he left. This risk is tough to quantify and tough to mitigate. I take some comfort from the fact that R&D costs are increasing again.

Figure 12: Data from TMX Money
An additional risk is the slowing or stopping of growth. The company does currently have a deficit of $142m in retained earnings on its books, which is offset by the $175m in paid-in capital. Although the $10m in cash and additional $31m in receivables make the balance sheet appear healthy, the large deficit is a concern that could limit future growth. The cash on hand is all that is available for marketing or product development, for example. Management is clearly aware of this risk, and as the company continues to be profitable, as it has over the last 5 years, the deficit is decreasing, although it's likely to remain on the books for some time, preventing, among other things, dividends to shareholders.


Figure 13: Data from TMX Money
As you can see, it's being repaid, but repaid slowly. This is likely part of the reason for FONR shares' undervaluation. Due to the company's aggressive growth over the last 5 years and the possibilities of higher growth to come, I do not believe this risk justifies the huge discount FONR shares are trading at currently, but it will be a key trend to keep an eye on in coming quarterly results.
Possible Catalysts
Future Earnings Announcements: After the drop in sales last year, investors lost some confidence in the company, but management remained undeterred by this. Even when sales revenue took a large hit, revenue from HMCA and other areas of the business kept Fonar profitable. As these areas continue to grow, Fonar revenue will reflect their progress. MRI sales are inconsistent, so a good quarter or year may lead to a surprise earnings beat and a jump in price. Over the long term, I think consistent growth will be seen, and I look forward to being able to analyze sales over a longer time frame, particularly when Fonar-360 becomes profitable.
Fonar-360: This product has the potential to shake up the industry and get Fonar some serious brand recognition. The knock-on effects of a large product can lead to a jump in market price, which is a possibility with Fonar-360.
Acquisition: Since Fonar Corp. has created such strong patent protection, it wouldn't be a surprise if one of the big players in the MRI market realised that the only way to compete with the advancements in X-ray and gamma technology is to bring Fonar products to the mass market. The extensive patent protection would mean the only way this could be done is for one of the larger MRI firms to buy out the company. Personally, I would think an attempt is very likely in the future, particularly when Fonar-360 is generating revenue. It's hard to judge how likely it would be for such an attempt to succeed, since almost 65% of the voting power belongs to the firm's founder and CEO, Raymond V. Damadian.

Fonar MRI - Maker of the Upright Multi-Position MRI


















The Craniocervical Syndrome and MRI

Rapid advances in MRI are transforming the treatment of patients suffering from the craniocervical syndrome (CCS). Articles in this publication
	have been written by leading international experts in the field to provide practioners with a better understanding of the subtle anatomy and MRI 
	appearances at the craniocervical junction, along with insight into the clinical significance of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow measurements and 
	their relationship to posture. The surgical management of patients with damage to the ligaments at the craniocervical junction and the role of 
	cervical spinal trauma in neurodegenerative diseases as well as CSF flow obstructions are also discussed.
This publication is valuable reading for practioners in the fields of radiology, neurosurgery, neurology, pain management, orthopaedic surgery 
	as well as for chiropractors and osteopaths.
Raymond Damadian, MD and David Chu, PhD of FONAR Corporation contributed a chapter entitled "The Possible Role of Craniocervical Trauma and Abnormal 
	Cerebrospinal Fluid Hydrodynamics in the Genesis of Multiple Sclerosis and the Craniocervical Syndrome.Â  Their published abstract reveals: "The importance 
	of visualizing and measuring cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow dynamics of patients in the upright position is described. Recent observations from the FONAR 
	UprightÅ½ Weight-Bearing Multi-PositionTM MRI likely to provide a new understanding of the origin of neurodegenerative diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, 
	are discussed.  The vulnerability of the human neck and its impact on CSF flow throughout the brain and spine is also linked to properly identifying the 
	craniocervical syndrome given its plethora of symptoms.Â

Fonar Upright (TM) MRI

Welcome
              to the Fonar UprightÂ® MultiâPositionâ¢ MRI. 
Don't
                  settle for a partial view of your spine.
Ask your doctor to
                see the view of your spine in which you experience your problem
                -- sitting, standing, bending, or lying
                    down.

Â 
Advantages
                of The Fonar UPRIGHTÂ® MultiâPosition MRI 
1.
                        SymptomâSpecific Positional ScanningâOnly
              With The Fonar UPRIGHTÂ® MultiâPositionâ¢ MRI 



 
 
 
 
 


              Advanced design allows the FONAR
              UprightÂ® MRI
                  to scan you in the position you experience your problemâsitting,
                  standing, bending, leaning, as well as lying down. All other
                  MRIs can only scan you while youâre lying down.
                2. Scanning With The Weight Of Your Body
                On Your Spine And Other Joints
                The Uprightâ¢ MRI allows all parts of the body to be imaged
                with the normal weight of your body on the spine and other jointsâan
                advantage that leads to a more accurate diagnosis. Imaging your
                spine when it is fully loaded with the weight of your body, as
                compared to unloaded in a conventional lieâdown MRI, is
                critical to an accurate diagnosis. As you can see by the following
                images,
                many back problems are âmissedâ when the spine is
                not bearing the weight of the body and not imaged in the positions
                the spine normally occupies. 
A New Technology for Better Diagnosis 
Now, a new technology is available that provides better diagnosis of your problem.
  Until now, all MRI exams were done with the patient lying down in a static
  position. But the Fonar UprightÂ® Multi-Position MRIâ¢ allows a dynamic
  MRI exam to be done in whatever position you experience your problem. Does
  positional imaging really make a difference? Yes, it does. The prestigious
  UCLA School of Medicine recently did a study that reveals the âmiss rateâ of
  static MRI, compared to patient problems detected with Dynamicâ¢ MRI.
  The study was done using the Fonar UprightÂ® Multi-Positionâ¢ MRI. 


LANDMARK STUDY BY UCLA SCHOOL OF MEDICINE OF
                  OVER 1,000 PATIENTS (1,302) 
                QUANTIFIES THE "MISS RATE" OF STATIC MRI*
(Static MRI is defined by UCLA as being scanned in one position,
                sitting straight up. It does not include being scanned in multiple
                positions, such as flexion (bending forward), extension (bending
                backward), lateral bending, or rotation.)
The Findings Could Substantially
                Improve Surgical Outcomes For Back Pain



L4-5 is the area of the lumbar spine, or
                      lower back, where most back problems occur (âMiss
                      Rateâ 35.1%). L3-4 is the second most frequent location
                      of back problems (âMiss Rate 38.7%).

Answers For Your Doctor
                  Many physicians are familiar with the advantages of the Fonar
                    UprightÂ® MultiâPositionâ¢ MRI.
  But the advanced technology is relatively new, so your doctor may say a conventional
  lie-down MRI is good enough. But no other MRI can see your problem in the position
  you experience it. Fonar images are indistinguishable from images made with
                    conventional MRIs. Hereâs how you can prove it to your
                    doctor. Show
  him these side-by-side images and ask him to tell you which ones were made
  with the Fonar UPRIGHTÂ® and which ones were made with a 1.5 Tesla MRI.
  To learn the correct answers, he or she is invited to call us toll-free at
  1-888-NEEDMRI.

3.
                        Unrivaled Comfort; Watch TV During Your Scan
You simply walk in, sit down, and watch TV during
                      your scan. You are not slid into the usual tube. This open
                      comfort is especially good for people who are claustrophobic.

                      incidence of breast cancer among women who had scoliosis
                      as children and were scanned multiple times a year to evaluate
                      the condition. The Fonar UprightÂ® MRI offers the first
                      radiation-free monitoring and the end of later-life breast
                      cancer due to overexposure to spine x-rays.





5. Scans Children, Who
                      Sit In Their Motherâs Lap; Usually Requires No Anesthesia
                      And Avoids Exposure Of Children To X-Rays
Â 
6.Scans Overweight Patients

Â  



THE PROOF
                      IS IN THE PICTUREâ¢
      More Cases Where the Patientâs Problem was âMissedâ Lying
      Down But Seen UPRIGHTÂ®
      Case 1
 Here
        are two scans of a patient with low back pain. The patient had surgery
        but the pain and symptoms continued to get worse. The image on the left
          was made with the patient lying down. It shows a normal alignment of
          the
          vertebrae.
          The
          image on
        the right, which was done UprightÂ®, revealed that the patient
        had a dramatic spinal instability that the lyingâdown scan did
        not reveal and that the first surgery did not address. Following visualization
        of
        the spinal dislocation seen by the UPRIGHTÂ® MRI, the patient underwent
        surgery a second time. The patient has been pain free ever since.

Advanced Search

                There are 3 types of search. Please only use one option at a time.
                
1) Build a boolean search string.
Ensure that document matches include...

...all of these word(s):



...and optionally include these word(s):



...but do not have these word(s):




2) Search for a phrase:

Enter your phrase:




3) Search on part of a word:

Enter the first few characters of a word:




Submit



Information on how to use Search

                    There are 2 types of basic queries: Terms and Phrases.
                    A Term is a single word search.
                    A Phrase would wrap a string of words in quotes and find matches on the extact string.
                

Boolean Operators
You can combine basic queries with Boolean operators to form a more complex query. Boolean operators define the relationships between Terms or Phrases. Our search supports the following Boolean operators: AND, "+", OR, NOT and "-". Please note that Boolean operators must be all uppercase.
                

AND
example search: default AND document
                    This is the default operator. It will be used if there is no Boolean operator between two terms. For example:
                    default document is the same as default AND document. In this case both terms need to exist within a listing to find a match on that listing.The + character is synonymous with using AND.
                

OR
example search: default OR document
                    In this case just one of the terms needs to exist within a listing to find a match on that listing.
                

NOT
example search: default NOT "document type"
                    The NOT operator excludes documents that contain the term (or phrase) after NOT. So a listing match would have to include the word default but not the phrase "document type". The - character is synonymous with using NOT.
                

Wildcard/Prefix queries
You can perform "wildcard" or "prefix" queries using the '*' operator. Whereas all of the previous search found exact matches on the whole term or phrase, a wildcard search will find partial matches.
                    example search: ehr*
                    This query will match all documents containing words beginning with the prefix 'ehr' like the word Ehrlichia.

Q:

A: The terms of the Preferred Stock are similar to those of Common

                      Preferred Stock has received four dividends of $0.62 per share. Although there is no public market for Class
                  A Non-Voting Preferred Stock, at some point in the future it is possible that it will become publicly traded. 
 

Q: 
                    Can the Non-voting Class A Preferred stock be sold or bought?
 
A: Yes, but only if done so privately. The Class A Non-Voting Preferred
                      Stock is not qualified or registered for trading on the NASDAQ system or any exchange at this time and there
                  is no known market. The financial markets do not post a price. 
 

Q: 
                    What was the record date for the issuance of the Class A Non-voting Preferred Stock?

A: The Company issued Class A Non-Voting Preferred Stock to owners
                      of record of the Common Stock as of October 20, 1995. The amount given was at a ratio of one share of Preferred
                  Stock for every 5 shares of Common Stock. 
 

Q: 
                    Why were the dividend payments made?

A: The dividend payments were the result of FONAR's successful enforcement
                  of the Company's patents. 
 

Q: 
                    Will there be any more dividend payments?
A: Additional dividends may be paid depending on the proceeds received
                  from the enforcement of the Company's patents.

Q: 
                    What are the details regarding the 1 for 25 reverse stock split?
FONAR effected a reverse stock split at a ratio of 1:25 (one new share for every 25 shares)
                    of its outstanding Common Stock and all other classes of its outstanding stock, effective as of April 17,
                    2007. The reason the Company implemented the reverse stock split was to retain its listing on NASDAQ. At a
                    hearing held before the NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel (âPanelâ) on February 15, 2007, FONARâs
                    request for continued listing on The NASDAQ Stock Market was granted, subject to the condition that on or
                    before May 1, 2007, the Company must have evidenced a closing bid price of $1.00 or more for a minimum of
                    ten consecutive trading days. The Panelâs decision was based on its determination that the reverse stock
                    split to be presented at the Annual Meeting on April 16, 2007, when implemented, would be likely to cure the
                    bid price deficiency and allow the Company to maintain compliance for the longer term. Following the reverse
                    stock split, the NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel found the Company to be in full compliance with its listing
                  requirements, including its share price, and the post-split price performance of FONAR shares.
