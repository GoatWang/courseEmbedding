      Dr. John W. Kozarich, Chairman of the Board. “Also, 
      on behalf of Ligand’s Board of Directors, I 
      want to thank Liz for her significant contribution during Ligand’s 
      important transition during the past year. We sincerely appreciate her 
      service and wish her all the best in her future endeavors.”


      Dr. Sabba has been a leading Research Analyst and Bio Fund Manager for 
      Knott Partners Management, an investment fund company, since November, 
      2006. Previously he was a Partner and Director of Research with Kilkenny

      York.
    

      He received his medical degree from the New York University School of 
      Medicine, and completed a residency in internal medicine and a
