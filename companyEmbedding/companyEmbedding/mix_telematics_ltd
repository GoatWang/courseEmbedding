M2M Device Certification Services







The Importance of Device Certification
Network device certification is a non-negotiable requirement for bringing new devices onto existing carrier networks. Regardless of whether the module (modem) component within a device has passed certification, any new device is required to do so as well prior to allowing commercial deployment. The goal of device certification is to identify and fix issues related to the quality of service on the desired network. Device certification testing ensures maximum device performance and minimum risk of service disruptions that could jeopardize the entire network infrastructure.
What is Device Certification?
Device certification is a series of standardized tests with acceptable parameters of results (think: passing grades). These tests are conducted specifically by designated test labs that demonstrate that a device operates properly and within acceptable means when connected to a wireless network. Device certification is required for new modules and devices as well as whenever any changes are made to an approved module or device. The actual time and cost required to complete certification will vary depending on the approval requirements.
The fastest, and often the most cost-effective, device certification strategy is avoiding the need to go through the process in the first place. If at all possible, use a pre-approved device unless there is a compelling reason to build a new one. If a new end device is required, make sure a pre-approved module from a reputable OEM is used in the design. You can view a list of pre-approved devices here.
If a pre-approved device or module that suits your needs is not available, then KORE can help you through the process of device certification.
KORE’s M2M Device Certification Professional Services
KORE offers its IoT/M2M customers full-service device certification services managed by a dedicated team of experienced employees, some of whom represent KORE on the boards of the regulatory standards bodies. 
KORE has helped numerous customers with M2M device certification and has a strong and proven track record of helping customers get their devices certified. We help you get your devices certified with the least investment expense in terms of personnel and resources, in the least amount of time, and with the highest probability of success. KORE brings numerous resources to the table, including experience and formal relationships with OEMs, operators, and even test labs. 
KORE has a partnership with RFI Global, a leading provider of GSM test lab services, and with Intertek, a specialty lab for CDMA certification testing services. These members of our M2M certified partnership program are experts in creating a clear path to successful certification. Both partners have the regulatory compliance expertise necessary to make sure the devices conform to the regulatory standards required for full-scale commercial deployment in the markets in question.
For companies seeking a wider array of engineering services, KORE has partnerships in place with leading “one-stop shops” – experts who can provide consultation on everything, including help with device design, application validation, contract manufacturing, device certification, and much more.
If you are interested in learning more about KORE’s device certification programs and partnerships, or if you have questions about our networks powering the Internet of Things, please complete the contact form at the top right of this page, or contact us by phone or e-mail.

Safety
Identifying and correcting bad driver behavior is the first step to reducing risk and increasing safety levels.
Research indicates that human error is to blame for around 80% of motor collisions. As a result, fleet owners are under mounting pressure to not only identify risky behavior, but to take corrective action and improve safety levels.
Our end-to-end safety solutions, together with additional devices like the MiX Rovi or RIBAS Display, have become well-known as powerful risk reduction tools.Find out more

					MiX Fleet Manager Premium			





 


MiX Fleet Manager Premium offers fleet operators unlimited access to information about their vehicles and drivers, with a host of features, tools and reports to help maximize return on investment. 

The solution comprises a sophisticated on-board computer, which collects and transmits valuable vehicle and driver data. This data is hosted in one of several top-tier data centers, and information is accessible online or via a mobile app (for Android or iOS).

Our customers from around the world agree: whatever the goal – be it to save fuel, increase utilization or improve customer service – MiX Fleet Manager Premium is proven to bring about guaranteed and significant results.    






Features
Key insights into your fleet’s performance.



Superior platform
Vital tracking functionality
Live information streams
Powerful reporting suite
Flexible to your every need






 


Superior platform
The MiX Fleet Manager Premium software platform is where all the magic happens. As well as being completely secure, it is packed with features to help fleet operators make informed and timely decisions regarding the performance of their fleet.










 


Vital tracking functionality
The tracking module provides a real-time view of a vehicle or asset’s position – whether it’s stationary or on the move – and which driver is behind the wheel. It also shows information relating to speed, driving direction, ignition status, driving violations, past trips and more. 









 


Live information streams
Proactive monitoring is possible thanks to live streams of information. These streams are user-defined and contain information about events as well as messages to and from the connected asset and/or driver. For priority trips, a stream can be undocked and kept open while navigating the rest of the application. 










 


Powerful reporting suite
The solution’s robust reporting capability enables data to be reviewed and analyzed in detail as well as in dynamic and customizable formats. Reports include movement, location, and trip and utilization reports, as well as driver scoring, fuel, event violations and cost analysis reports.









 


Flexible to your every need
MiX Fleet Manager Premium is compatible with a flexible range of services, add-ons and accessories by MiX Telematics. Depending on specific operational goals or regional requirements, customers can choose from video recording systems, in-cab navigation and messaging devices, driver engagement tools, an Hours of Service solution, journey management and satellite communication among others.











Benefits
Reduce, improve and prosper.



Use up to 15% less fuel
Improve driver behavior – and safety
Maximize fleet efficiency
Delight your customers






 


Use up to 15% less fuel
The rising cost of fuel has a major impact on fleet businesses. But with MiX Fleet Manager Premium, not only can fuel consumption be monitored and reduced by up to 15% in some instances, but behavioral aspects relating to efficient driving can be detected and corrected thanks to advanced reporting and analytics.










 


Improve driver behavior – and safety
Vehicles that are driven well naturally perform more efficiently and require less maintenance. MiX Fleet Manager Premium provides all the tools necessary to monitor, manage and improve driver behavior – not only for efficiency purposes, but for increased safety too. 










 


Maximize fleet efficiency
Getting the most from a fleet is another major concern. Which is why activity timelines are particularly useful to illustrate utilization patterns and assist in boosting fleet efficiency. Service and licensing schedules can be managed through automated reminders.










 


Delight your customers
Because MiX Fleet Manager Premium provides visibility over a fleet, customer service is one more aspect that improves as a result. The solution includes a find-nearest-vehicle function, which allows fleet managers to identify the closest vehicle to a customer site and route them there directly.









Resources
Better, safer, and more efficient fleet operations, translating into increased profitability over time. 








At any given time, our customers are enhancing their safety, lowering their risk, becoming more profitable or reducing their impact on the environment.

Light and affordable fleet management, for everyone.
If you thought fleet management was only for the “heavyweights” of the fleet world, then think again. Introducing MiX Fleet Manager Essential, a solution designed to give fleets of all sizes and types exactly what they need to boost efficiency – no more, no less.
MiX Fleet Manager Essential enables fleet operators to track and trace the movement and behavior of their vehicles and drivers from anywhere, at any time. 
For that to happen, vehicles are fitted with a small on-board computer that captures and transmits vehicle and driver data. Users can then access this information online, via the solution’s software platform. Some features are also available via MiX Fleet Manager Mobile, the solution’s free app for Android and iOS. 
Be it a fleet of trucks or a mixed fleet of cars, vans and motorcycles, MiX Fleet Manager Essential is fleet management made easy.

 Tools to ensure your bus and coach fleet runs efficiently and safely.Contact us









HomeIndustriesPublic Transport










					Public Transport			






Having a reliable telematics solution to monitor both drivers and vehicles enables bus operators to manage their performance when it comes to safety and efficiency. MiX Telematics customers, for example, are saving an average of 10% on their fuel costs.According to ABI Research, the emergence of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and smart city initiatives mean that more and more public transport operators are turning to, and implementing, telematics technologies to keep up with changing requirements.
 


Among other features, operators choose a fleet management solution to:

Monitor driver behaviour to improve fuel efficiency and reduce accidents.
Ensure the safety of their passengers.
Locate their vehicles to determine on-time arrivals along predetermined routes and at scheduled stops.
Locate vehicles within a yard to facilitate servicing and licensing procedures.
Monitor vehicles’ trip durations as well as drivers’ working hours.



 













At any given time, our customers are enhancing their safety, lowering their risk, becoming more profitable or reducing their impact on the environment.

 “We value human life above all else and this solution has certainly helped in ensuring our drivers arrive home safe every day.” Richard Suckling, Fonterra Milk Collection (New Zealand)

					Safety			

Identifying and correcting poor driver behavior is the first step to reducing risk and increasing safety levels.


Research indicates that human error is to blame in approximately 80% of motor collisions. As a result, fleet owners are under mounting pressure to not only identify risky driver behavior, but to take corrective action and improve safety levels.
Our end-to-end safety solutions have become an invaluable tool for small and large fleets, enabling them to:

Identify and correct poor driving.
Monitor drivers in relation to past performance.
Implement targeted driver training.
Develop customized driver safety policies.
Keep their vehicles serviced and safe on the road.

Matrix and Beame, our consumer solutions in South Africa, boast stand-out features like insurance approval, roadside assistance, automated tax logbook and crash alert.

Fleet Management
As a fleet manager, it is crucial to your business to not only track your vehicles, but to have access to immediate, secure information about your fleet at all times. You need to monitor the locations and statuses of their vehicles and drivers, without incurring the complexity of a full fleet management system.
Fleet management solutions by MiX Telematics present an effective offering which suits fleets of varying sizes and types – from trucks to light commercial vehicles, to motorcycles. Even the entry-level fleet management technology by MiX Telematics enables customers to have direct control over their mobile assets and workforce at all times.

Reduce fleet operating costs
Using MiX Telematics solutions you will be able to capture and compare the driving style and fuel efficiency of your staff. Used alongside an appropriate incentive scheme and driver training, you will be able to use this information to achieve dramatic improvements in fuel efficiency.


Improve passenger comfort and safety
Smoother driving results in enhanced passenger comfort which leads to greater patronage and brand loyalty. Safer driving styles achieved through the MiX Telematics fleet management solution means lower accident rates. Additionally, you will be able to use any improved claims history to negotiate preferential insurance premiums.



Lower CO2 emissions
Reducing carbon emissions is particularly important for the road transport industry, which is alone responsible for 18% of CO2 emissions globally. MiX Telematics is the first telematics provider in the world to offer a service that enables fleet operators to take responsibility for their carbon footprint. Our solutions enable clients to minimise the CO2 emissions of their organisations.

Vision

"To be the leading global provider of information and related services for mobile assets."

MiX Telematics’ strategy is to leverage its profitable, cash generative business by expanding its recurring revenue model through the company’s worldwide distribution network. With significant critical mass, a global footprint, a large subscriber base and a history of operating successfully in international markets, MiX Telematics is ideally positioned to take advantage of significant international and local growth opportunities.
 


Heritage
The listing of MiX Telematics in 2007 marked the birth of a new global leader in the vehicle tracking and fleet management industry. The company’s standing as a global player today is the result of a culmination of numerous business successes, key leadership and expertise, and decisions of strategic value.  




The business started out in South Africa in 1995 as Matrix Vehicle Tracking, a consumer-facing business focused on superior vehicle recovery and personal safety; services were delivered using cutting edge GSM–based tracking technology.

    MiX Telematics Ltd B-BBEE Certificate



Matrix soon became one of the leading vehicle tracking and stolen vehicle recovery service providers in South Africa, and the first to emphasise the safety of the individual as opposed to the vehicle – a value the company still applies fully today. While Matrix Vehicle Tracking was growing its consumer-base in South Africa, another South African business known as Omnibridge was gaining significant ground in the international commercial fleet management market. Omnibridge, which was founded as CI Fleet Management, was responsible for the design and development of the Siemens VDO Fleet Manager (FM) product range. The product range was branded VDO Fleet Manager and sold by Siemens worldwide.
 
In May 2007, Omnibridge acquired the distribution rights for its Fleet Manager product range from Siemens VDO, while simultaneously acquiring Siemens VDO’s UK-based fleet management and commercial vehicle outfitting businesses, including the Datatrak product range and network. In 2007, Matrix Vehicle Tracking acquired Omnibridge and these two businesses merged and went on to list on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange in November 2007.
 
Given the company’s vision to become the leading global provider of information and related services for mobile assets, the decision was made to re-brand to MiX Telematics in early 2008. The new brand captured the core of the business - ‘Mobile Information Exchange’ and telematics expertise - while enabling all business aspects, past and present, to come together and adopt a shared vision and philosophy.
 
Recent developments, over 2008 and 2009, include MiX Telematics’ acquisition of Tripmaster in the United States and SafeDrive International (SDI) based in Dubai and Perth. MiX Telematics North America builds upon the legacy of the Tripmaster brand by continuing to provide commercial fleet operators with greater efficiency and safety levels, as well as Hours of Service & IFTA compliance. SDI now forms part of MiX Telematics Middle East, which successfully serves the Middle East and Australian markets through offices in Dubai and Perth.

These companies spent over $1 billion buying back shares while their CEOs were dumping them
