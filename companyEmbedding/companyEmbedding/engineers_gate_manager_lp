Consensus Ratings for ACCO Brands (NYSE:ABD) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A

What are analysts saying about CA stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about CA stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "CA is a leading information technology (IT) management software company. We are optimistic about CA’s acquisition strategy, which has enhanced its IT management, software and services portfolio. Moreover, we believe that the diversity of its products and the increased efficiency offered by them will attract customers across sectors, lending stability to its business model. Additionally, CA’s “go to market” sales strategy integrates the commercial functions of sales, marketing, brand management, pricing and consumer insight, which helps it in lowering costs, thereby improving the bottom line. Nonetheless, intensifying competition from peers, an uncertain economic environment, currency headwinds and the weak IT spending forecast by Gartner are other concerns. Notably, shares of the company has underperformed the broader market over the last one year period." (7/17/2017)
2. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "CA announced the acquisition of privately held Veracode for $614M in cash. Veracode provides SaaS-based application security for integration across the software development lifecycle. The deal value represents about 6.0-8.0x NTM revenue, which we view as reasonable, and discuss in more detail below. We believe providing security at the application level will become even more important over time given the ever increasing distributed nature of IT infrastructures." (3/7/2017)

 Career History



President

                                    Current                


Engineers Gate Manager LP


                  Engineers Gate Manager's (EGM) objective is to generate high quality, risk adjusted returns on their clients' invested capital. They seek to achieve this objective through a research intensive and data-driven quantitative and systematic trading and investment program over a multi-year period. EGM employs investment techniques and strategies generally referred to as statistical arbitrage. The firm seeks to identify high positive or negative correlations between securities or other instruments, assets, or economic/financial conditions and to profit when prices or values related to those instruments, assets or conditions change in an uncorrelated manner. These arbitrage opportunities can be extremely short-lived (which necessitates a trading system that can make decisions and effect executions quickly) or can exist for a somewhat longer period (which can allow for more of a focus on strategic timing). EGM's investment program may also seek to identify asset classes that have inherent, built-in inefficiencies and building portfolios to acquire and hold (or to sell short) those asset classes. EGM may employ active or passive hedges for a number of reasons, including risk management. Hedges can be specific to one or more positions or strategies or to the funds' portfolios as a whole. The firm may invests the funds' assets, directly or indirectly, on margin or otherwise, in interests the securities or other financial instruments of US and non-US entities and other assets. This includes, but is not limited to: capital stock; shares of beneficial interest; partnership interests and similar financial instruments; bonds, notes and debentures (subordinated, convertible or otherwise); currencies; commodities; physical and intangible assets; interest rate, currency, commodity, equity and other derivative products; loans; accounts and notes receivable and payable held by trade or other creditors; trade acceptances; contract and other claims; executory contracts; participations; mutual funds, ETFs and similar financial instruments; money market funds; obligations of the US or any non-US government (or any country, state, governmental agency or political subdivision thereof); commercial paper; CDs; bankers' acceptances; trust receipts; and any other obligations and instruments, whether or not publicly traded or readily marketable. Derivatives in which EGM may invest fund assets include: futures contracts (and options thereon) relating to stock indices, currencies, US government securities and securities of non-US governments, other financial instruments and all other commodities; swaps, options, swaptions, warrants, caps, collars, floors and forward rate agreements; spot and forward currency transactions; and agreements relating to or securing such transactions.
