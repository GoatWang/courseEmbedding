Education and early career[edit]
Cox received a bachelor's degree in symbolic systems with a concentration in artificial intelligence from Stanford University, which he attended from 2001 to 2004.[3] Cox dropped out of a graduate degree program at Stanford to join Facebook in 2005.[2] He started as a software engineer and worked on first versions of many key Facebook products, including News Feed. As a 25-year-old engineer, he was promoted to Director of Human Resources[4] and later to Vice President of Product[2][5] before becoming Chief Product Officer.[1] As of July 2016 he held approximately 391 thousand Facebook shares worth $45 million. [6]
Facebook[edit]
Cox oversees hundreds of engineers, designers and product managers[7] responsible for new features and products. He helped build Facebook’s News Feed and still oversees the News Feed team.[1] His May 2014 promotion to Chief Product Officer “cements (him) as a leader of Facebook alongside COO Sheryl Sandberg.”[1] Cox gives a talk to all new recruits about Facebook’s mission, culture and philosophy.[5]
Reputation[edit]
Business Insider called Cox “a triple threat — an engineer who can build company-defining products, an operator who can recruit and manage good people, and a long-term strategic thinker.”[8] He is also known for his focus on bringing people and technology together. “Technology does not need to estrange us from one another,” Cox told Wired. “The physical reality comes alive with the human stories we have told there.”[9]
Philosophy[edit]
Cox envisions a future in which what your friends recommend on social networks plays a bigger role in what you buy, do, or watch on TV. He told The Wall Street Journal that he believes there will be a time “when you turn on the TV, and you see what your mom and friends are watching, and they can record stuff for you. Instead of 999 channels, you will see 999 recommendations from your friends."[2]
Personal life[edit]
Cox was born in Atlanta and raised in Winnetka, Illinois.[7] At an early age, he learned to play piano and to program computers.[7] He has played in New Trier's jazz band[7] and is considered a “remarkably talented keyboardist” in a reggae band.[1]
Late in 2010, Cox married his college sweetheart Visra Vichit-Vadakan, a trained biologist turned movie director[10] and granddaughter of Luang Wichitwathakan,[11] a Thai politician, historian, novelist and playwright.

Education and early career[edit]
Cox received a bachelor's degree in symbolic systems with a concentration in artificial intelligence from Stanford University, which he attended from 2001 to 2004.[3] Cox dropped out of a graduate degree program at Stanford to join Facebook in 2005.[2] He started as a software engineer and worked on first versions of many key Facebook products, including News Feed. As a 25-year-old engineer, he was promoted to Director of Human Resources[4] and later to Vice President of Product[2][5] before becoming Chief Product Officer.[1] As of July 2016 he held approximately 391 thousand Facebook shares worth $45 million. [6]
Facebook[edit]
Cox oversees hundreds of engineers, designers and product managers[7] responsible for new features and products. He helped build Facebook’s News Feed and still oversees the News Feed team.[1] His May 2014 promotion to Chief Product Officer “cements (him) as a leader of Facebook alongside COO Sheryl Sandberg.”[1] Cox gives a talk to all new recruits about Facebook’s mission, culture and philosophy.[5]
Reputation[edit]
Business Insider called Cox “a triple threat — an engineer who can build company-defining products, an operator who can recruit and manage good people, and a long-term strategic thinker.”[8] He is also known for his focus on bringing people and technology together. “Technology does not need to estrange us from one another,” Cox told Wired. “The physical reality comes alive with the human stories we have told there.”[9]
Philosophy[edit]
Cox envisions a future in which what your friends recommend on social networks plays a bigger role in what you buy, do, or watch on TV. He told The Wall Street Journal that he believes there will be a time “when you turn on the TV, and you see what your mom and friends are watching, and they can record stuff for you. Instead of 999 channels, you will see 999 recommendations from your friends."[2]
Personal life[edit]
Cox was born in Atlanta and raised in Winnetka, Illinois.[7] At an early age, he learned to play piano and to program computers.[7] He has played in New Trier's jazz band[7] and is considered a “remarkably talented keyboardist” in a reggae band.[1]
Late in 2010, Cox married his college sweetheart Visra Vichit-Vadakan, a trained biologist turned movie director[10] and granddaughter of Luang Wichitwathakan,[11] a Thai politician, historian, novelist and playwright.
