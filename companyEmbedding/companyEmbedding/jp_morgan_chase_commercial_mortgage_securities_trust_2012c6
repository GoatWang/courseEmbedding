                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Neither this document nor anything contained herein shall form the basis for any contract or commitment whatsoever.  The information contained herein is preliminary as of the date hereof, supersedes any previous such information delivered to you and will be superseded by any such information subsequently delivered prior to the time of sale.  These materials are subject to change, completion or amendment from time to time.
 
The attached information contains certain tables and other statistical analyses (the “Computational Materials”) that have been prepared in reliance upon information furnished by the Mortgage Loan Seller.  Numerous assumptions were used in preparing the Computational Materials, which may or may not be reflected herein.  The Computational Materials should not be construed as either projections or predictions or as legal, tax, financial or accounting advice.  You should consult your own counsel, accountant and other advisors as to the legal, tax, business, financial and related aspects of a purchase of these securities.  Any weighted average lives, yields and principal payment periods shown in the Computational Materials are based on prepayment and/or loss assumptions, and changes in such prepayment and/or loss assumptions may dramatically affect such weighted average lives, yields and principal payment periods.  In
addition, it is possible that prepayments or losses on the underlying assets will occur at rates higher or lower than the rates shown in the attached Computational Materials.  The specific characteristics of the securities may differ from those shown in the Computational Materials due to differences between the final underlying assets and the preliminary underlying assets used in preparing the Computational Materials.  The principal amount and designation of any security described in the Computational Materials are subject to change prior to issuance. None of the Underwriters nor any of their respective affiliates  any representation or warranty as to the actual rate or timing of payments or losses on any of the underlying assets or the payments or yield on the securities.
 
This information is based upon management forecasts and reflects prevailing conditions and management’s views as of this date, all of which are subject to change.
 
This document contains forward-looking statements.  Those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause the success of collections and the actual cash flow generated to differ materially from the information set forth herein.  While such information reflects projections prepared in good faith based upon methods and data that are believed to be reasonable and accurate as of the dates thereof, the issuer undertakes no obligation to revise these forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.  Investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements and are advised to make their own independent analysis and determination with respect to the forecasted periods, which reflect the issuer’s view only as of the date hereof.

(1)


Does not reflect the Class R Certificates.
 







(2)


In the case of each such Class, subject to a permitted variance of plus or minus 5%.
 







(3)


The credit support percentages set forth for Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3 and Class A-SB Certificates represent the approximate initial credit support for the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3 and Class A-SB Certificates in the aggregate.
 







(4)


Assumes 0% CPR / 0% CDR and an April 26, 2012 settlement date. Based on Modeling Assumptions as described in the Free Writing Prospectus, dated April 9, 2012 (the “Free Writing Prospectus”).
 







(5)


The “Certificate Principal to Value Ratio” for any Class (other than the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3 and Class A-SB Certificates) is calculated as the product of (a) the weighted average Cut-off Date LTV Ratio for the mortgage loans, multiplied by (b) a fraction, the numerator of which is the total Certificate Balance of such Class of Certificates and all Classes of Certificates senior to such Class of Certificates and the denominator of which is the total initial certificate principal balance of all of the principal balance certificates. The Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3 and Class A-SB Certificate Principal to Value Ratios are calculated in the aggregate for those Classes as if they were a single Class. Investors should note, however, that excess from any mortgage loan will not be available to offset losses on any other mortgage loan.
 







(6)


The “Underwritten NOI Debt Yield” for any Class (other than the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3 and Class A-SB Certificates) is calculated as the product of (a) the weighted average UW NOI Debt Yield for the mortgage loans, multiplied by (b) a fraction, the numerator of which is the total Certificate Balance of all of the Principal Balance Certificates and the denominator of which is the total Certificate Balance for such Class and all Classes of Certificates senior to such Class of Certificates. The Underwritten NOI Debt Yield for each of the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3 and Class A-SB Certificates is calculated in the aggregate for those Classes as if they were a single Class. Investors should note, however, that net operating income from any mortgage loan supports only the related mortgage loan and will not be available to support any other mortgage loan.
 







(7)


The Class X-A and Class X-B Notional Amounts are defined in the Free Writing Prospectus.

The Pass-Through Rate for the Class X-A Certificates for any Distribution Date will equal the excess, if any, of (a) the WAC Rate for the related Distribution Date, over (b) the weighted average of the Pass-Through Rates on the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-SB and Class A-S Certificates weighted on the basis of their respective Certificate Balances immediately prior to that Distribution Date.
 
The Pass-Through Rate for the Class X-B Certificates for any Distribution Date will equal the excess, if any, of (a) the WAC Rate for the related Distribution Date, over (b) the weighted average of the Pass-Through Rates on the Class B, Class C, Class D, Class E, Class F, Class G, Class H and Class NR Certificates, weighted on the basis of their respective Certificate Balances immediately prior to that Distribution Date.
 
See “Description of the Certificates—Distributions” in the Free Writing Prospectus.

Distribution of
Principal:
 


On any Distribution Date prior to the Cross-Over Date, payments in respect of principal of the Certificates will be distributed first, to the Class A-SB Certificates, until the certificate balance of the Class A-SB Certificates is reduced to the planned principal balance for the related distributed date set forth in Annex E to the Free Writing Prospectus, then to the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-SB, Class A-S, Class B, Class C, Class D, Class E, Class F, Class G, Class H and Class NR Certificates, in that order, until the Certificate Balance of each such Class is reduced to zero.  On any Distribution Date on or after the Cross-Over Date, payments in respect of principal of the Certificates will be distributed first to the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3 and Class A-SB Certificates, on a pro rata basis, based on the Certificate Balance of each such Class, and then, to the Class A-S, Class
B, Class C, Class D, Class E, Class F, Class G, Class H and Class NR Certificates, in that order, in each case until the Certificate Balance of each such Class is reduced to zero.
 
The “Cross-Over Date” means the Distribution Date on which the aggregate Certificate Balances of the Class A-S, Class B, Class C, Class D, Class E, Class F, Class G, Class H and Class NR Certificates have been reduced to zero (after taking into account any allocation of realized losses on the mortgage loans to such Classes on or prior to such date). The Class X-A and Class X-B Certificates will not be entitled to receive distributions of principal; however, the notional amount of the Class X-A Certificates will be reduced by the aggregate amount of principal distributions, realized losses and trust fund expenses allocated to Certificates that are components of the Class X-A Certificates’ notional amount (the principal balances of the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-SB and Class A-S Certificates) and the notional amount of the Class X-B Certificates will be reduced by the aggregate amount of principal distributions,
realized losses and trust fund expenses allocated to Certificates that are components of the Class X-B Certificates’ notional amount (the principal balances of the Class B, Class C, Class D, Class E, Class F, Class G, Class H and Class NR Certificates).

■

Yield Maintenance Allocation:


For purposes of the distribution of Yield Maintenance Charges on any Distribution Date, Yield Maintenance Charges collected in respect of the mortgage loans will first be allocated pro rata between two groups (based on the amount of principal distributed to the principal balance classes in each group), consisting of the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-SB, Class X-A and Class A-S Certificates, on the one hand (“YM Group A”) and the Class B, Class C, Class D, Class E, Class F and Class X-B Certificates, on the other hand (“YM Group B”). As among the Classes of Certificates in each YM Group, each Class of Certificates entitled to distributions of principal will receive an amount calculated generally in accordance with the following formula and as more specifically described in the Free Writing Prospectus,
with any remaining Yield Maintenance Charges on such Distribution Date being distributed to the class of Class X Certificates in such YM Group.


 




  
  

YM
Charge


x


Principal Paid to Class


x


(Pass-Through Rate on Class - Discount Rate)

 

  
  

Total Principal Paid


(Mortgage Rate on Loan - Discount Rate)

 



 


 
 

No Yield Maintenance Charges will be distributed to the Class G, Class H or Class NR Certificates.  Once the principal balances of the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-SB, Class A-S, Class B, Class C, Class D, Class E and Class F Certificates have been reduced to zero, all Yield Maintenance Charges will be distributed to the holders of the Class X-B Certificates.


 
 
 

■

Realized Losses:
 


Realized losses on the mortgage loans will be allocated first to the Class NR, Class H, Class G, Class F, Class E, Class D, Class C, Class B and Class A-S Certificates, in that order, in each case until the Certificate Balance of each such Class has been reduced to zero, and then, to the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-SB Certificates, on a pro rata basis, based on the Certificate Balance of each such class, until the Certificate Balance of each such Class has been reduced to zero.  The notional amount of the Class X-A and Class X-B Certificates will be reduced by the aggregate amount of realized losses allocated to Certificates that are components of the Class X-A Certificates’ and Class X-B Certificates’ notional amounts, respectively.
 


■

Interest Shortfalls:


A shortfall with respect to the amount of available funds distributable in respect of interest can result from, among other sources: (a) delinquencies and defaults by borrowers; (b) shortfalls resulting from the application of Appraisal Reductions to reduce P&I Advances; (c) shortfalls resulting from interest on Advances made by the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Trustee; (d) shortfalls resulting from the payment of Special Servicing Fees and other additional compensation that the Special Servicer is entitled to receive; (e) shortfalls resulting from extraordinary expenses of the trust, including indemnification payments payable to the Depositor, Master Servicer, Special Servicer, Certificate Administrator, Trustee or Senior Trust Advisor; (f) shortfalls resulting from a modification of a mortgage loans’ interest rate or principal balance; (g) and shortfalls resulting from other unanticipated or default-related
expenses of the trust.  Any such shortfalls that decrease the amount of available funds distributable in respect of interest to the Certificateholders will reduce distributions to the classes of Certificates (other than the Class R Certificates), beginning with those with the lowest payment priorities, in reverse sequential order. See “Description of the Certificates—Distributions—Priority” in the Free Writing Prospectus.
 


■

Appraisal Reductions:


Upon the occurrence of certain trigger events with respect to a mortgage loan, which are generally tied to certain events of default under the mortgage loan, the Special Servicer will be obligated to obtain an appraisal of the related Mortgaged Property and calculate the Appraisal Reduction amount.  The Appraisal Reduction amount is generally the amount by which the current principal balance of the related mortgage loan, as applicable, plus, in any case, outstanding advances, real estate taxes, unpaid servicing fees and certain similar amounts exceeds 90% of the appraised value of the related Mortgaged Property, giving effect to escrows and letters of credit. The Appraisal Reduction amount is notionally allocated to reduce, in reverse sequential order, each Class of Certificates beginning with the Class NR Certificates.

■

Appraisal Reduced
Interest:


Accrued and unpaid interest at the related Mortgage Rate for a mortgage loan that is not advanced by the Master Servicer or Trustee as backup master servicer due to the application of Appraisal Reduction amounts to such mortgage loan.
 


■

Master Servicer
Advances:


The Master Servicer will be required to advance certain delinquent scheduled mortgage loan payments of principal and interest and certain property protection advances, in each case, to the extent the Master Servicer deems such advances to be recoverable. At any time that an Appraisal Reduction amount exists (as described in the Free Writing Prospectus), the amount that would otherwise be required to be advanced by the Master Servicer in respect of delinquent payments of interest on the mortgage loan will be reduced by multiplying such delinquent interest amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the then outstanding principal balance of the mortgage loan minus the Appraisal Reduction amount and the denominator of which is the then outstanding principal balance of the mortgage loan.
 


■

Liquidated Loan
Waterfall:


On liquidation of any mortgage loan, all net liquidation proceeds will be applied so that amounts allocated as a recovery of accrued and unpaid interest will not, in the first instance, include any Appraisal Reduced Interest. After the adjusted interest amount is so allocated, any remaining liquidation proceeds will be allocated to offset certain advances and to pay principal on the mortgage loan until the unpaid principal amount of the mortgage loan has been reduced to zero. Any remaining liquidation proceeds will then be allocated to pay Appraisal Reduced Interest. Any liquidation proceeds in respect of each such mortgage loan in excess of the related outstanding balance will first be applied to offset any interest shortfalls allocated to the Certificates (other than the Class X-A and Class X-B Certificates), in sequential order and then to offset any realized losses allocated to the Certificates (other than the Class X-A
and Class X-B Certificates), in reverse sequential order. Any liquidation proceeds remaining after such applications will be distributed to the Class R Certificates.
 


■

Sale of Defaulted
Mortgage Loans and
REO Properties:


Within 30 days of a mortgage loan becoming a defaulted mortgage loan, the special servicer is required to order an appraisal and within 30 days of receipt of such appraisal is required to determine the fair value of such defaulted mortgage loan in accordance with the applicable servicing standard. If, however, the special servicer is already in the process of obtaining an appraisal with respect to the related mortgaged property, the special servicer is required to make its fair value determination as soon as reasonably practicable (but in any event within 30 days) after its receipt of such appraisal.
 
The special servicer may offer to sell or may offer to purchase any defaulted mortgage loan or REO property, if the special servicer determines that no satisfactory arrangements can be made for collection of delinquent payments and the sale would be in the best economic interests of the trust on a net present value basis. The special servicer is required to accept the highest offer for any defaulted mortgage loan or REO property in an amount at least equal to par plus accrued interest plus all other outstanding amounts due under such mortgage loan and any outstanding expenses of the trust relating to such mortgage loan (the “Purchase Price”).
 
If the special servicer does not receive an offer at least equal to the Purchase Price, the special servicer may purchase the defaulted mortgage loan or REO property at the Purchase Price. If the special servicer does not elect to purchase the defaulted mortgage loan or REO property at the Purchase Price, the special servicer is required to accept the highest offer received from any person that is determined to be a fair price (supported by an appraisal required to be obtained by the special servicer within 30 days of a mortgage loan becoming a defaulted mortgage loan) for such defaulted mortgage loan or REO property, if the highest offeror is a person other than the depositor, the master servicer, the special servicer, any borrower, any manager of a mortgaged property, any independent contractor engaged by the special servicer (in connection with offers related to the applicable mortgage loan), a holder of a related mezzanine
loan (except to the extent described below), or any known affiliate of any of them (each, an “Interested Person”). If the highest offer is made by an Interested Person, the Trustee must approve the purchase of the defaulted mortgage loan or REO property based upon its determination of the fair price for the defaulted mortgage loan or REO property (based upon updated appraisals received by the Trustee) and the Trustee may conclusively rely on the opinion of an independent appraiser or other independent expert retained by the Trustee in connection with making such determination. Neither the Trustee nor any of its affiliates may purchase a defaulted mortgage loan or REO property.

Sale of Defaulted
Mortgage Loans and
REO Properties
(continued):
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


If the special servicer does not receive any offers that are at least equal to the Purchase Price, the special servicer is not required to accept the highest offer and may accept a lower offer for a defaulted mortgage loan or REO property if the special servicer determines, in accordance with the applicable servicing standard, that a rejection of such offer would be in the best interests of the Certificateholders, so long as such lower offer was not made by the special servicer or any of its affiliates. Prior to the occurrence of a Consultation Termination Event, any sale of a defaulted mortgage loan for less than the Purchase Price will be subject to a right of first refusal held by the Directing Certificateholder, which right of first refusal must be exercised, if not waived sooner, within 10 business days of written notice from the special servicer. In the event the Directing Certificateholder does not exercise its right
of first refusal and any contemplated sale is not ultimately consummated pursuant to the proposed terms, the Directing Certificateholder will have a right of first refusal with respect to any subsequent sale of that defaulted mortgage loan by the special servicer pursuant to any new sale solicitation by the special servicer.
 
If title to any mortgaged property is acquired by the trust fund, the special servicer will be required to sell such mortgaged property prior to the close of the third calendar year beginning after the year of acquisition, unless (1) the IRS grants or has not denied an extension of time to sell such mortgaged property or (2) the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator and the Master Servicer receive an opinion of independent counsel to the effect that the holding of the property by the trust fund longer than the above-referenced three year period will not result in the imposition of a tax on either REMIC of the trust or cause the trust fund (or either REMIC of the trust fund) to fail to qualify as a REMIC. See “Servicing of the Mortgage Loans—Realization Upon Defaulted Mortgage Loans” in the Free Writing Prospectus.
 


■

Control Rights:
 


Pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, there will be a control regime whereby certain Classes of Certificates (the “Control Eligible Certificates”) will have certain control rights attached to them. The majority owner or appointed representative of the Class of Control Eligible Certificates that at any time of determination happens to be the Controlling Class (such owner or representative the “Directing Certificateholder”), will be entitled to direct the Special Servicer to take, or refrain from taking certain actions with respect to a mortgage loan. Furthermore, the Directing Certificateholder will also have the right to notice and consent to certain material actions that the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer plan on taking with respect to a mortgage loan.
 


■

Directing
Certificateholder:


BlackRock Financial Management, Inc. (or one of its affiliates) will be the initial Directing Certificateholder and one or more of its managed accounts will also own 100% of the Class G, Class H and Class NR Certificates as of the Closing Date.
 


■

Controlling Class:


The Controlling Class will at any time of determination be the most subordinate Class of Control Eligible Certificates then outstanding that has an aggregate Certificate Balance, as notionally reduced by any Appraisal Reductions allocable to such Class, equal to no less than 25% of the initial Certificate Balance for such Class.
 
The Controlling Class as of the Closing Date will be the Class NR Certificates.
 


■

Control Eligible
Certificates:
 


Class G, Class H and Class NR Certificates.


■

Control Event:


A Control Event will occur when the Certificate Balance of the Class G Certificates (taking into account the application of Appraisal Reductions to notionally reduce the Certificate Balance of the Class G Certificates) has been reduced to less than 25% of the initial Certificate Balance as of the Closing Date.
 
Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Control Event, the Controlling Class will no longer have any Control Rights. The Directing Certificateholder will relinquish its right to direct certain actions of the Special Servicer and will no longer have consent rights with respect to certain actions that the Master Servicer or Special Servicer plan on taking with respect to a mortgage loan.

■

Control Event
(continued):


Following the occurrence and during the continuance of a Control Event, the Directing Certificateholder will retain consultation rights with the Special Servicer with respect to certain material actions that the Special Servicer plans on taking with respect to a mortgage loan. Such consultation rights will continue until the occurrence of a Consultation Termination Event.
 


■

Consultation
Termination Event:


A Consultation Termination Event will occur when, without giving regard to the application of any Appraisal Reduction amount (i.e., giving effect to principal reductions through realized losses only), there is no Class of Control Eligible Certificates that satisfies the requirement of a Controlling Class.
 
Upon the occurrence of a Consultation Termination Event, there will be no Class of Certificates that will act as the Controlling Class and the Directing Certificateholder will have no rights under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement other than those rights generally available to all Certificateholders.
 


■

Appraised-Out Class:


A Class of Control Eligible Certificates that has been determined, as a result of Appraisal Reduction amounts allocable to such Class, to no longer be the Controlling Class.
 


■

Remedies Available to Holders of an
Appraised-Out Class:


Holders of the majority of any Class of Control Eligible Certificates that is determined at any time of determination to no longer be the Controlling Class as a result of an Appraisal Reduction allocable to such class will have the right, at their sole expense, to require the Special Servicer to order a second appraisal report from an MAI appraiser (selected by the Special Servicer) for any mortgage loan that results in the Class becoming an Appraised-Out Class. Upon receipt of the second appraisal, the Special Servicer will be required to determine, in accordance with the Servicing Standard, whether, based on its assessment of the second appraisal, any recalculation of the Appraisal Reduction amount is warranted, and if so warranted shall recalculate the Appraisal Reduction amount based on the second appraisal and if required by such recalculation, the Appraised-Out Class will be reinstated as the Controlling Class. The
Holders of an Appraised-Out Class requesting a second appraisal shall refrain from exercising any control or consent rights of the Controlling Class until such time, if any, as the Class is reinstated as the Controlling Class.
 


■

Senior Trust Advisor:


The Senior Trust Advisor will have certain review and, after the occurrence and during the continuance of a Control Event, consultation rights relating to the performance of the Special Servicer and with respect to its actions taken in connection with the resolution and/or liquidation of Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans.  After the occurrence and during the continuance of a Control Event, the Senior Trust Advisor will generally be responsible for reviewing the Special Servicer’s operational practices with respect to the resolution and liquidation of Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans. In addition, after the occurrence and during the continuance of a Control Event, the Senior Trust Advisor will have certain consultation rights with respect to the Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans. The Senior Trust Advisor will initially be Pentalpha Surveillance LLC.
 
After the occurrence and during the continuance of a Control Event, the Senior Trust Advisor will prepare an annual report for the benefit of all Certificateholders based on the Senior Trust Advisor’s review of certain information delivered to the Senior Trust Advisor including each final asset status report delivered to it during the prior calendar year, setting forth its assessment of the Special Servicer’s performance of its duties under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement on a platform-level basis with respect to the resolution and liquidation of Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans.
 
Prior to the occurrence and continuance of a Control Event, the Senior Trust Advisor is required to promptly review all information available to Privileged Persons on the Certificate Administrator’s website related to Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans and certain information available to Privileged Persons on the Certificate Administrator’s website related to mortgage loans included on the monthly CREFC servicer watch list report and each Final Asset Status Report in order to maintain its familiarity with the mortgage loans and the performance of the Special Servicer under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.

Upon the written direction of Holders of at least 75% of the aggregate notional balance of all Classes of Certificates entitled to principal (taking into account the application of Appraisal Reduction amounts to notionally reduce the Certificate balances of Classes to which such Appraisal Reduction amounts are allocable), the Certificate Administrator will immediately replace the Special Servicer with the replacement Special Servicer.
 


■

Master Servicer and
Special Servicer
Compensation:
 


The Master Servicer and Special Servicer are entitled to certain fees in connection with the servicing and administration of the mortgage loans as more fully described under “Transaction Parties–Servicing and Other Compensation and Payment of Expenses” in the Free Writing Prospectus.
 
The Master Servicer is entitled to a fee (the “Servicing Fee”) payable monthly from interest received in respect of each mortgage loan that will accrue at the related servicing fee rate described in the Free Writing Prospectus.  The Special Servicer is also entitled to a fee (the “Special Servicing Fee”) with respect to each Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan and REO Loan at the special servicing fee rate described in the Free Writing Prospectus.
 
In addition to the Servicing Fee, Special Servicing Fee and certain other fees described below, the Master Servicer and Special Servicer are entitled to retain and share certain additional servicing compensation, including assumption application fees, assumption fees, defeasance fees and certain Excess Modification Fees and consent fees with respect to the mortgage loans.  The Special Servicer may also be entitled to either a Workout Fee or Liquidation Fee, but not both, from recoveries in respect of any particular mortgage loan.
 
An “Excess Modification Fee” with respect to any mortgage loan is the sum of (A) the excess of (i) any and all Modification Fees with respect to a mortgage loan, over (ii) all unpaid or unreimbursed additional expenses described in the Free Writing Prospectus (excluding Special Servicing Fees, Workout Fees and Liquidation Fees) outstanding with respect to the related mortgage loan and reimbursed from such Modification Fees and (B) expenses previously paid or reimbursed from Modification Fees as described in clause (A), which expenses have subsequently been recovered from the related borrower or otherwise. With respect to the Master Servicer and Special Servicer, the Excess Modification Fees collected and earned by such Person from the related borrower (taken in the aggregate with any other Excess Modification Fees collected and earned by such Person from the related borrower within the prior 12 months of the collection
of the current Excess Modification Fees) will be subject to a cap of 1.00% of the outstanding principal balance of the related mortgage loan on the closing date of the related modification, extension, waiver or amendment.
 
A “Modification Fee” with respect to any mortgage loan is generally any fee with respect to a modification, extension, waiver or amendment of any mortgage loan. A “Workout Fee” will generally be payable with respect to each Corrected Mortgage Loan (as defined in the Free Writing Prospectus) and will be calculated at a rate of 1.00% of payments of principal and interest on the respective mortgage loan for so long as it remains a Corrected Mortgage Loan.

Master Servicer and
Special Servicer
Compensation
(Continued):


After receipt by the Special Servicer of Workout Fees with respect to a Corrected Mortgage Loan in an amount equal to $25,000, any Workout Fees in excess of such amount will be reduced by the Excess Modification Fee Amount (described below); provided, that in the event the Workout Fee collected over the course of such workout calculated at the Workout Fee Rate is less than $25,000, then the Special Servicer shall be entitled to an amount from the final payment on the related Corrected Mortgage Loan that would result in the total Workout Fees payable to the Special Servicer in respect of that mortgage loan to be $25,000.
 
The “Excess Modification Fee Amount” for any Corrected Mortgage Loan, is an amount equal to any Excess Modification Fees paid by or on behalf of the related borrower and received and retained by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, as additional servicer compensation within the prior 12 months of the related modification, waiver, extension or amendment resulting in the mortgage loan being a Corrected Mortgage Loan, but only to the extent those fees have not previously been deducted from a Workout Fee or Liquidation Fee.

The Liquidation Fee for each Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan will be payable at a rate of 1.00% of the liquidation proceeds.
 
The Liquidation Fees will be reduced by the amount of any Excess Modification Fees received by the Special Servicer with respect to the related mortgage loan as additional compensation within the prior 12 months; provided, however that no Workout Fee (on an aggregate basis) or Liquidation Fee will be less than $25,000.

Mortgage Loan No. 1 - 200 Public Square




 

The Property.  200 Public Square is a 1,265,289 square foot, 45-story, Class A office tower located on Public Square within downtown Cleveland, Ohio that was developed in 1985. Amenities include an eight-story atrium with landscaped interior gardens, various conference facilities, a fitness center, retail and dining options and an attached 757-car parking garage. The property, the third tallest building in Cleveland, is located in the middle of Cleveland’s central business district, near the RTA Rapid Transit Terminal that provides access to Hopkins International Airport and the Cleveland suburbs. Cleveland’s primary bus lines stop at the property and the main downtown streets leading to Public Square provide access to all major freeways including Interstate 77, Interstate 71 and Interstate 90. The property was developed in 1985 as the headquarters of Standard
Oil of Ohio, which subsequently was acquired by British Petroleum America (“BP America”) and the property was re-named in 1987 as the BP Tower. BP America vacated the property in 2000 when it left the Cleveland market. As of February 14, 2012, 200 Public Square was 81.9% occupied by 51 tenants. Since January 2011 approximately 160,154 square feet of space has been leased with several tenants currently in free rent periods and various tenants owed tenant improvements and leasing commissions by the borrower. The loan is structured with upfront reserves of $7,180,323 for free rent and $5,383,924 for outstanding tenant improvements and leasing commissions. According to the sponsor, there are no currently contemplated capital improvement plans.
 
The three largest tenants at the property are Cliffs Natural Resources (“Cliffs”), Benesch, Friedlander, Coplan & Aronoff LLP (“Benesch”) and Huntington National Bank. The leases with respect to Cliffs and Benesch both expire within the loan term with lease expiration dates of December 2021 and July 2019, respectively. For a full description of loan structure related to these tenants’ lease expiration dates, refer to the “Escrows and Reserves” section herein. Cliffs has the right to terminate its lease or contract its space on any day after November 1, 2017 with 12 months notice and payment of the landlord’s unamortized costs. Cliffs has two, five-year lease extension options at fair market value with a nine month notice period. Cliffs is a Cleveland-based, international mining and natural resources company. A member of the
S&P 500 index, Cliffs (rated Baa3 by Moody’s and BBB- by S&P) is a producer of iron ore and metallurgical coal. Traded on the New York Stock Exchange with a ticker of “CLF,” Cliffs had a market capitalization of approximately $10.1 billion as of April 2, 2012. In total, Cliffs leases approximately 185,920 square feet (14.7% of net rentable area) and has been in occupancy at the property since 2008. Benesch is a corporate law firm with six domestic offices and an international office in Shanghai, China. Benesch serves national and international clients that include public and private, middle market and emerging companies as well as private equity funds, entrepreneurs, non-profit organizations, trusts and estates. The 2011 edition of the Best Lawyers in America ranked Benesch number one in Cleveland in the areas of administrative, corporate, government relations, health care, real
estate, venture capital and non-profit/charities law. Benesch has been a tenant at the property since 1994 and recently executed a lease to expand at the property by approximately 8,697 square feet in February 2012 and is expected to take occupancy of the expansion space in June 2012. In total, Benesch leases approximately 124,087 square feet (9.8% of net rentable area) and has a lease expiration date of July 2019. Huntington National Bank is a subsidiary of Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (“Huntington Bancshares”), a multi-state diversified regional bank holding company.

Huntington National Bank recently consolidated its Cleveland operations into 200 Public Square in November 2011 and leases approximately 96,721 (7.6% of net rentable area) square feet through October 2031.
 
200 Public Square is within walking distance of a variety of shopping, dining and entertainment options including Tower City Center Mall and the Cleveland Browns’, Cleveland Cavaliers’ and the Cleveland Indians’ stadiums. In addition, the property is in close proximity to two of Cleveland’s newest developments, the Cleveland Medical Mart & Convention Center (the “Cleveland MMCC”) and Caesar’s Horseshoe Casino.  The Cleveland MMCC is a new convention and medical merchandise center that is being developed by Vornado at an estimated cost of $425 million. The project is targeted towards the medical and healthcare industries and is expected to be completed in 2013. The new Caesar’s Horseshoe Casino is located diagonally across Public Square and is expected to open in May 2012. The new casino is expected to create up to 1,600 new jobs and 8 million visits to downtown Cleveland annually. The new project is being developed
by a joint venture between Rock Gaming LLC and Caesars Entertainment Corporation.  In addition, approximately one mile west from the property, the Wolstein Group and Fairmount Properties are developing a mixed use, waterfront development known as the Flats East Bank. The mixed-use development commenced in December 2010 with the first phase, which is expected to cost $275 million, consisting of a 95% pre-leased office tower, a 150-key Aloft hotel and a variety of restaurant and entertainment offerings.

(1) TTM represents the trailing twelve months ending February 29, 2012.
(2) Percentage column represents percent of Net Rental Income for all revenue lines and represents percent of Effective Gross Income for the remainder of fields.
(3) Other income represents parking and other rental storage income. Parking has ranged from approximately $1.9 million in 2009 to $2.1 million in the TTM period. Underwritten parking income is grossed up for vacancy.
(4) The UW NOI is higher than the historical 2009-2011 NOI’s due to new leases at the property and the burn off of free rent. Full contractual rent was underwritten for all tenants, including those that had executed leases but were not yet in occupancy, and an escrow of approximately $7.2 million was taken at closing, which represents the remaining free rents on executed leases. On a monthly basis, during a free rent or rent abatement period, a portion of the free rent will be released from the loan’s cash management waterfall.
(5) Average Annual Rent PSF is based on historical financial statements and leased square footage. Vacant space is excluded from the calculation.
 
Property Management. The manager of 200 Public Square is Harbor Group Management Co., a Virginia corporation and an affiliate of the loan’s sponsor.
 
Escrows and Reserves. At closing, the borrower was required to deposit into escrow $7,180,323 for a free rent reserve, $5,383,924 for outstanding tenant improvements and leasing commissions, $976,790 for real estate taxes, $165,000 for tenant improvements and leasing commissions, $102,500 for deferred maintenance and $21,100 for replacement reserves. In addition, the borrower is required to post 1/12th of the estimated annual real estate taxes on a monthly basis. The requirement for the borrower to make monthly deposits to the insurance escrow is waived so long as no event of default has occurred and is continuing and the borrower provides satisfactory evidence that the property is insured pursuant to a blanket policy in accordance with the loan documents. The borrower is also required to make monthly deposits of $21,100 for replacement reserves. The loan is structured with ongoing
collections for tenant improvements and leasing commissions of $165,000 per month (the “Monthly TI/LC Reserve Collection”), subject to an initial cap of $1.5 million (the “TI/LC Reserve Cap”). The borrower is required to deposit all lease termination payments with the lender. These lease termination payments (other than the fees paid in connection with the Cliffs termination and contraction options) are not counted towards the TI/LC Reserve Cap. If Cliffs exercises its termination option, the borrower is required to escrow $460,000 per month with lender for 12 consecutive months and deposit with lender all lease termination payments. Provided Cliffs has not exercised its termination option, if Cliffs does not deliver notice of its intent to renew on or before March 31, 2021, then on each payment date commencing April 1, 2021 through and including December
1, 2021, the borrower is required to escrow $611,000 per month with lender (subject to reduction in an amount equal to any deposits being made by reason of a Cliffs contraction, which is described below), which will not be counted towards the TI/LC Reserve Cap. Furthermore, if either of the foregoing termination or non-renewal events occur, the TI/LC Reserve Cap increases by $5.5 million (a “Cliffs TI/LC Reserve Cap Increase Event”). Finally, if Cliffs exercises its contraction option, (i) the borrower is required to escrow 1/12th of the product of (x) the square footage of Cliffs contraction space, and (y) $30.00, with lender for 12 consecutive months, and (ii) the TI/LC Reserve Cap is required to increase by an amount equal to the aggregate amount of such deposits. In addition, in the event that Cliffs exercises its lease renewal option, on each payment date commencing on April 1, 2021 through and including
December 1, 2021, the borrower will be required to post $308,000 per month, which will be held by lender for tenant improvement obligations in connection with the extension. If Benesch does not deliver notice of its intent to renew on or before January 31, 2018, then on each payment date commencing February 1, 2018 through and including July 1, 2019, the Monthly TI/LC Reserve Collection increases by $220,000 and the TI/LC Reserve Cap increases by $3.9 million (the “Benesch TI/LC Reserve Cap Increase Event”). In the event that a Cliffs TI/LC Reserve Cap Increase Event and a Bensech TI/LC Reserve Cap Increase Event both occur, then the TI/LC Reserve Cap will be $10.9 million.
 
Lock Box / Cash Management. The 200 Public Square loan is structured with a Hard lockbox and in-place cash management. The borrower was required to send tenant direction letters to all tenants instructing them to deposit all rents and payments into the lockbox account controlled by the lender. All funds in the lockbox account are swept daily to a cash management account under the control of the lender and disbursed during each interest period of the loan term in accordance with the loan documents. To the extent the (i) DSCR falls below 1.10x based on a trailing three month period, (ii) there is an event of default under the loan documents, or (iii) the borrower or property manager becomes party to a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar action, then the excess cash flow shall be swept and held as additional collateral for the loan.

The Loan. The Arbor Place Mall loan has an outstanding principal balance of $122.0 million and is secured by a first mortgage lien on a super regional mall located in Douglasville, Georgia. In total, the mall has approximately 1.16 million square feet, of which 546,374 square feet serves as collateral for the loan. The ten year loan amortizes on a 30-year schedule. The property was developed in 1999 by CBL & Associates Properties, Inc., a real estate investment trust with a focus on regional malls. The proceeds from the loan were used to refinance previously existing debt of approximately $64.2 million, pay closing costs of $716,226, fund upfront reserves of $2.7 million and return $54.4 million of equity to the sponsor. The previously existing debt was securitized as a part of the CSFB 2002-CKS4 transaction.

Lock Box / Cash Management. The loan is structured with a CMA lockbox. The borrower was required to send tenant direction letters to all tenants instructing them to deposit all rents and other payments into the lockbox account. The funds are then returned to an account controlled by the borrower until the occurrence of a Cash Sweep Event (herein defined). In the event of a Cash Sweep Event, the borrower will establish a segregated cash management account to be held in trust and for the benefit of lender. Lender will have a first priority security interest in the cash management account. “Cash Sweep Event” means the occurrence of: (i) an event of default; (ii) any bankruptcy action of the borrower or manager; or (iii) the DSCR based on the trailing twelve month period immediately preceding the date of such determination falling below 1.15x. Upon the occurrence of a Cash Sweep
Event all funds deposited to the lockbox shall be deemed additional security for the loan.

All funds in the lockbox account are swept daily to a cash management account under the control of the lender and disbursed during each interest period of the loan term in accordance with the loan documents. To the extent (i) the DSCR based on the immediately preceding trailing three month period falls below 1.05x, (ii) there is an event of default under the loan documents or (iii) the borrower or property manager becomes the subject of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar action, all excess cash flow will be trapped and held as additional collateral for the loan.

The Loan. The Innisfree Hotel Portfolio loan is a $53,000,000 ($121,281/Room) first mortgage secured by three limited-service beachfront hotels, including a 181-room Hampton Inn located in Pensacola Beach, Florida, a 137-room Hilton Garden Inn located in Orange Beach, Alabama, and a 119-room Holiday Inn Express located in Orange Beach, Alabama.  The properties, all located along the Gulf Coast, benefit from direct access to the beach as well as direct water views from many of the properties’ rooms. The proceeds of the loan were used to refinance the previously existing debt on the properties, which totaled $49,096,718.  The remaining proceeds were used to fund closing costs, fees, and reserves, and return approximately $7.0 million in equity to the sponsor of the borrowers.  The borrowers acquired the properties in June 2003 (with respect to the
Hilton Garden Inn and Holiday Inn Express properties in Orange Beach, Alabama) and in December 2005 (with respect to the Hampton Inn in Pensacola Beach, Florida ) for a total cost of $59.5 million.  The borrowers have invested approximately $12.0 million in hard costs and furniture, fixtures and equipment (“FF&E”) and $1.1 million in soft costs since acquisition of the properties. Including closing costs, reserves and fees of $868,203, the borrowers had a total cost basis of approximately $73.4 million at closing of the loan, with the borrowers maintaining $16,438,503 in hard equity in the properties. The  sponsor is Innisfree Hotels.
 
The Borrowers. The borrowing entities for the loan are H&S Development, LLC, CRR Hospitality, L.L.C. and Seaside Hospitality, L.L.C. Each borrower is a single purpose entity and an Alabama limited liability company, except for H&S Development, LLC, which is a Florida limited liability company.

Mortgage Loan No. 5 – Innisfree Hotel Portfolio






 



The Sponsor.  The sponsor of the borrowers is Innisfree Hotels.  Innisfree Hotels was founded in 1985 by Julian MacQueen.  Innisfree Hotels is a closely held and managed hotel operator that focuses on the development, operation and management of gulf region hospitality properties, currently owning and managing eight hotels in the region totaling approximately 1,248 rooms and third party managing an additional four hotels totaling 442 rooms. Innisfree Hotels has relationships with both InterContinental Hotels Group and Hilton.
 
The Properties. The Innisfree Hotel Portfolio consists of three beachfront limited-service hotel properties totaling 437 rooms, located in Pensacola Beach, Florida and Orange Beach, Alabama, along the Gulf Coast. The hotel properties include the 181 room Hampton Inn – Pensacola Beach, the 137 room Hilton Garden Inn – Orange Beach and the 119 room Holiday Inn Express – Orange Beach.  The properties are all beachfront hotels with direct access to the Gulf of Mexico shores, the primary amenity for both the properties and their respective markets.  The properties were all constructed in the mid-1990’s and were renovated at various times between 2009 and 2011. The properties are all interior corridor hotels and feature property amenities in addition to the direct beach access including outdoor pools, poolside food and beverage services, fitness centers,
business centers, and meeting spaces. Guestrooms at all of the properties feature flat-screen televisions, microwaves, refrigerators, and other amenities typical for limited service hotels of similar quality.  All of the properties feature balconies along their Gulf-Coast (ocean view) rooms.
 
The Pensacola Beach, Florida and Orange Beach, Alabama areas are driving vacation destinations for families and groups from the Southeast United States up through the Midwest United States and Canada. The areas experience high season for leisure travelers during the summer months with group business travel dominating the fall shoulder seasons. The British Petroleum oil spill from 2010 caused significant declines in transient reservations during the peak summer months. The markets have since demonstrated recovery of approximately 8.2% year-over-year RevPAR growth in 2011.

Hampton Inn – Pensacola Beach.  The Hampton Inn - Pensacola Beach property is located along approximately 600 feet of Gulf of Mexico beachfront at 2 Via De Luna Drive, within Escambia County, Florida. The site consists of a 4.38-acre irregular-shaped parcel, developed with a four-story limited service Hampton Inn hotel with a total of 181 rooms. The property is the first hotel along Via De Luna Drive, when entering Pensacola Beach from mainland Pensacola.  Considering the significant drive-in business generated at the property, this location provides an advantage to the other beachfront properties in the market.  The beach and Gulf of Mexico are the main demand generators for the area along with local retail outlets and restaurants within walking distance of the property. The property opened as a Hampton Inn in 1995 and consists of 181 rooms in an interior corridor,
4-story rectangular-shape structure.  The building was completely renovated in 2006 after Hurricane Ivan forced the property to close in 2004. The property was again renovated in 2011. The entrance of the hotel and porte cochere are located in the northern end of the building which houses the front desk, management offices, meeting space, fitness center, business center and breakfast area/restaurant.
 
Guestrooms are located on all 4 floors of the interior corridor property.  The guestrooms consist of 113 double queen rooms, 67 king rooms, and 1 suite with full kitchen.  Each of the 181 rooms is equipped with either a single king bed or two queen beds.  King bedded guestrooms also include a sleep sofa. Each guestroom is provided with a high-definition LCD flat panel television, work desk, high-speed internet access, coffee maker, microwave oven, mini-refrigerator, tea maker and iron w/ ironing board.  Gulf-front (ocean view) rooms feature a balcony.
 
The property is operated as a Hampton Inn under a franchise agreement with Promus Hotels, Inc. dated as of December 16, 2005.  The franchise agreement has an original 20-year term and will expire in December 2025.  The franchise agreement stipulates a franchise fee of five percent (5%) of the hotel’s gross room revenues.  The franchise agreement additionally stipulates monthly program fees equal to four percent (4%) (subject to annual increases of 1% provided that cumulative increases will not exceed 5%) of the hotel’s gross room revenues will be taken.  These program fees are included in the marketing expense within the underwriting.
 
The Hampton Inn – Pensacola Beach property is ground leased to the applicable borrower by the Santa Rosa Island Authority (“SRIA”).  The entirety of Pensacola Beach is owned by Escambia County, Florida and is under the direction of the SRIA.  The ground lease, dated November 17, 1968 runs through May 1, 2090 (approximately 68 years beyond the term of the Loan).  The ground lease provides for a restricted use of the property as either a hotel or amusement park.  Additionally, the ground lease provides that the leasehold owner, the applicable borrower, will pay percentage rent based upon a percentage of gross receipts from room revenues and other revenue sources  (with a minimum annual payment of $50,000). It is noted that all percentage rent to become payable under the ground lease is billed directly to hotel guests on their individual folios, so that the ground lease fees are passed directly through to the guests.  This
practice is in line with that of the other hotel properties along Pensacola Beach.

Mortgage Loan No. 5 – Innisfree Hotel Portfolio






 


Escrows and Reserves. The borrowers deposited $135,644 in escrow for annual real estate taxes at loan origination and are required to escrow 1/12 of the annual estimated tax payments monthly, which currently equates to $24,329. The borrowers also deposited $185,685 in escrow for insurance at loan origination and are required to escrow (i) 1/12 of the annual insurance premiums monthly or (ii)  to the extent any coverage is being maintained under a blanket insurance policy approved by lender, 1/12 of the product of (x) 125% and (y) the annual insurance premiums allocable to the properties in order to accumulate sufficient funds to pay all such insurance premiums. The current monthly escrow for insurance premiums equates to $46,421. If any of the insurance policies are subject to an approved premium finance agreement, the lender will release, absent
an event of default, a portion of the insurance reserve allocable to the required payment under such agreement upon receipt of evidence that the borrowers have paid such amount for the succeeding quarterly period. The borrowers are required to deposit 4% of monthly gross revenues each month in the FF&E reserve.  An upfront ground rent reserve in the amount of $35,000 (calculated as approximately 110% of the highest monthly percentage rent payment due under the ground lease in 2011) was taken at loan origination with respect to the Hilton Garden Inn – Orange Beach property. The borrowers are required to deposit on a monthly basis an amount sufficient to make the associated monthly payment under the ground lease, provided, however, so long as (i) no event of default or Cash Management Event (as defined below) has occurred and is continuing and (ii) the borrowers have paid all ground rent directly to the ground lessor and the borrowers provide the lender with evidence
of the payment of the prior month’s ground rent payment, the borrowers are not required to make deposits to the ground rent reserve. A seasonality reserve was also established at loan origination to fund shortfalls of mortgage and mezzanine loan debt service, reserves and operating expenses during low season at the properties.  During the term of the loan, the borrowers will be required to make monthly deposits into the seasonality reserve during the high season months based upon the following schedule: May - $185,000, June - $185,000, July - $650,000, August - $650,000, and September - $180,000, with a cumulative amount of $1,850,000 being swept during the high season months.  The franchise agreements for the Hilton Garden Inn – Orange Beach property and the Holiday Inn Express – Orange Beach property expire in July 2017 and June 2018, respectively. On the date that is 18 months prior to the expiration of the respective franchise agreements, all excess cash flow will
be swept into a PIP reserve (a “PIP Reserve Trigger”). The lender will deposit into the PIP reserve all excess cash until such time as (i) the borrower has delivered either a renewal of the expiring franchise agreement or a replacement franchise agreement for that property in form and substance acceptable to the lender for a term of at least 10 years, (ii) the borrower has delivered, if required by the franchisor, an acceptable property improvement plan (“PIP”), (iii) the borrower has delivered an acceptable comfort letter from the applicable franchisor and (iv) 125% of the cost of the PIP, as determined based on the average of two cost bids for the PIP work acceptable to lender (the “PIP Reserve Amount”), is accumulated in the PIP reserve or deposited by borrower into the PIP reserve ((i) through (iv) the “Cure Conditions”).  Upon determination of the PIP Reserve Amount, the borrower may request funds held in the FF&E reserve in excess
of $1.0 million to be reallocated to such PIP reserve.  Funds in the PIP reserve may be used to pay for all costs associated with the PIP.  Upon receipt of documentation from the respective franchisor stating that all PIP work is complete, and satisfaction of the Cure Conditions, excess proceeds in the PIP reserve will first be used to refill the FF&E reserve to the extent funds were drawn from the FF&E reserve, and any excess proceeds after refilling the FF&E reserve will be released to the borrowers so long as no event of default or Cash Management Event has occurred and remains uncured.
 
Lock Box / Cash Management. The Innisfree Hotel Portfolio loan is structured with a CMA lockbox and springing cash management. Each account debtor and each credit card clearing bank will be required to remit all amounts due with respect to the property directly to a clearing account controlled by the lender during the term of the loan. All funds in the lockbox account are swept daily to the borrowers. Cash management will spring upon the occurrence of a “Cash Management Event”, which will occur if and when: (i) an event of default occurs under the loan or the property management agreement (“Default Trigger”), (ii) DSCR for the properties falls below 1.215x (“DSCR Cash Management Trigger”), (iii) the property manager (or such manager’s parent, if applicable) becomes insolvent and/or files for bankruptcy (“Manager Event”)
or (iv) a PIP Reserve Trigger occurs, as described under the heading “Escrows and Reserves” above.  In the event that there is a Cash Sweep Event, all excess cash flow will be trapped. A “Cash Sweep Event” means the occurrence of (i) a Default Trigger, (ii) DSCR for the properties falls below 1.114x (“DSCR Sweep Trigger”), (iii) a Manager Event, or (iv) a PIP Reserve Trigger.
 
Release of Properties. The borrower has the right to a release of an individual property (a “Release Property”) from the cross-collateralization provisions of the mortgage, a severance of the mortgage loan and a partial assumption of the portion of the mortgage loan to be secured by the Release Property, all in connection with a third-party, arms-length sale of the Release Property, provided the following conditions are met for the first release: (i) no event of default exists, (ii) a Combined LTV of the Release Property no greater than 63%, (iii) a Combined LTV of the remaining crossed properties no greater than 63%, (iv) a Combined DSCR of the Release Property no less than 1.43x, (v) a Combined DSCR of the remaining crossed properties no less than 1.43x, (vi) the purchaser of the Release Property assumes the relevant portion of the mortgage
loan subject to the lender’s customary loan assumption requirements, and (vii) payment of all other costs and expenses of the lender in connection with the release. The conditions for the second release are: (i) no event of default, (ii) a Combined LTV of the Release Property no greater than 60%, (iii) a Combined LTV of the remaining property no greater than 60%, (iv)  a Combined DSCR of the Release Property no less than 1.50x, (v) a Combined DSCR of the remaining property no less than 1.50x, (vi) the purchaser of the Release Property assumes the relevant portion of the mortgage loan subject to lender’s customary loan assumption requirements, and (vii) payment of all other costs and expenses of lender in connection with the release.

Mortgage Loan No. 5 – Innisfree Hotel Portfolio






 



The release of any property from the cross-collateralization provisions (as detailed above) will require the borrower to pay down the mortgage loan in an amount equal to 25% of the allocated loan amount for the Release Property and to pay a yield maintenance charge. In connection with the release of any property from the cross collateralization provisions, there will also be a similar requirement to pay down the mezzanine loan. The borrower must also pay for any assumption fees.
 
References to the “Combined LTV” and “Combined DSCR” in second preceding paragraph are references to the loan-to-value ratio and debt service coverage ratio, respectively, based upon the respective portions of the mortgage loan and mezzanine loan, collectively, that are to be directly or indirectly secured by either (i) the Release Property or (ii) the remaining property or properties, as the case may be.
 
Hilton Garden Inn Release Parcel. A 1.30 acre portion along the eastern portion of the Hilton Garden Inn – Orange Beach property is included in the collateral (the “HI PB Release Parcel”).  The HI PB Release Parcel currently houses a miniature golf operation and landscaped areas.  The HI PB Release Parcel may be released from the collateral upon request from the borrowers, without payment of any consideration, subject to certain conditions, including no event of default, proper subdivision, conformance with zoning, and other standard lender requirements.
 
Additional Debt. A mezzanine loan of $4.0 million secured by the equity interest in the borrower was provided by an affiliate of LCF. The mezzanine loan has a coterminous maturity with the mortgage loan. The total debt of $57.0 million will amortize based on a 30-year schedule. The mortgage loan and the mezzanine loan, together have a Cut-off Date LTV equal to 63.4%, a Maturity Date LTV equal to 53.8%, a UW DSCR equal to 1.43x and an UW NCF Debt Yield equal to 10.4%.

(2) Percentage column represents percent of Net Rental Income for all revenue lines and represents percent of Effective Gross Income for the remainder of fields.
(3) UW Rents in Place are inclusive of full contractual rent for all tenants in occupancy, regardless of whether or not the respective tenants are currently receiving free rent. LaSalle Equity leases 22,349 square feet and is receiving free rent through May 31, 2012 and Tricolor Auto Group, LLC leases 12,901 square feet and is receiving free rent through April 30, 2012. A free rent reserve of $242,767 was taken at closing for both tenants and will be released to borrower on a monthly basis pursuant to the loan agreement.





 
Property Management. The property will be managed by Rosemont Property Management of Texas, LLC, a subsidiary of the sponsor.
 
Escrows and Reserves. At closing, the borrower was required to deposit into escrow $2,075,000 for required repairs at the property, $242,767 for outstanding free rent credits and $54,325 for outstanding tenant improvements allowances. The borrower is required to escrow 1/12 of the annual estimated tax payments monthly, which currently equates to $130,356 monthly. The requirement for the borrower to make monthly deposits to the insurance escrow is waived so long as no event of default has occurred and is continuing and the borrower provides satisfactory evidence that the property is insured in accordance with the loan documents. At origination and on a monthly basis thereafter, the borrower is required to deposit $37,500 to the tenant improvement/leasing commission reserve and $4,692 to the replacement reserve. The tenant improvement/leasing commission reserve
is capped at $1,350,000.
 
Lock Box / Cash Management. The loan is structured with a Hard lockbox and in-place cash management. The borrower was required to send tenant direction letters to all tenants instructing them to deposit all rents and payments into the lockbox account controlled by the lender. All funds in the lockbox account in excess of a specified amount are swept daily to a cash management account under the control of the lender and disbursed during each interest period of the loan term in accordance with the loan documents. To the extent (i) the DSCR falls below 1.10x, (ii) there is an event of default under the loan documents or (iii) the borrower or property manager becomes party to a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar action, then all excess cash flow will be trapped and held as additional collateral for the loan.

(1) The loan will be structured with an ARD of 120 months after the initial payment date.

From April 1, 2031 through the ground lease expiration date, ground rent is determined based on a formula that either corresponds to CPI or the fair market value of the vacant land (without the value of any of the improvements constructed thereon).
 
Property Management. GTECH Center is managed by R.J. Kelly, an affiliate of the sponsors and borrower.
 
Escrows and Reserves. At closing, the borrower was required to deposit $91,667 in escrow for real estate taxes and is required to escrow 1/12 of the annual estimated tax payments monthly, which is currently $91,667. The borrower was required to deposit $118,125 in escrow at closing for deferred maintenance. At closing, the borrower also was required to deposit $4,691 in escrow for insurance, $3,328 for replacement reserves and $30,000 for ground rent.

In the event that any tenant at the property terminates its lease and pays any consideration in connection with such termination, the borrower is required to pay to the lender the termination fees which will be retained by
the lender in a lease termination fee reserve. Funds in the lease termination fee reserve may be used by the borrower to pay for approved tenant improvement and leasing commission obligations incurred by the borrower in connection with re-letting space vacated by a tenant that paid a lease termination fee.

Escrows and Reserves. At closing, the borrower was required to deposit $1,700,000 into escrow for the aNETorder reserve, which represents the remaining rent and reimbursement payments due through expiration under aNETorder’s lease, and $186,806 for required repairs at the properties. The borrower was also required to deposit $184,271 for real estate taxes and $8,515 for insurance in escrow at loan origination, and is required to escrow 1/12 of the annual estimated tax and insurance payments monthly, which currently amounts to $62,318 and $1,064, respectively. At origination and on a monthly basis thereafter, the borrower is required to deposit in escrow $16,667 to the tenant improvement/leasing commission reserve, $16,667 to the debt service reserve and $6,575 to the replacement reserve. The tenant improvement/leasing commission reserve and the debt service reserve
have caps that are subject to change based upon the occurrence of events outlined in the loan documents. Provided that no event of default is occurring or continuing under the loan documents, the lender is required to make disbursements from the aNETorder Reserve Fund as follows (i) on every payment date, an amount equal to monthly rent and reimbursements payable by aNETorder under its lease is required to be deposited in the cash management account and applied in the same manner as rents until $600,000 has been deposited in the cash management account and (ii) all remaining amounts in the aNETorder reserve fund are required to be disbursed to the borrower when the entire aNETorder space is occupied by aNETorder, one or more replacement tenants reasonably approved by the lender and/or one or more subleases reasonably approved by lender. In order to disburse remaining funds in the aNETorder reserve fund to borrower as result of satisfaction of (ii) above, lender must
receive an acceptable estoppel certificate as detailed in the loan documents. The borrower is entitled to partial disbursements for leases of subleases of not less than 25,000 square feet, which satisfy the requirements above in an amount equal to $1,100,000 multiplied by the proportion of aNETorder space demised pursuant to such lease or sublease.
 
Lock Box / Cash Management. The loan is structured with a Hard lockbox and in-place cash management. The borrower was required to send tenant direction letters to all tenants instructing them to deposit all rents and payments into the lockbox account controlled by the lender. All funds in the lockbox account are swept daily to a cash management account under the control of the lender and disbursed during each interest period of the loan term in accordance with the loan documents. In the event (i) the DSCR based on the immediately preceding trailing three month period falls below 1.10x, (ii) there is an event of default under the loan documents, (iii) the borrower or property manager becomes the subject of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar action, (iv) on April 1, 2015 unless (a) the property is 72.0% occupied
by tenants pursuant to leases expiring on or after January 1, 2021 and otherwise satisfying the requirements set forth in the loan documents and (b) the lender has received an acceptable estoppel from each tenant or (v) on April 1, 2020 unless (a) the property is 72.0% occupied by tenants pursuant to leases expiring on or after January 1, 2026 and otherwise satisfying the requirements set forth in the loan documents and (b) the lender has received an acceptable estoppel from each tenant, then all excess cash shall be swept and held as additional collateral for the loan.

Mortgage Loan No. 9 – Oak Ridge Office Portfolio





 


The Sponsors. The loan’s sponsors and nonrecourse carve-out guarantors are John C. Harvey and Edward J. Sussi, executives of the Cowperwood Company (“Cowperwood”), a New York-based national commercial real estate development company that currently manages in excess of approximately 2 million square feet. John C. Harvey is the President and Chief Executive Officer of Cowperwood. Mr. Harvey has approximately 47 years of commercial real estate experience, 37 of which were served with Cowperwood. Edward J. Sussi is the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Cowperwood. Mr. Sussi has approximately 35 years of commercial real estate experience, 33 of which were served with Cowperwood. Along with its construction partners, Cowperwood has constructed over 5 million square feet of commercial office projects including properties in Colorado, Florida, New Mexico, New York,
South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and Washington.
 
The Properties. The Oak Ridge Office Portfolio is a seven building office portfolio located in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, approximately 25 miles west of Knoxville. The portfolio consists of Oak Ridge Corporate Center I and Oak Ridge Technical Center. As of April 1, 2012, the portfolio was 93.4% occupied by 15 tenants. Oak Ridge Technical Center (“ORTC”) is a six-building, one story Class B multi-tenanted business park that was constructed between 1991 and 1999. Oak Ridge Corporate Center I (“ORCC I”) is a four story, Class A multi-tenant office building that was constructed in 1991. Amenities at ORCC I include a coffee-shop, a common area fitness room and a decorative retention pond with walking trails. According to the sponsor, ORCC I was initially developed as an outgrowth of the Cowperwood and Science
Applications International Corporation’s (“SAIC”) desire to produce a quality corporate environment to accommodate SAIC and other national firms residing in substandard space. The city of Oak Ridge was established in 1942 as a site for a single purpose – the secret production of the atomic bomb. Since then, the community has evolved into a center of scientific research and technology with four predominant economic drivers: (i) Oak Ridge National Laboratory (the “ORNL”); (ii) Y-12 National Security Complex; (iii) Oak Ridge Associated Universities and (iv) environmental management.
 
The tenancy at the properties is representative of the local area’s focus in specialized sciences including nuclear physics, environmental technology, advanced materials, information technology, biomedical technology, transportation research and measures and controls. The three largest tenants at the properties are SAIC, UT-Battelle, LLC and BWXT Y-12, L.L.C. SAIC, located at ORCC I, currently occupies approximately 134,789 square feet, although it will contract by 11,369 square feet on May 31, 2012. SAIC is a provider of scientific, engineering, systems integration and technical services and solutions to all branches of the U.S. Military, the U.S. Department of Defense, the intelligence community, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and other public and private entities. SAIC recently entered into a settlement agreement and a deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S.
Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York and the City of New York (“NYC”) relating to investigations surrounding an automated time and attendance and workforce management system (“CityTime”) that SAIC developed and implemented for certain NYC agencies. The settlement agreement and the deferred prosecution agreement is further described under “Litigation or Other Legal Proceedings Could Adversely Affect the Mortgage Loans” in the Free Writing Prospectus.  In 1989, SAIC purchased a 32-acre parcel of land from the city of Oak Ridge and retained Cowperwood’s services to design and construct its southeastern regional headquarters. The remaining portion of the 32-acre parcel was purchased by Cowperwood to develop the ORCC I, which, upon completion in 1991, was 100% leased, with Bechtel National, Inc. as the major tenant. In 1999, SAIC outgrew its southeastern headquarters facility and leased additional space in ORCC I. SAIC
is headquartered in McLean, VA and employs, along with its subsidiaries, approximately 41,000 employees worldwide. At the close of trading on April, 2, 2012, SAIC’s (NYSE: SAI) share price was $13.21 with a market capitalization of approximately $4.51 billion.
 
UT-Battelle, LLC (“UT-Battalle”), a 50-50 partnership between the University of Tennessee and Battelle Memorial Institute, was established in 2000 for the purpose of managing and operating the ORNL on behalf of the U.S. Department of Energy (“DOE”). UT-Battelle occupies 88,859 square feet at ORTC and assumed management responsibility for ORNL in April 2000, after winning a competitive procurement process. At the end of the first five-year term, the contract was renewed for a second five-year period. In June 2010, the DOE elected to extend the contract for an additional five years ending in 2015. Battelle Memorial Institute is a 501(c)(3) private nonprofit charitable trust headquartered in Columbus, Ohio. The institute opened in 1929 and since has focused on contract research and development work in the areas of metals and material science. The ORNL was established in 1943 to produce and separate plutonium for
the World War II Manhattan Project. Today, ORNL is the DOE’s largest science and energy laboratory.
 
BWXT Y-12, L.L.C., is a partnership established between the Babcock & Wilcox Company and Bechtel Corporation for the sole purpose of managing and operating the Y-12 National Security Complex under a contract to the U.S. DOE and the National Nuclear Security Administration (“NNSA”). The Y-12 National Security Complex is one of four production facilities in the NNSA’s Nuclear Security Enterprise and is responsible for the production and maintenance of all uranium parts for nuclear weapons in the U.S. arsenal, as well as the development of technologies associated with those activities. The Babcock & Wilcox Company (B&W) is an energy products and services provider that services a wide spectrum of industries and markets including modular nuclear power, renewable energy, government services, fossil power, environmental power and commercial nuclear power. Bechtel Corporation is a privately owned engineering, construction
and project management company. Completed in February 1943, the initial mission of the Y-12 National Security Complex was the separation of uranium-235 from natural uranium for use in an atomic bomb. Today, the Y-12 National Security Complex is one of four production facilities in the NNSA’s Nuclear Security Enterprise.

The Property. The four buildings were constructed between 1990 and 2001 and range from 44,336 square feet to 101,353 square feet. The buildings are situated within the larger Continental Executive Business Parke, a two million square foot office/industrial park that provides tenants with immediate access to I-94, the main thoroughfare serving Chicago’s central business district. The buildings are Continental Executive Parke I (“CEP I”), Continental Executive Parke II (“CEP II”), Continental Executive Parke III (“CEP III”) and Continental Executive Parke IV (“CEP IV”). The collateral is currently 93.6% occupied and is leased to six tenants. Since 2006 approximately $8.0 million has been spent on capital improvements across the buildings.
 
The three largest tenants at the property are Baxter Credit Union (“Baxter”), CDW Corp (“CDW”) and Parkson Corporation (“Parkson”). Baxter, a non-profit organization and one of the nation’s top 100 credit unions, is headquartered at the property. Baxter provides customers access to VISA credit and checkcards, home equity loans, ATMs, and online banking. Baxter serves over 140,000 members and has service centers across the country and in Puerto Rico. Baxter has been in occupancy at the property since 1999, expanded into the CEP IV building from CEP I in 2007 and has a lease expiration date of April 30, 2020. CDW’s is the second largest tenant and occupies 75,444 square feet at the property. Though CDW’s corporate headquarters are located across the street, the executive offices are located in CEP III. CDW is a reseller of computer
hardware, software and supplies. CDW was acquired by Chicago-based Madison Dearborn Partners, LLC in 2007. They have been in occupancy since 2005 with a lease expiration date of February 29, 2016. The third largest tenant is Parkson, which is headquartered in Florida. Parkson occupies 39,803 square feet and is a provider of advanced solutions in water, wastewater recycling and treatment. Parkson has offices in Florida, Illinois, Quebec, Mumbai and the United Arab Emirates. They have been in occupancy in CEP II since 2004 and have a lease expiration date of April 30, 2018.
 
Continental Executive Parke is located within the Central Northwest office submarket, which is part of the Chicago MSA. According to the appraisal, the area immediately surrounding the collateral is a high income suburb of Chicago. As of 2011, population and median household income were approximately 49,262 and $95,645 within a three-mile radius, respectively, and 135,458 and $96,455 within a five-mile radius, respectively. As of year-end 2011, the Central Northwest submarket had an overall inventory of approximately 5.9 million square feet, of which 1.5 million square feet or 25.4% were Class A properties. During the same period, the submarket reported a vacancy rate of 11.6% and a quoted rental rate of $18.75 per square foot for Class A properties. Total absorption and completed construction within the submarket were 65,681 square feet and 24,341 square feet, respectively.

Property Management. The properties are managed by PWA Real Estate, LLC, an affiliate of the sponsor. PWA Real Estate, LLC. has sub-management agreement with NAI Hiffman Asset Management, LLC, a third-party manager who has managed the buildings for over 10 years.
 
Escrows and Reserves. At closing the borrower was required to deposit $361,965 for property taxes, $36,770 for tenant improvements and leasing commissions, and $4,903 in escrow for replacement reserves. In addition, the borrower was required to deposit $156,359 for a free rent reserve associated with the Wonderlic lease. Wonderlic is currently paying 50% abated rent through January 2013, at which point it commences paying full rent. In light of the collected reserve, full contractual rent has been underwritten for Wonderlic. On a monthly basis, the borrower is required to deposit $36,770 for tenant improvements and leasing commissions and $4,903 for replacement reserves. The tenant improvements and leasing commissions reserve fund is subject to a cap of $1,323,720. On a monthly basis, the borrower is required to escrow 1/12 of the estimated
annual real estate tax which currently is $60,328. The requirement to make monthly deposits for insurance premiums is waived so long as (i) no event of default has occurred and is continuing; (ii) the borrower has provided the lender with satisfactory evidence that the property is insured pursuant to a blanket policy in accordance with the loan documents.
 
Lock Box / Cash Management. The loan is structured with a CMA lockbox. The borrower was required to set up a lockbox account at closing and send tenant direction letters to all tenants instructing them to deposit all rent and payments into the lockbox account controlled by the lender. However, funds in the lockbox account are returned to an account designated by the borrower until the occurrence of a Cash Sweep Event (as defined below). In a Cash Sweep Event, the borrower will establish a segregated cash management account to be held in trust and for the benefit of the lender. The lender will have a first priority security interest in the cash management account. Cash Sweep Event means the occurrence of (i) an event of default under the loan documents, (ii) any bankruptcy action of the borrower or manager, (iii) the DSCR based on the immediately preceding trailing three month period
falls below 1.10x, (iv) a Baxter trigger event as outlined in the loan documents or (v) a CDW trigger event has occurred as outlined in the loan documents.

(1) Occupancy, Number of Tenants, UW Revenues, UW NOI and UW NCF include Nordstrom Rack, which has executed its lease, but is not yet in occupancy or paying rent and Cost Plus World Market, which is currently paying percentage rent in lieu of base rent as a result of a co-tenancy provision related to a pre-existing co-tenancy provision that was triggered and is expected to be cured upon Nodstrom Rack taking occupancy. Nordstrom Rack, which represents 12.2% of the Net Rentable Area, is expected to take occupancy and commence rent payments May 3, 2012. Cost Plus World Market, which represents 6.2% of the Net Rentable Area, will commence full contractual rent payments upon Nordstrom Rack taking occupancy. UW NOI is higher than historical NOI’s primarily due to lease up of the property related to Nordstrom Rack and other tenants.
(2) The Initial Other Escrows and Reserves represents (i) the World Market reserve fund of $310,500, (ii) the Nordstrom Rack reserve fund of $205,250 and (iii) $3,125 for deferred maintenance.
 
The Loan. The approximately $25.7 million first mortgage loan is secured by the Commons at Temecula, an approximately 292,545 square foot retail center located in Temecula, California. Proceeds from the loan were used to pay down a line of credit held by the sponsor. The property was acquired by the sponsor in 2005 for approximately $51.5 million, resulting in a loan to original cost of 49.8%. The borrower is sponsored by Retail Properties of America, Inc., a self-managed REIT with a portfolio of 259 properties totaling in excess of 34 million square feet as of December 31, 2011, and a repeat JPMCB borrower.
 
The Property. The property is a 292,545 square foot retail center that is currently occupied by 14 tenants including Jo Ann Fabrics (sales of $156 per square foot, lease expiration of January 31, 2016), Sports Chalet, Inc. (sales of $135 per square foot, lease expiration of December 31, 2015) and Nordstrom Rack (sales NAV, lease expiration of March 31, 2022). Sales figures in 2011 for reporting tenants were approximately $178 per square foot with occupancy costs of 8.0%. The property is located in a predominantly retail corridor adjacent to the Promenade Mall, which is anchored by JCPenney, Macy’s and Sears. At closing, $310,500 was reserved for Cost Plus World Market, which is currently paying percentage rent in lieu of base rent due
to a pre-existing co-tenancy provision that was triggered and is expected to be cured upon Nordstrom Rack taking occupancy. Additionally, $205,250 was reserved for Nordstrom Rack and will not be released until the tenant is in occupancy, conducting business and paying rent.
 
The Market. As of the fourth quarter of 2011, the South Riverside submarket had an average vacancy rate of approximately 8.6% with a quoted rental rate of approximately $17.55. The property currently has a vacancy of 3.7% with rental rates ranging from $10.00 for anchors to $29.00 for in-line tenants.

(1) Fitch has confirmed that the SunTrust Bank Portfolio III has, in the context of its inclusion in the mortgage pool, credit characteristics consistent with investment grade rated obligations.
(2) The borrowers are Inland American ST Portfolio JP3, L.L.C. and Inland American ST Florida Portfolio JP3, L.L.C.
(3) The loan is structured with an anticipated repayment date (“ARD”) of July 1, 2021. In the event that the loan is not paid off on or before the ARD, the borrower is required to make monthly payments to the lender of principal and interest in the amount of an assumed constant amount calculated using the current outstanding principal balance of the loan, 5.4200% (the “Initial Interest Rate”), and 30 year amortization schedule, such payment to be applied to interest in an amount equal to interest that would have accrued on the outstanding principal balance of the loan (without adjustment for accrued interest) at the Initial Interest Rate and the remainder to the principal balance of the loan and additional interest will accrue based on a step up in the interest rate of 3.00% per annum plus the greater of (i) the Initial Interest Rate, and (ii) a rate as calculated
by the lender in accordance with the loan documents in its sole discretion; provided, however, that in no event shall the revised Interest Rate exceed the Initial Interest Rate plus 5.00%. The final maturity date of the loan is July 1, 2031.
(4) Represents the Original Term to the ARD.
(5) The Springing Monthly Other Escrows and Reserves represents the rollover reserve, the tenant sale reserve and the environmental reserve. In the event that (a) SunTrust Bank or any other tenant has failed to provide notice of its exercise of its option to renew its lease on or before the date required or (b) the DSCR falls below 1.80x, the borrower will be required to deposit to the rollover reserve an amount equal to 125% of the monthly rent attributable to the lease or leases that SunTrust Bank or any other tenant fails to renew. In the event that (a) SunTrust has been acquired by another entity, (b) SunTrust Bank has failed to provide notice of its exercise of its option to renew at least 90% of its leases on or before the date required to be delivered under such lease or (c) the DSCR falls below 1.80x, the borrower will be required to deposit to the tenant sale reserve account an amount as defined in the loan agreement,
which shall be held by lender as additional security for the loan. The borrower may eliminate a DSCR shortfall trigger by partial prepayment of the loan together with the applicable yield maintenance premium. In the event that SunTrust Bank does not timely renew its lease at any of 14 properties that potentially have environmental issues, the borrower shall be required to deposit to the environmental reserve an amount equal to 125% of the estimated costs for remediating the environmental issue at the related property. Such amount will be held as additional security for the loan. See “Risk Factors – Environmental Risks Relating to the Mortgaged Properties” in the Free Writing Prospectus.
 
The Loan. The $25.0 million first mortgage loan was used to refinance existing debt on 30 SunTrust Bank branches located in the southeastern and Middle-Atlantic states. The loan has an ARD of July 1, 2021 and a final maturity date of July 1, 2031. In June 2011, JPMCB provided three uncrossed loans totaling $150 million (consisting of the subject loan and two other loans securitized in JPMCC 2011-C5 totaling $125 million, which are secured by 151 properties in the aggregate) to refinance $97.9 million of existing debt on a portfolio of 218 SunTrust Bank properties (the “SunTrust Bank 218 Property Portfolio”) and return equity to the sponsor. The remaining 37 properties, which were not financed by JPMCB as part of the three loan, $150.0
million financing package, are currently unencumbered. Subsidiaries of Inland American Real Estate Trust, Inc. acquired the SunTrust Bank 218 Property Portfolio for $374.9 million as part of a larger 432 asset sale-leaseback transaction with SunTrust Bank that closed in 2007. The total consideration for the 432 asset transaction was $694.8 million. The allocated cost for the sponsor’s acquisition of the 30 properties is approximately $51.6 million representing implied borrower equity of $26.6 million.

(1) Deposit information is on an annual basis and is as of June 30, 2011.
 
The Master Agreement.  The properties are subject to individual absolute triple net lease agreements, each with a lease expiration date of December 31, 2017 with one ten year extension option and six additional five-year extension options. The leases provide annual 1.5% base rent increases during the term of the lease as well as 1.5% annual base rent increases during the term of the first three extension options. During the fourth through seventh extension options, base rent will be equal to the fair market rental value of the property as determined by the sponsor and tenant, or in the absence of an agreement, as determined in accordance with the appraisal procedure set forth in the lease. In addition to individual leases, each property is bound by a master agreement. The SunTrust Bank 218 Property Portfolio was
split into 10 separate lease pools (collectively, the “SunTrust Bank Lease Pools” and individually, a “SunTrust Bank Lease Pool”) with each SunTrust Lease Pool consisting of 22 or 21 leases. For any given SunTrust Bank Lease Pool, if SunTrust Bank exercises an extension of a single lease in that specific pool, it must extend leases equal to at least 75.0% of the annual base rent for all of the properties in that specific SunTrust Bank Lease Pool. The properties that collateralize the SunTrust Bank Portfolio III loan do not represent 100.0% of any individual SunTrust Bank Lease Pool. For further information on the individual properties in the master agreement, refer to “Certain Tenant Information for SunTrust Bank” in the Free Writing Prospectus.

(1) The loan is structured with an anticipated repayment date (“ARD”) of April 1, 2017. In the event that the loan is not paid off on or before the ARD, the borrower is required to make monthly payments to the lender of principal and interest in the amount of the monthly debt service payment at the initial interest rate, and additional interest will accrue based on a step up in the interest rate of 300 basis points plus the greater of (i) the initial interest rate (5.58800%) or (ii) 500 basis points plus the then current ten year swap yield (the “Revised Interest Rate”); but in no event shall the Revised Interest Rate exceed 500 basis points plus the initial interest rate. The final maturity date of the loan is October 1, 2024.

The Loan. The $24.5 million first mortgage loan, is secured by a 206,030 square foot Class B single-tenant office property located in Oakbrook, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. Proceeds of the loan along with borrower’s equity of approximately $1.9 million, were used to refinance previously existing debt of $21.5 million, and pay closing costs of approximately $4.9 million. The previously existing debt, securitized in the MSC 2006-T21 transaction, had an anticipated repayment date in December 2011 and was in its anticipated repayment date period prior to its repayment. The sponsor purchased the property in 2004 as part of a sale-leaseback for approximately $40.2 million. The borrower is sponsored by Inland Private Capital Corporation (“IPCC”). IPCC provides alternative strategies for deferring capital gains that may arise form the sale of a business or investment property through
1031 transactions.
 
The Property. The property consists of two adjacent buildings totaling approximately 206,030 square feet, which are 100.0% occupied by a single tenant, Ace Hardware, which has a lease expiration of November 30, 2024. The property serves as the corporate headquarters for the tenant. The improvements were originally constructed in 1974 and substantially renovated in 1995. Founded in 1924, Ace Hardware is a chain of individually owned and operated hardware stores serving local communities across the United States. There are currently 4,400 stores offering a wide variety of hardware and fix-and-replace products, as well as niche items and services. Ace Hardware recently signed a 10 year lease extension, in addition to the three years remaining on the current term prior to the loan closing. The sponsor paid $4.0 million to the tenant at closing
to facilitate a renovation project estimated to total approximately $9.5 million.
 
The Market. The property is located in Oakbrook, Illinois, approximately 20 miles west of Chicago, along I-88 which provides access to the regional freeway system as well as O’Hare International Airport. According to the appraiser, as of the third quarter of 2011, the East/West Tollway submarket had an average vacancy rate of approximately 20.6% and effective rental rate of $21.05. The property is currently 100.0% occupied at a rental rate of $13.75.

(1) 2009 NOI number is not available given that the asset opened in August 2009.
(2) The Courtyard San Antonio Riverwalk loan is structured with a CMA lockbox, which for purposes of this loan, means that all operating revenue from the hotel is deposited into an account controlled by Courtyard Management Corporation (“Marriott Manager”) and amounts due from Marriott Manager (after the payment of certain expenses and reserves) to the borrower are deposited into a lender controlled lockbox account.
(3) A mezzanine loan has been provided by an affiliate of LCF to Riverwalk CY Mezz, LLC in the amount of $4,350,000.  It is a 10-year loan with a 73.5% LTV (when combined with the mortgage loan) on a 30 year amortization schedule carrying an 11.50% rate.
(4) Monthly FF&E is calculated as 4% of the gross revenues for Marriott Manager’s prior 4 week accounting period until the monthly payment date in September 2012 and 5% of the gross revenues for Marriott Manager’s prior 4 week accounting period thereafter.  The FF&E account is maintained by Marriott Manager, and the lender is in the process of obtaining a security interest over such account.
(5) Includes a seasonality reserve and a parking rent reserve. Any draws from the seasonality reserve will be replenished with excess cash flow (to the extent available) until such time as the seasonality reserve is replenished to the amount reserved at closing. The requirement to make deposits to the parking rent reserve is waived so long as there is no event of default under the loan and the lender receives evidence on a monthly basis that the parking rent is being paid by Marriott Manager.
 
The Loan. The $23.0 million first mortgage loan along with a $4.35 million mezzanine loan was used to refinance an existing loan of $26.4 million as well as fund reserves and pay closing costs. The loan is secured by a 220-room Courtyard by Marriott Hotel.  The property is located at 207 North Saint Mary’s Street along the San Antonio Riverwalk (the “Riverwalk”).  The borrower acquired the land for the property in 2005 and was the original developer of the hotel.  The hotel was completed in August 2009 for a total cost of approximately $37.3 million. Including financing closing costs and fees of approximately $777,221 for the loan, the borrower had a total cost basis of approximately $38.1 million at closing of the loan.
 
The Property. The property is a 17-story limited service Courtyard by Marriott hotel with a total of 220 rooms.  Guestrooms at the property consists of 115 king rooms (42 of which include balconies overlooking the Riverwalk) and 105 double queen rooms (14 of which include balconies overlooking the Riverwalk).  Amenities at the property include a 53-seat full service restaurant called “The Bistro,” which is operated by Marriott and serves three meals per day, and a 32 seat Lobby Lounge, also operated by Marriott.  The property additionally includes seven indoor meeting/banquet facilities totaling 8,658 square feet.  Other amenities at the property include an outdoor rooftop swimming pool and whirlpool, exercise room, business center, and market pantry.
 
The Market. The property is located on the Riverwalk tourist destination area of the San Antonio central business district. The Riverwalk, one of the largest tourism attractions in San Antonio, runs approximately five miles through the heart of the San Antonio central business district, providing riverfront walkways lined with restaurants, shops, bars and hotels.  The property is situated in close proximity to several major attractions in the San Antonio market, including the Alamo, Alamodome and Rivercenter Mall, all located less than a half mile from the property, as well as the Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center, a 1.3 million square feet convention hall, including a 2,500-seat performing arts center, also located approximately one quarter mile from the property.

(1) The sponsors are SAC Holding Corporation and Blackwater Investments, Inc.
(2) The loan is structured with an anticipated repayment date (“ARD”) of April 1, 2022. In the event that the loan is not paid off on or before the ARD, the borrower is required to make monthly payments to the lender of principal and interest in the amount of the monthly debt service payment at the initial interest rate and additional interest will accrue based on a step up in the interest rate of 300 basis points plus the greater of (i) the initial interest rate (5.80000%) or (ii) 390 basis points plus the then current ten year swap yield (the “Revised Interest Rate”); but in no event shall the Revised Interest Rate exceed 500 basis points plus the initial interest rate. The final maturity date of the loan is April 1, 2032.
(3) 2011 NOI represents the trailing twelve month period ending September 30, 2011. Year end 2011 statements have not yet been provided by the borrower.
(4) Represents the Original Term to the ARD.
(5) The Initial Other Escrows and Reserves represent required repairs the borrower is obligated to perform at the property as defined in the loan documents.
 
The Loan. The $23.0 million first mortgage loan was used to refinance previously existing debt of approximately $13.2 million, fund upfront reserves of $528,234, pay closing costs of $261,093 and return equity of approximately $9.0 million on a portfolio of nine self-storage properties located in Texas, California, Ohio, Michigan, Tennessee and Arizona. The borrower is owned by affiliates of AMERCO which serves as the holding company for U-Haul International. A shareholder of AMERCO has filed a shareholder derivative lawsuit against one of the sponsors, which is described in more detail under “Litigation or Other Legal Proceedings Could Adversely Affect the Mortgage Loans” in the Free Writing Prospectus.
 
The Properties. The properties are comprised of nine self-storage properties located across six states with a total of 4,133 units. The portfolio consists of two properties located in Texas (24.5% of total units), three in California (22.1% of total units), one in Ohio (19.5% of total units), one in Michigan (18.5% of total units), one in Tennessee (8.3% of total units) and one in Arizona (7.1% of total units). In total, approximately 17.5% of the total units in the portfolio are climate controlled and there are an additional 15 RV/boat parking spots. U-Haul International, Inc. (“U-Haul”), founded in 1945, is a moving equipment and storage rental company with a current network of more than 15,950 locations in all 50 US States and 10 Canadian provinces. U-Haul locations provide customers with moving and storage supplies including self-storage, packing supplies and truck and trailer

(1) UW NOI is higher than historical NOI’s primarily due to lease up of property. UW NOI includes full contractual rent for HomeGoods.
(2) The Initial Other Escrows and Reserves represents the HomeGoods reserve fund. The HomeGoods reserve fund will be released to the borrower upon satisfaction certain terms and conditions including, but not limited: (i) no event of default has occurred or is continuing; (ii) borrower has delivered to lender an acceptable estoppel letter from HomeGoods and (iii) HomeGoods is paying full unabated rent under its lease.
 
The Loan. The approximately $20.9 million first mortgage loan was used to recapitalize Southlake Corners, a 134,894 square foot anchored retail property located in Southlake, Texas. The sponsor, Retail Properties of America, Inc. (“RPA”) has owned the property since 2006 in a joint venture with the state Board of Florida (“Florida JV”). The Florida JV hired HFF, L.P. to market the property for sale in the open market. RioCan Holdings USA, Inc. (“RioCan”) was the winning bidder with a bid of approximately $35.4 million. As a result of RPA and RioCan already having a joint venture partnership in place (the “RPA-RioCan JV”), the decision was made to contribute the asset to the RPA-RioCan JV. The RPA-RioCan JV is structured such that RPA contributed 20% equity and RioCan contributed 80% equity.
 
The Property. Southlake Corners is located at the intersection of Interstate Highway 114 and North Kimball Avenue with frontage along Southlake Boulevard, a retail corridor in Southlake, Texas. Southlake is located approximately 25 miles northwest of Dallas. The property was constructed in 2004 and is currently 98.5% occupied by 21 tenants including HomeGoods, who is expected to open for business in May 2012. Southlake Corners is shadow anchored by Lowe’s and additional retail tenants in the vicinity of Southlake Boulevard include Home Depot, Costco, HEB’s Central Market and Kroger. The property has suffered from below market stabilized occupancy levels since 2009 after Circuit City declared bankruptcy and moved out of the property and dropped from an occupancy of 96.7% in 2008 to as low as 65.3% in 2010. Toys/Babies “R” Us replaced the vacant Circuit City space and HomeGoods
is going to occupy two spaces that were formerly occupied by American Backyard and Home Depot Flooring.
 
The Market. According to the appraiser, the population and average household income as of 2011 within a three-mile radius from the property was approximately 58,356 and $121,633, respectively. According to the appraiser, the property is located within the Southlake City submarket of the Dallas/Fort Worth retail market. As of year end 2011, the Southlake City submarket had an inventory of approximately 2.1 million square feet with an average occupancy rate of 84.8% and an average asking rent of $26.70.

(1) UW NOI is higher than 2011 NOI primarily due to the burn off of tenants’ free rent periods, tenants that were not in occupancy for a full year in 2011 and contractual rent escalations.
(2) A mezzanine loan may be obtained by owners of a qualified transferee under a third party sale provided certain terms and conditions are satisfied including: (i) the LTV of the mortgage and mezzanine loans does not exceed 67.0% based on a newly commissioned appraisal; (ii) the debt service coverage ratio (taking into account the mezzanine loan) is not less than 1.25x; (iii) the mezzanine loan shall be evidenced by lender in its sole discretion and (iv) the maturity date of the mezzanine shall be no earlier than the maturity date of the loan.
(3) The Initial Other Escrows and Reserves represents the outstanding TI/LC reserve of $197,247, the parking abatement reserve of $85,980 and the Grandbridge reserve of $50,000.
 
The Loan. The $20.6 million first mortgage loan, along with borrower equity of approximately $11.0 million, was used to finance the acquisition of 2200 West Loop for approximately $30.9 million, fund upfront reserves of $478,345 and pay closing costs of $342,892. 2200 West Loop is a 201,720 square foot, Class A office property located in Galleria/West Loop North office submarket of Houston, Texas. Parmenter Realty Fund IV Investments, Inc. is the loan’s nonrecourse carve-out guarantor and is an affiliate of Parmenter Realty Partners, a privately held investment owner/manager and a repeat JPMCB borrower.
 
The Property. 2200 West Loop is located at 2200 West Loop South in the Galleria/Upton area of Houston, Texas. The high-rise, 10 story building was constructed in 1974 and is 85.1% occupied by 11 tenants. The property underwent two major renovations in 2000 and 2008. The 2000 renovation, an approximately $8.4 million renovation, focused on building modernization including a new garage, improvements to the driveway, and upgrades to the lobby and elevators. The 2008 renovation was focused on elevator modernization and chiller replacement and cost approximately $2.0 million. The largest tenants at the property are Tenaris Global Services USA (“Tenaris”), Morgan Stanley Smith Barney and Tecpetrol Operating LLC. No other tenant occupies more than 8.0% of the net rentable area. Tenaris is a subsidiary of Tenaris S.A., a supplier of tubes and related services for the energy industry
and other industrial applications. In the event that Tenaris does not renew its lease, excess cash flow will be swept up to a cap of $400,000. In the event that Morgan Stanley Smith Barney does not renew its lease, excess cash flow will be swept up to a cap of $500,000. Funds will be swept into separate accounts to be used to re-lease the respective spaces.
 
The Market. Primary access to the property is provided by West Loop South, a major artery that crosses the Houston area in a north-south direction. Public transportation is provided to the property via Houston Metro. According to the appraiser, as of the third quarter of 2011, the Galleria/West Loop North office submarket had an average vacancy rate of approximately 12.1% and effective rental rate of approximately $29.12 for Class A properties. The property currently has a physical vacancy of 14.9% and an average rental rate of $21.68.

(1) The loan is structured with an anticipated repayment date (“ARD”) of November 1, 2016. In the event that the loan is not paid off on or before the ARD, the borrower is required to make monthly payments to the lender of principal and interest in the amount of the monthly debt service payment at the initial interest rate and additional interest will accrue based on a step up in the interest rate of 300 basis points plus the greater of (i) the initial interest rate (6.01800%) or (ii) 460 basis points plus the then current five year swap yield (the “Revised Interest Rate”); but in no event shall the Revised Interest Rate exceed 500 basis points plus the initial interest rate. The final maturity date of the loan is September 1, 2018.
(2) Given the single tenant nature of the property, certified historical financial statements were not made available by the borrower to the lender.
(3) Represents the Original Term to the ARD.
(4) Refer to “Operating History and Underwritten Net Cash Flow” below for general descriptions of the assumptions made in underwriting the asset.
(5) The Initial Other Escrows and Reserves represents the deferred maintenance reserve.
 
The Loan. The five-year first mortgage loan of $20.5 million, along with a $4.0 million mezzanine loan and $7.1 million of sponsor’s equity, were used to finance the acquisition of Heritage Commons IV, an approximately 164,333 square foot, Class A office property located in Fort Worth, Texas. The property was purchased for total consideration of approximately $31.0 million resulting, in a loan to cost ratio of 66.1%. The borrower is owned by affiliates of Global Income Trust, a newly formed private REIT formed through a partnership of CNL Financial Group Inc. and Macquarie Group Limited. JPMCB previously provided the Global Income Trust with a $12.4 million loan in June 2011 to finance the acquisition of Heritage Commons III, which was securitized in JPMCC 2011-C5.
 
The Property. The property is 100% occupied by a single tenant, Mercedes-Benz Financial Services USA LLC (“Mercedes-Benz”), with a lease expiration of September 30, 2018. The Class A property was built-to-suit for Mercedes-Benz in 2008 and includes amenities such as conference facilities, a cafeteria/dining area and multiple fitness areas. Mercedes-Benz, a subsidiary of Daimler Group AG, provides financing for dealers and buyers of Daimler-brand cars and trucks in the US, Canada, Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico, with a current loan portfolio of approximately $32.0 billion. The property is part of a larger master-planned, mixed-use development complex called Alliance Texas.
 
The Market. The property is located in North Fort Worth within the Alliance Texas development, a 17,000 acre master-planned, mixed-use development. The development serves as a central location for office, retail, industrial and residential communities in North Fort Worth. Alliance Texas offers a variety of commercial real estate options, including industrial, office and retail properties. Alliance Texas is home to 290 companies serving over 30,000 employees and 7,700 single-family homes, and is home to a variety of companies such as Fidelity Investments, Bell Helicopter, Deloitte University and TD Ameritrade. According to the appraiser, the property is located in the Alliance Texas submarket which, as of the first quarter of 2011, had an average vacancy rate of approximately 4.4%, compared to the broader Metroplex submarket which had a vacancy rate of 17.0%.

(1) The increase in UW NOI over 2011 NOI is the result of five tenants totaling 22,149 square feet commencing their lease terms throughout 2011 and early 2012, as well as St. Giles’ 7,860 square foot expansion taking effect in August of 2012.
(2) The Initial Other Escrows and Reserves represent the free rent reserve for outstanding rent abatements and underwritten rent escalations where tenants are not yet paying their full underwritten rent.
 
The Loan. The $20.0 million first mortgage loan was used to refinance previously existing debt of approximately $13.3 million, fund upfront reserves of $669,619, pay closing costs of $327,118 and return equity of approximately $5.6 million to the sponsor. The loan is secured by an approximately 93,321 square foot, Class B office property located in San Francisco, California. The previously existing debt was securitized in the JPMCC 2007-LDP10 transaction.
 
The Property.  785 Market Street is a 93,321 square foot office building comprised of 18 stories as well as a basement and a penthouse.  The Property was built in 1906 and substantially renovated in the 1980. The property is 99.0% occupied by 22 office tenants and one retail tenant.  The top tenant at the property is St. Giles Colleges, Inc, an English language speaking and teacher-training organization with locations in San Francisco, New York, the UK, Canada and Brazil, which currently occupies 15,755 square feed and will expand its space to 23,615 square feet in August 2012 (25.3% of net rentable area).
 
The Market.  The property is located just west of San Francisco’s central business district, between 3rd and 4th Streets in the Union Square submarket.  According to the appraiser, as of the fourth quarter of 2011 the Union Square submarket had an inventory of approximately $4.2 million square feet with an average vacancy rate of 5.3% and average asking rents of $32.96.  The property currently has a physical vacancy rate of 1.0% and an average rental rate of $31.42.
