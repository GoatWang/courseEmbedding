WHY PRODUCTS IN THE NEWS?




Because you want results …NOW!











Products in the News started as a direct response television program on the Discovery Channel and other cable networks.





At any one time, up to a million people would tune-in to see TV segments on a handful of different products, services, computer apps and even books!
Start-ups, small businesses and new products would appear on the half hour show to introduce mass audiences to their product or brand. It was affordable, because we produced the show ourselves, and procured the TV time directly with the cable networks. What quickly resulted, were clients that wanted to do more. They wanted to be on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. They wanted more TV. More traffic to their websites and into call centers.
They wanted SEO and SEM help. They needed higher conversions from site visitors. Email, Banners, Shopping Carts, Radio, Newsprint, Magazine…
In short, what started as a TV show turned into a busy successful clients bustling for help!

PRODUCTS IN THE NEWS HAS THE EXPERTISE TO MAKE YOUR PRODUCT A SUCCESS!




Come to a Trusted Source to Get Results!




John Scherer is a long-time direct response marketing guru. As the CEO of Products in the News, he understands time is limited, resources are tight …and money is even tighter!





That’s why everything we do at Products in the News is designed to turn heads, convert traffic and drive sales.
For years, at John’s computer learning company, Video Professor, John had a mantra: Melt the Phones. It meant that you couldn’t get a sale until the customer reached out to you – so making compelling offers to targeted customers was just the beginning of the process.
Once the phone melted it was time to close the sale. At Products in the News, we close for our clients everyday. If it means capturing the right data, clean navigation through the eCommerce path, or anything else. We aim to exceed your expectations for delivering sales!

Product Information 
 
John Walvoord is widely acknowledged as the dean of all twentieth century prophecy scholars on the strength of his prolific contributions to the contemporary study of the end-times. As president and chancellor of Dallas Theological Seminary for over 50 years, he inspired and trained ministers, teachers, and Christian college and seminary professors. His teaching and subsequent publications on prophetic subjects have the hallmarks of being true to Scripture and easily understandable by all.
 
Our new Walvoord Collection features three foundational titles which will provide new insights to seasoned as well as new students of Christology and biblical prophesy.
 
   Daniel: The Key to Prophetic Revelation    Widely acknowledged as a landmark work on the book of Daniel
 
This is a detailed, systematic analysis of the Book of Daniel with emphasis on investigating and refuting non-biblical views.  Daniel: The Key to Prophetic Revelation  is a companion to  The Revelation of Jesus Christ  . It goes beyond a mere presentation of the author's interpretation of Old Testament prophecy. It quotes Bible scholars from different theological perspectives to help you discover the meaning of the Scriptures cited. The book includes:·

Difficult to interpret phrases
Apocryphal additions
Major textual difficulties
Use of Persian and Greek words
Historical background of Bible events
Past and future fulfillments of specific prophecies

Though contemporary analysis and explanation, this Walvoord masterpiece emphasizes the value and genuineness of Daniel and his prophecies in the light of modern biblical and archaeological evidence.    A $21.95 value 
 
   The Revelation of Jesus Christ    A verse-by-verse study of one of the most complex books in the Bible.
 
Developed from years of teaching, dedicated study, and sound evangelical scholarship, this is a sane and sensible commentary on the book of Revelation.
 
No other New Testament book evokes the same fascination, produces wider divergence of interpretation, and is less understood than the book of the Revelation. The Bible was intended to be understood, the author maintains, and Revelation is no exception. Here then is a book for those who have been puzzled by the seals, trumpets, woes, plagues, and vials, for those who do not understand who the beast, the false prophet, and the great red dragon represent.There is also excellent analysis for those who want to know the meaning for our day of the letters to the seven churches.
 
Walvoord recognizes Revelation's symbolic features, but points out that much of it can be interpreted literally. He defends the premillennial position, but at crucial points considers other views — the allegorical and historical, and the amillennial and postmillennial approaches.
 
With more than 200,000 copies in print,  The Revelation of Jesus Christ  has earned its place as a highly-regarded exposition and approach to the book of Revelation from a dispensational viewpoint.
 
In comparing  The Revelation of Jesus Christ  to Ryrie's  Revelation  , you will find the Ryrie work to be a competent and concise primary resource for understanding and teaching. The more-detailed presentation of The  Revelation of Jesus Chris  t will expand your exegetical knowledge of Revelation's themes, prophesies and related doctrinal positions.    A $21.95 value 
 
   Jesus Christ Our Lord     Contemporary in analysis and defense of orthodox Christology in the face of modern liberalism
 
Of the life and work of Jesus, the apostle John said, “Even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written” (John 21:25). Acknowledging the size of the task, as well as its importance, John Walvoord has written this systematic presentation of the Person and work of Christ from eternity past to eternity future.
 
Beginning with an analysis of modern trends in the study of Christology, Dr. Walvoord shows that “contemporary Christology has in many respects confused rather than clarified the extended revelation of the Word of God.”
 
Analyzing the Old Testament, he shows Christ in history, typology, and prophecy. Then, in the New Testament, he examines the life and work of the incarnate Christ, including the doctrines of atonement, redemption, propitiation, and reconciliation. This add-on will complement your other Walvoord content with an examination of the present and future work of Christ and the completion of His Kingdom.    A $17.95 value
