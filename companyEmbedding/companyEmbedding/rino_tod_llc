Gunzilla® BC-10 
is a patent pending formula designed to clean, lubricate and protect all in one formula. Gunzilla performs best when no other cleaners, oils or preservatives are used.   Gunzilla BC-10 was developed to reduce weapon malfunctions and to remove the health concerns associated with hazardous gun cleaners and lubricants.  Gunzilla is made from natural based materials and contains no water and no petroleum solvents.   It is safer and more effective than other gun cleaners, and can be used on every type of gun which includes handguns, shotguns, rifles, automatic weapons, black powder guns and cannons.

Gunzilla effectively removes carbon, copper, lead, rust, black powder, and plastic particles left from shotgun sabots/wads.  Most cleaners soften carbon but it still must be scraped or scrubbed off a gun.  Gunzillas unique formula breaks the bonds of the carbon molecules and turns them into a sludge-like liquid.  It also neutralizes and cleans the residue left by corrosive primers.  In black powder guns Gunzilla eliminates using water to clean and oil to lubricate.  Just clean the black powder gun with Gunzilla and then you are done.

Gunzilla improves weapon reliability because it leaves a non-ionic coating for lubrication and protection which doesn't attract or retain sand, dust and carbon. In Iraq, Gunzilla has reduced weapon malfunctions by 75% and is considered a life saving product.  Many police and federal ranges have reported that Gunzilla has eliminated the weapon jamming problems on their range guns.

Many champion shooters claim they have scored their highest scores using Gunzilla because it eliminates and/or greatly reduces flyers in the middle of a match.  According to one shooter every bullet goes exactly where you think it should go."

When you return home to clean your gun after shooting, Gunzilla has a very low odor so you wont drive everyone out of your home.  Once you wash your hands with soap and water nobody would know you have been cleaning guns.  If you go hunting after cleaning your gun with Gunzilla you wont be notifying all the deer and elk you are in the woods looking for them.

Gunzilla is currently being used by over 22 Federal Law Enforcement Agencies, over 200 police departments, and many military units deploying to combat.  They all use Gunzilla because it is a superior cleaner, offers superior lubrication and provides superior rust protection.  Most importantly Gunzilla saves lives, saves the environment and it saves money.

Gunzilla meets the USDA Bio-Preferred product standards and it contains no hazardous chemicals, is non-flammable, and non-corrosive.  Just because a product says "biodegradable" or "non toxic" doesn't necessarily means it contains no hazardous chemicals. So it is important for the product to say "no hazardous chemicals" because hazardous chemicals are regulated by the federal government. A

hazardous chemical 

is defined by OSHA as any chemical that is a health hazard or a physical hazard.

OSHA defines a health hazard as a chemical for which there is a statistically significant evidence based on at least one study conducted in accordance with established scientific principles that acute or chronic health effects may occur in exposed employees. Chemicals covered by this definition include carcinogens, toxic or highly toxic agents, reproductive toxins, irritants, corrosives, sensitizers, hepatotoxins, nephrotoxins, neurotoxins, agents that act on the hematopoietic system and agents that can damage the lungs, skin, eyes or mucous membranes.
Gunzilla contains NO HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS, is non flammable, and non corrosive. It is also air shipping safe and is legal to carry in your checked baggage on an airliner.

Copperzilla is designed to remove the most difficult copper and lead fouling quickly.  The majority (90%) of our customers will only use Gunzilla to remove copper and lead fouling quickly.  However if you shoot solid copper bullets in a long range rifle, lead slugs in a shotgun, or found Gunzilla to work slower than you wanted, we would recommend you use Copperzilla along with Gunzilla.  Copperzilla will remove the most difficult copper and lead from the bore in 30 minutes. Then the weapon is cleaned with Gunzilla and you are done. Copperzilla can be left on any steel, stainless steel or chrome bore without etching the metal. Copperzilla is also made from natural based materials and has virtually no odor and no ammonia. In our field testing we were told Copperzilla was superior to the strongest ammonia based cleaners for removing copper. 

Gunzilla is the new gold standard for total gun care and we are proving it daily as more and more customers try our superior product. TopDuck Products, LLC offers direct purchasing programs for government agencies and we welcome all dealer inquiries. Our trained staff takes great pride in growing this company one customer at a time.  It would be a pleasure to have you as a valued customer.
Don Kettles, President
