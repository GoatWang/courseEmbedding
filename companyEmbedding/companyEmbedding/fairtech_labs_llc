Contact

	When you receive notice that your product is under detention, contact your Anresco customer service representative in your preferred language (e.g. English, Chinese, Spanish, Vietnamese, more).  Provide your rep a copy of the FDA notice as well as the shipping documents for the detained entry.  He/she will arrange for a sampler to come to your warehouse, store, or cold storage facility as soon as possible.



2

Sampling

	When the sampler arrives at your facility, you will need to take him/her to where the detained product is being held.  The sampler will take representative samples of the product per FDA guidelines.  This entails taking pictures of the shipment, selecting a predetermined number of boxes/bags without bias, opening up and taking samples from each, and recording actions taken and observations made.  After the samples have been taken, they will be driven or shipped to a nearby Anresco location.



3

Analysis

	When the samples arrive at our facility the clock starts ticking.  Our normal turnaround time is 10 business days from receipt of samples, though for some analyses it is longer or shorter.  The analyses can be turned around quicker for a "rush" surcharge.  Often times the expected completion of the analyses will occur after the FDA deadline.  In this case we will provide you a copy of the collection report and you will file an extension with the FDA.



4

Reporting

	Once the analysis is completed we will determine whether the product is likely to meet FDA requirements, fail them, or is on the borderline.  Most importers ask us to forward passing reports directly to the FDA to get them reviewed ASAP.  If the result is borderline or likely to fail then we ask the importer how they want us to proceed. Completed reports can be viewed via our client portal 24/7/365.


5

Release

	It the product is deemed not in violation of the terms of its detention the FDA will "release" it for sale to the general public!





Please note that Anresco cannot guarantee that positive results will result in a release (though that has generally been our experience).  Every FDA import district has its own unique requirements and enforcement can be arbitrary at times.  









I would recommend Anresco Labs to any colleague. I never have to worry if they're going to get the job done without fear of delay or rejection on the part of the test package.

Anresco is highly professional in rendering services, quick at responding to customer requests and orders.
Chief Tayo Akingbolagun, President of Catfish Farmers Association of Nigeria


I genuinely appreciated how I was treated by all the staff at Anresco. As a small, first time product producer, regulations can be confusing. Everyone made me feel comfortable asking questions, gave appropriate and candid answers, and provided explanations where needed. I would (and have several times) recommend Anresco Labs.
Kim Pedley, Township Valley Farms


[Anresco]'s service is great. The staff are very cooperative and helpful in all possible ways.
Ram Shrestha, Ganesh International Inc.


As an international confectionery vendor we ship over 600 full truckloads of product to the USA every year. We use many crossing points and we've partnered with ANRESCO as their customer service is extraordinary, their understanding of our needs is immediately understood, they guide us through the whole process and a bi-lingual staff facilitates our response to the FDA authorities in a timely manner.
Aramando Crespo - Managing Director of Dulces De La Rosa


We are a small-scale food manufacturer and have been using Anresco's services for over a year now.  We value their affordability, quick turnarounds on test results, and the accessibility to analysts!

The Democratsâ Better Way: Positive Messaging or Pandering to Trump Voters Who Are Never Coming Back?



George Washington law professor and economist praises Democrats for coming up with a message that preserves the partyâs commitment to social justice issues, rather than attempting to woo Trump voters by appealing to what Trump appealed to.

The Democratsâ Better Way: Positive Messaging or Pandering to Trump Voters Who Are Never Coming Back?



George Washington law professor and economist praises Democrats for coming up with a message that preserves the partyâs commitment to social justice issues, rather than attempting to woo Trump voters by appealing to what Trump appealed to.
