        Celebrate faith and fashion with this diamond Star of David pendant from the Unstoppable Love¬ô Collection. Created in warm 10K gold, this design pairs one polished and one diamond-lined triangle together to create a traditional Star of David. At the center of the star, a flower-shaped composite of shimmering diamonds glistens in a unique setting that moves with every turn of her head and every beat of her heart. Radiant with 1/6 ct. t.w. of diamonds and polished to a brilliant shine, this Star of David pendant suspends along an 18.0-inch rope chain that secures with a spring-ring clasp.
