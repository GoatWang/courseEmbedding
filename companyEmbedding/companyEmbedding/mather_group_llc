Company | The Mather Group, LLC

















 























Get to know a new kind of advisor












In 2001, we built The Mather Group from the ground up to put all of our experience and expertise to work for one purpose—the interests of our clients.
Within Wall Street firms, there is a culture of profits placed before a client’s best interest. Where advisors are pressured to sell products simply to increase revenue. We chose a new model by breaking away from Wall Street and created a culture focused on giving sound advice.
We also wanted to provide a complete retirement plan—including expert tax planning. For successful executives preparing for retirement, sound tax advice in combination with investment strategy is often their greatest need. Wall Street can’t do that.
By removing the pressure to sell products, and creating a total focus on serving clients, we’ve built a culture that attracts talented investment professionals who are service oriented, not profit-hungry. The Mather Group’s focus is on our clients and their success. 

“The Mather Group’s focus is exclusively on our clients and their success.”
We believe in giving back to the communities we serve.

Financial Planning Services | The Mather Group, LLC
















 























Complete Retirement Planning Services















Guiding a successful retirement requires more than just managing investments. Our comprehensive planning services cover all aspects of making a smooth financial and lifestyle transition, above and beyond most competitors' offerings.† 


Tax Planning
Investment Management
Estate Planning
Risk Management
 




†As of 2011, based on "Study on Investment Advisors and Broker-Dealers" by U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission, only 3.8% of advisors are fiduciaries and obligated to your interests first.








Expert Tax Planning to Maximize Your Retirement 





When planning for retirement you need a focused and experienced eye on your taxes—something most of our competitors can’t offer.
Through the development of comprehensive cash flow models, The Mather Group's CPAs may be able to significantly reduce your tax liabilities over multi-year periods. This includes a detailed review of your tax returns while leveraging extensive knowledge of your corporate benefit programs.
Our tax expertise will maximize your wealth for years to come, and includes:

Income tax reduction
Income tax smoothing
Executive deferral program optimization
Quarterly estimated tax filing
Tax minimization on highly appreciated stock
Tax reduction for stock option exercises

Tax loss harvesting minimizes your investment losses and tax liability while maintaining portfolio risk and optimizing your expected return. It’s a simple, yet powerful strategy too often overlooked. Watch our video to learn more. 






One of the ways The Mather Group strives to maximize portfolio gains while minimizing your tax exposure is through Tax Loss Harvesting.











Investment Management with Your Best Interests in Mind 





Our unbiased approach enables us to draw on a diversified array of research from many leading global institutions.
Using this research, we create low-cost targeted portfolios that accommodate various levels of risk, from current income generation to more growth-oriented goals. With an emphasis on risk management, we maximize the predictability of our portfolio returns to help you best achieve your retirement goals. 

Experience How The Mather Group Guides Your Investments.
Explore the chart  








Estate Planning: Protecting Your Wealth
Successful retirement requires smart plans for transferring your wealth to the people and organizations that matter most to you.
We work with you to foster the wise stewardship of your wealth by minimizing probate expenses and estate taxes. Furthermore, we create sound structures that will protect your wealth for future generations. 








Managing Risk For a Complete Retirement Picture 





As you transition into retirement, you're likely to encounter financial risks that require careful consideration.
We analyze the merits of long-term care and life insurance solutions alongside your retirement, estate, and tax-planning needs. If we identify a gap in insurance needs, we recommend a solution that originates with your existing insurance agent. We never recommend insurance solutions in exchange for commission.
We compare possible retiree health insurance with private and Affordable Care Act plans to ensure our clients have optimal coverage at the lowest cost available. We also assist in Medicare enrollment and the selection of Medigap and Supplemental policies on an annual basis.

Why Us for Your Retirement Planning | The Mather Group, LLC

















 























Smart, Trusted Retirement Planning















Low-Cost Advice Sets Us Apart‡
We find the most cost-effective investment strategies, and you pay only for our expert advice – no commissions, no product fees, and no hidden fees.
The Mather Group's fee-only index approach puts more of your money where it should be—in your investments, not in a broker's pockets. Without those commissions and hidden fees, your portfolio has more money growing in retirement, a method that's 60% lower in cost than a comparative mutual fund portfolio.*
 
‡ Based on Average Advisory Fee Percentages in Personal Capital's "Financial Savings Report: The Real Cost of Fees." 


Our way is 60%lower cost*

Are added fees crippling your investments?
For every new client, we provide a free investment audit to expose the true cost of owning each of your investments. If there are hidden fees, we bring them to light. Nine times out of ten, your investment costs with The Mather Group are significantly lower.
Get a Free Cost Audit 









A FIDUCIARY OBLIGATION TOPUT YOUR INTERESTS FIRST
Fiduciaries like The Mather Group are registered investment advisors (RIAs) with a fiduciary duty to their clients.
That means we have a legal obligation to always act in your best interest. Brokers and hybrid RIAs are not obligated to act in your best interest and can sell investment products for commissions.
And there are no conflicts about where your money is held – all your investments are held in a separate custody with Fidelity, a highly rated national firm. 

Our motivation is to see your retirement investments grow.
Meet Your Advisors 








Only 3.8% of all advisors areOBLIGATED TO PUT YOUR INTERESTS FIRST†
Is your financial advisor truly your advocate?  Conduct a quick "Fiduciary Audit" on any firm you might consider. 







Critical questions to ask your advisor



Do you offer in-house/proprietary investment products or solutions? This identifies conflicts of interest. If they use their own products, they are double dipping, which means they are charging you product fees on top of management fees.
The Mather Group has an open architecture, which means we can invest in anything that is publicly traded. We only use what is best for our clients and we DO NOT have our own products. 

Do you carry a series 6 or series 7 license? This identifies if someone carries a brokerage license. If they do, they are not a fiduciary 100% of the time and can get paid in non-transparent ways.
The Mather Group does not hold a series 6 or series 7 license since we are a true fiduciary RIA.

Company | The Mather Group, LLC

















 























Get to know a new kind of advisor












In 2001, we built The Mather Group from the ground up to put all of our experience and expertise to work for one purpose—the interests of our clients.
Within Wall Street firms, there is a culture of profits placed before a client’s best interest. Where advisors are pressured to sell products simply to increase revenue. We chose a new model by breaking away from Wall Street and created a culture focused on giving sound advice.
We also wanted to provide a complete retirement plan—including expert tax planning. For successful executives preparing for retirement, sound tax advice in combination with investment strategy is often their greatest need. Wall Street can’t do that.
By removing the pressure to sell products, and creating a total focus on serving clients, we’ve built a culture that attracts talented investment professionals who are service oriented, not profit-hungry. The Mather Group’s focus is on our clients and their success. 

“The Mather Group’s focus is exclusively on our clients and their success.”
We believe in giving back to the communities we serve.

Wikipedia

Wikipedia is now even more integral to Google search results with the removal of right side ads, and takes up more space on branded search results. Since anyone can edit Wikipedia at any time, we make sure that your reputation is upheld and thriving.

http://themathergroupllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/wikipedia.mp4
 

 
NY Times Best-Selling Author has Wikipedia Page Deleted
Even NY Times best-selling authors aren’t immune to the occasionally trigger-happy Wikipedia community. Not having a Wikipedia page is both detrimental to your SEO and Google results, but more important for this author, it is also the way to gain legitimacy and status on the internet. If you don’t have a Wikipedia page, you aren’t even seen. This was especially important as he had a new book coming out that was likely to be searched for on the internet for more information prior to someone purchasing the book.
The Mather Group carefully rewrote his page and coded it in the special wiki language. We republished it, and when we did so added citations to it and linked from other articles that mentioned the author back to the main page. This made the Wiki page stronger as it wasn’t an “orphan” any longer. Most importantly we continued to defend it from being deleted as we monitored it.
The author now has a fully-functional and stable Wikipedia page which has given him more shelf space on Google. The Mather Group continues to monitor his page to make sure that it is up-to-date, relevant and accurate.
