Please take a look through my carefully chosen beautiful designer fabrics sold by the fat quarter or by the metre.
You can order fabric samples online – if you would like a sample of any fabric simply click the Order a Sample button on the fabric page (maximum 5 samples per order – total cost for 5 samples is £1 including FREE postage).
For reference (if fabric is 110cm wide):-
1 fat quarter = 55cm wide x 50cm long; 2 fat quarters = 110cm wide x 50cm long or 0.5m
3 fat quarters = 110cm wide x 75cm long or 0.75m; 4 fat quarters = 110cm wide x 100cm long or 1m, etc
Therefore if you require 0.5m of fabric please enter a quantity of 2; If you require 0.75m of fabric please enter a quantity of 3; If you require 1.0m of fabric please enter a quantity of 4, etc.
Note: For multiple fat quarters purchased in the same design you will receive one continuous length of fabric.
There is an ‘in stock’ indicator for each fabric just so you can see how much is still available. If you need more then please do not hesitate to contact me as I will restock regularly. Widths are approximate as per the manufacturers specifications. Colours are reproduced as accurately as possible but colours do vary between computer screens – you may order samples of any in stock fabrics.

Please take a look through my carefully chosen beautiful designer fabrics sold by the fat quarter or by the metre.
You can order fabric samples online – if you would like a sample of any fabric simply click the Order a Sample button on the fabric page (maximum 5 samples per order – total cost for 5 samples is £1 including FREE postage).
For reference (if fabric is 110cm wide):-
1 fat quarter = 55cm wide x 50cm long; 2 fat quarters = 110cm wide x 50cm long or 0.5m
3 fat quarters = 110cm wide x 75cm long or 0.75m; 4 fat quarters = 110cm wide x 100cm long or 1m, etc
Therefore if you require 0.5m of fabric please enter a quantity of 2; If you require 0.75m of fabric please enter a quantity of 3; If you require 1.0m of fabric please enter a quantity of 4, etc.
Note: For multiple fat quarters purchased in the same design you will receive one continuous length of fabric.
There is an ‘in stock’ indicator for each fabric just so you can see how much is still available. If you need more then please do not hesitate to contact me as I will restock regularly. Widths are approximate as per the manufacturers specifications. Colours are reproduced as accurately as possible but colours do vary between computer screens – you may order samples of any in stock fabrics.
