Urban Futures, Inc. (UFI) has wrapped up a number of projects for clients across multiple divisions of the company. Delivering quality product for each UFI client is critical to the company’s mission. Below is a brief summary of recent work completed.
In the State of California, municipalities are required to file a number of annual reports and material event notices for bond issuances. UFI has just wrapped up a busy disclosure season, ensuring client municipalities are in compliance with State law. UFI provided disclosure services to 79 cities or special districts, filing 327 reports during the most recent disclosure period. Isom Advisors, the UFI schools finance division, provided disclosure services to 70 school districts during that same period.
UFI has also recently completed an Interim Finance Director assignment in the City of Patterson. For the past six months, UFI has served as the Chief Finance Officer of the City while a search is carried out for a permanent replacement to fill the vacant position. This interim staffing solution allowed the City to take their time in a hiring search and find the exact match for their needs.
The City of Oxnard is preparing for an audit and engaged UFI to assist their finance team in preparation. The firm has wrapped up work in the City, and Oxnard is now prepared to move forward with their audit.
