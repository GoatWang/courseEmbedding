You need someone to represent you who knows the process. Someone who thoroughly researches and prepares your case for all possible outcomes. Joe McGrath is that type of lawyer. We have used Joe many times over the last several years for minor infractions, all with a positive outcome. Most recently he represented us on some serious charges in two different jurisdictions. He was zealous in his pursuit of getting the facts of the case straight.He repeatedly tried to call the district attorney in one of the cases for over a month, and the DA would not return his call. He finally got in his car and drove an hour to the DA’s office so he could provide his side of the case. He provided additional information to the DA and letters of reference on behalf of his client and was able to get the felony charge reduced to a misdemeanor. We were very thankful for his compassion, dedication and perseverance to our case. Joe also recommended counseling which we would have not sought on our own. The counseling has changed my son’s life. This would not have been possible without Joe.Joe McGrath believes everyone should have equal footing in the courtroom and be heard. He will stand up for you and not back down in what he believes is the truth. I would highly recommend Joe  McGrath, because he cares about you and your individual circumstances. Joseph McGrath Attorney At LawTackle150@hotmail.com M. ratedI live in Florida and found that Virginia had a restriction on my license from 21 years ago. I could not renew my Florida license until it was lifted. I tried on my own to handle it for a year and a half with no luck. I hired Joe and wished I had done so in the beginning. He quickly and efficiently took over, and with his expertise and connections I had my license restored in 3 months despite the complications I created. The man is amazing and reasonably priced. (He doesn't charge enough as far as I'm concerned) My job depends on travel so he honestly saved me. I cant recommend him enough!Brent A Jackson & Associates, PC.davidkimstanley ratedBrent Jackson took my 'truly impossible' case without hesitation, because he saw tremendous injustice that needed a 'fighter'.  He took on the WHOLE system, and never gave up, EVER.  He was relentless and fearless. I feel I owe my fate and future to his actions and efforts.  WE WON when EVERYONE said it could NEVER be done. His courtroom powers are amazing, but his character and courage surpass even his legal skills. It is not exageration to say that I could safely place my entire fate in his hands, because I DID, and I am FOREVER glad that I did. Riley & Wells Attorneys-At-LawDouglas G. ratedMr. Bohannon represented me for what seemed to be a bazar traffic incident.  Once in the courtroom, he had applied his wealth of experience in negotiation to appease his client by finding a solution that I believe was least restrictive for the other party.  Though counter intuitive, he helped me to help someone with mental disabilities.  Unbridled, I shudder to imagine the person’s fate because it was clear that we had the advantage.  Mr. Bohannon used 360°vision to resolve the conflict.  I was pleased.Douglas T. GravesAngela Whitleysylvia.anderson.718 ratedIf you are in trouble, contact Angela Whitley.  Mrs. Whitley is very knowledgeable of the law.  She is professional and extremely reliable.  She understands the court system, and how the law works.  But she is also concerned about people.  She will  provide you with great support through the entire legal process. She helped me get through so many things that I did not understand.Give Mrs. Whitley a try!  After your first experience as her client, you'll find yourself retuning to her for all of your legal needs.  Joseph McGrath Attorney At LawChris J. ratedI got a DUI for blowing a .08 at a sobriety checkpoint in Richmond VA and was facing license suspension of a year.Joe worked with me to get all of the necessary information about my case, and handled it all the way until I was judged Not Guilty in Richmond Circuit Court. Joe can give you more background on my case.Though there are no guarantees in his profession, I believe Joe used the best and most strategic tactics to prove my innocence and save me a crap load of money and time.CPJBrent A Jackson & Associates, PC.jnathaniel ratedOne of the things that impressed me when I visited Mr. Jackson's office was the newspaper articles on the wall giving you a history of his career.  It provided me with a sense of comfort that I was dealing with an individual who knew his profession.  He was honest with me in our dealings and sometimes the truth did hurt.  But I got the last laugh when I asked if he wished that he could still grow hair.  Thanks for everything........God BlessJoseph McGrath Attorney At LawTamara G. ratedCDL TRUCKERS TAKE NOTEI highly recommend Joe McGrath! As a CDL OTR driver my license is my livelihood. Mr. McGrath represented me last minute and was able to get my case resolved in my favor without my ever having to appear and take time from my job.  He remained in contact and kept me informed every step of the way.  He understands the trucker and the importance of keeping points off if our CDL!  Recommended without reservation! Brent A Jackson & Associates, PC.a1b1c1d1 ratedAttorney Jackson is the person you go to if you need a fighter in Court.  He has represented my family for over 20 years and has been with us through the good and the bad.  When you go to his office he has a wall of "Thank You" cards.  I just wanted to say  "Thank You" to him in a way that everyone should know because our family believes in him.John A March, Attorney-at-Lawfreeman ratedI was arrested on a felony cha...I was arrested on a felony charge of larceny and was facing 1-5 years in prison.  Mr. March got the charges dismissed and now I am a free man.  Mr. March is very professional and committed to getting the job done.  If you are in need of a great attorney...please retain the services of Mr. March.Did You Know?Types of AttorneysThe legal profession is vast, with each attorney having his or her specialties. Here are some of the most common attorneys individuals seek out when they require legal aid:Criminal Lawyer
A criminal defense lawyer is probably the attorney the average person imagines. Criminal attorneys are the men and women who defend individuals accused of a crime. The lawyer may work pro bono - for the public good - so the accused is certain to have representation, even if he or she cannot afford an attorney.Criminal lawyers are experts in the criminal justice system. They help their clients decide how to plead when first charged by the police and guide them through trial procedures. Defense lawyers must use every bit of their knowledge and resources to get their clients the fairest results from criminal proceedings.Business Lawyer
If you are a small business owner or the head of a larger corporation, you may come into contact with a business lawyer. Many big companies keep a legal staff on payroll to deal with the daily operations of running and maintaining a large enterprise. Business lawyers may have more specific specialties like copyright law, product liability and mergers and acquisitions.Business attorneys may focus their practices on certain industries. There are entertainment lawyers to guide artists through royalties and media contracts, while hospitals employ malpractice attorneys to protect doctors from aggressive litigation.Employment Lawyer
When you work for a company, you may find yourself in need of an employment lawyer - especially if the relationship between you and your employer sours. An employment attorney prevents people from losing their jobs due to unfair reasons. Workers' compensation lawyers help maintain safe employment conditions and ensure workers receive fair compensation after workplace injury or discrimination.Finance Lawyer
A personal finance attorney can protect and manage your investments and securities. You may use a finance lawyer to help you prepare your taxes, but you might be better off working with an accountant. A tax attorney is more commonly contacted after a business or individual runs into trouble with the IRS or state regulators.Real Estate Lawyer
Your family may keep a lawyer on retainer to guide you through the major expenses that come up in life. When buying a home, you could work with a real estate lawyer to make sure you get the best deal and won't get taken advantage of by tricky mortgage agreements or unfair landlords. An estate attorney can help you plan for the worst by creating a will and preparing your finances for after your death.Bankruptcy Lawyer
A bankruptcy lawyer is essential to help you resolve your financial difficulties when they start to spin out of control. Certain attorneys help create strategies to bring you out of debt and speak to your creditors. A lawyer can advise you on which type of bankruptcy you should file for.Civil Lawyer
If you are suing someone or being sued, you need a civil lawyer. Civil attorneys - and criminal lawyers - are the legal representatives who argue on your behalf in a courtroom setting. Civil lawyers may represent you on matters of business, finance or a wide variety of other specialized needs.One of the most common types of civil attorneys is a personal injury lawyer. When you're hurt by an outside party and you would like to hold them legally responsible, a personal injury attorney conducts litigation and negotiates settlements to compensate for your pain and suffering. Sometimes many wronged people will join together with a single civil lawyer or law office to form a class action lawsuit.Family/Divorce Lawyer
Most people will turn to a lawyer during a divorce to navigate the emotionally charged legal proceedings. A divorce attorney can assist in determining grounds for separation, division of property and custody of children.Family attorneys deal with much more personal matters. If you're getting married, a family lawyer can help you prepare a prenuptial agreement or other family planning paperwork such as adoption or inheritance documents.Questions One Should Ask a Lawyer Before Hiring ThemTo ensure you find a competent attorney who won't abuse your trust or drain your finances, you have to make the proper inquiries. There are several questions you should ask, but the majority will fall under three general topics:Training and Experience Questions
One of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorney's history. When you first step into a lawyer's office, you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas. You have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.Once you inquire about the broad details of their legal career, you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue. You should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases.Financial Questions
You need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney. You should request a list of all costs in advance so you won't be surprised by additional expenses like overhead. Also determine exactly when you will start being billed. You want to inspect paperwork carefully. If the attorney charges you for his or her experience, you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistant.Find out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour. Many civil lawyers work on contingency. Whatever the payment plan, make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performance.Lawyer/Client Relationship Questions
When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time. You need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship. The attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updates.You should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust. Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship. Great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier, such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle. The more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs, the better.Top Reasons to Hire a LawyerYou may keep a lawyer on retainer or you could turn to an attorney during specific situations. Here are some common reasons people begin seeking legal representation or advice:You Know Your Limitations
If you sign documents and you come across a word you don't recognize, you need assistance. You may need a third party to help you navigate important employment or real estate paperwork. It's essential you fully understand the terms of any legally binding documentation or activity you become a part of. If you are not an expert in a given field, you'll want to hire an attorney who is.A lawyer may find legal implications or opportunities you might miss. If you find yourself in a civil or criminal matter, a proper attorney ensures you don't receive a harsh punishment for a small mistake.You're Facing an Important Event/Decision
When making decisions critical to your financial stability or personal life, you may want a lawyer with expertise in your situation to make sure you do everything you can to arrive at the proper resolution. This is especially true when you become involved in a criminal case and your freedom is on the line.It's not just a matter of legal knowledge; lawyer's have access to numerous resources you do not. They have staff ready to work around the clock and experts in a variety of fields to give your important issues the attention they deserve.You Can't Be Impartial
During times when personal matters intersect with legal proceedings, you may need to have an advocate to prevent your emotions from getting in the way of level-headed thinking. For example, divorce lawyers can mediate a heated argument and help both partners get on with their lives.Emotional investment could be subtle. You may want to have a lawyer look over an investment opportunity that looks too good to be true or investigate the merits of a possible civil suit when you feel wronged.You're Out of Options
Many people turn to lawyers when they are in trouble. If you've been accused of a crime or are in a terrible financial situation, you can find an attorney who will work with what you have available to assist you as you deal with your problems.Personal injury lawyers find solutions for people who can no longer work under their own power and bankruptcy attorneys prevent people from giving in to debt. If you find yourself in a situation where you can't find a solution, a lawyer may be able to offer the counsel you need.How to Choose a LawyerWhen it comes time to choose a lawyer, you should start by searching close to home. While you probably don't want the conflict of interest that comes from being represented by a family member, friends and loved ones can recommend lawyers who served them well in the past. If you do have attorneys you are familiar with, ask who they believe would be best for you.After going through personal references - especially from individuals who had similar needs - you should broaden your search through public information resources. You can call your area's attorney referral service or check legal organizations like Martindale-Hubbell. There are other resources available online. You should check websites for client reviews and other third-party forms of approval.When you build a list of possible candidates, perform a background check on each one. See if you can find information on their history and success record. Once you find a possible lawyer, you should call to arrange a consultation so you can ask your important questions in person.By performing the necessary research and taking every available precaution, you can narrow your search to the attorney most suited to your needs.
