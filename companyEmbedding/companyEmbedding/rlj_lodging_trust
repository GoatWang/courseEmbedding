Forward Looking Statements


      Certain statements in this press release that are not in the present or 
      past tense or that discuss the expectations of RLJ and/or FelCor are 
      forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the U.S. 
      Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the U.S. 
      Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward looking 
      statements, which are based on current expectations, estimates and 
      projections about the industry and markets in which RLJ and FelCor 
      operate and beliefs of and assumptions made by RLJ management and FelCor 
      management, involve uncertainties that could significantly affect the 
      financial results of RLJ or FelCor or the combined company. Words such 
      as "expects," "anticipates," "intends," "plans," "believes," "seeks," 
      "estimates," “forecast,” “guidance,” “outlook,” “may,” and “might” and 
      variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to 
      identify such forward looking statements, which generally are not 
      historical in nature. Such forward-looking statements may include, but 
      are not limited to, statements about the anticipated benefits of the 
      proposed merger between RLJ and FelCor, including future financial and 
      operating results, the attractiveness of the value to be received by 
      FelCor stockholders, the attractiveness of the value to be received by 
      RLJ, the combined company's plans, objectives, expectations and 
      intentions, the timing of future events, anticipated administrative and 
      operating synergies, the anticipated impact of the merger on net debt 
      ratios, cost of capital, future dividend payment rates, forecasts of FFO 
      accretion, projected capital improvements, expected sources of 
      financing, and descriptions relating to these expectations. All 
      statements that address operating performance, events or developments 
      that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future — including 
      statements relating to expected synergies, improved liquidity and 
      balance sheet strength — are forward looking statements. These 
      statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain 
      risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. 
      Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking 
      statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance 
      that our expectations will be attained and therefore, actual outcomes 
      and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted 
      in such forward looking statements. Some of the factors that may affect 
      outcomes and results include, but are not limited to: (i) national, 
      regional and local economic climates, (ii) changes in the real estate 
      industry, financial markets and interest rates, or to the business or 
      financial condition of either company or business (iii) increased or 
      unanticipated competition for the companies' properties, (iv) risks 
      associated with acquisitions, including the integration of the combined 
      companies' businesses, (v) the potential liability for the failure to 
      meet regulatory requirements, including the maintenance of REIT status, 
      (vi) availability of financing and capital, (vii) risks associated with 
      achieving expected revenue synergies or cost savings, (viii) risks 
      associated with the companies' ability to consummate the merger and the 
      timing of the closing of the merger, (ix) the outcome of claims and 
      litigation involving or affecting either company, (x) applicable 
      regulatory changes, and (xi) those additional risks and factors 
      discussed in reports filed with the Securities and Exchange 
      Commission ("SEC") by RLJ and FelCor from time to time, including those 
      discussed under the heading "Risk Factors" in their respective most 
      recently filed reports on Forms 10K and 10Q. Neither RLJ nor FelCor 
      undertakes any duty to update any forward looking statements appearing 
      in this document.

About RLJ
RLJ Lodging Trust is a self-advised, publicly traded real estate investment trust focused on acquiring premium-branded, focused-service and compact full-service hotels. RLJ Lodging Trust has a portfolio of 122 properties, with approximately 20,100 rooms, located in 21 states and the District of Columbia. Our hotels are geographically diverse  and concentrated in major urban areas and dense  markets that provide  multiple demand generators from business, leisure and other travelers.  At  the same time, as a result of high construction costs and the density of these  markets, these locales provide significant barriers to  entry.  We believe that our investment strategy presents attractive opportunities for us to acquire additional  hotels with significant upside potential. 
Our strategy is to invest in focused-service  and compact full-service hotels, which typically generate most of their revenue  from room rentals, have limited food and beverage outlets and meeting space,  and require fewer employees than larger hotels. We believe that such  premium-branded, focused-service hotels have the potential to provide  attractive risk-adjusted returns relative to  larger full-service hotels due to their ability to  generate higher revenue per room while  providing better profit margins as a result of a more efficient operating model  and less volatile cash flows.  Our hotels operate under well-recognized  global brands, including Courtyard by Marriott, Residence Inn by Marriott,  Hilton Garden Inn, Homewood Suites by Hilton, Hyatt Place and Embassy Suites and we  maintain strong relationships with these leading franchisors.  
The company became publicly-traded in May  2011 and was formed to succeed  the hotel investment and ownership platform  of RLJ Development and its two remaining lodging-focused private equity funds,  RLJ Lodging Fund II, LP and RLJ Real Estate Fund III, LP.  RLJ Development  was co-founded in 2000 by Robert L. Johnson, our Executive Chairman, and Thomas  J. Baltimore, Jr. With over 15 years of operations, the company has developed significant expertise in  acquiring and asset managing  focused-service and compact full-service hotels.  Our experienced senior management team, which operated the company's  predecessor, is comprised of seasoned professionals with extensive industry  relationships and asset management experience that will allow us to continue to  compete effectively and generate strong internal  growth.  In addition, we plan to enhance the value of this platform by  being open and transparent in our investor communications and following sound  corporate governance practices.
The  company is a self-advised and self-administered Maryland real estate investment trust and is  traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the stock symbol "RLJ".

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Industry Update




Press Release24 April 2017RLJ Lodging Trust and FelCor Lodging Trust to Merge Creating $7 Billion Leading Lodging REIT

Bethesda, MD – RLJ Lodging Trust ("RLJ") (NYSE: RLJ) and FelCor Lodging Trust Incorporated ("FelCor") (NYSE: FCH) today announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement (the "Merger Agreement") under which FelCor will merge with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of RLJ in an all-stock transaction. Post-merger, RLJ is expected to have a pro forma equity market capitalization of approximately $4.2 billion and a total enterprise value of $7 billion, creating the largest pure-play public REIT dedicated to owning focused-service and compact full-service hotels.

The merger will establish the third biggest pure-play lodging REIT by enterprise value, creating meaningful scale to capitalize on cost efficiencies, negotiate leverage and access to capital, and the opportunity to strategically recycle assets and optimize the portfolio. The combined company will have ownership interests in 160 hotels, including premiumbranded hotels located primarily in urban and coastal markets with multiple demand generators. The combination also provides significant penetration within key high-growth markets and broad geographic and brand diversity. With a strong and flexible balance sheet and disciplined approach to portfolio and asset management, the combined company will have the attributes and capabilities to drive accretive growth and to pursue additional opportunities to enhance value.

Robert L. Johnson, Executive Chairman of RLJ Lodging Trust, stated, "As Chairman of RLJ Lodging Trust, I would like to say that we are very excited about this combination with FelCor. I am confident that, under the management of our seasoned team of executives, this portfolio will yield significant benefits to the shareholders of both companies."
"We are truly excited about this unique opportunity as we transform our two companies into one of the largest pure-play lodging REITs. Combining these two complementary portfolios creates a best-in-class platform that is well positioned to deliver long-term growth and generate significant shareholder value," commented Ross H. Bierkan, RLJ's President and Chief Executive Officer. "In addition to being immediately accretive to our RevPAR, merging with FelCor expands our geographic footprint in highly-desirable markets on the West Coast, while strengthening our presence in other coastal markets in the East and the South. RLJ's enhanced scale post-merger is expected to generate both
corporate- and property-level operating cost benefits and market leverage opportunities, which will drive shareholder value over time."
Steven R. Goldman, FelCor's Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We are very pleased to combine with RLJ Lodging Trust to create a leading lodging REIT that is positioned for significant long-term growth. This merger creates a company that has greater reach in key markets with a streamlined operating structure and more advantageous cost of capital.
FelCor shareholders are receiving an attractive valuation for the company's hotel assets and have the opportunity to benefit from a highly respected management team with a history of value creation."
Transaction Terms
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, each share of FelCor common stock will be converted into 0.362 shares of newly issued common shares of RLJ common stock in a taxable merger. FelCor's operating units will be exchanged for limited partnership units in RLJ's operating partnership at a similar exchange ratio of 0.362. Following the merger, RLJ's shareholders are expected to own approximately 71 percent of the combined company's fully diluted equity, and FelCor's shareholders are expected to own the remaining 29 percent.
This strategic merger was unanimously approved by the Boards of both companies. Once the merger is consummated, the company will retain the RLJ Lodging Trust name and will trade under the ticker symbol "RLJ" (NYSE).
Summary of Strategic Benefits
Merging RLJ and FelCor positions the combined company to enhance shareholder value as an industry leader among lodging REITs, with the following highlights:
 Combination creates the third largest pure-play lodging REIT with a combined enterprise value of $7 billion
 Increased shareholder liquidity and cost of capital efficiencies
 Stock transaction allows both sets of shareholders to participate in the upside
 Enhanced positioning with brands and operators
 Leading upscale portfolio of compact full-service and premium focused-service hotels generating strong operating margins
 Combined portfolio will include 160 hotels in 26 states and the District of Columbia, diversified across Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt and Wyndham flags
 Broad geographic diversity and strengthened presence in key markets such as California, Florida and Boston
 Positive financial impact and positioning for future value creation
 Accretive in first full year
 Expected cash G&A expense savings of approximately $12 million and approximately $10 million of potential savings from stock-based compensation expense and capitalized cash G&A
 Opportunity for additional ongoing operating and cash flow improvements through greater purchasing power, market leverage and capital expenditure efficiencies

Future opportunities to unlock value from portfolio repositioning
Potential conversion and redevelopment opportunities
Opportunity to actively refine portfolio
Strong and flexible balance sheet
Significant liquidity, minimal near-term maturities and opportunity to lower cost of capital

Pro Forma Operations and Balance Sheet
The combined entity will have 31,467 rooms across 160 hotels. The merger will be immediately accretive to RLJ's RevPAR with Pro forma 2016 RevPAR increasing 5.4% to $137.
The merger of RLJ and FelCor will produce significant economies of scale, including approximately $22 million of expected savings from the elimination of duplicative corporate general and administrative costs. The combined company is also expected to benefit from long-term, property level savings in the areas of energy/utility contracts, insurance and furniture, fixture and equipment (FF&E) procurement. Finally, the merger will augment RLJ's human capital by adding a number of talented FelCor professionals to the RLJ team.
The combined entity will have significant financial strength and flexibility, including approximately $700 million of available liquidity, which includes approximately $400 million of an undrawn credit facility. The combined entity's projected Pro forma Net Debt to EBITDA ratio during the first full-year of operations is expected to be less than 4.5x (or less than 5.0x including convertible perpetual preferred equity) and is expected to improve each year thereafter.
Leadership and Organization
The combined company will continue to be led by Robert L. Johnson as Executive Chairman, Ross H. Bierkan as President and Chief Executive Officer, and Leslie D. Hale as Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Upon completion, the company's headquarters will remain in Bethesda, Maryland. The number of Trustees on RLJ's Board will be increased to eight, with one existing FelCor director mutually acceptable to FelCor and RLJ being appointed to the RLJ Board upon closing.
Dividend Policy and Declaration
Both RLJ and FelCor are expected to continue to follow their respective dividend policies until the closing of the merger. Following the closing of the transaction, the new company expects to pay a quarterly dividend of $0.33 per common share of beneficial interest, consistent with RLJ's current dividend policy. Any post-merger dividends are subject to the approval of RLJ's Board.
Closing of the Transaction
A joint proxy statement/prospectus will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and, following its effectiveness, will be mailed to the shareholders of both companies. The transaction is expected to close by the end of 2017. The merger is subject
to customary closing conditions, including the approval of both RLJ and FelCor shareholders.

Barclays is acting as the financial advisor to RLJ and Hogan Lovells and Arent Fox are serving as legal advisors. BofA Merrill Lynch is acting as the financial advisor to FelCor, and Sidley Austin, Polsinelli and Jones Day provided legal advice to FelCor. ICR, LLC and Financial Profiles, Inc. are serving as communications advisors for the transaction.
