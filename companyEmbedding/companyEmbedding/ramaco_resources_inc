Ramaco Resources, Inc. Announces Acquisition Of Southwestern Virginia Coal Properties






GlobeNewswire



Mar 29, 2017 5:00 PM EDT













 


















































 LEXINGTON, Ky., March 29, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- RAMACO Resources, Inc. (NASDAQ:METC) ("Ramaco") announced today that it has entered into various agreements acquiring, through its subsidiary RAMACO Resources Land Holdings, LLC, approximately 14,762 acres of coal properties in Tazewell and Buchanan Counties, Virginia and McDowell County, West Virginia, from Jewell Ridge Coal Corporation ("Jewell Ridge"), an indirect subsidiary of The Brink's Company.  As part of the transaction, Ramaco acquired several coal leaseholds adjacent to its Knox Creek operations. Among the assets acquired, Ramaco became the sublessor of Revelation Energy, LLC ("Revelation"), which now operates several underground coal mines formerly owned by a subsidiary of SunCoke Energy, Inc. ("SunCoke"), and which still supply coal to SunCoke's nearby Jewell Coke Plant. However, Ramaco also acquired significant properties that are not subleased to Revelation in close proximity to Ramaco's Knox Creek preparation plant and Norfolk Southern loadout, which may be developed in the future. In addition to receiving royalty income from the acquired properties, Ramaco will immediately begin planning development of those portions of the properties not currently subleased to Revelation.  Ramaco's management estimates that the acquisition will yield approximately 10 million mineable tons of metallurgical coal once exploration and reserve analysis efforts are completed.  Ramaco intends to enter into additional subleases with neighboring coal operators as well as develop its own mid- and low-volatile metallurgical coal mines.  Ramaco will also explore the potential for re-mining two existing coal refuse areas which could contain saleable metallurgical-quality material which was a by-product of processing coal prior to the implementation of more modern coal processing technology. Michael Bauersachs, Ramaco's President and Chief Executive Officer, noted that "Ramaco's strong balance sheet was the key driver in completing this transaction.  We were able to provide proper assurance to both Jewell Ridge and our new lessors of our ability to perform in the future, which was critical given our posture as a relatively new coal producer.  This transaction meets our disciplined criteria of acquiring metallurgical coal reserves near existing operations at a low cost of entry."

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.      Key Stock Data    P/E Ratio (TTM) N/A     EPS (TTM) N/A     Market Cap $260.94 M     Shares Outstanding 39.06 M     Public Float 5.57 M     Yield METC has not issued dividends in more than 1 year.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.
