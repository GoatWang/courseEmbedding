  The Marcus Corporation (NYSE: MCS) today announced the promotion of Thomas F. Kissinger, 53, to senior executive vice president of The Marcus Corporation. In addition, the company announced the promotions of Steven S. Bartelt to director of legal affairs and Mary Beth Castino to director of risk management.   Thomas F. Kissinger (Photo: Business Wire)   Kissinger will continue to serve as The Marcus Corporation’s general counsel and secretary, and will assume added responsibilities for the human resources and corporate real estate departments. He will also work with the company’s two divisions on strategic planning.  Kissinger joined The Marcus Corporation in 1993 as secretary and director of legal affairs. He was promoted to general counsel and secretary in 1995 and to vice president, general counsel and secretary in 2004. Prior to joining The Marcus Corporation, he was associated with the Milwaukee law firm of Foley & Lardner and was a senior tax accountant with the accounting firm of Arthur Andersen. Kissinger currently serves on the board of directors of the American Red Cross and is a member of the Waukesha County Business Alliance. He received a bachelor’s degree in accounting from the University of Illinois and a J.D. degree from George Washington University.  “Tom has done an outstanding job for the company over the past 20 years in working with our management team and board of directors, and in building a responsive and effective internal legal department. I look forward to continuing to work with Tom as he assumes his added responsibilities,” said Gregory S. Marcus, president and chief executive officer of The Marcus Corporation.  Bartelt will assume additional management responsibilities within the legal department as the company plans for the retirement of Linda Treland, chief counsel of real estate, in 2015 after 26 years with the company. Bartelt will also continue to oversee many of the company’s complex legal transactions. He joined The Marcus Corporation in 2000 as senior counsel and was promoted to associate general counsel in 2007. His career also includes positions with the law firms of Godfrey & Kahn and Reinhart Boerner Van Deuren. Bartelt received a Bachelor of Business Administration degree from the University of Wisconsin – Oshkosh and a J.D. degree from the University of Minnesota Law School. He is a founding member and former officer of the University of Wisconsin – Oshkosh College of Business Alumni Association.

How do I choose a lawyer?Consider the following: 
Comfort Level - Are you comfortable telling the lawyer personal
information? Does the lawyer seem interested in solving your problem? 
Credentials - How long has the lawyer been in practice? Has
the lawyer worked on other cases similar to yours? 
Cost - How are the lawyer's fees structured - hourly or flat
fee? Can the lawyer estimate the cost of your case? 
City - Is the lawyer's office conveniently located?
Not sure what questions to ask a lawyer?Here are a few to get you started:

How long have you been in practice?
How many cases like mine have you handled?
How often do you settle cases out of court?
What are your fees and costs?
What are the next steps?
