	Rydex Fund Merger





	 




	Guggenheim Investments, advisor to the Rydex Variable Trust funds, has announced that it intends to merge the Rydex VT Alternative Strategies Allocation Fund into the Rydex VT Multi-Hedge Strategies Fund on April 20, 2012.  This merger is subject to a final proxy filing by Rydex and shareholder approval.  If the merger occurs, we will support it by replacing the Rydex VT Alternative Strategies Allocation Variable Account Option with the Rydex VT Multi-Hedge Strategies Variable Account Option in your variable annuity:




	 










	Existing Variable Account Option








	 








	Replacement Variable Account Option









	Rydex VT Alternative Strategies Allocation →






	 






	Rydex VT Multi-Hedge Strategies








	 




	Any Account Value you have in the Existing Variable Account Option at the end of the Business Day on April 20, 2012 (or other date the merger may occur) will be transferred to the Replacement Variable Account Option.  You will not incur a transfer charge and the transfer will not count toward the 12 free transfers allowed each Contract Year.




	 





	If you are currently invested in both the Existing Variable Account Option and the Replacement Variable Account Option, you may be over allocated to the Replacement Variable Account Option after the merger. 



	Please contact your financial professional to review your investment allocations.

	 

	If you wish to change your allocation, please provide us with your written instructions at the address listed below.




	 





	Future Contributions and Systematic Programs



	 Any future contributions and purchases made through an automated program (such as asset rebalancing, systematic contribution, systematic transfer or dollar cost averaging) that are currently directed to the Existing Variable Account Option will be redirected to the Replacement Variable Account Option.  You can provide different directions for your future contributions or automated program allocations by contacting us or your financial representative.




	 





	Guaranteed Lifetime Income Advantage Rider



	 If you purchased a Guaranteed Lifetime Income Advantage Rider, this Replacement will take effect as described above.  Your allocations will remain in compliance with all investment requirements associated with those riders.  You do not need to do anything.




	 





	Free Transfer



	 If you transfer out of the Replacement Variable Account Option within 30 days of the date of the merger and the transfer would result in a transfer charge because you will exceed your 12 free transfers allowed during the Contract Year, you can contact us and we will ensure that you are not charged for the transfer.




	 




	You can contact our offices in writing at 400 Broadway, Cincinnati, Ohio 45202 or 15 Matthews Street, #200, Goshen, New York 10924 or call us at 1-800-433-1778.

5. Integrity Contracts and the National Integrity Contracts cited in the application and affected by the Substitution are flexible premium deferred variable annuities (the “Contracts”).Start Printed Page 13148

6. Each Contract permits allocations of value to available fixed and variable subaccounts; each variable subaccount invests in a specific investment portfolio of an underlying mutual fund. Of the 24 Contracts affected by this application, 18 Contracts offer the same 56 portfolios (“Subset 1”), four Contracts offer the same 54 portfolios (“Subset 2”) and two Contracts offer the same 43 portfolios (“Subset 3”).
7. Each Contract permits transfers from one subaccount to another subaccount at any time prior to annuitization, subject to certain restrictions and charges described below. No sales charge applies to such a transfer of value among subaccounts. The Contracts permit up to twelve free transfers during any contract year. A fee of $20 is imposed on transfers in excess of twelve transfers in a contract year.
8. Each Contract reserves the right, upon notice to Contract owners and compliance with applicable law, to add, combine or remove subaccounts, or to withdraw assets from one subaccount and put them into another subaccount. Each Contract's prospectus provides that Applicants may add, remove or combine subaccounts or withdraw assets relating to a Contract from one subaccount and put them into another.
9. The Integrity Companies propose the substitution of four portfolios (two of which include three classes each) of Variable Insurance Products Fund III (the “Existing Portfolios”). As replacements, the Integrity Companies propose three portfolios (two of which include three classes) of Variable Insurance Products Fund III and, in the case of Fidelity VIP Contrafund, Variable Insurance Products II (the “Replacement Portfolios”). All of the Replacement Portfolios are currently available in the Contracts. Neither Variable Insurance Products Fund III, Variable Insurance Products Fund II, nor Fidelity Management and Research Company (collectively referred to as “Fidelity”) are affiliated with Applicants.
10. The investment objective, strategies and risks of each Replacement Portfolio are the same as, or similar to, the investment objective, strategies and risks of the corresponding Existing Portfolio.

11. Applicants state that the proposed substitutions are expected to provide benefits to the Contract owners, including better performing funds and simplification of fund offerings through the elimination of overlapping and duplicative portfolios in certain asset categories, particularly the large growth category. After the Substitution, Contract owners will continue to be able to select among funds with a full range of investment objectives, investment strategies and risks. Of the 24 Contracts affected by the Substitution, Contract owners in Subset 1 (18 Contracts) will be able to select among 52 portfolios, Contract owners in Subset 2 (four Contracts) will be able to select among 50 portfolios, and Contract owners in Subset 3 (two Contracts) will be able to select among 40 portfolios.
12. Applicants represent that each Replacement Portfolio has lower total gross and net expense ratios and equal or lower management fees than the corresponding Existing Portfolio. Service fees charged by each Replacement Portfolio pursuant to a 12b-1 plan are equal to those charged by the Existing Portfolio. The management fees the Replacement Portfolios and Existing Portfolios (the “Portfolios”) pay to Fidelity Management and Research Company (“FMR”) have two components: A group fee rate and an individual fund fee rate. The group fee rate is based on the monthly average net assets of all the registered investment companies with which FMR has management contracts. The second component is the individual fund fee rate, which for each Existing Portfolio (except one) is the same as the rate for the Replacement Portfolio, 0.30%. In the one instance, the rate paid on the Fidelity VIP Balanced Portfolio (Replacement Portfolio) is 0.15%, which is lower than is paid on the Fidelity VIP Growth and Income Portfolio (Existing Portfolio) of 0.20%. Detailed expense information is set forth in the Chart below. By reducing expenses, the Applicants represent that the Integrity Companies are offering their Contract owners and prospective investors a selection of better-managed funds at a reduced cost.

13. Applicants submit that each of the Replacement Portfolios has demonstrated better performance than the corresponding Existing Portfolios during each of the periods measured. Detailed performance information is set forth in the Application.
Applicants Legal Analysis and Conditions
1. The Substitution will take place at the portfolios' relative net asset values determined on the date of the Substitution in accordance with Section 22 of the Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder with no change in the amount of any Contract owner's cash value, death benefit, living benefit or in the dollar value of his or her investment in any of the subaccounts. Accordingly, there will be no financial impact on any Contract owner. The Substitution will be effected by having each of the subaccounts that invests in the Existing Portfolios redeem its shares at the net asset value calculated on the date of the Substitution and purchase shares of the respective Replacement Portfolios at the net asset value calculated on the same date.
2. The Substitution will be described in detail in a written notice mailed to Contract owners. The notice will inform Contract owners of the Integrity Companies' intent to implement the Substitution and describe the Substitution, the reasons for engaging in the Substitution and how the Substitution will be implemented. Details regarding the effect on any investment in a GLWB will also be provided. The notice will be mailed to all Contract owners at least 30 days prior to the Substitution and will inform affected Contract owners that they may transfer assets from the subaccounts investing in the Existing Portfolios at anytime after receipt of the notice, and from the subaccounts investing in the Replacement Portfolios for 30 days after the Substitution, to subaccounts investing in other portfolios available under the respective Contracts, without the imposition of any transfer charge or limitation and without diminishing the number of free transfers that may be made in a given contract year. A supplement will be filed with the Commission for all current prospectuses containing the information to be included in the notice.
3. Each Contract owner will be provided with a prospectus for the Replacement Portfolios applicable to them. Within five days after the Substitution, the Integrity Companies will send each affected Contract owner written confirmation that the Substitution has occurred.
4. The Integrity Companies will pay all expenses and transaction costs of the Substitution, including all legal, accounting and allocated brokerage expenses relating to the Substitution. No costs will be borne by Contract owners. Affected Contract owners will not incur any fees or charges as a result of the Substitution, nor will their rights or the obligations of the Integrity Companies under the Contracts be altered in any way. The Substitution will not cause the fees and charges under the Contracts currently being paid by Contract owners to be greater after the Substitution than before the Substitution. The Substitution will have no adverse tax consequences to Contract owners and will in no way alter the tax benefits to Contract owners.
5. Each Contract and its prospectus expressly discloses the reservation of the Applicants' right, subject to applicable law, to substitute shares of another portfolio for shares of the portfolio in which a subaccount is invested.
6. The investment objectives and policies of the Replacement Portfolios are similar to those of the corresponding Existing Portfolios such that Contract owners will have reasonable continuity in investment expectations.
7. The Substitution will not result in the type of costly forced redemption that Section 26(c) was intended to guard against because the Contract owner will continue to have the same type of investment choices, with better potential returns and the same or lower expenses and will not otherwise have any incentive to redeem their shares or terminate their Contracts.
8. The purposes, terms and conditions of the proposed Substitution are consistent with the protection of investors, and the principles and purposes of Section 26(c), and do not entail any of the abuses that Section 26(c) is designed to prevent.
9. Current gross and net annual expenses in each Replacement Portfolio are lower than those of the corresponding Existing Portfolios.
10. Each Replacement Portfolio is an appropriate portfolio to move Contract owners' values currently allocated to the Existing Portfolios because the portfolios have similar investment objectives, strategies and risks.
11. The Substitution will be at the net asset values of the respective portfolio shares without the imposition of any transfer or similar charge and with no change in the amount of any Contract owners' values.
12. The Substitution will not cause the fees and charges under the Contracts currently being paid by Contract owners to be greater after the Substitution than before the Substitution and will result in Contract owners' Contract values being moved to portfolios with the lower current total net annual expenses.
13. In connection with assets held under Contracts affected by the Substitution, the Integrity Companies will not receive, for three years from the date of the Substitution, any direct or indirect benefits from the Replacement Portfolios, their advisors or Start Printed Page 13151underwriters (or their affiliates) at a rate higher than that which they had received from the Existing Portfolios, their advisors or underwriters (or their affiliates), including without limitation 12b-1 Fees, shareholder service, administration or other service fees, revenue sharing or other arrangements in connection with such assets. Applicants represent that the Substitution and the selection of the Replacement Portfolios were not motivated by any financial consideration paid or to be paid by the Replacement Portfolios, their advisors or underwriters, or their respective affiliates.
14. Notice of the proposed Substitution will be mailed to all Contract owners at least 30 days prior to the Substitution. All Contract owners will have an opportunity at anytime after receipt of the notice of the Substitution and for 30 days after the Substitution to transfer Contract account value affected by the Substitution to other available subaccounts without the imposition of any transfer charge or limitation and without being counted as one of the Contract owner's free transfers in a contract year.
15. Within five days after the Substitution, the Integrity Companies will send to its affected Contract owners a written confirmation that the Substitution has occurred.
16. The Substitution will in no way alter the insurance benefits to Contract owners or the contractual obligations of the Integrity Companies.
17. The Substitution will have no adverse tax consequences to Contract owners and will in no way alter the tax benefits to Contract owners.
Conclusion
For the reasons and upon the facts set forth above, the Applicants believe that the requested order meets the standards set forth in Section 26(c) and should, therefore, be granted.

SelectQuote Review: An Easy Way to Buy Life Insurance

						Posted on October 4, 2016 by John Schmoll in
						Insurance 

This post may contain affiliate links. Please read my disclosure page for more info.


This article was sponsored by SelectQuote, but all thoughts and opinions are my own.
Buying life insurance is right up there with going to the dentist. We know we need it, but we can think of a million things that are more fun. Should this hold us back from buying life insurance? In a word, no! Having worked in the life insurance industry myself I’ve seen first hand what happens to families when an earner passes unexpectedly.
They’re left on their own to figure out how to meet their day-to-day needs, not to mention their future needs. As a small business owner, husband and father, I believe buying life insurance is one of the most important and loving things I can do. If you’re in the market for life insurance, this overview of SelectQuote will show you how many of the preconceived notions you may have about life insurance are worth rethinking.
How Does SelectQuote Work?
 
Years ago it was a time intensive process to buy life insurance. You had to meet with a salesperson, fill out a lengthy paper application and then wait to get your quote. Technology has greatly reduced the pain of applying for life insurance. SelectQuote harnesses that technology to simplify the entire life insurance purchase process so you can have your quote in a matter of minutes.
This is how SelectQuote is able to provide actionable information in such a short time period. SelectQuote does not sell their own product; rather they act as a kind of automated life insurance broker. SelectQuote works with over 20 reputable life insurance companies to find you the best rate possible, which is great for someone who wants to pay the lowest price.
I went through the process of applying for life insurance myself through SelectQuote. You go to the SelectQuote site and answer ten simple questions. They ask for things like age, weight, medical background information and the level of coverage you want. The process took me maybe five minutes total. SelectQuote gives you a case number and assigns a representative to reach out to you within 24 hours.
I was called within 8-10 hours by a representative who asked a few more follow-up questions. In total, our phone conversation was roughly ten minutes and he was able to provide me quotes from A+ rated providers at the end of our call. The lowest quote was $29.44 per month for a 20-year $250,000 term life insurance policy, which is in line with quotes I’ve received from other providers.
Within 15 minutes of getting off the phone, my SelectQuote representative emailed me three other quotes representing a variety of other coverage options. I loved this as it gave me the information I needed to compare different options and decide what solution is best for my family.
You may wonder what type of coverage SelectQuote offers. They offer only term life coverage. I’ve covered in-depth the value of term life insurance in the past and SelectQuote holds to the same solid principles, which may be part of the reason they are the top term life insurance agency in the country. SelectQuote offers 10, 15, 20 and 30-year plan options and over $5 million in coverage so you have plenty of flexibility through SelectQuote.
Going Beyond Life Insurance
 
It’s easy to think that life insurance is the main type of coverage you need for your needs. That’s not the case as you may need anything from auto insurance, homeowner’s/renters insurance or disability insurance, to name a few. SelectQuote knows this and doesn’t stop at just life insurance.
SelectQuote offers three additional types of insurance coverage. Those are:

Auto Insurance
Homeowner’s Insurance
Medicare Supplement Insurance

I don’t currently have need for any of those coverage options though they operate similar to life insurance through SelectQuote. They work with only A- to A+ carriers and find the best rates possible to help you save money.

The Importance of Life Insurance
 
We think we’re invincible; we’re not. It’s easy to put off buying life insurance because we think it’s not needed or that it’s too expensive. However, our financial responsibility does not end when we die. As a parent or spouse you have many obligations to continue to care for with your family after your passing, such as:

Paying off your house
Paying off any other outstanding debt
College for your children
Retirement needs

There are other needs you may need to provide for, but these are among the most important. Life insurance helps care for those needs and provide peace of mind that your loved ones won’t have to suffer. A 2015 LIMRA study shows that half of families would feel the financial impact of losing a primary income earner within the first year. Life insurance helps lessen that sting.
What if you’re young or single? Do you still need life insurance? I would argue that in most cases, you do. Not all debt dies with you and you may have other outstanding obligations. Then there’s the funeral. The average funeral costs over $7,200. Without life insurance your family is on the hook for those expenses.
You may think life insurance is too expensive to buy. The aforementioned LIMRA study reveals that 65 percent of people think life insurance is too expensive. In many cases that simply isn’t true. Taking a look at my quote, I could have $250,000 in coverage for less than $30 per month. That’s less than a tank of gas. If you’re younger than I am, you can get coverage for significantly cheaper because you lock in lower rates due to your age.
You may think life insurance isn’t important, but in many cases it’s a vital part of financial health. Go to SelectQuote today to see what kind of rates you can get.
 
Do you think life insurance is important to have? Why do you think so many believe life insurance is too expensive? Would your family be in need upon your untimely passing?

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
