      hard credit enhancement (CE) for the class A notes totals 5.50%, 
      consisting of 7.00% subordination and a 0.50% nondeclining reserve 
      offset by undercollateralization of 2.00% on an adjusted pool basis.
    

      Improved Portfolio/Securitization Performance: Losses on Ford Credit's 
      portfolio and 2009-2012 FCAOT securitizations declined, supported by the 
      improving, albeit volatile, U.S. economy and strong used vehicle values 
      resulting in higher recovery rates.
    

      Positive Corporate Performance: Fitch currently rates the long-term 
      Issuer Default Rating of Ford Motor Co., the parent of Ford Credit and 
      Ford Credit, 'BBB-' with a Stable Rating Outlook.
    

      Strong Wholesale Vehicle Market (WVM): The U.S. WVM is healthy in early 
      2013. However, Fitch remains cautious of the potential impact of general 
      economic weakness and rising fuel prices on demand for and values of 
      used vehicles.
    

      Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: Ford Credit demonstrates 
      good capabilities as originator, underwriter, and servicer, evidenced by 
      historical delinquency and loss performance of its managed portfolio and 
      securitizations. Fitch deems Ford Credit capable to adequately service 
      2013-A.
    

      Integrity of Legal Structure: The legal structure of the transaction 
      should provide that a bankruptcy of Ford Credit would not impair the 
      timeliness of payments on the securities.
    

      The presale report is available to all investors on Fitch's website at 'www.fitchratings.com'.

      Fitch Rates Ford Credit Auto Owner Trust 2013-C
    





July 30, 2013 12:21 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings to the notes issued by Ford 
      Credit Auto Owner Trust 2013-C:
    

      --$315,000,000 class A-1 'F1+sf';
    

      --$414,000,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$420,200,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$100,930,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$39,480,000 class B 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$26,320,000 class C 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$26,320,000 class D 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      Stable Credit Quality: The 2013-C pool is relatively consistent with 
      prior deals. The weighted average (WA) FICO score is 723 with 87.30% new 
      vehicles, while the pool is geographically diverse with 6.9 months of 
      seasoning, and 41.32% of the retail contracts have loan terms of more 
      than 60 months.
    

      Adequate Credit Enhancement Structure: The cash flow distribution is a 
      sequential-pay structure, consistent with prior transactions. Initial 
      hard credit enhancement for the class A notes totals 5.50%, consisting 
      of 7.00% subordination and a 0.50% non-declining reserve offset by 
      under-collateralization of 2.00% on an adjusted pool basis.
    

      Improved Portfolio/Securitization Performance: Losses on Ford Credit's 
      portfolio and 2009-2012 FCAOT securitizations have declined supported by 
      the improving, albeit volatile, U.S. economy, and healthy used vehicle 
      values resulting in higher recovery rates.
    

      Positive Corporate Performance: Fitch currently rates the long-term 
      Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of Ford, the parent of Ford Credit, and Ford 
      Credit 'BBB-' with a Stable Rating Outlook.
    

      Wholesale Vehicle Market (WVM): The U.S. wholesale vehicle market is 
      currently healthy. However, Fitch remains cautious as to the potential 
      impact of general economic weakness and rising fuel prices on demand for 
      and values of used vehicles.
    

      Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: Ford Credit demonstrates 
      good capabilities as originator, underwriter, and servicer, evidenced by 
      historical delinquency and loss performance of its managed portfolio and 
      securitizations. Fitch deems Ford Credit capable to adequately service 
      2013-C.
    

      Integrity of Legal Structure: The legal structure of the transaction 
      should provide that a bankruptcy of Ford Credit would not impair the 
      timeliness of payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case and could result in potential rating actions on the notes. Fitch 
      evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to all classes of Ford 
      Credit Auto Owner Trust 2013-C to increased losses over the life of the 
      transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the class B, C and D notes 
      display some sensitivity to increased defaults and losses, showing 
      potential downgrades of up to one category under Fitch's moderate (1.5x 
      base case loss) scenario. All classes of notes could experience 
      downgrades of up to two rating categories under Fitch's severe (2.5x 
      base case loss) scenario.
    

      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the 
      accompanying presale report.
    

      The presale report is available to all investors on Fitch's website at 'www.fitchratings.com'.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Fitch expects to rate Ford Credit Auto Owner Trust 2013-D; presale issuedHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreTry Yahoo Finance on Firefox »YahooSearchSearchSign inU.S. Markets closedS&P 5002,472.10-3.32 (-0.13%)Dow 3021,830.31+33.76 (+0.15%)Nasdaq6,374.68-7.51 (-0.12%)Fitch expects to rate Ford Credit Auto Owner Trust 2013-D; presale issuedReutersNovember 18, 2013ReblogShareTweetShareNov 18 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)Fitch Ratings expects to assign the following ratings to the notes issued by Ford Credit Auto Owner Trust 2013-D:--$347,900,000 class A-1 'F1+sf';--$467,100,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$471,600,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$110,200,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$44,110,000 class B 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$29,410,000 class C 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;--$29,410,000 class D 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable.Key Rating DriversStable Credit Quality: The 2013-D pool is consistent with prior deals, with a WA FICO score of 726, and new vehicle contracts total 87.37%. The pool is geographically diverse with seven months of seasoning, while 41.37% of the pool consists of loans with terms of more than 60 months.Adequate Credit Enhancement Structure: The cash flow distribution is a sequential-pay structure, consistent with prior transactions. Initial hard credit enhancement (CE) for the class A notes totals 5.50%, consisting of 7.00% subordination and a 0.50% non-declining reserve offset by under-collateralization of 2.00% on an adjusted pool basis.Stable Portfolio/Securitization Performance: Delinquencies and losses on Ford Credit's portfolio and 2009-2012 FCAOT securitizations are currently at low levels, supported by the improving (albeit volatile) U.S. economy, and healthy used vehicle values resulting in higher recovery rates.Positive Corporate Performance: Fitch currently rates the long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of Ford Motor Company (Ford), the parent of Ford Credit, and Ford Credit 'BBB-' with a Stable Rating Outlook.Unstable Economic Outlook: A slower recovery and potential for volatility could affect delinquencies and losses. Fitch's analysis accounts for this risk by including poorer performing vintages from the recent recession in the base case loss analysis.Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: Ford Credit demonstrates adequate abilities as originator, underwriter and servicer, as evidenced by historical portfolio and securitizations' delinquency and loss performance. Fitch deems Ford Credit an adequate servicer to service 2013-D.Integrity of Legal Structure: The legal structure of the transaction should provide that a bankruptcy of Ford Credit would not impair the timeliness of payments on the securities.Rating SensitivityUnanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case and could result in potential rating actions on the notes. Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to all classes of Ford Credit Auto Owner Trust 2013-D to increased losses over the life of the transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the class B, C and D notes display some sensitivity to increased defaults and losses, showing potential downgrades of up to one category under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case loss) scenario. All classes of notes could experience downgrades of up to two rating categories under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario.Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the accompanying presale report.The presale report is available to all investors on Fitch's website at 'www.fitchratings.com'.
