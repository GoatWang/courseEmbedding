Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code).

What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

Glen Messina Named President and CEO of PHH Corporation | Business Wire
























































Glen Messina Named President and CEO of PHH Corporation




Jerome Selitto Resigns as President and Chief Executive Officer






January 04, 2012 09:04 AM Eastern Standard Time



MT. LAUREL, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--PHH Corporation (NYSE: PHH) (“PHH”) announced today that its board of 
      directors has elected Glen A. Messina, President and Chief Executive 
      Officer, effective immediately. Mr. Messina has also been elected to the 
      board of directors as a Class III director. Mr. Messina has been the 
      company’s Chief Operating Officer since joining the company in July 2011.
    


      Mr. Messina succeeds Jerome Selitto, who has resigned as President and 
      Chief Executive Officer, effective immediately.
    

      “We are delighted to name Glen Messina as our President and CEO,” said 
      Jim Egan, Chairman of the PHH Corporation Board of Directors. “The 
      prolonged uncertainty and volatility in the global economy and capital 
      markets, along with a U.S. housing market that remains challenging, 
      requires an emphasis on liquidity and cash generation over growth in the 
      near term. The board unanimously believes that Glen is the ideal 
      executive with the right experience to lead PHH as we focus on these 
      priorities.
    

      “Over the course of his career, Glen has developed broad and deep 
      management experience. He has led, or held key management roles in, 
      large, complex organizations and has direct experience in mortgage and 
      fleet management. Glen has a solid record of helping drive shareholder 
      value. He joined the company this past July with the mandate to focus on 
      operational excellence, exceptional customer service and evolve our 
      business models, processes and technologies to address the continuous 
      change in our industries. The board has worked closely with Glen and we 
      are impressed with all that he has accomplished as our chief operating 
      officer in just a short time.”
    

      “I am pleased to accept these new roles, and am excited about the strong 
      prospects for PHH,” said Mr. Messina. “We are a leading provider of 
      business process management services for the mortgage and fleet 
      industries. We have the strength to weather the current economic 
      turbulence, and the vigor to resume our growth when the economy and 
      capital markets improve. I look forward to continuing to work with the 
      management team and our employees to capitalize on the opportunities 
      before us, realize our true potential and increase shareholder value.”
    

      Mr. Egan said, “We thank Jerry Selitto for the contributions he has made
