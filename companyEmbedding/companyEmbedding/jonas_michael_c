Comfort Level - Are you comfortable telling the lawyer personal
information? Does the lawyer seem interested in solving your problem?

the lawyer worked on other cases similar to yours? 
Cost - How are the lawyer's fees structured - hourly or flat
fee? Can the lawyer estimate the cost of your case?

What are your fees and costs?
What are the next steps?
