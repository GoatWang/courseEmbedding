Virtus to Become Advisor to Phoenix Edge Series Fund Under Agreement with Phoenix Companies



HARTFORD, Conn., July 28 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- The Phoenix Companies, Inc. (NYSE: PNX) and Virtus Investment Partners, Inc. (Nasdaq: VRTS) today announced they have reached an agreement for Virtus to become the advisor and distributor to the Phoenix Edge Series Fund, a variable insurance trust.  Virtus will rename the trust the Virtus Variable Insurance Trust and market the current and new investment strategies to other insurance and annuity companies.

(Logo: http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20090105/NEM020LOGO )
On July 26, the Edge Series board of trustees approved the appointment of Virtus as advisor and distributor of the trust and several fund mergers that, if approved by fund shareholders, should improve the scale and marketability of the trust.
The trust comprises 17 funds and $1.6 billion in assets (at June 30, 2010) that are investment options in Phoenix's variable life and annuity products.  Virtus currently serves as administrator to the trust and subadvisor to $300 million of fund assets, and will assume subadvisory responsibilities for an additional $500 million of fund assets.  Goodwin Capital Advisers, an affiliate of Phoenix, and Aberdeen Asset Management will continue to manage $700 million of assets under subadvisory agreements with Virtus.
Four of the funds, with approximately $100 million of assets, will not be part of the transaction and will be merged into a third-party variable insurance trust at a later date.  Phoenix has an additional $2.2 billion of variable product assets managed by external advisors.
Philip K. Polkinghorn, Phoenix's senior executive vice president, business development, and president of the Phoenix Edge Series Fund, said the transaction is consistent with the company's recent history of strategic partnerships with organizations that can provide particular expertise and benefit Phoenix customers.
"We believe Virtus is best suited to the roles of advisor and distributor because of its track record in adopting funds and solid historical investment performance.  These two attributes will help it attract more assets and allow fund shareholders to benefit from economies of scale, in addition to a refreshed portfolio with a wide range of investment options.  Given Virtus' existing roles, we believe this transition will be seamless and efficient," Polkinghorn said.
George R. Aylward, president and chief executive officer of Virtus, said the transaction offers several benefits to Virtus as well.  In addition to preserving the current economics from its roles as fund administrator and subadvisor, the transaction provides Virtus with an opportunity to improve scale in its business by managing the additional funds and by creating new product and distribution opportunities.
"This is an important step in Virtus' growth strategy because it increases our assets under management by $1.2 billion and gives us a new product line that we can offer to other insurance companies as we expand our distribution reach into the variable insurance trust marketplace," Aylward said.  "We look forward to building on our relationship with Phoenix customers and offering our investment management and administration expertise to other insurance companies."
Financial terms of the agreement, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter, were not disclosed, but the economics of the transaction will be based on assets under management going forward.

JULY 31, 2006 (UNAUDITED)                                                       
NOTE 1--SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                                 

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies   
  consistently followed by the Phoenix Series Fund in the preparation of the
    Schedules of Investments. The preparation of the Schedules of Investments in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United  
    States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Schedules of       
Investments. Actual results could differ from those estimates.          

A. SECURITY VALUATION                                                   

     Equity securities are valued at the official closing price (typically
   last sale) on the exchange on which the securities are primarily traded, or
if no closing price is available, at the last bid price.                

Debt securities are valued on the basis of broker quotations or 
valuations provided by a pricing service, which in determining value    
 utilizes information with respect to recent sales, market transactions in
 comparable securities, quotations from dealers, and various relationships
between securities in determining value.                                

      As required, some securities and assets may be valued at fair value as
determined in good faith by or under the direction of the Trustees.     

       Certain foreign common stocks may be fair valued in cases where closing
prices are not readily available or are deemed not reflective of readily
  available market prices. For example, significant events (such as movement
    in the U.S. securities market, or other regional and local developments) may
occur between the time that foreign markets close (where the security is
principally traded) and the time that the Fund calculates its net asset 
value (generally, the close of the NYSE) that may impact the value of   
    securities traded in these foreign markets. In these cases, information from
an external vendor may be utilized to adjust closing market prices of   
certain foreign common stocks to reflect their fair value. Because the  
frequency of significant events is not predictable, fair valuation of   
certain foreign common stocks may occur on a frequent basis.            

     Short-term investments having a remaining maturity of 60 days or less
are valued at amortized cost, which approximates market.                

The Money Market Fund uses the amortized cost method of security
   valuation absent extraordinary or unusual market conditions. In the opinion
of the Trustees, this represents the fair value of the securities. The  
    Trustees monitor the deviations between the Fund's net asset value per share
  as determined by using available market quotations and its net asset value
per share using amortized cost. If the deviation exceeds 1/2 of 1%, the 
  Board of Trustees will consider what action, if any should be initiated to
  provide fair valuation. Using this method, the Fund attempts to maintain a
constant net asset value of $1 per share.                               

B. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS AND RELATED INCOME                             

        Security transactions are recorded on the trade date. Dividend income is
recorded on the ex-dividend date, or in the case of certain foreign     
   securities, as soon as the Fund is notified. Interest income is recorded on
    the accrual basis. Each Fund amortizes premiums and accretes discounts using
  the effective interest method. Realized gains and losses are determined on
the identified cost basis.                                              

C. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION                                         

        Foreign securities and other assets and liabilities are valued using the
    foreign currency exchange rate effective at the end of the reporting period.
    Cost of investments is translated at the currency exchange rate effective at
the trade date.                                                         

D. FOREIGN SECURITY COUNTRY DETERMINATION

PHOENIX SERIES FUND                                                             
NOTES TO SCHEDULES OF INVESTMENTS                                               
JULY 31, 2006 (UNAUDITED)                                                       

       A combination of the following criteria is used to assign the countries
 of risk listed in the schedules of investments: country of incorporation,
 actual building address, primary exchange on which the security is traded
and country in which the greatest percentage of company revenue is      
generated.                                                              

E. FORWARD CURRENCY CONTRACTS 

      Certain Funds may enter into forward currency contracts in conjunction
    with the planned purchase or sale of foreign denominated securities in order
to hedge the U.S. dollar cost or proceeds. Forward currency contracts   
    involve, to varying degrees, elements of market risk in excess of the amount
   recognized in the Notes to Schedules of Investments. A risk arises from the
possible movements in foreign exchange rates or if counterparty does not
perform under the contract.                                             

        A forward currency contract involves an obligation to purchase or sell a
    specific currency at a future date, which may be any number of days from the
   date of the contract agreed upon by the parties, at a price set at the time
of the contract. These contracts are traded directly between currency   
traders and their customers.                                            

     At July 31, 2006, the Balanced Fund had entered into forward currency
contracts as follows:

F. WHEN-ISSUED AND DELAYED DELIVERY TRANSACTIONS                        

Certain Funds may engage in when-issued or delayed delivery     
   transactions. Each Fund records when-issued and delayed delivery securities
on the trade date. Each Fund maintains collateral for the securities    
purchased.                                                              

G. SECURITY LENDING                                                     

       Certain Funds loan securities to qualified brokers through an agreement
 with State Street Bank (the "Custodian") and the Fund. Under the terms of
the agreement, the Fund receives collateral with a market value not less
  than 100% of the market value of loaned securities. Collateral is adjusted
   daily in connection with changes in the market value of securities on loan.
   Collateral may consist of cash, securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S.
    Government or its agencies and the sovereign debt of foreign countries. Cash
 collateral has been invested in a short-term money market fund. Dividends
  earned on the collateral and premiums paid by the borrower are recorded as
   income by the Fund net of fees and rebates charged by the Custodian for its
services in connection with this securities lending program. Lending    
   portfolio securities involves a risk of delay in the recovery of the loaned
securities or in the foreclosure on collateral.                         

H. LOAN AGREEMENTS                                                      

        Certain Funds may invest in direct debt instruments, which are interests
  in amounts owed by a corporate, governmental, or other borrower to lenders
    or lending syndicates. The Fund's investments in loans may be in the form of
participations in loans or assignments of all or a

PHOENIX SERIES FUND                                                             
NOTES TO SCHEDULES OF INVESTMENTS                                               
JULY 31, 2006 (UNAUDITED)                                                       

   portion of loans from third parties. A loan is often administered by a bank
or other financial institution (the lender) that acts as agent for all  
 holders. The agent administers the terms of the loan, as specified in the
loan agreement. When investing in a loan participation, the Fund has the
    right to receive payments of principal, interest and any fees to which it is
entitled only from the lender selling the loan agreement and only upon  
   receipt by the lender of payments from the borrower. The Fund generally has
    no right to enforce compliance with the terms of the loan agreement with the
 borrower. As a result, the Fund may be subject to the credit risk of both
the borrower and the lender that is selling the loan agreement. When the
 Fund purchases assignments from lenders it acquires direct rights against
    the borrower on the loan. Direct indebtedness of emerging countries involves
a risk that the government entities responsible for the repayment of the
    debt may be unable, or unwilling to pay the principal and interest when due.

I. REIT investments                                                     

      Dividend income is recorded using management's estimates of the income
   included in distributions received from the REIT investments. Distributions
  received in excess of this estimated amount are recorded as a reduction of
    the cost of investments or reclassified to capital gains. The actual amounts
  of income, return of capital and capital gains are only determined by each
REIT after its fiscal year-end and may differ from estimated amounts.   

NOTE 2--CREDIT RISK AND ASSET CONCENTRATIONS                            

  In countries with limited or developing markets, investments may
   present greater risks than in more developed markets and the prices of such
investments may be volatile. The consequences of political, social or   
   economic changes in these markets may have disruptive effects on the market
prices of these investments and the income they generate, as well as a  
Fund's ability to repatriate such amounts.                              

    Each Fund may invest a high percentage of their assets in specific
sectors of the market in their pursuit of a greater investment return.  
   Fluctuations in these sectors of concentration may have a greater impact on
a Fund, positive or negative, than if a Fund did not concentrate its    
investments in such sectors.                                            

High yield/high risk securities typically entail greater price  
volatility and/or principal and interest rate risk. There is a greater  
chance that an issuer will not be able to make principal and interest   
   payments on time. Analysis of the creditworthiness of issuers of high yield
    securities may be complex, and as a result, it may be more difficult for the
adviser and/or subadviser to accurately predict risk.                   

   At July 31, 2006, The Mid-Cap Growth Fund held securities issued by
    various companies in the Information Technology sector comprising 23% of the
total net assets of the Fund.                                           

NOTE 3--ILLIQUID AND RESTRICTED SECURITIES                              

Investments shall be considered illiquid if they cannot be disposed of  
within seven days in the ordinary course of business at the approximate 
   amount at which such securities have been valued by the Fund. Additionally,
  the following information is also considered in determining liquidity: the
    frequency of trades and quotes for the investment, whether the investment is
  listed for trading on a recognized domestic exchange and/or whether two or
 more brokers are willing to purchase or sell the security at a comparable
    price, the extent of market making activity in the investment and the nature
  of the market for investment. Illiquid securities are footnoted as such at
the end of each Fund's Schedule of Investments where applicable.        

Restricted securities are illiquid securities, as defined above, not    
   registered under the Securities Act of 1933. Generally, 144A securities are
excluded from this category, except where defined as illiquid.

ITEM 2. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

    (a)  The registrant's  principal executive and principal financial officers,
         or  persons  performing  similar  functions,  have  concluded  that the
         registrant's  disclosure  controls and  procedures  (as defined in Rule
         30a-3(c)  under the  Investment  Company Act of 1940,  as amended  (the
         "1940 Act") (17 CFR 270.30a-3(c)))  are effective,  as of a date within
         90 days of the filing date of the report that  includes the  disclosure
         required by this  paragraph,  based on the evaluation of these controls
         and  procedures  required by Rule  30a-3(b)  under the 1940 Act (17 CFR
         270.30a-3(b))  and Rules  13a-15(b) or 15d-15(b)  under the  Securities
         Exchange   Act  of  1934,   as  amended   (17  CFR   240.13a-15(b)   or
240.15d-15(b)).                                               

    (b)  There  were  no  changes  in the  registrant's  internal  control  over
         financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the 1940 Act (17
         CFR  270.30a-3(d))  that occurred during the  registrant's  last fiscal
         quarter that have  materially  affected,  or are  reasonably  likely to
         materially  affect,  the  registrant's  internal control over financial
reporting.
