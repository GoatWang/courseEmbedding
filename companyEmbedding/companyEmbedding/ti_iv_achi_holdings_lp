	Explanation of Responses:










	(1) 





	The 8.00% Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Series A Preferred Stock") of Accretive Health, Inc. (the "Issuer") is convertible at any time, at the holder's election, and has no expiration date.









	(2) 





	This Form 4 is being filed jointly pursuant to Rule 16a-1(a)(3) and Rule 16a-3(j) under the Securities Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") to report the beneficial ownership of shares of Series A Preferred Stock that TCP-ASC ACHI Series LLLP (the "Partnership"), TCP-ASC GP, LLC (the "Partnership GP"), TI IV ACHI Holdings GP, LLC (the "Aggregator GP"), TI IV ACHI Holdings, LP (the "Aggregator"), TowerBrook Investors Ltd. ("TowerBrook"), Neal Moszkowski, Ramez Sousou, and Ascension Health Alliance d/b/a Ascension ("Ascension") (together, the "Reporting Persons") may be deemed to have acquired as a payment-in-kind dividend on April 3, 2017 under the Certificate of Designations of 8.00% Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the "Certificate of Designations"), dated as of February 16, 2016.









	(3) 





	The Partnership is a Delaware series limited liability limited partnership that was formed to effect the purchase (the "Purchase") of the Issuer's securities, including 200,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, in connection with that certain Securities Purchase Agreement, dated as of December 7, 2015, by and among the Issuer, the Partnership and Ascension (the "Purchase Agreement"). The sole general partner of the Partnership is the Partnership GP, and the limited partners of the Partnership are the Aggregator and Ascension. The Partnership GP is a Delaware limited liability company that was formed to effect the Purchase. The members of the Partnership GP are the Aggregator and Ascension. (cont'd)









	(4) 





	(cont'd) The Aggregator is a Delaware limited partnership that was formed to effect the Purchase. The sole general partner of the Aggregator is the Aggregator GP, and the limited partners of the Aggregator are TowerBrook Investors IV (Onshore), L.P., TowerBrook Investors IV (OS), L.P., TowerBrook Investors IV Executive Fund, L.P., TowerBrook Investors IV (892), L.P. and TowerBrook Investors Team Daybreak, L.P. The Aggregator GP is a Delaware limited liability company that was formed to effect the Purchase. The sole member of the Aggregator GP is TowerBrook. TowerBrook is a Cayman Islands corporation and its principal business is to serve as the general partner or member of various affiliates of investment funds managed or advised by TowerBrook Capital Partners L.P. The directors and joint controlling shareholders of TowerBrook are Neal Moszkowski, a U.S. citizen, and Ramez Sousou, a U.K. citizen. Ascension is a Missouri not-for-profit corporation.









	(5) 





	Pursuant to the Certificate of Designations, on April 3, 2017, the Partnership received 4,287 shares of Series A Preferred Stock from the Issuer as a payment-in-kind dividend for the period beginning on January 1, 2017 and ending on March 31, 2017 on the 214,363 shares of Series A Preferred Stock acquired by the Partnership since the Purchase closed on February 16, 2016. The reported securities may be deemed to be owned directly by the Partnership, and indirectly by the Partnership GP, the Aggregator GP, the Aggregator, TowerBrook, Neal Moszkowski, Ramez Sousou and Ascension. As permitted by Rule 16a-1(a)(4), the filing of this Form 4 shall not be construed as an admission that any of the Reporting Persons are beneficial owners of any of the securities covered by this statement.









	(6) 





	Pursuant to that certain Limited Liability Limited Partnership Agreement of the Partnership, dated as of December 7, 2015, by and between the Partnership GP, the Aggregator and Ascension (the "Partnership Agreement"), the board of directors of the Partnership established a series of partnership interests to hold the securities allocable to the Aggregator under the Partnership Agreement ("Series TB") and a series of partnership interests to hold the securities allocable to Ascension under the Partnership Agreement ("Series AS"). Accordingly, the Aggregator GP, the Aggregator, TowerBrook, Neal Moszkowski and Ramez Sousou disclaim beneficial ownership of the 1,929 shares of Series A Preferred Stock distributed as a payment-in-kind dividend on April 3, 2017 held directly by Series AS, whereas Ascension disclaims beneficial ownership of the 2,358 shares of Series A Preferred Stock distributed as payment-in-kind dividend on April 3, 2017 and held directly by Series TB.










	Remarks:



	For purposes of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Reporting Persons may be deemed to be directors by deputization by virtue of their contractual right to appoint directors to the board of directors of the Issuer. As a result, the "Director" box is marked in Item 5 of this Form 4.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
