Vanguard Natural Resources, LLC Announces Confirmation of Plan of Reorganization
 Posted on July 19, 2017 



 


Houston – July 19, 2017 – (PR NEWSWIRE) – Vanguard Natural Resources, LLC (OTC: VNRSQ) (“Vanguard” or “the Company”) announces that the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (the “Bankruptcy Court”) has entered an order (the “Confirmation Order”) confirming the Debtors’ Modified Second Amended Joint Plan of Reorganization Under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the “Plan”). The Company expects that the effective date of the Plan will be August 1, 2017 (the “Effective Date”). Following the Effective Date, the Company expects to be reorganized as a Delaware corporation named Vanguard Natural Resources, Inc.
The Plan provides for the reorganization of the Company and certain subsidiaries (such subsidiaries, together with the Company, the “Debtors”) as a going concern and will significantly reduce long-term debt and annual interest payments of the reorganized Debtors. Among other things, the Plan provides for:

a backstopped rights offering, with subscriptions for an aggregate of $255.75 million of new common stock of the Company (“New Common Stock”)
a fully committed $19.25 million equity investment from the Company’s second lien investors for shares of New Common Stock;
a full recovery for each lender under the Company’s existing revolving credit facility, consisting of (i) cash interest, (ii) cash in the amount of its pro rata share of the proceeds from the sale of the Glasscock County assets, (iii) as applicable, its pro rata share of a repayment of a portion of the borrowings outstanding under the Company’s revolving credit facility and (iv) as applicable, its pro rata share of new revolving loans and/or term loans;
the issuance of approximately $78 million of new second lien notes to the holders of the Company’s existing second lien notes, plus accrued and unpaid postpetition interest through the Effective Date;
cash payments to general unsecured creditors for their pro rata shares of a reserved cash pool;
the issuance of shares of New Common Stock to holders of the Company’s senior notes;
the issuance to the Company’s preferred unitholders of such holders’ pro rata share of (i) New Common Stock and (ii) warrants to purchase additional shares of New Common Stock at a strike price of $44.25; and
the issuance to the Company’s common unitholders of such holders’ pro rata share of warrants to purchase shares of New Common Stock at a strike price of $61.45.

The warrant strike prices were calculated based on the Company’s plan equity value of $20.00 per share of New Common Stock, which the Bankruptcy Court confirmed as part of the Plan.
In a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission concurrently with this release, the Company has furnished preliminary unaudited consolidated financial information for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2017 and updated projections for income and loss due to cancellation of indebtedness income.
Court filings and other information related to the chapter 11 cases are available on the Company’s website at www.vnrllc.com/restructuring and at http://cases.primeclerk.com/vanguard, which is a website administered by the Company’s claims agent, Prime Clerk LLC. The Company has also set up a toll-free hotline to answer employee, vendor, investor and royalty owner questions, which is available Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Central Standard Time at 844-596-2260 (internationally at 929-333-8976).  Parties may obtain electronic notification of court filings through the Prime Clerk website or may register for email notices by completing the Bankruptcy Court’s registration form that can be accessed at http://www.txs.uscourts.gov/sites/txs/files/CRECFform.pdf.

Did Your Broker Recommend Investing in Vanguard Natural Resources LLC (VNR)? - Securities Lawyer

Did Your Broker Recommend Investing in Vanguard Natural Resources LLC (VNR)? 


Could Vanguard Natural Resources LLC (VNR) be the next energy company to declare bankruptcy?



52wk Range:
0.46 – 8.46







Vanguard Natural Resources LLC (VNR) has had a tough 52-week period, as Vanguard’s stock price has plunged from this time last year, when it was $8.94 per share.
Vanguard announced recently that it would delay a $15 million interest payment on some of its senior notes taking advantage of the grace period on the payment. This caused the stock to fall over 30% amid fears of bankruptcy. If the payments on the notes are not made within the 30 day grace period, Vanguard would default on its entire debt and could be forced into bankruptcy.
Vanguard has $1.8 billion in debt, including $1.4 billion from its credit line. Vanguard’s estimated value is approximately $1.95 billion and its total assets at $358.5 million. If Vanguard can’t address its liquidity problems and make the debt payment in the grace period, the future looks bleak for this oil company.
Vanguard Natural Resources LLC, acquires and develops oil and natural gas properties in the United States. It owns properties, and oil and natural gas reserves primarily located in 10 operating basins. Vanguard Natural Resources LLC was founded in 2006 and is headquartered in Houston, Texas.
Dozens of energy-related companies have filed for bankruptcy since 2015 due to the plummeting prices of crude oil.  Soreide Law Group continues to hear from a growing list of investors whose brokers recommended a high-concentration of these risky oil and gas stocks for their conservative portfolios. When an energy company files for Chapter 11, the investors could be left empty handed at the end of a very long creditor’s line.
If you’ve experienced devastating losses due to your broker’s over-concentration of Vanguard Natural Resources LLC (VNR) or any other energy-related stock, call Soreide Law Group for a free consultation with a lawyer regarding the possibility of recovering your losses at:  888-760-6552.
Soreide Law Group represents clients nationwide before FINRA and we operate on a contingency basis.

Testimonials



Our experience with Lars Soreide was very satisfying. He is a very sincere and dedicated lawyer. He did an excellent job in representing us in front of the arbitrator.We recovered 100% of the funds that we invested with the stockbroker. We highly recommend him.WILL GILLMAN • CLIENTMr. Soreide represented me and Everything went great. I highly recommend hiring Mr. Soreide. Preparation is key and he was super prepared for the hearing. Thank You.TODD FREDERICK • CLIENTWe are so happy we chose Lars K. Soreide of Soreide Law Group to handle a claim against our stock broker. Our long trusted broker was actually not to be trusted. We had lost over 6 figures because of illegal activity the FBI charged him with. We were devastated since my husband and I were in retirement. I researched for many hours before deciding on Lars Soreide to handle the case against our broker to try and recover some of our losses. He was professional and did an outstanding job. He knew how to reach a settlement when another legal firm representing a large group could not reach a settlement due to the size of that groups claim. We are so happy we did not go with the large group and chose someone that would concentrate on our loss and our settlement. We are very satisfied with the way he handled and settled our case. ANN HODY • CLIENTThe Soreide Law Group was of great help to us. They are true professionals in the field of the SEC law and in our case they won a satisfactory settlement. KRISTINA HALL • CLIENTExtremely Knowledgeable, professional, and prompt. No communication issues whatsoever and, of course, the desired best possible outcome was achieved.BRIAN FERY • CLIENTSoreide Law Group helped my wife and I recover a portion of what we lost with an Atlanta brokerage firm. Soreide stayed in touch every step of the way and concluded our claim in the amount of time they originally stated. Very good experience. KEN MILLS • CLIENTLars Soreide is a fantastic litigator and helped me recover 90% of my losses through my broker. After a sick wife, i took my eyes off my brokerage account – turns out the guy was running trades that were substantially more aggressive than the conservative basis i had established my portfolio under. He helped me arbitrate my case and litigated the matter. What do you know, they wound up firing the broker and paid me almost 100% of my losses. This guy is fantastic and will fight harder than any other lawyer I’m convinced to regain your money. He doesn’t get paid unless you do!!JEFFREY K • CLIENTExcellent Attorney, Trustworthy, Knowledgeable and Responsive.
I have many years experience in the legal field and I found Lars to be among the best attorneys that I have had the pleasure of dealing with. I have never had the need to file an action on behalf of myself or my family before. My mother’s life savings was lost to an investment which involved some unscrupulous dealings. I decided that I needed to do something to help my mother recover some of her savings as this investment devastated her financially. After investigating and speaking with several attorneys I was most impressed with Lars. I have dealt with many attorneys over the years due to my work and I found Lars to be extremely intelligent, compassionate and very knowledgeable in this field of litigation. Lars was on top of every detail of the process. Due to his prowess my mother was able to recover a good portion of her lost investment. I cannot say enough about his straight forward dealings with us as well as his compassion towards my mother and her situation. He truly believed in what he was doing for us and he brought this attitude in to the case. If I ever had to file suit again I would not hesitate to contact Lars again in a second. I cannot recommend him enough. He does not relegate you to his staff but he speaks with you directly every time. I was most impressed with his attitude, responsiveness, knowledge and compassion. I cannot thank him enough for helping our family in our time of need.JOHN C • CLIENTThank God for this Guy! Lars Soreide is amazing. He recovered over a half a million dollars of my funds from my churn and burn broker who actually counter sued me after filing the lawsuit. I didn’t even know it was possible to bring this type of lawsuit through FINRA to recover. Glad I went through with it. Would recommend Lars to anyone.Michael M • CLIENTMr. Soreide is very honest, he never promised an outcome but took the case when everyone said there was no case. I was very pleased with the outcome and how we recovered our losses and he saw it through until the end. Marissa Nugent • CLIENTI hired Lars Soreide to represent me against my stock broker who was running a ponzi scheme. Soreide Law sued the firm for not catching the fraud he was running. The case went to a full trial before 3 arbitrators and they awarded us back every dollar I lost in the Ponzi scheme. My wife and I felt this was totally hopeless because the stock broker was in jail and had no money but we collected every penny back from the firm. We owe a huge THANK YOU to Soreide Law Group. Dominic M. • CLIENT5.0 Out of 5.0 Overall Superb Client Review RatingLawyers.com

Testimonials



Our experience with Lars Soreide was very satisfying. He is a very sincere and dedicated lawyer. He did an excellent job in representing us in front of the arbitrator.We recovered 100% of the funds that we invested with the stockbroker. We highly recommend him.WILL GILLMAN • CLIENTMr. Soreide represented me and Everything went great. I highly recommend hiring Mr. Soreide. Preparation is key and he was super prepared for the hearing. Thank You.TODD FREDERICK • CLIENTWe are so happy we chose Lars K. Soreide of Soreide Law Group to handle a claim against our stock broker. Our long trusted broker was actually not to be trusted. We had lost over 6 figures because of illegal activity the FBI charged him with. We were devastated since my husband and I were in retirement. I researched for many hours before deciding on Lars Soreide to handle the case against our broker to try and recover some of our losses. He was professional and did an outstanding job. He knew how to reach a settlement when another legal firm representing a large group could not reach a settlement due to the size of that groups claim. We are so happy we did not go with the large group and chose someone that would concentrate on our loss and our settlement. We are very satisfied with the way he handled and settled our case. ANN HODY • CLIENTThe Soreide Law Group was of great help to us. They are true professionals in the field of the SEC law and in our case they won a satisfactory settlement. KRISTINA HALL • CLIENTExtremely Knowledgeable, professional, and prompt. No communication issues whatsoever and, of course, the desired best possible outcome was achieved.BRIAN FERY • CLIENTSoreide Law Group helped my wife and I recover a portion of what we lost with an Atlanta brokerage firm. Soreide stayed in touch every step of the way and concluded our claim in the amount of time they originally stated. Very good experience. KEN MILLS • CLIENTLars Soreide is a fantastic litigator and helped me recover 90% of my losses through my broker. After a sick wife, i took my eyes off my brokerage account – turns out the guy was running trades that were substantially more aggressive than the conservative basis i had established my portfolio under. He helped me arbitrate my case and litigated the matter. What do you know, they wound up firing the broker and paid me almost 100% of my losses. This guy is fantastic and will fight harder than any other lawyer I’m convinced to regain your money. He doesn’t get paid unless you do!!JEFFREY K • CLIENTExcellent Attorney, Trustworthy, Knowledgeable and Responsive.
I have many years experience in the legal field and I found Lars to be among the best attorneys that I have had the pleasure of dealing with. I have never had the need to file an action on behalf of myself or my family before. My mother’s life savings was lost to an investment which involved some unscrupulous dealings. I decided that I needed to do something to help my mother recover some of her savings as this investment devastated her financially. After investigating and speaking with several attorneys I was most impressed with Lars. I have dealt with many attorneys over the years due to my work and I found Lars to be extremely intelligent, compassionate and very knowledgeable in this field of litigation. Lars was on top of every detail of the process. Due to his prowess my mother was able to recover a good portion of her lost investment. I cannot say enough about his straight forward dealings with us as well as his compassion towards my mother and her situation. He truly believed in what he was doing for us and he brought this attitude in to the case. If I ever had to file suit again I would not hesitate to contact Lars again in a second. I cannot recommend him enough. He does not relegate you to his staff but he speaks with you directly every time. I was most impressed with his attitude, responsiveness, knowledge and compassion. I cannot thank him enough for helping our family in our time of need.JOHN C • CLIENTThank God for this Guy! Lars Soreide is amazing. He recovered over a half a million dollars of my funds from my churn and burn broker who actually counter sued me after filing the lawsuit. I didn’t even know it was possible to bring this type of lawsuit through FINRA to recover. Glad I went through with it. Would recommend Lars to anyone.Michael M • CLIENTMr. Soreide is very honest, he never promised an outcome but took the case when everyone said there was no case. I was very pleased with the outcome and how we recovered our losses and he saw it through until the end. Marissa Nugent • CLIENTI hired Lars Soreide to represent me against my stock broker who was running a ponzi scheme. Soreide Law sued the firm for not catching the fraud he was running. The case went to a full trial before 3 arbitrators and they awarded us back every dollar I lost in the Ponzi scheme. My wife and I felt this was totally hopeless because the stock broker was in jail and had no money but we collected every penny back from the firm. We owe a huge THANK YOU to Soreide Law Group. Dominic M. • CLIENT5.0 Out of 5.0 Overall Superb Client Review RatingLawyers.com

Did Your Broker Recommend Investing in Vanguard Natural Resources LLC (VNR)? - Securities Lawyer

Did Your Broker Recommend Investing in Vanguard Natural Resources LLC (VNR)? 


Could Vanguard Natural Resources LLC (VNR) be the next energy company to declare bankruptcy?



52wk Range:
0.46 – 8.46







Vanguard Natural Resources LLC (VNR) has had a tough 52-week period, as Vanguard’s stock price has plunged from this time last year, when it was $8.94 per share.
Vanguard announced recently that it would delay a $15 million interest payment on some of its senior notes taking advantage of the grace period on the payment. This caused the stock to fall over 30% amid fears of bankruptcy. If the payments on the notes are not made within the 30 day grace period, Vanguard would default on its entire debt and could be forced into bankruptcy.
Vanguard has $1.8 billion in debt, including $1.4 billion from its credit line. Vanguard’s estimated value is approximately $1.95 billion and its total assets at $358.5 million. If Vanguard can’t address its liquidity problems and make the debt payment in the grace period, the future looks bleak for this oil company.
Vanguard Natural Resources LLC, acquires and develops oil and natural gas properties in the United States. It owns properties, and oil and natural gas reserves primarily located in 10 operating basins. Vanguard Natural Resources LLC was founded in 2006 and is headquartered in Houston, Texas.
Dozens of energy-related companies have filed for bankruptcy since 2015 due to the plummeting prices of crude oil.  Soreide Law Group continues to hear from a growing list of investors whose brokers recommended a high-concentration of these risky oil and gas stocks for their conservative portfolios. When an energy company files for Chapter 11, the investors could be left empty handed at the end of a very long creditor’s line.
If you’ve experienced devastating losses due to your broker’s over-concentration of Vanguard Natural Resources LLC (VNR) or any other energy-related stock, call Soreide Law Group for a free consultation with a lawyer regarding the possibility of recovering your losses at:  888-760-6552.
Soreide Law Group represents clients nationwide before FINRA and we operate on a contingency basis.

Forget Vanguard Natural Resources, LLC: These 3 Stocks Are Better Buys
The troubled upstream master limited partnership is teetering on the brink, which is why investors need to look elsewhere.











                Matthew DiLallo
            

                (TMFmd19)

Vanguard Natural Resources (NASDAQ:VNR) is in over its head right now. As of the end of September, the company had borrowed $1.325 billion under its bank credit facility. That is a grave concern because its banks cut the borrowing base on that facility to $1.1 billion in October. This decision means the company needs to repay the deficiency in six equal monthly payments or it may have no choice but to declare bankruptcy. Unfortunately, that latter option is looking more likely with each passing day given its declining cash flow and other financial issues. 
Because of the company's precarious financial situation, investors should forget about investing in Vanguard Natural Resources right now. Instead, those looking for an oil and gas stock with a similar focus or business model should consider Antero Resources (NYSE:AR), Parsley Energy (NYSE:PE), or Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE:EPD) instead. Here's why. 
Natural gas-driven growth
One thing that had drawn investors to Vanguard Natural Resources in the past was its focus on natural gas over oil. Thanks to a string of acquisitions, Vanguard built a substantial natural gas asset base totaling 4.4 trillion cubic feet equivalent (Tcfe) of proved reserves -- about three-quarters of which is gas -- giving it tremendous optionality and upside to rising gas prices. That said, because of the company's higher costs and elevated debt level, it cannot get the most out of this resource base. 
Contrast this with Antero Resources, which is one of the fastest-growing gas companies in the country. The company currently controls the largest acreage position in the core of the Marcellus shale as well as an expansive position in the Utica. These areas hold more than 13 Tcfe of proved gas reserves and an estimated 60 Tcfe of resource potential. Meanwhile, thanks to its relatively low leverage and the high-return nature of these wells, Antero Resources believes it can grow production by 20% to 25% next year, with significant growth potential in future years. Suffice it to say, investors looking for gas-driven growth need to look past Vanguard and consider Antero Resources instead. 
Making acquisitions the right way
Another draw of Vanguard's business model was its acquisition-driven growth strategy. Since going public in 2007, the company has spent $5 billion to complete 25 strategic acquisitions. That said, it funded the bulk of that growth with debt and, worse yet, used its credit facility as a primary funding source for deal-making. That decision now has the company near the brink of bankruptcy.
Contrast this with Parsley Energy, which primarily uses equity to fund acquisitions. This year alone, the company has completed four transactions, which have added 42,000 net acres to its portfolio, boosting its position by nearly 50%. However, each time it announced a deal, the company immediately launched a stock offering. Because of that, Parsley Energy has just $750 million of net debt, which is a tiny amount for the more than $8 billion company. Furthermore, Parley Energy has not touched its $600 million credit facility and currently has $200 million in cash, which gives it ample liquidity for future deals or to drill more wells. Suffice it to say, Parsley Energy knows the right way to do mergers and acquisitions in the oil patch.

Get your distributions here
The third draw to Vanguard in the past was its generous distributions. At its peak, the company was sending unitholders a lucrative cash payment every month. However, the significant slump in commodity prices, when combined with the company's balance sheet issues, forced it to cut the payout last year before stopping it altogether in 2016. 
Contrast this with Enterprise Products Partners, which has paid unitholders a distribution every quarter since going public in 1998, having increased the payout 58 times, including for the past 49 straight quarters. Driving the consistency of Enterprise Products Partners' distribution increases is its strong investment grade-rated balance sheet, a conservative payout ratio, and the fact that the bulk of its cash flow comes from stable fee-based assets. Furthermore, with several fee-based expansion projects currently under construction, Enterprise Products Partners has clear visibility to keep its distribution growth streak alive. Meanwhile, it will be a miracle for Vanguard to get back into the position where it can start paying its investors distributions ever again. 
Investor takeaway
Investors might think Vanguard Natural Resources' low unit price is an attractive opportunity to pick up a natural gas-focused company potentially poised for a turnaround. While it is possible that the company might fix its balance sheet woes before time runs out, there's a real risk it could fail. Investors are better off avoiding that risk, which is why they should forget about Vanguard and consider investing in Antero, Parsley, or Enterprise instead.

Testimonials



Our experience with Lars Soreide was very satisfying. He is a very sincere and dedicated lawyer. He did an excellent job in representing us in front of the arbitrator.We recovered 100% of the funds that we invested with the stockbroker. We highly recommend him.WILL GILLMAN • CLIENTMr. Soreide represented me and Everything went great. I highly recommend hiring Mr. Soreide. Preparation is key and he was super prepared for the hearing. Thank You.TODD FREDERICK • CLIENTWe are so happy we chose Lars K. Soreide of Soreide Law Group to handle a claim against our stock broker. Our long trusted broker was actually not to be trusted. We had lost over 6 figures because of illegal activity the FBI charged him with. We were devastated since my husband and I were in retirement. I researched for many hours before deciding on Lars Soreide to handle the case against our broker to try and recover some of our losses. He was professional and did an outstanding job. He knew how to reach a settlement when another legal firm representing a large group could not reach a settlement due to the size of that groups claim. We are so happy we did not go with the large group and chose someone that would concentrate on our loss and our settlement. We are very satisfied with the way he handled and settled our case. ANN HODY • CLIENTThe Soreide Law Group was of great help to us. They are true professionals in the field of the SEC law and in our case they won a satisfactory settlement. KRISTINA HALL • CLIENTExtremely Knowledgeable, professional, and prompt. No communication issues whatsoever and, of course, the desired best possible outcome was achieved.BRIAN FERY • CLIENTSoreide Law Group helped my wife and I recover a portion of what we lost with an Atlanta brokerage firm. Soreide stayed in touch every step of the way and concluded our claim in the amount of time they originally stated. Very good experience. KEN MILLS • CLIENTLars Soreide is a fantastic litigator and helped me recover 90% of my losses through my broker. After a sick wife, i took my eyes off my brokerage account – turns out the guy was running trades that were substantially more aggressive than the conservative basis i had established my portfolio under. He helped me arbitrate my case and litigated the matter. What do you know, they wound up firing the broker and paid me almost 100% of my losses. This guy is fantastic and will fight harder than any other lawyer I’m convinced to regain your money. He doesn’t get paid unless you do!!JEFFREY K • CLIENTExcellent Attorney, Trustworthy, Knowledgeable and Responsive.
I have many years experience in the legal field and I found Lars to be among the best attorneys that I have had the pleasure of dealing with. I have never had the need to file an action on behalf of myself or my family before. My mother’s life savings was lost to an investment which involved some unscrupulous dealings. I decided that I needed to do something to help my mother recover some of her savings as this investment devastated her financially. After investigating and speaking with several attorneys I was most impressed with Lars. I have dealt with many attorneys over the years due to my work and I found Lars to be extremely intelligent, compassionate and very knowledgeable in this field of litigation. Lars was on top of every detail of the process. Due to his prowess my mother was able to recover a good portion of her lost investment. I cannot say enough about his straight forward dealings with us as well as his compassion towards my mother and her situation. He truly believed in what he was doing for us and he brought this attitude in to the case. If I ever had to file suit again I would not hesitate to contact Lars again in a second. I cannot recommend him enough. He does not relegate you to his staff but he speaks with you directly every time. I was most impressed with his attitude, responsiveness, knowledge and compassion. I cannot thank him enough for helping our family in our time of need.JOHN C • CLIENTThank God for this Guy! Lars Soreide is amazing. He recovered over a half a million dollars of my funds from my churn and burn broker who actually counter sued me after filing the lawsuit. I didn’t even know it was possible to bring this type of lawsuit through FINRA to recover. Glad I went through with it. Would recommend Lars to anyone.Michael M • CLIENTMr. Soreide is very honest, he never promised an outcome but took the case when everyone said there was no case. I was very pleased with the outcome and how we recovered our losses and he saw it through until the end. Marissa Nugent • CLIENTI hired Lars Soreide to represent me against my stock broker who was running a ponzi scheme. Soreide Law sued the firm for not catching the fraud he was running. The case went to a full trial before 3 arbitrators and they awarded us back every dollar I lost in the Ponzi scheme. My wife and I felt this was totally hopeless because the stock broker was in jail and had no money but we collected every penny back from the firm. We owe a huge THANK YOU to Soreide Law Group.

Index funds could help lower long-term costs
Get the high quality and low costs you'd expect from the company that introduced indexing to individual investors.
What are index mutual funds?



Instead of hiring fund managers to actively select which stocks or bonds the fund will hold, an index fund buys all (or a representative sample) of the securities in a specific index, like the S&P 500 Index.The goal of an index fund is to track the performance of a specific market benchmark as closely as possible. That's why you may hear it referred to as a "passively managed" fund.

Index funds offer built-in benefits








Low costs
Because index funds hold investments until the index itself changes, they generally have lower management and transaction costs.
 




Lower risk through broader diversification
Some index funds give you exposure to potentially thousands of securities in a single fund.
 




Tax efficiency
Broad index funds generally don't trade as much as actively managed funds might, so they're typically generating less taxable income, which reduces the drag on your investments.
 
Compare index funds vs. actively managed funds 

Could actively managed funds help you beat the market?

Read more about what you should consider when choosing an index fund


You can get an index fund anywhere—why Vanguard?








We started the indexing revolution
Vanguard launched the first index fund for individual investors in 1976, and we've been fine-tuning both our benchmark selections and tracking skills ever since.Today, we have more than 60 unique funds that track indexes across the bond and stock markets, both U.S. and international, as well as sector-specific areas of the markets.
See a complete list of Vanguard index funds 

 




We've made it our business to keep your costs low
The average Vanguard index fund expense ratio is 71% less than the industry average.*

In fact, the right balance of four of our broadest index funds could give you a complete portfolio, with full exposure to U.S. and international stock and bond markets.Get details on:

	All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market. Bond funds are subject to the risk that an issuer will fail to make payments on time and that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates or negative perceptions of an issuer's ability to make payments. Investments in stocks issued by non-U.S. companies are subject to risks including country/regional risk, which is the chance that political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions; and currency risk, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Funds that concentrate on a relatively narrow market sector face the risk of higher share-price volatility. Past performance is no guarantee of future returns. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.

Vanguard stock funds


93% of our low-cost stock mutual funds performed better than their peer-group averages over the past 10 years.*




Give your money a chance to grow over the long term
Get higher potential for investment growth



Stock mutual funds aim to provide long-term growth, unlike bond funds, which focus on income. In exchange for more growth, however, you're likely to experience more ups and downs in the value of your investment.

Increase diversification in your portfolio



A stock fund could give you access to hundreds—sometimes thousands—of stocks, which spreads out risk more than owning individual stocks.

Get broad exposure to the stock markets



You can use just a few funds to complete the stock portion of your portfolio. Each of these index funds gives you access to a wide variety of stocks in a single, diversified fund.

Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund holds more than 3,000 domestic stocks.

Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund holds more than 5,500 non-U.S. stocks.

How to choose a stock fund



Here are a few questions to ask yourself while you're considering the right Vanguard stock fund for your portfolio:

How do stock mutual funds differ from one another?



When looking for a stock fund, consider these two characteristics:

Investing style. In general, stock funds invest in value stocks, growth stocks, or a blend of the two.

Capitalization. Stock funds also choose investments based on the size, or capitalization, of a company. Companies are considered either small-, mid-, or large-cap.


See a complete list of Vanguard stock funds


Do I want domestic or international stocks?








Investing in both U.S. and international stock funds can add another level of diversification to an already well-balanced portfolio.

Would I prefer index or active funds?



Do you feel more comfortable tracking the market, or would you rather try to beat it?

Index funds try to track the performance of a specific market benchmark.

Actively managed funds are steered by our expert portfolio managers who select specific securities for the fund. While actively managed funds give you a chance to beat the benchmark, they can also underperform.


Compare index funds vs. actively managed funds


Should I focus on a specific industry?



You can choose a fund that invests solely in a specific sector of the market, like health care, technology, or telecommunications.But remember, these funds have a very narrow focus and expose you to more risk. Sector and specialty funds should only be used to supplement an already diversified portfolio.

Index funds could help lower long-term costs
Get the high quality and low costs you'd expect from the company that introduced indexing to individual investors.
What are index mutual funds?



Instead of hiring fund managers to actively select which stocks or bonds the fund will hold, an index fund buys all (or a representative sample) of the securities in a specific index, like the S&P 500 Index.The goal of an index fund is to track the performance of a specific market benchmark as closely as possible. That's why you may hear it referred to as a "passively managed" fund.

Index funds offer built-in benefits








Low costs
Because index funds hold investments until the index itself changes, they generally have lower management and transaction costs.
 




Lower risk through broader diversification
Some index funds give you exposure to potentially thousands of securities in a single fund.
 




Tax efficiency
Broad index funds generally don't trade as much as actively managed funds might, so they're typically generating less taxable income, which reduces the drag on your investments.
 
Compare index funds vs. actively managed funds 

Could actively managed funds help you beat the market?

	All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market. Bond funds are subject to the risk that an issuer will fail to make payments on time and that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates or negative perceptions of an issuer's ability to make payments. Investments in stocks issued by non-U.S. companies are subject to risks including country/regional risk, which is the chance that political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions; and currency risk, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Funds that concentrate on a relatively narrow market sector face the risk of higher share-price volatility. Past performance is no guarantee of future returns. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.

Vanguard balanced funds


100% of our low-cost balanced funds performed better than their peer-group averages over the past 10 years.*




Get a mix of stocks and bonds in one fund
Combine the potential for income and growth



Balanced mutual funds invest in both bonds, which focus primarily on income, and stocks, which aim for investment growth.

Add stability to your portfolio



The bond portion of the fund helps offset the risks associated with the stock portion—providing you with a "balanced" investment.

Automatically maintain your asset mix



You never have to rebalance a balanced fund—it's done for you automatically. Some funds maintain a set asset mix, while others grow more conservative over time.

Spread out your exposure to risk



By potentially holding hundreds—sometimes thousands—of bonds and stocks in a single balanced fund, you get more diversification than you would buying individual bonds and stocks.

How to choose a balanced fund



Picking a Vanguard balanced fund generally depends on whether you're investing for a specific goal, like retirement, or you have another goal in mind.

Target Retirement Funds



If you're investing for retirement, you can get a complete portfolio in a single fund with a Vanguard Target Retirement Fund. Simply choose a fund based on the date you plan to retire or your current age, and the fund will gradually grow more conservative the closer you get to retirement.
See which Target Retirement Fund fits your timeline


LifeStrategy Funds



If you'd prefer a fund that maintains a set asset mix, a LifeStrategy® Fund can help you reach other financial goals.
Match your risk tolerance to a LifeStrategy Fund


Managed Payout Fund



If you're looking to generate income in retirement, Vanguard Managed Payout Fund** might be appropriate for you.
Get income from the Managed Payout Fund


Traditional balanced funds



If you'd like a set asset allocation based on the level of risk you're comfortable with, choose from a variety of traditional index or actively managed balanced funds.

footnote**Vanguard Managed Payout Fund is protected by U.S. Patent Nos. 8,180,695 and 8,185,464.
	Investments in Target Retirement Funds are subject to the risks of their underlying funds. The year in the fund name refers to the approximate year (the target date) when an investor in the fund would retire and leave the workforce. The fund will gradually shift its emphasis from more aggressive investments to more conservative ones based on its target date. An investment in a Target Retirement Fund is not guaranteed at any time, including on or after the target date.
	Each LifeStrategy Fund invests in 4 broadly diversified Vanguard funds and is subject to the risks associated with those underlying funds.
	The Managed Payout Fund is not guaranteed to achieve its investment objectives, is subject to loss, and some of its distributions may be treated in part as a return of capital. The dollar amount of the fund's monthly cash distributions could go up or down substantially from one year to the next and over time. It is also possible for the fund to suffer substantial investment losses and simultaneously experience additional asset reductions as a result of its distributions to shareholders under its managed-distribution policy. An investment in the fund could lose money over short, intermediate, or even long periods of time because the fund allocates its assets worldwide across different asset classes and investments with specific risk and return characteristics. Diversification does not necessarily ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market. The fund is proportionately subject to the risks associated with its underlying funds, which may invest in stocks (including stocks issued by REITs), bonds, cash, inflation-linked investments, commodity-linked investments, long/short market-neutral investments, and leveraged absolute return investments.
	The Managed Payout Fund may not be appropriate for all investors. For example, depending on the time horizon, retirement income needs, and tax bracket, an investment in the Managed Payout Fund might not be appropriate for younger investors not currently in retirement, in IRAs or other tax-advantaged accounts for those investors under 59½, or for participants in employer-sponsored plans. Investors who hold the Managed Payout Fund within a tax-advantaged retirement account should consult their tax advisors to discuss tax consequences that could result if payments are distributed from their core account prior to age 59½ or if they plan to use the Managed Payout Fund, in whole or in part, to meet their required minimum distribution (RMD) obligations. Distributions from the Managed Payout Fund are unlikely to precisely match an investor's IRA RMD obligations. In addition, use of the Managed Payout Fund may be restricted in employer-sponsored plans by the terms of the governing plan documents and/or at the discretion of the plan administrator. Review the information carefully with your financial advisor before deciding whether the Managed Payout Fund is right for you.
	All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.

Testimonials



Our experience with Lars Soreide was very satisfying. He is a very sincere and dedicated lawyer. He did an excellent job in representing us in front of the arbitrator.We recovered 100% of the funds that we invested with the stockbroker. We highly recommend him.WILL GILLMAN • CLIENTMr. Soreide represented me and Everything went great. I highly recommend hiring Mr. Soreide. Preparation is key and he was super prepared for the hearing. Thank You.TODD FREDERICK • CLIENTWe are so happy we chose Lars K. Soreide of Soreide Law Group to handle a claim against our stock broker. Our long trusted broker was actually not to be trusted. We had lost over 6 figures because of illegal activity the FBI charged him with. We were devastated since my husband and I were in retirement. I researched for many hours before deciding on Lars Soreide to handle the case against our broker to try and recover some of our losses. He was professional and did an outstanding job. He knew how to reach a settlement when another legal firm representing a large group could not reach a settlement due to the size of that groups claim. We are so happy we did not go with the large group and chose someone that would concentrate on our loss and our settlement. We are very satisfied with the way he handled and settled our case. ANN HODY • CLIENTThe Soreide Law Group was of great help to us. They are true professionals in the field of the SEC law and in our case they won a satisfactory settlement. KRISTINA HALL • CLIENTExtremely Knowledgeable, professional, and prompt. No communication issues whatsoever and, of course, the desired best possible outcome was achieved.BRIAN FERY • CLIENTSoreide Law Group helped my wife and I recover a portion of what we lost with an Atlanta brokerage firm. Soreide stayed in touch every step of the way and concluded our claim in the amount of time they originally stated. Very good experience. KEN MILLS • CLIENTLars Soreide is a fantastic litigator and helped me recover 90% of my losses through my broker. After a sick wife, i took my eyes off my brokerage account – turns out the guy was running trades that were substantially more aggressive than the conservative basis i had established my portfolio under. He helped me arbitrate my case and litigated the matter. What do you know, they wound up firing the broker and paid me almost 100% of my losses. This guy is fantastic and will fight harder than any other lawyer I’m convinced to regain your money. He doesn’t get paid unless you do!!JEFFREY K • CLIENTExcellent Attorney, Trustworthy, Knowledgeable and Responsive.
I have many years experience in the legal field and I found Lars to be among the best attorneys that I have had the pleasure of dealing with. I have never had the need to file an action on behalf of myself or my family before. My mother’s life savings was lost to an investment which involved some unscrupulous dealings. I decided that I needed to do something to help my mother recover some of her savings as this investment devastated her financially. After investigating and speaking with several attorneys I was most impressed with Lars. I have dealt with many attorneys over the years due to my work and I found Lars to be extremely intelligent, compassionate and very knowledgeable in this field of litigation. Lars was on top of every detail of the process. Due to his prowess my mother was able to recover a good portion of her lost investment. I cannot say enough about his straight forward dealings with us as well as his compassion towards my mother and her situation. He truly believed in what he was doing for us and he brought this attitude in to the case. If I ever had to file suit again I would not hesitate to contact Lars again in a second. I cannot recommend him enough. He does not relegate you to his staff but he speaks with you directly every time. I was most impressed with his attitude, responsiveness, knowledge and compassion. I cannot thank him enough for helping our family in our time of need.JOHN C • CLIENTThank God for this Guy! Lars Soreide is amazing. He recovered over a half a million dollars of my funds from my churn and burn broker who actually counter sued me after filing the lawsuit. I didn’t even know it was possible to bring this type of lawsuit through FINRA to recover. Glad I went through with it. Would recommend Lars to anyone.Michael M • CLIENTMr. Soreide is very honest, he never promised an outcome but took the case when everyone said there was no case. I was very pleased with the outcome and how we recovered our losses and he saw it through until the end. Marissa Nugent • CLIENTI hired Lars Soreide to represent me against my stock broker who was running a ponzi scheme. Soreide Law sued the firm for not catching the fraud he was running. The case went to a full trial before 3 arbitrators and they awarded us back every dollar I lost in the Ponzi scheme. My wife and I felt this was totally hopeless because the stock broker was in jail and had no money but we collected every penny back from the firm. We owe a huge THANK YOU to Soreide Law Group.

Vanguard stock funds


93% of our low-cost stock mutual funds performed better than their peer-group averages over the past 10 years.*




Give your money a chance to grow over the long term
Get higher potential for investment growth



Stock mutual funds aim to provide long-term growth, unlike bond funds, which focus on income. In exchange for more growth, however, you're likely to experience more ups and downs in the value of your investment.

Increase diversification in your portfolio



A stock fund could give you access to hundreds—sometimes thousands—of stocks, which spreads out risk more than owning individual stocks.

Get broad exposure to the stock markets



You can use just a few funds to complete the stock portion of your portfolio. Each of these index funds gives you access to a wide variety of stocks in a single, diversified fund.

Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund holds more than 3,000 domestic stocks.

Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund holds more than 5,500 non-U.S. stocks.


Get details on Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund

Get details on Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund


How to choose a stock fund



Here are a few questions to ask yourself while you're considering the right Vanguard stock fund for your portfolio:

How do stock mutual funds differ from one another?



When looking for a stock fund, consider these two characteristics:

Investing style. In general, stock funds invest in value stocks, growth stocks, or a blend of the two.

Capitalization. Stock funds also choose investments based on the size, or capitalization, of a company. Companies are considered either small-, mid-, or large-cap.


See a complete list of Vanguard stock funds


Do I want domestic or international stocks?








Investing in both U.S. and international stock funds can add another level of diversification to an already well-balanced portfolio.

Would I prefer index or active funds?



Do you feel more comfortable tracking the market, or would you rather try to beat it?

Index funds try to track the performance of a specific market benchmark.

Actively managed funds are steered by our expert portfolio managers who select specific securities for the fund. While actively managed funds give you a chance to beat the benchmark, they can also underperform.


Compare index funds vs. actively managed funds


Should I focus on a specific industry?



You can choose a fund that invests solely in a specific sector of the market, like health care, technology, or telecommunications.But remember, these funds have a very narrow focus and expose you to more risk. Sector and specialty funds should only be used to supplement an already diversified portfolio.

footnote**Vanguard Managed Payout Fund is protected by U.S. Patent Nos. 8,180,695 and 8,185,464.
	Investments in Target Retirement Funds are subject to the risks of their underlying funds. The year in the fund name refers to the approximate year (the target date) when an investor in the fund would retire and leave the workforce. The fund will gradually shift its emphasis from more aggressive investments to more conservative ones based on its target date. An investment in a Target Retirement Fund is not guaranteed at any time, including on or after the target date.
	Each LifeStrategy Fund invests in 4 broadly diversified Vanguard funds and is subject to the risks associated with those underlying funds.
	The Managed Payout Fund is not guaranteed to achieve its investment objectives, is subject to loss, and some of its distributions may be treated in part as a return of capital. The dollar amount of the fund's monthly cash distributions could go up or down substantially from one year to the next and over time. It is also possible for the fund to suffer substantial investment losses and simultaneously experience additional asset reductions as a result of its distributions to shareholders under its managed-distribution policy. An investment in the fund could lose money over short, intermediate, or even long periods of time because the fund allocates its assets worldwide across different asset classes and investments with specific risk and return characteristics. Diversification does not necessarily ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market. The fund is proportionately subject to the risks associated with its underlying funds, which may invest in stocks (including stocks issued by REITs), bonds, cash, inflation-linked investments, commodity-linked investments, long/short market-neutral investments, and leveraged absolute return investments.
	The Managed Payout Fund may not be appropriate for all investors. For example, depending on the time horizon, retirement income needs, and tax bracket, an investment in the Managed Payout Fund might not be appropriate for younger investors not currently in retirement, in IRAs or other tax-advantaged accounts for those investors under 59½, or for participants in employer-sponsored plans. Investors who hold the Managed Payout Fund within a tax-advantaged retirement account should consult their tax advisors to discuss tax consequences that could result if payments are distributed from their core account prior to age 59½ or if they plan to use the Managed Payout Fund, in whole or in part, to meet their required minimum distribution (RMD) obligations. Distributions from the Managed Payout Fund are unlikely to precisely match an investor's IRA RMD obligations. In addition, use of the Managed Payout Fund may be restricted in employer-sponsored plans by the terms of the governing plan documents and/or at the discretion of the plan administrator. Review the information carefully with your financial advisor before deciding whether the Managed Payout Fund is right for you.
	All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.
