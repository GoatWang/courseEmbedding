Retirement income





Focus on your future

Retirement is just the beginning. It’s your time to live well. That’s why some portion of your retirement income should be dependable and predictable.
And while you may be on the path to saving for the future, there are some factors out of your control that create uncertainty. Markets can be volatile, you may live longer than you now imagine and the effect of inflation on your buying power can be unpredictable. Your qualified retirement plan and Social Security may not provide enough income to meet your long-term needs.
A variable annuity from Great-West Financial® can make a difference. By focusing on replacing your income in retirement, you can plan for a more meaningful future.





What is a variable annuity?
A variable annuity is a long-term, tax-deferred retirement savings vehicle that allows you to invest in a wide selection of investment options that are wrapped inside of an insurance contract. It provides an easy, convenient way to supplement the money you receive at retirement from Social Security, your retirement plan at work and your personal savings.
What can a variable annuity do for me?

Faster accumulation of retirement savings — Because the money invested in a variable annuity grows tax deferred (just like in your employer retirement plan), your savings can build faster than they would in a taxable account.1 Any withdrawals of earnings prior to you reaching age 59½ may be subject to income tax and a 10% penalty. A withdrawal charge may also apply.
Growth potential — Choose from more investment options (variable subaccounts) covering a broad array of asset classes and strategies, and make any changes to your asset allocation to match changes to your investment objectives.2
Protection for your family from market declines — The death benefit assures that your beneficiaries will get back the greater of what you put into your account or the total amount of your contributions less prior withdrawals.

Important Disclosures
1 Taxable investments held longer than 12 months may qualify for lower capital gains and/or qualified dividend tax rates, which may make the return on the taxable investments more favorable.
2 Funds may impose redemption fees and/or transfer restrictions if assets are held for less than the published holding period. For more information, see the fund’s prospectus and/or disclosure documents.
3 All guarantees are subject to the claims-paying ability of the Great-West Life & Annuity Insurance Company. Schwab does not provide any insurance guarantees.
4 Insurance expenses, including mortality and expense charges on the Schwab Advisor Choice Variable Annuity, are 0.49%, as compared with the industry average of 1.34% according to a June 30, 2015, Morningstar survey of 2,115 variable annuities. This does not include fees associated with the guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit, underlying investment options or the guaranteed minimum (return-of-premium) death benefit option.
5 The decision to purchase an annuity in a qualified plan or IRA should not be based on the annuity’s tax-deferred accrual feature as the qualified plan or IRA itself already provides this.
6 GWFS Equities, Inc. is the principal underwriter and distributor for the certificate and the Great-West SecureFoundation® Balanced ETF Fund.

About Great-West Life & Annuity Insurance Company
Great-West SecureFoundation®  — Backed by Great-West Life & Annuity Insurance Company

After the financial crisis in the late 2000's, the way people began thinking about
and planning for retirement changed. Suddenly, the company behind an
investment became as important as how an investment performed. Trust,
credibility and strength took on new importance for investors.


        We recognize that our actions as a company can have a long-term effect on
your retirement. It's something that's guided our approach to
business since the Great-West Family of Companies* got their start with
The Great-West Life Assurance Company in 1891. For over 100 years, we've
helped our clients through challenging economic times by doing business
the right way. Great-West Life & Annuity Insurance Company is a leading
provider of employer-sponsored retirement savings plans. We also provide
annuity and life insurance products for individuals, families and businesses.

        Even though the Great-West Family of Companies has been around a
long time, we are also an innovative company. Markets change. People's
needs change. We have to change to meet those needs. Offering Great-West SecureFoundation®  is a good
example. Many people are looking for a way to protect their future,
long-term retirement income from market losses, while benefiting from
market gains. They want to stay invested when markets go up. And they
want retirement income for the long term. That's why we at Empower Retirement developed and are proud to offer
quality products such as Great-West SecureFoundation. With Great-West
SecureFoundation, we are continuing our long history of conservative,
disciplined risk management. 
        
      

        Great-West Life & Annuity Insurance Company is rated by independent, nationally recognized rating organizations that regularly review and analyze the financial strength and creditworthiness of the company. We have consistently received high marks from industry sources for financial strength. 
      

        Great-West Life & Annuity Insurance Company's financial strength and stability is typified by the strong ratings given by major ratings agencies. 
 


Superior (A+)  by A.M. Best Company, Inc. (highest of 10 categories)   
          
        
Very Strong (AA)  by Fitch Ratings (second highest of nine categories)

In light of recent market volatility, remember that your investments in our retirement income offerings and insurance products are intended as long-term investments. Attempts to time the market are rarely successful. One way to manage risk over time is to ensure you have a diversified portfolio that is rebalanced through up-and-down markets. Keep your individual needs, goals and time horizon in mind and consult with your financial adviser if needed. It is important to note diversification and rebalancing do not ensure a profit and do not protect against loss in declining markets.

I can't log in. What is wrong?

There are several possible reasons for why you are unable to log in. Please review the scenarios below and if you are still unable to log in, contact your customer service representative.

I believe I have entered my Username and PIN correctly; however, I'm receiving a message stating, "The system was not able to log you on."
The most likely reason for this is that your Username was not entered correctly. You can verify your Username by clicking on the "Forgot Username or PIN?" link located on the login page.  
I remember my Username but can't remember my PIN.
Click on "Forgot Username or PIN?" then select the tab "Forgot PIN" and follow the steps to log in.
I forgot my Username and PIN.
Click  on "Forgot Username or PIN?" then click on the "Forgot Username and PIN" tab  and follow the steps to log in.
I'm stuck at the login page! Every time I try to log in, it just reloads the same page over again.
    A "cookie" issue commonly causes this problem. A "cookie" or "session variable" is a bit of information that a Web server, hosting a website such as this one, stores on a Web client, such as your PC. There are two types of cookies: temporary and permanent. Temporary cookies are deleted every time you shut down your browser or after a certain amount of inactivity (10 minutes for this site). Permanent cookies are retained on your PC's hard drive, typically taking up less space than it takes to store two lines of English text. 
A permanent cookie is used to store non-private information that helps Web servers customize the way you view a particular website. Information such as where you left the website the last time you visited, the functions you use most often, etc., are stored so that return visits are more familiar for you.
This  website only uses temporary cookies for personal account information. We use  these to store information about your transactions while on our website so you  don't have to authenticate your identity with your Username and PIN every time  you want to do something on the site. As with all temporary cookies, this  information—which is  already encrypted for your protection—is deleted every time you shut down your browser or after every 10 minutes of inactivity, whichever occurs first.
 Without the use of cookies, it becomes impossible to offer the range and types of transactions, calculations, education information and advice available on our website. Cookies are passive bits of information, much like a sticky note on your desk. They can never damage your PC or erase any records, etc. 

To keep from having to re-enter your Username and PIN, we  advise checking the "enable all cookies" option in your browser. This  will also allow you to take advantage of the customization and personalization  features on our website and any others you regularly visit.

 We are keenly aware of our participants' concerns about security, and we constantly monitor our website's security infrastructure and make improvements where possible. Using cookies does not affect our very strong security architecture in any way.
 Internet Explorer Users:
 1. Under the "Tools" menu, select "Internet Options."
      2. Click on the "Privacy" tab. If your settings are set at high or above, you will not be able to access the website. You must reset this to medium-high or lower.

 I  have received my PIN and would like to personalize it. Can I change my PIN  online?

 Yes, you have the ability to change your PIN on our website. You can change the originally assigned PIN to a number of your choosing. After you log in, click on "My Profile," then choose "Personal Account Information." At the bottom of the page, click on the "Edit" button next to "PIN." Enter the new PIN information and then click on "Submit." The change is effective immediately and no written confirmation will be mailed.
Back to top
Once  I insert the first number of my Username or PIN, the browser automatically  inserts the rest. How do I keep it from doing that?

The automatic insertion of your Username and PIN is due to an enabled setting on your browser. It is called "AutoComplete." Here are the instructions to disable this feature in some of the most popular browsers:
 Internet Explorer 5 and higher:

From Internet Explorer, choose "Tools" and then "Internet Options." 
From the "Internet Options" multi-tabbed dialog box that appears, select the "Content" tab.
Click the "AutoComplete" button. 
Uncheck everything. 
Click on the "Delete AutoComplete history..." button.
Select the items you would like to delete from the browser's history and click "Delete."
Click  on "OK" to  return to your browser.

Mozilla  Firefox: 

From the "Tools" menu, select "Options." 
Select the "Security" category. 
Uncheck the options under "Passwords."
Select the "Privacy" category.
In the "History" section, select "Use custom settings for history" from the drop-down menu.
Uncheck the box to remember search and form history.
Click on "OK" to return to your browser. 

Safari:

Go to the Safari application menu.
Select "Options."
Click the "AutoFill" icon.
Next, click the "Edit . . ." button next to whichever category of saved entries you'd like to change.

What  is Rebalance My Investments, and how do I use it?*

Rebalance My Investments automatically redistributes your existing account balances to selected investment options at the frequency you choose. Rebalancing will begin one frequency period from the time your transaction is submitted. Some investment options may not be available due to plan restrictions.

    EXAMPLE: Let's say you have allocated 40% of your assets to fund A, 20% to fund B, and 40% to fund C. Over the course of time and through market fluctuations, the funds may gain or lose value. So if fund A gained more than 40% of the value of your entire portfolio, the Rebalance My Investments feature would reapportion assets so that only 40% is in fund A, 20% in fund B and 40% in fund C, the percentages you originally designated. 
Follow these steps  to use the Rebalance My Investments feature: 

Click on "Transactions."
Select "Rebalance My Investments."
Select a frequency period and set up date.
Click "Continue."
Select the funds to which you want to rebalance (must total 100%). You can also elect to have your future contribution allocations match your selections by checking the box for "Change Future Investments."
Click "Continue."
Verify the information you inserted is correct. 
Click "Continue."
Click "Submit" and wait for a confirmation number.

* Rebalancing does not ensure a profit and does not protect against loss in declining markets.
Back to top
What  is dollar cost averaging, and how do I use it?**

Dollar cost averaging can help reduce exposure to stock market fluctuations and timing risk by investing equal, fixed amounts of money in particular investments on a regular schedule. This means you end up buying more shares when prices are low and fewer shares when prices are high. In the long run, this slow and steady investment pace could lower your average cost, potentially turning the normal ups and downs of the stock market in your favor.
Follow these steps to successfully use our Dollar Cost Averaging tool:

Select "Transactions." 
Select "Dollar Cost Average."
Select a frequency period. 
Click "Continue to the next step." 
Choose a termination date for the Dollar Cost Average, or select "Do not terminate this Dollar Cost Average. Run it until I cancel it." 
Choose the investments you would like to transfer money from.
Click "Continue to the next step."
Enter the dollar amount you would like to transfer out of the selected investment option(s).
Click "Continue to the next step."
Choose the investment options you would like to transfer into.
Click "Continue to the next step."
Choose the percentages to go in the selected funds (must total 100%). 
Click "Continue to the next step."
Verify that the information you inserted is correct. 
Click on "Initiate Dollar Cost Average." 

**Dollar cost averaging does not ensure a profit and does not protect against loss in declining markets. Investors should consider their financial ability to continue a dollar-cost-averaging plan during periods of fluctuating price levels.

I cannot view documents, such as fund overviews and  performance history. What do I need to do to view these types of documents?

Those types  of files are on our website as PDF documents. PDF stands for portable data  format. PDF files are visually rich documents that can't be changed. In order  to view these documents, you need a free program called Adobe® Acrobat® Reader. If you do not currently have Adobe Acrobat Reader  installed on your system, you can obtain it at www.adobe.com. You may also click here to download it.

Is it necessary to log out?

Yes, logging out is necessary to avoid unauthorized use of your account. However, that is not the only measure we have in place to protect your privacy. Anytime your browser is shut down, all account information is cleared away. We also have a time-out feature that clears all account information 10 minutes after the last account activity. Once the website "times out," you must log on again to resume account activity.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
