																Product Description
															




																Collection: MARK SIKESThis artisanally crafted pattern puts a fresh spin on an archival ikat. Keep the borders intact or cut them off to use as trim on curtains, upholstery and pillows.Width: 51" (130CM)Content: 55% COTTON, 45% LINENHorizontal Repeat: 51" (130CM)Vertical Repeat: 7 1/4" (18CM)Match: STRAIGHT W/BORDERUsage: Fabric






																Samples Policy
															


What is the difference between a sample and a cutting?

A sample comes from a random dye lot  and its purpose is for you to determine if you want that particular design. A cutting (or CFA) is for the purpose of  matching colors. It is much smaller than a sample and comes from the specific  dye lot that you will receive when you place an order and specifically request  a CFA.

Can I keep samples?
Samples are on loan and you may keep them until you are finished with them.  However, when you are finished with them it is important to return them to the  proper manufacturer.

What sizes do samples come in?
All samples are meant for interior designers’ usage and are very generous. A  large pattern will be a large rectangle for you to visualize it accurately. A  solid pattern will be an adequate size to view the pattern.

Why are samples priced?
The $7 Sample Fee is a processing fee and is non refundable unless you do not  receive your sample. All samples are ordered online.

Can I track my samples?
Manufacturers often mail the samples via USPS and tracking is not available.





																Shipping
															



																Free Shipping on all orders over $100*
															All non-sample orders are shipped via UPS or FedEx.
															Samples are generally shipped via the U.S. Postal Service.

Samples Policy For Schumacher BRENTWOOD STRIPE CHINA BLUE FabricSchumacher Fabric

What is the difference between a sample and a cutting?

A sample comes from a random dye lot  and its purpose is for you to determine if you want that particular design. A cutting (or CFA) is for the purpose of  matching colors. It is much smaller than a sample and comes from the specific  dye lot that you will receive when you place an order and specifically request  a CFA.

Can I keep samples?
Samples are on loan and you may keep them until you are finished with them.  However, when you are finished with them it is important to return them to the  proper manufacturer.

What sizes do samples come in?
All samples are meant for interior designers’ usage and are very generous. A  large pattern will be a large rectangle for you to visualize it accurately. A  solid pattern will be an adequate size to view the pattern.
