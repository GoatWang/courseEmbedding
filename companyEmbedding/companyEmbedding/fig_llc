                Vinegars

A quality balsamic is essential to any kitchen. Created is small batches, the complex aromatics of our fig balsamic vinegar, spiced notes of orange, vanilla, and clove, will elevate any recipe. Beautiful flavors for marinades, a dipper for breads or simply drizzling on fresh strawberries or ice cream.

This chunky, plum-colored compote combines figs, apricots, and cherries harvested at the peak of flavor. Fruit forward with the perfect depth and spice, it is compellingly delicious. 

This is the perfect addition to a cheese and charcuterie platter, and to keep in the pantry for last-minute entertaining! It also makes a decadent cheesecake topping.

Products 



AllAvailable NowChutneyJamsJelliesPicklesPreserves




Tomato Chutney



Our tomato chutney is the perfect condiment for meats (especially pork) and vegetables. Think of it as a complex spicy topping somewhere between a sauce and catsup. The kick comes primarily from fresh ginger root and garlic. Note to those with nut allergies: Our Tomato Chutney contains slivered almonds.














Pickled Onion Rings



Our favorite burger topping; mildly spicy and crisp to provide a little crunch and zing to your burgers.














Spicy Pickled Okra



A late summer / fall offering. We use small (one to two bites) okra pods. They have an intense (and some say addictive) flavor.














Strawberry Jam



When the local strawberries show up at market, we make as much of this product as we can, and it is never enough. Our goal is to accent the natural flavor of the fresh berries. Typically we sell this product in May and are sold out in June.














Blackberry Jam



We produce this product with fresh blackberries from local growers. We make batches with-seeds and without. This is a jam, not a jelly: not as thick as a jelly. Perfect for spooning over pancakes or spreading on toast or a biscuit. We love it on PB&J sandwiches.














Spicy Pickled Peaches



Pickled peaches were once a staple on the southern table and are hard to find these days. We make a limited quantity of Pickled Peaches that are spicy and bursting with flavor. These are the perfect side to compliment pork or other meats and are used in many Southern recipes.














Peaches in Amaretto Syrup



When the peaches hit the local farmers market, we get busy making as many jars of this as we have time to. It is never enough and we sell out quickly. These peach halves make a delightful finale to a special meal when served over vanilla ice cream or whipped cream.














Watermelon Rind Pickles



If we can find thick-rind watermelons late in the summer, we offer these. Crisp and sweet with just a hint of spice.














Old Fashioned Fig Preserves



Our fig preserves are made from the fruit of our ancient Brown Turkey fig tree. The tree produces a small fig crop in late July / early August from which we make this preserve. Our fig preserves replicate those common in the early and mid Twentieth Century. The figs are whole or halved and this preserve is accented with ginger and lemon slices. These are a perfect topping for a breakfast biscuit or muffin.














Pepper Jellies



We grow our own Jalapeno, Cayenne, and Scotch Bonnet chiles and create hot pepper jellies that capture the unique flavors of these peppers. The Cayenne and Jalapeno jellies are modestly hot, while the Scotch Bonne jelly is quite a bite. We make a limited quantity of extra-hot pepper jellies for customers who need even more heat.














Green Tomato Pickles



When green tomatoes start showing up at local farmers markets, we make this very labor intensive pickle using a very old recipe. These take three days to produce and are made in very limited quantities. They are crisp, tart, spicy and slightly sweet- the perfect accompaniment for a special dinner plate. This is one of our family’s favorite pickles and it is perfect for special occasions.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
