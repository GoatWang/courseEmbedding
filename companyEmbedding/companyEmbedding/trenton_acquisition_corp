This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 


Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.


What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.


The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

ACQUISITION OF AUSTRALIAN FINE CHINA




 
























																		 
 
 
 
 
COMPANY ANNOUNCEMENT

																		15th March, 2016.


																		TRENTON INTERNATIONAL ACQUISITION OF AUSTRALIAN FINE CHINA


																		Dear Valued Customer,
																		 
																		 We are pleased to announce the acquisition of the business of Australian Fine China by Trenton International, which was completed on 7th March 2016.
																		 
																		Accordingly, from 7th March, the business of Australian Fine China (AFC) – incorporating the importation and sale of all AFC, Schott Zwiesel, RAK, Vicrila, Villeroy & Boch, Grayshott and Amefa – will become part of the Trenton International business.
																		 
																		Key personnel of AFC will be joining Trenton International.  Karen Sanders, one of AFC’s many long-standing employees, will assume the position of Branch Manager (WA).  Sales professionals Michael Carrie (NSW) and Didier Chavrimootoo (VIC) have joined our team.  Their contact details will remain the same.  Simon Carrel has also joined Trenton to ensure a smooth transition.
																		 
																		We are very committed to maintaining and growing the close relationships that AFC has had with its customers.  We believe the amalgamation of the suite of brands and products available from Trenton and AFC defines the commencement of an exciting and new era of supply into the Australian and New Zealand hospitality markets.
																		 
																		Obviously there will be many questions and we plan to meet with you all in the forthcoming weeks to explain the practical effect of this amalgamation in regards to your business with Trenton and AFC.
																		 
																		However, the generality is that:
																		 

All sales of AFC products (including Schott Zwiesel, Vicrila, RAK, Villeroy & Boch, Grayshott and Amefa) from 7th March 2016 will be invoiced by Trenton International through the current AFC system.  A system integration will take place in the coming months;
All debtor balances arising up to and including 4th March 2016 will remain due to Aust Fine China Pty Ltd. Karen Sanders will continue to be responsible for administration of these debtor balances;
All existing contractual arrangements between AFC and our customers will be unaffected and will be met by Trenton.  All outstanding quotations remain valid for the period originally  quoted;
AFC will maintain current warehousing and customer services functions in Western Australia.  AFC (and its brands) will continue to be shipped ex Perth with a minimum FIS of $1000 pre gst of shippable goods.

 
																		The purchase excludes the Total Hospitality Solutions (THS) and the Perth Shop.  Trenton will not be acquiring these stores and they will continue to operate as independent companies.

																		 
																		The acquisition of Australian Fine China will take Trenton to a new level, providing an expanded and comprehensive range of innovative products and iconic brands.   With a view to further enhancing the sales and operational effectiveness of Trenton, we are pleased to announce that Laurie Nelson will assume the role of General Manager and Tim Russell has been appointed National Sales Manager.  This new structure better aligns our team at Trenton to meet the needs of our customers and the hospitality market.
																		                                      
																		We look forward to your ongoing support.
																		 
																		 
																		Yours sincerely,


																		 
																		Tom Reiner                                         Colin Reiner
																		Managing Director                             Director

FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS

 

Certain
statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are
“forward-looking statements” regarding the plans and
objectives of management for future operations and market trends
and expectations. Such statements involve known and unknown risks,
uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results,
performance or achievements to be materially different from any
future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by
such forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements
included herein are based on current expectations that involve
numerous risks and uncertainties. Our plans and objectives are
based, in part, on assumptions involving the continued expansion of
our business. Assumptions relating to the foregoing involve
judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic,
competitive and market conditions and future business decisions,
all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and
many of which are beyond our control. Although we believe that our
assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements are
reasonable, any of the assumptions could prove inaccurate and,
therefore, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking
statements included in this report will prove to be accurate. In
light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the
forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such
information should not be regarded as a representation by us or any
other person that our objectives and plans will be achieved. We
undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any
forward-looking statements for any reason. The terms
“we”, “our”, “us”, or any
derivative thereof, as used herein refer to Trenton Acquisition
Corp, a Delaware corporation.

Organization
and Business




 

Business
Activity

 

Trenton
Acquisition Corp. ("the Company") was incorporated in the state of
Delaware on January 18, 2011 with the objective to acquire, or
merge with, an operating business.

 

The
Company was organized as a vehicle to investigate and, if such
investigation warrants, acquire a target company or business
seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly traded
corporation. The Company’s principal business objective over
the next twelve months and beyond will be to achieve long-term
growth potential through a combination with a business rather than
immediate short-term earnings. The Company will not restrict its
potential target companies to any specific business, industry or
geographical location. The analysis of business opportunities will
be undertaken by, or under the supervision of, the officers and
directors of the Company.

 

Change in
Control Transaction

 

 

On
September 9, 2014, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase
Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with unrelated
purchasers (collectively, the “Purchasers”), whereby
the Company sold 5,000,000 shares of the Company’s common
stock to the Purchasers for an aggregate purchase price of $65,000.
Simultaneously, the Company entered into and closed a Repurchase
Agreement (the “Repurchase Agreement”) with its sole
stockholder, NLBDIT 2010 Services, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (“NLBDIT”), whereby NLBDIT sold and
the Company repurchased 5,000,000 shares of the Company’s
common stock for an aggregate purchase of $65,000. In conjunction
with these transactions the loan payable-related party, note
payable-related party, and the related accrued interest were
forgiven and converted to additional paid-in capital. As a result
of the foregoing transactions, the Company’s former Chief
Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Secretary,
and Director resigned and one of the Company’s new
stockholders was appointed President, Secretary, and Director and
another new stockholder was appointed Chief Financial Officer of
the Company. The sole member of Rodman & Co., LLC
(“Rodman”) is deemed to beneficially own 3,250,000
shares of the Company’s common stock, representing 65% of the
Company’s issued and outstanding shares and, as a result, has
the ability to control the operations of the Company.

 

On June
30, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company (the
“Board”) appointed Zvi Ben-Zvi to the positions of
President and sole director of the Company to fill the vacancies in
those positions due to the resignation of Arnold P.
Kling.

 

On August
8, 2016, the Board appointed Kenneth J. Kirsch to the position of
Chief Financial Officer of the Company to fill the vacancy in that
position due to the resignation of Thomas Pinou.

Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies




 

Basis of
Presentation

 

 

The
accompanying condensed financial statements of the Company have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for
complete financial statement presentation. In the opinion of
management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair
presentation of the interim periods presented have been included.
All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. The
accompanying condensed financial statements and the information
included under the heading Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be
read in conjunction with the Company’s audited financial
statements and related notes included in the Company’s Form
10-K as of March 31, 2016. Interim results are not necessarily
indicative of the results for a full year.

 

Use of
Estimates

 

The
preparation of condensed financial statements in conformity with
GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the
condensed financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies (cont’d.)




 

Cash
Equivalents

 

The
Company considers highly liquid financial instruments purchased
with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
There are no cash equivalents at the condensed balance sheet
dates.

 

Income
Taxes

 

 

The
Company utilizes the accrual method of accounting for income taxes.
Under the accrual method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
determined based on the differences between the financial reporting
basis and the tax basis of the assets and liabilities and are
measured using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect
when the differences are expected to reverse. An allowance against
deferred tax assets is recognized when it is more likely than not
that such tax benefits will not be realized.

 

The
Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of an uncertain
tax position only after considering the probability that a tax
authority would sustain the position upon examination. For tax
positions meeting a “more-likely than-not” threshold,
the amount recognized in the condensed financial statements is the
benefit expected to be realized upon settlement with the tax
authority. For tax positions not meeting the threshold, no
financial statement benefit is recognized. The Company recognizes
interest and penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions
in income tax expense. As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, the
Company has no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain
tax positions.

 

Loss Per
Common Share

 

Basic
loss per share is calculated using the weighted-average number of
common shares outstanding during each reporting period. Diluted
loss per share includes potentially dilutive securities such as
outstanding options and warrants, using various methods such as the
treasury stock or modified treasury stock method in the
determination of dilutive shares outstanding during each reporting
period. The Company does not have any potentially dilutive
instruments for either of the periods presented.

 

Emerging
Growth Company

 

The Company
is an “emerging growth company” and has elected to
use the extended transition period for complying with new or
revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS
Act. This election allows the Company to delay the adoption of new
or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates
for public and private companies until those standards apply to
private companies.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

 

Management
does not believe that any recently issued but not yet effective
accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material effect
on the accompanying condensed financial statements.

 




Note 3
-



Going
Concern




 

 

The
accompanying condensed financial statements have been prepared
assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which
contemplates the recoverability of assets and the satisfaction of
liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has
incurred losses from inception of approximately $199,000, and has
negative working capital of approximately $68,000 at September 30,
2016, which among other factors raises substantial doubt about the
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability
of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon
management’s plan to find a suitable acquisition or merger
candidate, raise additional capital from the sales of stock, and
receive additional loans from related parties. The accompanying
condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments that
might be required should the Company be unable to continue as a
going concern.

 




Note 4
-



Income
Taxes




 

 

As of
September 30, 2016, the Company has net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $199,000, subject to certain change
of control limitations, to reduce future federal and state taxable
income through 2036.

 

The
Company currently has no federal or state tax examinations in
progress nor has it had any federal or state examinations since its
inception. All of the Company’s tax years are subject to
federal and state tax examination.

factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements
of Trenton Acquisition Corp. (“we”, “us”,
“our” or the “Company”) to be materially
different from any future results, performance or achievements
expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. The
forward-looking statements included herein are based on current
expectations that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. The
Company's plans and objectives are based, in part, on assumptions
involving the continued expansion of business. Assumptions relating
to the foregoing involve judgments with respect to, among other
things, future economic, competitive and market conditions and
future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible
to predict accurately and many of which are beyond the control of
the Company. Although the Company believes its assumptions
underlying the forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of
the assumptions could prove inaccurate and, therefore, there can be
no assurance the forward-looking statements included in this
Quarterly Report will prove to be accurate. In light of the
significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking
statements included herein, the inclusion of such information
should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or any
other person that the objectives and plans of the Company will be
achieved.
