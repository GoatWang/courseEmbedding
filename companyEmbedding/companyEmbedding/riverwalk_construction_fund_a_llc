Regions Bank lawsuit against the developers of Cityview at Riverwalk condominiums Regions Bank has filed suit against the developers of a South Waterfront condominium project that has been promoted as a cornerstone for creation of a residential community along Fort Loudoun Lake across from downtown. In the lawsuit filed Friday in Knox County Chancery Court, Regions alleges that Georgia companies, including Cityview at Riverwalk LLC, owe more than $23 million on a construction loan that now is in default. Cityview at Riverwalk is a 122-unit condo/marina project on Blount Avenue where the Knoxville Glove Co. once operated that broke ground more than two years ago. Other defendants named in the complaint are Glove Factory Land Holdings LLC, Blount Ave Marina Investors, Michael J. Blonder and Bradley G. Johnson. Blonder and Johnson are executives at Atlanta-based Focus Development. Although that firm was not named in the suit, its Web site lists Cityview at Riverwalk as one of the projects in its portfolio. A spokesman for Focus said the firm has not had a chance to review the suit and could not discuss it at this time. The lawsuit alleges that Regions has not received interest payments for either February or March of this year. In addition, the suit said that "even if Regions disbursed the remaining available funds under the Construction Loan, the borrowers would be unable to complete the condominium project because such funds would be insufficient to provide for all of the necessary remaining construction and improvements." In January, a partner with Atlanta-based Focus Development confirmed that deposits made on approximately 40 of the project's 80 pre-sold units had been refunded for failure "to meet contractual obligations due to delayed completion." The lawsuit, though, alleges that there are approximately 19 pre-sale contracts in place for the purchase of condo units in the project. The lawsuit seeks a judgment for the loan amount owed and asks for an order authorizing a receiver to take control of the property and the condo project. The receiver would manage completion of construction and operate the property once construction is done. Regions also claims that it has not received financial statements from the borrowers as required under the loan agreement and that the borrowers have allowed liens to be filed against the project for unpaid labor and materials. Blonder and Johnson could not be reached for comment. According to the suit, Regions made a construction loan for $21.6 million to sister companies Glove Factory, Blount Ave and Cityview for the condo project. The amount was later increased to $23.3 million, with Blonder and Johnson guaranteeing payment of the loan. Regions also contends in the suit that the borrowers and Knoxville's Community Development Corp. entered into a Development and Financing Agreement in September 2006 that would fund part of the development under a tax increment financing loan for $2.8 million from BB&T. Regions also provided the Riverwalk developers with a separate mezzanine loan for $2.6 million to help in development. In 2006, Knoxville City Council members approved a measure making the project's site its own tax increment financing district. Under a TIF, developers borrow private money to pay for infrastructure improvements but use all or part of the new property tax revenue from the project to pay down those debts. Regions is seeking to receive and disburse proceeds from the tax increment financing loan. Alvin Nance, executive director and CEO of KCDC, said TIF funds have been expended, but only on public improvements in the area. Nance said he wasn't aware the construction loan was in default. He said the situation is unfortunate, but KCDC hasn't received any indication that the developer won't finish the project. Business writer Josh Flory may be reached at 865-342-6994. Business editor Bill Brewer contributed to this report.

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors

How important is contractor licensing in North Carolina?



Contractors in North Carolina must take an exam administered by PSI licensure certification in order to become licensed. 











Your liability risk when hiring Riverwalk Construction, Llc



Although state law does not require contractors to carry general liability or workers' compensation insurance, hiring contractors who do have an active policy of each insurance is highly recommended. Request a copy of each insurance certificate for your records before any work begins.











Financial recourse when hiring Riverwalk Construction, Llc



Contractors in North Carolina do not have to obtain a surety bond to perform work on residential properties. Homeowners have financial recourse in North Carolina through The Homeowners Recovery Fund, which provides assistance to eligible North Carolina homeowners who have suffered a financial loss caused by the dishonest or incompetent conduct of a licensed general contractor.











What else should I know before hiring Riverwalk Construction, Llc



Licensed contractors must furnish proof of financial responsibility to obtain a limited, intermediate, or unlimited license according to a company's working capital. Working capital is current assets minus current liabilities.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in North Carolina, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk.

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Colleyville:













Does Riverwalk Development, Llc carry a valid contracting license?



Only certain types of specialty contractors (e.g. HVAC, electrical) need to be licensed in Texas. There are no licensing requirements when it comes to hiring for a construction or major remodeling project.
Riverwalk Development, Llc currently holds license A080423 (Building), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Colleyville?



The Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR) regulates HVAC and electrical contractors. You should verify their license status on the TDLR Website before hiring. General contractors and home builders are not licensed so you should do additional research before hiring one.











Your liability risk when hiring Riverwalk Development, Llc



Although it isn't a regulatory requirement, you can ask your general contractor to provide evidence of workers' compensation and general liability insurance prior to hiring them. 











Financial recourse when hiring Riverwalk Development, Llc



The Texas Department of Licensing Regulation does not require general contractors to carry a surety bond nor is there a state recovery fund.











What else should I know before hiring Riverwalk Development, Llc



There is no financial or criminal background check performed on general contractors by the TDLR. The State's Department of Public Safety does maintain a publicly accessible database so you can run your own background check prior to hiring. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



The information on BuildZoom is made available as a public service and should not be considered advertising. We collect client feedback and verify contractors' permitted history with dozens of local building departments in Texas, which saves you time and helps minimize your risk when hiring. 











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The Texas Attorney General's office recommends getting several bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free).

PRESS RELEASE – FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Palm Beach Gardens, Florida  – March 28, 2012
The Town of Jupiter invites residents to the ribbon cutting ceremony for the completion of the Jupiter Riverwalk Extension at Harbourside Place. 
Allied Capital and Development of South Florida, LLC, the Town of Jupiter and the Northern Riverwalk Community Development District are proud to announce the highly anticipated completion of the extension of the Jupiter Riverwalk at Harbourside Place.  We cordially invite the residents and visitors of the Town of Jupiter to attend a ceremonial ribbon cutting to take place on April 3, 2012 at 11:00 AM.  The Mayor of the Town of Jupiter, Karen Golonka, President of Allied Capital & Development of South Florida, Nicholas A. Mastroianni II and the Commissioner of the Florida Inland Navigation District, Donn Colee Jr. will all be present to give a dedication speech and to show their appreciation for the hard work and dedication that has resulted in the completion of the Harbourside Place Riverwalk Extension.  The project, located at Indiantown Road and U.S.1, included the installation of a 1,100-foot pedestrian promenade along the Intracoastal Waterway, as well as a new seawall and public access dock system.
Working hand in hand with the Town of Jupiter, Allied Capital and Development of South Florida, LLC was able to bring about a smooth and timely construction of the Riverwalk.  This was due in large part by the efforts of Moss & Associates Construction Management, who brought in the first phase of the Harbourside Place development on time and budget.  This latest section of the Jupiter Riverwalk will feature an abundance of waterfront access for the citizens of Jupiter and Palm Beach County.   Featuring 1,100 feet of Riverwalk pathway, runners, cyclists, and walkers alike will pass under 4 trellis features and happen upon numerous opportunities to rest and enjoy the beautiful waterfront views that Harbourside Place offers.  Further features of this Riverwalk extension include a new 209-foot public access dock, several drinking fountains (including dog water fountains), an abundance of landscaping, and nature and wildlife viewing opportunities.   The new public dock is designed to give boaters access to the Riverwalk and future restaurants and retail shops housed at Harbourside Place; the adjacent dock will have nine public boat slips for residents and vacationers to use.
Jupiter Riverwalk Extension is completed at Harbourside Place – Join the Ribbon Cutting Ceremony April 3, 2012 at 11:00 AM.
President of Allied Capital and Development of South Florida, LLC, Nicholas A. Mastroianni II, stated that “this is another step toward bringing waterfront access to the community of Jupiter and we are proud to be part of it. “  The $144 Million Harbourside Place facility is being partially funded through the EB-5 Visa Program, which allows foreigners to invest in United States, USCIS Approved, projects that stimulate the U.S. economy and create jobs.  EB-5 participants will make an investment of $500,000 into the Harbourside Place project and will create at least 10 jobs for U.S. citizens in Palm Beach County per investment. In return, the investor will receive a return on their investment, as well as a conditional United States Green Card.  More information on the EB-5 visa program can be found on www.visaeb-5.com.
The finished product of Harbourside Place will feature an entertainment plaza and outdoor amphitheatre, retail space, restaurants and eateries, office suites, Westin Hotel accommodations, conference center and marina slips. Harbourside Place is projected to create more than 2,400 jobs over the next three years and will provide exceptional economic stimulus for the region.  Mr. Mastroianni continued stating, “…with the Riverwalk extension finished, we are looking forward to creating even more jobs when moving on to the construction of phase two of Harbourside Place.”    Phase two of Harbourside Place is set to begin subsequently, with work to be continued by the expert team at Moss & Associates Construction Management.
