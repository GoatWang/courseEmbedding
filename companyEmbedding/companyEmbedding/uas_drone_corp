Technology 
 










RAPTOR Flight Control System
The most important UAS technology, and most difficult to master, is the vehicle autopilot and the operator interface, the Ground Control Station. Drone Aviation’s RAPTOR Flight Control System comprises the Georgia Institute of Technology’s GUST autopilot, and the DAC developed GCS. 




Autopilot

The RAPTOR on-board autopilot (GUST), executes on standard Intel i3, i5, i7, single board computing architecture. RAPTOR is not performance constrained as are many flight control systems operating on proprietary, difficult to upgrade hardware. Being able to rapidly increase computing power allows for mission expansion using capabilities such as GPS-denied vision navigation, target recognition and neural network vehicle control. Commercially licensed exclusively to DAC, GUST is an extensible software platform for full vehicle and environment simulation, on-board dynamic vehicle flight control (autopilot), and sensor-fusion navigation. GUST is mature technology with 15 years of research and operational experience and continues to be improved and expanded by Georgia Tech and Drone Aviation.




Ground Control Station (GCS)

The RAPTOR GCS is unique in the industry. Developed by DAC for use in tethered systems, the GCS is uncluttered by removing confusing settings and options, vehicle tuning and informational windows not required for tethered systems. Further, the RAPTOR GCS operating system is separate from the operator’s tablet, PC, phone or other display and input device. This abstraction layer allows the vehicle to be monitored by a central site, and operated with many different types of devices locally, over a secure wifi or wired Ethernet/Fiber optic link.





















Kevlar Armored Tether
The DAC tether system is an armored smart leash that provides uninterruptible power, and unhackable communications to the WATT UAS and WASP aerostat. While this concept appears simple, DAC’s proprietary tether technology is a key differentiator and enabler for long-duration, safe, unmanned flight. 
Advantages:
Tether-based systems for aerial platforms deliver a number of advantages: 
Fly more reliably and safely than free-flying unmanned aircraft
Unlimited flight duration from ground-based power
Transmit power, video and other data, vehicle control, securely through Kevlar armored tether, no signal to hack




















Tension Control Winch System
A critical part of the WATT Ground Support Equipment, the tension control winch maintains consistent tether alignment with the WATT aerial vehicle. As the vehicle ascends or descends the winch system rapidly adjusts. When in loiter or mobility modes, the tension control monitoring and adjustment system measures tether line tension hundreds of times per second. 




Read More

Small adjustments are made to ensure the tether does not become slack or pull on the aerial vehicle. The system is fully automatic, compensating for both drone operation and environmental conditions. Managed tension avoids slack or whipping of the tether in winds or vehicle flight changes which can result in the tether wrapping around nearby obstructions. Further, the vehicle is more stable when the tether tension is actively managed as the tether is not inconsistently pulling on the vehicle.


Advantages:

More stable vehicle flight, resulting in better video and higher accuracy station-keeping
Safer operation, especially in windy conditions or mobile operations
Winch is designed to allow safe recovery of aerial vehicle






















ACCESSIBLE. MOBILE. RELIABLE.

History[edit]
AAI Corporation originated as Aircraft Armaments, Inc. in August 1950, founded by six aviation and defense industry professionals. It was renamed AAI Corporation in the late 1950s.
AAI’s parent company, United Industrial Corporation (UIC), was founded as Hayes Body Corporation in the early 1900s. Renamed many years later, UIC was admitted into the New York Stock Exchange for trading on December 15, 1964.
From 1994 to 2004, AAI partnered with the Czech firm, Škoda, in a joint venture to manufacture trolley buses. The joint venture, named Electric Transit, Inc., supplied 330 trolley buses to San Francisco and Dayton before being dissolved in 2004.
On 22 June 2006 Aerosonde Ltd was acquired by AAI.[2]
Textron acquired AAI and other subsidiaries of UIC with its purchase of the parent company for approximately $1.1 billion in 2007. AAI became part of Textron's helicopter subsidiary, Bell Textron, in the acquisition.[3]
Today, AAI owns or occupies more than 1,100,000 square feet (100,000 m2) of office and manufacturing space across Australia, the United Kingdom and the USA.
As of May 2014, AAI had been made into three parts: Unmanned Systems, Support Solutions, and Electronic Systems. The company is still registered as an active corporation in the State of Maryland under the name, AAI Corporation.[4]
Products & services[edit]




Shadow 200 UAV in Iraq


Unmanned systems[edit]
AAI is one of a limited number of companies engaged in the design and full-rate production of a successfully fielded, operational unmanned aircraft system (UAS) for the DoD. AAI first began development work on the unmanned systems product line in 1985, winning a competitive fly-off with its Pioneer Remotely Piloted Vehicle.
The company's unmanned aircraft systems include the Shadow 200 Tactical UAS, which is designated RQ-7B by the U.S. Army, as well as the Shadow 400 and 600 systems. As of July, 2014, Shadow systems had accumulated more than 920,000 flight hours,[5] with more than 90 percent of those hours in support of U.S. and allied combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.[6][7]
The company’s UAS capabilities expanded with the 2006 acquisition of Australian UAS manufacturer Aerosonde Pty. Ltd. This fleet's newest model is the Aerosonde Mark 4.7 small unmanned aircraft system. In late 2009, AAI conducted a shipboard demonstration of the system aboard the M80 Stiletto ship.
In September 2008, AAI announced that it had teamed with Aeronautics Ltd. to provide the Orbiter miniature UAS in selected markets.
The company's One System Ground Control Station is fielded as part of the Shadow Tactical UAS, as well as the One System Portable Ground Control Station and One System Remote Video Terminal.
On 16 November 2009, AAI entered a 40-year exclusive license agreement with Carter Aviation Technologies concerning a possible autonomous slowed rotor/compound aircraft with potential for increased speed (250 knots) and range (1300 nautical miles) delivering 3000 pounds cargo, compared to traditional rotorcraft. It is to be based on the Carter PAV.[8][9]
AAI is developing an RQ-7 Shadow, also with a Carter rotor on top for vertical take-off and landing,[10][11] to fly in 2012.[12] AAI also intends to use this technology as the basis for their proposal to DARPAs "Flying Humvee" Transformer program.[13][14][15]
Logistics & Technical Services[edit]
AAI provides a variety of engineering, logistical, maintenance, repair and overhaul services for the company's own platforms as well as those of other original equipment manufacturers.
Its customers include the U.S. Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps, for which the company supports a wide variety of operational systems. The Logistics & Technical Services business unit also provides depot maintenance equipment and services to domestic and international military aviation customers.
Test & Training Systems[edit]
AAI’s test systems are used by every branch of the U.S. military. The Joint Systems Electronic Combat Systems Tester is part of the DoD’s family of testers and currently supports flight-line electronic warfare testing for several U.S. military aircraft.
The company’s Advanced Boresight Equipment systems are used to align avionics and weapons systems onboard military aircraft and helicopters. AAI also produces radar simulators that simulate varied threat signals to test the functionality of radar warning receivers and cockpit displays and controls.
AAI acquired ESL Defence Limited in 2005. Based in the UK, ESL designs and manufactures electro-optical, infrared, and ultraviolet test and simulation/stimulation products for use on flight lines, in aircraft maintenance facilities, and at military test and evaluation ranges.
AAI also provides functional automated test equipment for satellite, electronic and other systems.
Training Systems[edit]
AAI has capabilities in the design, production, and sustainment of maintenance training devices such as the C-17 Globemaster, the F-22 Raptor, and most recently, the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter.
AAI modified and produced state-of-the-art, simulation-based maintenance training devices for the F-22 Raptor providing students with instruction in ground maintenance, aircraft servicing, and munitions loading.
The armament training device provides hands-on skill development pertaining to the removal, installation, inspection, operation, and checkout tasks of the gun, gun doors, left main weapons bay door system and launchers, left side weapons bay launcher, right wing pylon, partial fuel system, stores management system, and weapons safing system. The trainer uses real aircraft support equipment including munitions and the portable maintenance aid (PMA).
The landing gear training device allows instruction on maintenance tasks on the landing gear systems, environmental control systems, hydraulics, and electrical and electronic warfare systems. The device supports nose and right main landing gear operation, and an operational arresting hook.
The aft fuselage training device is a mock-up of the left side wing, horizontal stabilizer, vertical stabilizer, engine bay, forward engine bay door, and aft engine bay door, as well as numerous light systems and engine bay area components for removal and installation task training.
The F-35 Lightning II aircraft system maintenance trainer provides student maintainers comprehensive training on ground operation, maintenance, fault isolation, and testing procedures in a highly realistic simulated environment utilizing an interactive 3-D virtual aircraft environment. This realistic, 3-D virtual vehicle environment, as well as 2-D panels and displays allow students to navigate throughout the F-35 aircraft during maintenance training and select the virtual support equipment and tools required. A real F-35 portable maintenance aid is connected at each student station, allowing the student to monitor the virtual aircraft functions, run diagnostics, and display technical and task documentation. [16]
AAI’s training systems are utilized by U.S. and allied international military customers.
Products include naval, electronic warfare, air defense, radar, and UAS training systems.
Advanced Systems[edit]
AAI’s Advanced Systems unit primarily investigates and responds to new and emerging customer needs and markets. The company is currently working on the U.S. Army’s Lightweight Small Arms Technologies project. It has also developed the PDCue Gunshot Detection System and TDCue acoustic detection systems for the U.S. Army and Marine Corps.

History[edit]
AAI Corporation originated as Aircraft Armaments, Inc. in August 1950, founded by six aviation and defense industry professionals. It was renamed AAI Corporation in the late 1950s.
AAI’s parent company, United Industrial Corporation (UIC), was founded as Hayes Body Corporation in the early 1900s. Renamed many years later, UIC was admitted into the New York Stock Exchange for trading on December 15, 1964.
From 1994 to 2004, AAI partnered with the Czech firm, Škoda, in a joint venture to manufacture trolley buses. The joint venture, named Electric Transit, Inc., supplied 330 trolley buses to San Francisco and Dayton before being dissolved in 2004.
On 22 June 2006 Aerosonde Ltd was acquired by AAI.[2]
Textron acquired AAI and other subsidiaries of UIC with its purchase of the parent company for approximately $1.1 billion in 2007. AAI became part of Textron's helicopter subsidiary, Bell Textron, in the acquisition.[3]
Today, AAI owns or occupies more than 1,100,000 square feet (100,000 m2) of office and manufacturing space across Australia, the United Kingdom and the USA.
As of May 2014, AAI had been made into three parts: Unmanned Systems, Support Solutions, and Electronic Systems. The company is still registered as an active corporation in the State of Maryland under the name, AAI Corporation.[4]
Products & services[edit]




Shadow 200 UAV in Iraq


Unmanned systems[edit]
AAI is one of a limited number of companies engaged in the design and full-rate production of a successfully fielded, operational unmanned aircraft system (UAS) for the DoD. AAI first began development work on the unmanned systems product line in 1985, winning a competitive fly-off with its Pioneer Remotely Piloted Vehicle.
The company's unmanned aircraft systems include the Shadow 200 Tactical UAS, which is designated RQ-7B by the U.S. Army, as well as the Shadow 400 and 600 systems. As of July, 2014, Shadow systems had accumulated more than 920,000 flight hours,[5] with more than 90 percent of those hours in support of U.S. and allied combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.[6][7]
The company’s UAS capabilities expanded with the 2006 acquisition of Australian UAS manufacturer Aerosonde Pty. Ltd. This fleet's newest model is the Aerosonde Mark 4.7 small unmanned aircraft system. In late 2009, AAI conducted a shipboard demonstration of the system aboard the M80 Stiletto ship.
In September 2008, AAI announced that it had teamed with Aeronautics Ltd. to provide the Orbiter miniature UAS in selected markets.
The company's One System Ground Control Station is fielded as part of the Shadow Tactical UAS, as well as the One System Portable Ground Control Station and One System Remote Video Terminal.
On 16 November 2009, AAI entered a 40-year exclusive license agreement with Carter Aviation Technologies concerning a possible autonomous slowed rotor/compound aircraft with potential for increased speed (250 knots) and range (1300 nautical miles) delivering 3000 pounds cargo, compared to traditional rotorcraft. It is to be based on the Carter PAV.[8][9]
AAI is developing an RQ-7 Shadow, also with a Carter rotor on top for vertical take-off and landing,[10][11] to fly in 2012.[12] AAI also intends to use this technology as the basis for their proposal to DARPAs "Flying Humvee" Transformer program.[13][14][15]
Logistics & Technical Services[edit]
AAI provides a variety of engineering, logistical, maintenance, repair and overhaul services for the company's own platforms as well as those of other original equipment manufacturers.
Its customers include the U.S. Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps, for which the company supports a wide variety of operational systems. The Logistics & Technical Services business unit also provides depot maintenance equipment and services to domestic and international military aviation customers.
Test & Training Systems[edit]
AAI’s test systems are used by every branch of the U.S. military. The Joint Systems Electronic Combat Systems Tester is part of the DoD’s family of testers and currently supports flight-line electronic warfare testing for several U.S. military aircraft.
The company’s Advanced Boresight Equipment systems are used to align avionics and weapons systems onboard military aircraft and helicopters. AAI also produces radar simulators that simulate varied threat signals to test the functionality of radar warning receivers and cockpit displays and controls.
AAI acquired ESL Defence Limited in 2005. Based in the UK, ESL designs and manufactures electro-optical, infrared, and ultraviolet test and simulation/stimulation products for use on flight lines, in aircraft maintenance facilities, and at military test and evaluation ranges.
AAI also provides functional automated test equipment for satellite, electronic and other systems.
Training Systems[edit]
AAI has capabilities in the design, production, and sustainment of maintenance training devices such as the C-17 Globemaster, the F-22 Raptor, and most recently, the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter.
AAI modified and produced state-of-the-art, simulation-based maintenance training devices for the F-22 Raptor providing students with instruction in ground maintenance, aircraft servicing, and munitions loading.
The armament training device provides hands-on skill development pertaining to the removal, installation, inspection, operation, and checkout tasks of the gun, gun doors, left main weapons bay door system and launchers, left side weapons bay launcher, right wing pylon, partial fuel system, stores management system, and weapons safing system. The trainer uses real aircraft support equipment including munitions and the portable maintenance aid (PMA).
The landing gear training device allows instruction on maintenance tasks on the landing gear systems, environmental control systems, hydraulics, and electrical and electronic warfare systems. The device supports nose and right main landing gear operation, and an operational arresting hook.
The aft fuselage training device is a mock-up of the left side wing, horizontal stabilizer, vertical stabilizer, engine bay, forward engine bay door, and aft engine bay door, as well as numerous light systems and engine bay area components for removal and installation task training.
The F-35 Lightning II aircraft system maintenance trainer provides student maintainers comprehensive training on ground operation, maintenance, fault isolation, and testing procedures in a highly realistic simulated environment utilizing an interactive 3-D virtual aircraft environment. This realistic, 3-D virtual vehicle environment, as well as 2-D panels and displays allow students to navigate throughout the F-35 aircraft during maintenance training and select the virtual support equipment and tools required. A real F-35 portable maintenance aid is connected at each student station, allowing the student to monitor the virtual aircraft functions, run diagnostics, and display technical and task documentation. [16]
AAI’s training systems are utilized by U.S. and allied international military customers.
Products include naval, electronic warfare, air defense, radar, and UAS training systems.
Advanced Systems[edit]
AAI’s Advanced Systems unit primarily investigates and responds to new and emerging customer needs and markets. The company is currently working on the U.S. Army’s Lightweight Small Arms Technologies project. It has also developed the PDCue Gunshot Detection System and TDCue acoustic detection systems for the U.S. Army and Marine Corps.

Unmanned aircraft guidelines protect military-sanctioned airspace from encroachment


News 






By Katrina Goforth - kgoforth@civitasmedia.com








When Orville and Wilbur Wright took the first successful flight in 1903, the idea of a man flying seemed an impossibility. A century later, technology has advanced so that an aircraft can not only fly but can fly without a human pilot onboard. Unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, are far from the end of advancement in aeronautics, but they may pose a threat to more traditional aircraft.
While the U.S. military began experimenting with unmanned aircraft as early as World War I, unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs, have also become a popular hobbyist aircraft used for photographing landscapes or as an advanced model airplane and in the commercial sector for maintenance and inspection of cell towers or eye-in-the-sky media coverage.
Encroachment has been an important topic in Altus since the multi-engine flight training school was activated in 1943 because it can affect the outcome of a Base Realignment and Closure, or BRAC, if it affects the success of the base’s designated mission. At Altus Air Force Base, that mission is centered around flight training.
With the popularity of UAVs increasing, the chance of civilian-operated aircraft occupying military-sanctioned airspace is higher without proper registration and knowledge of federal guidelines.
“We know the importance of the Altus Air Force Base mission, so we jealously protect our base,” Altus Area Economic Development Corporation, or SECD, Chairman Jim Gover said at the last SEDC meeting held Thursday when the topic of UAVs in the civilian sector was discussed.
The Federal Aviation Administration, or FAA, has guidelines in place for UAVs that depend on the pilot’s use of the aircraft. Hobbyists are required to stay five miles from airports without prior notification to the airport and air traffic control, and commercial pilots of UAVs are required to adhere to the guidelines of Class G airspace, which includes all airspace below 14,500 feet that is not otherwise classified or controlled.
For a complete list of guidelines, visit the FAA website at www.faa.gov.

History[edit]
AAI Corporation originated as Aircraft Armaments, Inc. in August 1950, founded by six aviation and defense industry professionals. It was renamed AAI Corporation in the late 1950s.
AAI’s parent company, United Industrial Corporation (UIC), was founded as Hayes Body Corporation in the early 1900s. Renamed many years later, UIC was admitted into the New York Stock Exchange for trading on December 15, 1964.
From 1994 to 2004, AAI partnered with the Czech firm, Škoda, in a joint venture to manufacture trolley buses. The joint venture, named Electric Transit, Inc., supplied 330 trolley buses to San Francisco and Dayton before being dissolved in 2004.
On 22 June 2006 Aerosonde Ltd was acquired by AAI.[2]
Textron acquired AAI and other subsidiaries of UIC with its purchase of the parent company for approximately $1.1 billion in 2007. AAI became part of Textron's helicopter subsidiary, Bell Textron, in the acquisition.[3]
Today, AAI owns or occupies more than 1,100,000 square feet (100,000 m2) of office and manufacturing space across Australia, the United Kingdom and the USA.
As of May 2014, AAI had been made into three parts: Unmanned Systems, Support Solutions, and Electronic Systems. The company is still registered as an active corporation in the State of Maryland under the name, AAI Corporation.[4]

Shadow 200 UAV in Iraq


Unmanned systems[edit]
AAI is one of a limited number of companies engaged in the design and full-rate production of a successfully fielded, operational unmanned aircraft system (UAS) for the DoD. AAI first began development work on the unmanned systems product line in 1985, winning a competitive fly-off with its Pioneer Remotely Piloted Vehicle.
The company's unmanned aircraft systems include the Shadow 200 Tactical UAS, which is designated RQ-7B by the U.S. Army, as well as the Shadow 400 and 600 systems. As of July, 2014, Shadow systems had accumulated more than 920,000 flight hours,[5] with more than 90 percent of those hours in support of U.S. and allied combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.[6][7]
The company’s UAS capabilities expanded with the 2006 acquisition of Australian UAS manufacturer Aerosonde Pty. Ltd. This fleet's newest model is the Aerosonde Mark 4.7 small unmanned aircraft system. In late 2009, AAI conducted a shipboard demonstration of the system aboard the M80 Stiletto ship.
In September 2008, AAI announced that it had teamed with Aeronautics Ltd. to provide the Orbiter miniature UAS in selected markets.
The company's One System Ground Control Station is fielded as part of the Shadow Tactical UAS, as well as the One System Portable Ground Control Station and One System Remote Video Terminal.
On 16 November 2009, AAI entered a 40-year exclusive license agreement with Carter Aviation Technologies concerning a possible autonomous slowed rotor/compound aircraft with potential for increased speed (250 knots) and range (1300 nautical miles) delivering 3000 pounds cargo, compared to traditional rotorcraft. It is to be based on the Carter PAV.[8][9]
AAI is developing an RQ-7 Shadow, also with a Carter rotor on top for vertical take-off and landing,[10][11] to fly in 2012.[12] AAI also intends to use this technology as the basis for their proposal to DARPAs "Flying Humvee" Transformer program.[13][14][15]
Logistics & Technical Services[edit]
AAI provides a variety of engineering, logistical, maintenance, repair and overhaul services for the company's own platforms as well as those of other original equipment manufacturers.
Its customers include the U.S. Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps, for which the company supports a wide variety of operational systems. The Logistics & Technical Services business unit also provides depot maintenance equipment and services to domestic and international military aviation customers.
Test & Training Systems[edit]
AAI’s test systems are used by every branch of the U.S. military. The Joint Systems Electronic Combat Systems Tester is part of the DoD’s family of testers and currently supports flight-line electronic warfare testing for several U.S. military aircraft.
The company’s Advanced Boresight Equipment systems are used to align avionics and weapons systems onboard military aircraft and helicopters. AAI also produces radar simulators that simulate varied threat signals to test the functionality of radar warning receivers and cockpit displays and controls.
AAI acquired ESL Defence Limited in 2005. Based in the UK, ESL designs and manufactures electro-optical, infrared, and ultraviolet test and simulation/stimulation products for use on flight lines, in aircraft maintenance facilities, and at military test and evaluation ranges.
AAI also provides functional automated test equipment for satellite, electronic and other systems.
Training Systems[edit]
AAI has capabilities in the design, production, and sustainment of maintenance training devices such as the C-17 Globemaster, the F-22 Raptor, and most recently, the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter.
AAI modified and produced state-of-the-art, simulation-based maintenance training devices for the F-22 Raptor providing students with instruction in ground maintenance, aircraft servicing, and munitions loading.
The armament training device provides hands-on skill development pertaining to the removal, installation, inspection, operation, and checkout tasks of the gun, gun doors, left main weapons bay door system and launchers, left side weapons bay launcher, right wing pylon, partial fuel system, stores management system, and weapons safing system. The trainer uses real aircraft support equipment including munitions and the portable maintenance aid (PMA).
The landing gear training device allows instruction on maintenance tasks on the landing gear systems, environmental control systems, hydraulics, and electrical and electronic warfare systems. The device supports nose and right main landing gear operation, and an operational arresting hook.
The aft fuselage training device is a mock-up of the left side wing, horizontal stabilizer, vertical stabilizer, engine bay, forward engine bay door, and aft engine bay door, as well as numerous light systems and engine bay area components for removal and installation task training.
The F-35 Lightning II aircraft system maintenance trainer provides student maintainers comprehensive training on ground operation, maintenance, fault isolation, and testing procedures in a highly realistic simulated environment utilizing an interactive 3-D virtual aircraft environment. This realistic, 3-D virtual vehicle environment, as well as 2-D panels and displays allow students to navigate throughout the F-35 aircraft during maintenance training and select the virtual support equipment and tools required. A real F-35 portable maintenance aid is connected at each student station, allowing the student to monitor the virtual aircraft functions, run diagnostics, and display technical and task documentation. [16]
AAI’s training systems are utilized by U.S. and allied international military customers.
Products include naval, electronic warfare, air defense, radar, and UAS training systems.
Advanced Systems[edit]
AAI’s Advanced Systems unit primarily investigates and responds to new and emerging customer needs and markets. The company is currently working on the U.S. Army’s Lightweight Small Arms Technologies project. It has also developed the PDCue Gunshot Detection System and TDCue acoustic detection systems for the U.S. Army and Marine Corps.

Code of Ethics













Code of Business Conduct and Ethics
Click here to view PDF version




This Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the “Code”) sets forth legal and ethical standards of conduct for directors, officers and employees of UAS Drone Corp., a Nevada corporation, and its subsidiaries (the “Company”). This Code is intended to deter wrongdoing and to promote the conduct of all Company business in accordance with high standards of integrity and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. This Code applies to the Company and all of its subsidiaries and other business entities controlled by it worldwide.

If you have any questions regarding this Code or its application to you in any situation, you should contact your supervisor or the Company’s General Counsel.

Compliance with Laws, Rules and Regulations

The Company requires that all employees, officers and directors comply with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to the Company wherever it does business. You are expected to be familiar with the laws, rules and regulations applicable to your place of work, and such additional laws, rules and regulations which may apply and of which the Company gives you written notice.

You are expected to use good judgment and common sense in seeking to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations and to ask for advice when you are uncertain about them.

If you become aware of the violation of any law, rule or regulation by the Company, whether by its officers, employees or directors, it is your responsibility to promptly report the matter to your supervisor, the Company’s General Counsel. While it is the Company’s desire to address matters internally, nothing in this Code should discourage you from reporting any illegal activity, including any violation of the securities laws, antitrust laws, environmental laws or any other federal or state law, rule or regulation, to the appropriate regulatory authority. Employees, officers and directors shall not discharge, demote, suspend, threaten, harass or in any other manner discriminate against an employee because he or she in good faith reports any such violation. This Code should not be construed to prohibit you from testifying, participating or otherwise assisting in any state or federal administrative, judicial or legislative proceeding or investigation.

Conflicts of Interest


Employees, officers and directors must act in the best interests of the Company. You must refrain from engaging in any activity or having a personal interest that presents a conflict of interest. A conflict of interest occurs when your personal interest interferes, or appears to interfere, with the interests of the Company. A conflict of interest can arise whenever you, as an officer, director or employee, take action or have an interest that prevents you from performing your Company duties and responsibilities honestly, objectively and effectively.

Employees and Officers: In the following instances a conflict of interest is deemed to exist absent mitigating facts and circumstances:

where the officer or employee performs services as a consultant, employee, officer, director, advisor or in any other capacity for, or has a financial interest in, a Direct Competitor of the Company, other than services performed in the context of the officer’s or employee’s job with the Company or at the request of the Company and other than a financial interest representing less than one percent (1%) of the outstanding shares of a publicly-held company;
where the officer or employee uses his or her position with the Company to influence a transaction with a Significant Supplier or Significant Customer in which such person has any personal interest, other than a financial interest representing less than one percent (1%) of the outstanding shares of a publicly-held company;
where the officer or employee has any Close Relative who holds a financial interest in a Direct Competitor of the Company, other than an investment representing less than one percent (1%) of the outstanding shares of a publicly-held company;
where the officer or employee supervises, reviews or influences the performance evaluation or compensation of a member of his or her Immediate Family who is an employee of the Company; or
where the officer or employee engages in any other activity or has any other interest that the Board of Directors of the Company may reasonably determine to constitute a conflict of interest.


Directors: Directors must not:

perform services as a consultant, employee, officer, director, advisor or in any other capacity for, or have a financial interest in, a Direct Competitor of the Company, other than services performed at the request of the Company and other than a financial interest representing less than one percent (1%) of the outstanding shares of a publicly-held company;
have, or permit any Close Relative to have, a financial interest in a Direct Competitor of the Company, other than an investment representing less than one percent (1%) of the outstanding shares of a publicly-held company;
use their position with the Company to influence any decision of the Company relating to a contract or transaction with a Significant Supplier or Significant Customer of the Company if the director or a Close Relative of the director:
performs services as a consultant, employee, officer, director, advisor or in any other capacity for such Significant Supplier or Significant Customer; or
has a financial interest in such Significant Supplier or Significant Customer, other than an investment representing less than one percent (1%) of the outstanding shares of a publicly-held company.
directly supervise, review or influence the performance evaluation or compensation of a member of his or her Immediate Family; or
engage in any other activity or have any other interest that the Board of Directors of the Company may reasonably determine to constitute a conflict of interest.


For purposes of this Code, the following definitions apply:

“Close Relative” means a spouse, domestic partner, dependent child (including step-child or foster child) or any other person living in the same home with the employee, officer or director.

“Direct Competitor” means any commercial business entity which directly competes with one or more of the Company’s product or service lines of business representing at least 5% (five percent) of the Company’s gross annual revenues.

“Immediate Family” means a Close Relative and a parent, sibling, child (including stepchild or foster child), mother- or father-in-law, son- or daughter-in-law, or brother- or sister-in-law.

“Significant Customer” means a customer that has made during the Company’s last full fiscal year, or proposes to make during the Company’s current fiscal year, payments to the Company for property or services in excess of one (1) percent of (i) the Company’s consolidated gross revenues for its last full fiscal year or (ii) the customer’s consolidated gross revenues for its last full fiscal year.

“Significant Supplier” means a supplier to which the Company has made during the Company’s last full fiscal year, or proposes to make during the Company’s current fiscal year, payments for property or services in excess of one (1) percent of (i) the Company’s consolidated gross revenues for its last full fiscal year or (ii) the customer’s consolidated gross revenues for its last full fiscal year.

Participation in an open source project, whether maintained by the Company or by another commercial or non-commercial entity or organization does not constitute a conflict of interest even where such participant makes a determination in the interest of the project that is adverse to the Company’s interests.

The rules set forth above are threshold rules. It is your responsibility to disclose to the General Counsel any transaction or relationship that reasonably could be expected to give rise to a conflict of interest, or, if you are an officer or director, to the Chairman of the Board of Directors (or in the case of such Chairman, to the Board of Directors as a whole), who shall be responsible for determining, based on all of the facts and circumstances, whether such transaction or relationship constitutes a conflict of interest. Determinations by the General Counsel of a conflict of interest may be appealed to the Audit Committee, if any, and determinations by the Audit Committee of a conflict of interest, whether sustaining the General Counsel or made independently, may be appealed to the Board of Directors, which determination shall be final.

Upon a determination that a conflict exists, the finding party (General Counsel, Audit Committee or Board of Directors) must make an independent finding as to how the conflict of interest is to be mitigated. Mitigating actions include such measures as are reasonably certain to eliminate the conflict of interest, including, but not limited to reassignment of job duties, transfer of job assignment, termination of employment, or removal from office. All such mitigating actions are to be taken in accordance with the laws pertaining to the place of employment of the subject party, including laws governing due process and employment, and such other agreements of employment as may exist between the Company and the subject employee.

Insider Trading

It is usually illegal to buy or sell securities using material information not available to the public. Persons who give such undisclosed “inside” information to others may be as liable as persons who trade securities while possessing such information. Securities laws may be violated if you, or any relatives or friends trade in securities of the Company, or any of its customers or vendors, while possessing inside information or unpublished knowledge.  If you are uncertain about the constraints on your purchase or sale of any Company securities or the securities of any other company that you are familiar with by virtue of your relationship with the Company, you should consult with the Company’s General Counsel before making any such purchase or sale.

Confidentiality

Employees, officers and directors must maintain the confidentiality of confidential information entrusted to them by the Company or other companies, including our suppliers and customers, except when disclosure is authorized by a supervisor or legally mandated. Unauthorized disclosure of any confidential information is prohibited. Additionally, employees should take appropriate precautions to ensure that confidential or sensitive business information, whether it is proprietary to the Company or another company, is not communicated within the Company except to employees who have a need to know such information to perform their responsibilities for the Company.

Third parties may ask you for information concerning the Company. Employees, officers and directors (other than the Company’s authorized spokespersons) must not discuss internal Company matters with, or disseminate internal Company information to, anyone outside the Company, except as required in the performance of their Company duties and after an appropriate confidentiality agreement is in place. This prohibition applies particularly to inquiries concerning the Company from the media, market professionals (such as securities analysts, institutional investors, investment advisers, brokers and dealers) and security holders. All responses to inquiries on behalf of the Company must be made only by the Company’s authorized spokespersons. If you receive any inquiries of this nature, you must decline to comment and refer the inquirer to your supervisor or one of the Company’s authorized spokespersons.

You also must abide by any lawful obligations that you have to your former employer. These obligations may include restrictions on the use and disclosure of confidential information, restrictions on the solicitation of former colleagues to work at the Company and non-competition obligations.

Finally, if you are involved in conducting business in the federal, state or local government marketplace(s), you may be subject to other obligations regarding the use, disclosure, safeguarding or receipt of particular types of information, including restrictions regarding competition-sensitive information such as government source selection or contractor bid and proposal information.

Honest and Ethical Conduct and Fair Dealing

Employees, officers and directors should endeavor to deal honestly, ethically and fairly with the Company’s suppliers, customers, competitors and employees. Statements regarding the Company’s products and services must not be untrue, misleading, deceptive or fraudulent. You must not take unfair advantage of anyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged information, misrepresentation of material facts or any other unfair-dealing practice.

Protection and Proper Use of Corporate Assets

Employees, officers and directors should seek to protect the Company’s assets. Theft, carelessness and waste have a direct impact on the Company’s financial performance. Employees, officers and directors must use the Company’s assets and services solely for legitimate business purposes of the Company and not for any personal benefit or the personal benefit of anyone else.

Employees, officers and directors must advance the Company’s legitimate interests when the opportunity to do so arises. You must not take advantage of opportunities for yourself or another person that are discovered through your position with the Company or the use of property or information of, or entrusted to, the Company.

Gifts and Gratuities

The use of Company funds or assets for gifts, gratuities or other favors to Company employees is prohibited, except to the extent such gifts are in compliance with applicable law, nominal in amount and not given in consideration or expectation of any action by the recipient. Note: Payments to Company employees under bonus, commission, incentive, or other bona-fide recognition and performance plans or programs are not considered gifts under this section.

Employees, officers and directors must not accept, or permit any member of their Immediate Family to accept, any gifts, gratuities or other favors from any customer, supplier or other person doing or seeking to do business with the Company, other than items of nominal value. Any gifts that are not of nominal value should be returned immediately and reported to your supervisor. If immediate return is not practical, they should be given to the Company for charitable disposition or such other disposition as the Company believes appropriate in its sole discretion. For purposes of this policy, nominal value is considered $100 or less.

Common sense and moderation should prevail in business entertainment engaged in on behalf of the Company. Employees, officers and directors should provide, or accept, business entertainment to or from anyone doing business with the Company only if the entertainment is infrequent, modest and intended to serve legitimate business goals.

Bribes and kickbacks are criminal acts, strictly prohibited by law. You must not offer, give, solicit or receive any form of bribe or kickback anywhere in the world.

You must also abide by the often stringent laws regulating gifts and gratuities to government officials and employees.

Accuracy of Books and Records and Public Reports

Employees, officers and directors must honestly and accurately report all business transactions. You are responsible for the material accuracy of your records and reports. Accurate record keeping and reporting are essential to the Company’s ability to meet legal and regulatory obligations, including specific obligations relating to the Company’s transactions with governments and governmental entities.

All Company books, records and accounts shall be maintained in accordance with all applicable regulations and standards and accurately reflect the true nature of the transactions they record in all material respects. The financial statements of the Company shall conform in all material respects to generally accepted accounting principles and the Company’s accounting policies. No undisclosed or unrecorded account shall be established for any purpose. No false or misleading entries shall be made in the Company’s books or records for any reason, and no disbursement of corporate funds or other corporate property shall be made without adequate supporting documentation. It is the policy of the Company to provide full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and documents filed with, or submitted to, the Securities and Exchange Commission and in other public communications.

Concerns Regarding Accounting or Auditing Matters

Employees with concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters or complaints regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters may confidentially, and anonymously if they wish, submit such concerns or complaints in writing to the Chairman of the Board of Directors at the address listed below. See Reporting and Compliance Procedures. A complete record of all complaints will be prepared each fiscal quarter and reported to the Board of Directors.

The Board of Directors will evaluate the merits of any concerns or complaints received by it and authorize such follow-up actions, if any, as it deems necessary or appropriate to address the substance of the concern or complaint.

The Company will not discipline, discriminate against or retaliate against any employee who reports a complaint or concern (unless the employee is found to have knowingly and willfully made a false report).

Waivers of this Code of Business Conduct and Ethics

While some of the policies contained in this Code must be strictly adhered to and no exceptions can be allowed, in other cases exceptions may be possible. Any employee or officer who believes that an exception to any of these policies is appropriate in his or her case should first contact his or her immediate supervisor. If the supervisor agrees that an exception is appropriate, the approval of the General Counsel must be obtained. The General Counsel shall be responsible for maintaining a complete record of all requests for exceptions to any of these policies and the disposition of such requests and report such record to the Board of Directors each fiscal quarter.

Any executive officer or director who seeks an exception to any of these policies should contact the Chairman of the Board of Directors. Any waiver of this Code for executive officers or directors or any change to this Code that applies to executive officers or directors may be made only by the Board of Directors of the Company and will be disclosed as required by law or stock market regulation.

Reporting and Compliance Procedures

Every employee, officer and director has the responsibility to ask questions, seek guidance, and report suspected violations and express concerns regarding compliance with this Code.  Any employee, officer or director who knows or believes that any other employee or representative of the Company has engaged or is engaging in Company related conduct that violates applicable law or this Code should report such information to his or her supervisor, the Company’s General Counsel, as described below. You may report such conduct openly or anonymously without fear of retaliation. The Company will not discipline, discriminate against or retaliate against any employee who reports such conduct in good faith, whether or not such information is ultimately proven to be correct, or who cooperates in any investigation or inquiry regarding such conduct. Any supervisor who receives a report of a violation of this Code must immediately inform the General Counsel.

If either the General Counsel or the Chairman of the Board receives information regarding an alleged violation of this Code, he or she shall, as appropriate, (a) evaluate such information, (b) if the alleged violation involves an executive officer or a director, inform the Chief Executive Officer and Board of Directors of the alleged violation, (c) determine whether it is necessary to conduct an informal inquiry or a formal investigation and, if so, initiate such inquiry or investigation and (d) report the results of any such inquiry or investigation, together with a recommendation as to disposition of the matter, to the Board of Directors or a committee thereof. Employees, officers and directors are expected to cooperate fully with any inquiry or investigation by the Company regarding an alleged violation of this Code. Failure to cooperate with any such inquiry or investigation may result in disciplinary action, up to and including discharge.

The Company shall determine whether violations of this Code have occurred and, if so, shall determine the disciplinary measures to be taken against any employee who has violated this Code. In the event that the alleged violation involves an executive officer or a director, the Chief Executive Officer and the Board of Directors, respectively, shall determine whether a violation of this Code has occurred and, if so, shall determine the disciplinary measures to be taken against such executive officer or director.

Failure to comply with the standards outlined in this Code will result in disciplinary action including, but not limited to, reprimands, warnings, probation or suspension without pay, demotions, reduction in salary, discharge and restitution. Certain violations of this Code may require the Company to refer the matter to the appropriate governmental or regulating authorities for investigation or prosecution. Moreover, any supervisor who directs or approves of any conduct in violation of this Code, or who has knowledge of such conduct and does not immediately report it, also will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including discharge. All such disciplinary actions are to be taken in accordance with the laws pertaining to the place of employment of the subject party, including laws governing due process and employment, and such other agreements of employment as may exist between the Company and the subject employee.

Law Enforcement


Whether you’re a small law enforcement agency or a large metro PD, determining a course of action in an expeditionary manner will amplify your effectiveness and strengthen capability in a dynamic environment.  Our UAS can provide law enforcement with rapid employment and up to 40 minutes of awareness through a bird’s eye view of real-time situations, to enhance resolve. UAS Deploy is an all in one platform enclosed in a Military Spec case, which is easily transportable. It utilizes Vertical Take-off and Landing (VTOL) capabilities and improved ease of use by utilizing a tablet or cell phone. Applications include: Search and Rescue (SAR); Pre and Post Accident or Crime Scene Investigation; Explosive Ordinance and Bomb Disposal; Narcotics Investigation; and Hazmat Incidents.




 




Emergency Responders




Ground based fixed cameras and the extended time to attain an ‘eye in the sky’, inhibit our first responders to understand the situation and capability of an offender. Our UAS system places the advantage back into the decision maker’s eyes. Custom lenses and the ability to change the perspective, add tremendous value to enable apprehension and closure to an unfortunate situation. Crime scene and accident investigation aerial images provided by UAS Drone Corp., enhance overall understanding, at a value that is unmeasurable.




 
















Security


UAS Drone Corp. offers the Security sector new capabilities that can reduce cost and operational risk, while improving efficiency. Utilizing Vertical Take-off and Landing (VTOL), our UAS can be used effectively to monitor ship yards, power plants and valuable storage lots. Security companies require real-time information and imagery about the situation in order to make informed decisions. UAS Drone Corp. provide a means of collecting important information more quickly than a ground-based crew, reducing the time and number of personnel required to assess a breach in security and dispatch personnel to provide containment.

OUR HISTORY

 




UAS Drone Corp was founded by former Marine Corp experts in the field of Commercial Unmanned Aerial Systems.


The founders, former US Marine Corp Master Sergeant UAS Pilots and lead instructors of Marine and Naval UAS operations and platforms, both stateside and abroad, were expert platform engineers, mission planners and operators during their respective tenures.



 




After completion of military service, they observed a gap in the commercial UAS market which led to the inception of UAS Drone Corp. The underlining principle of UAS Drone Corp is to provide an extremely efficient commercial grade UAS, at a price point below current market platforms, while ensuring maximum capabilities and safety.


Experience and ingenuity together have leveraged success with UAS split site operations, relief on station, dual operations, video/imagery dissemination and overall platform development.

About

 








UAS READY-TO-FLY

ADVANCED FEATURES

Systems come armed with a brushless gimbal mounted GoPro providing the user with maximum flexibility to view, capture and manipulate unprecedented aerial video, and a DX7s Spektrum for information on battery voltage, signal quality, engine or motor temperature, airspeed, altitude and more.

 


“The base platform is our UAS product line, which is pound for pound the most efficient, stable and cost effective unmanned platform in the market today. Enforcing strength and efficiency in its multiple applications is the primary focus in developing the UAS. Ultimately, ergonomics are improved by way of operating through tablets and/or smartphones, which reduces training time

 


and enhances operator confidence. Failsafe safety features have been pre-programmed to reduce the possibility of platform loss. The UAS battery voltage monitoring, adjustable geo-fencing restrictions and operator distress will activate a return to launch automatic flight mode, where the platform will maintain current altitude, return home and land by itself.”
