Additionally, Mr. Dick held a number of positions at Linens 'n Things from 1993 to 2006, including Vice President, Controller and Treasurer.  He is a certified public accountant, and will be responsible for the finance organization, investor relations, and information technology.  Mr. Dick will report to Julian R.

Mr. Geiger continued, "We are thrilled to have someone of David's caliber join Aeropostale as Chief Financial Officer.  David's extensive financial and retail experience will support and facilitate our corporate goals as we navigate through this important juncture in Aeropostale's history.  We expect a seamless transition as Marc assists David during his first few months at Aeropostale."
UPDATES FOURTH QUARTER 2014 OUTLOOK
In conjunction with today's announcement, the Company also announced certain preliminary and unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.  
For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, net sales decreased 11% to $594.5 million, from $670.0 million in the year ago period. Comparable sales, including the e-commerce channel, for the fourth quarter decreased by 9%, compared to a 15% decrease last year.
Based on better than expected sales, margins, and expense management for the month of January, the Company now expects an operating (loss)/profit for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 in the range of approximately ($2.0) to $2.0 million, which translates to a net loss in the range of approximately ($0.06) to ($0.01) per diluted share based on the Company's originally estimated tax rate of approximately 4.0%. This revised outlook compares to the Company's previously issued guidance of operating losses in the range of ($18.0) to ($23.0) million, which translated to a net loss in the range of approximately ($0.25) to ($0.31) per diluted share.  This earnings guidance does not include the impact of any asset impairments, real estate consulting fees, lease buyout costs, severance, other accelerated store closure costs or restructuring costs.
Mr. Geiger continued, "I am encouraged with the progress we are making and that we were able to deliver higher comparable sales and margins in January, which allowed us to exceed our updated guidance.  With today's announced executive appointments, we are returning to an organizational structure that existed when Aeropostale registered its most significant gains in sales and profitability.  As a result of this progress and of the changes we are making, I believe we are better positioned to restore the luster of the Aeropostale brand and our overall financial results, as we continue to navigate through a challenging retail environment."
The Company expects to announce fourth quarter and fiscal 2014 earnings results on Thursday, March 12, 2015 at 4:15 PM (EST).

Are Organizations Doing Enough to Improve Customer Satisfaction
Time-to-market pressure can diminish product testing time and quality. The results are product recalls, shoddy merchandise, and apologies by CEOs about poor quality. The consequence is the loss of consumer confidence. Don’t these companies realise that there’s no compromise on quality? I’m sure that these companies are ISO 9000 certified or have a Total Quality Management (TQM) program, so what is the problem? Perhaps the problem is not with ISO 9000 or TQM but with the way it is used.Dick, David J. and Shelby Rosiak. Usability Interface (2000). Articles>Usability>Assessment>ISO 9000
2.#11752
Are You Satisfied with Online Shopping?
How many of you use the Internet to order merchandise? Many consumers are choosing the Internet to order merchandise rather than brave the crowds and traffic snarls at shopping malls. I don’t know if you have noticed it, but the order process and ease of use varies from one web site to another. The often-confusing process is enough to make you bail out and shop elsewhere. According to an article in the Wall Street Journal, 'E-tailers Try to Keep Shoppers From Bolting at Checkout Point,' (1) usability, technology, and e-commerce issues are stopping shoppers from completing their purchases. The article states that about 65% of shoppers bail out at the checkout point. Poor design has cost E-tailers over $6.1 billion in potential sales.Dick, David J. Usability Interface (2001).

Breaking into Government IT Contracting  
When I was preparing my transition from employment in Belgium to employment in northern Virginia, friends encouraged me to look at opportunities as an information technology (IT) contractor for the federal government, which relies on contractors to design and deliver IT solutions. For this reason, many companies that build and sell IT systems have entered the lucrative market of outsourcing employees.Since May 2005, I have been employed by four contracting companies and worked at several government agencies. When I started working as a contractor, I discovered that very little is written about the ins and outs of contracting. What I learned came from friends and associates, and their advice helped me understand how to be successful.Dick, David J. Intercom (2010). Careers>Freelance>Government>Consulting

Convincing the Skeptics
People unfamiliar with usability think that it's cosmetic and can be combined with other phases of development when time is available. It's often difficult to educate them, especially if they are more senior than you are and consider it a waste of time. They will not be convinced by statistics from anywhere other than outside the organization. What should you do next? You may be able to say something like 'It seems your only objection is [whatever], so if we can resolve this issue, do you have any other reasons why we shouldn't do usability testing?' This way, you have their agreement to do usability just as soon as you have resolved the issue.   Dick, David J. Usability Interface (1999). Careers>Usability>Management

Creating Standards and Strategies
I have been asked to document the standards and strategies of usability. Given my company's interest to achieve ISO 9000 certification, I thought of the benefits to have a standard and strategy that conform to an ISO standard. My research led to two standards, ISO 13407 and ISO 9241, which have become invaluable to me. Dick, David J. Usability Interface (1998). Articles>Usability>Standards>ISO 9000

Documents That No Project Cannot Be Without
Short deadlines force project teams to quickly design, test, and release the product with little or no design documentation. If these documents are written, they generally are not well-written and are not comprehensive. The fact of the matter is that most project teams do not have enough staff to design the product, let alone write and manage documentation. This situation creates an ideal opportunity for technical writers to assist the project team in more ways than writing a user guide.Dick, David J. Carolina Communique (2008).

Don't Get Angry
An article in the Washington Post, June 7, 1999, called Terminal Tantrums; 'Computer Rage' Is Widespread, a Study of Users Concludes describes research out of Britain, that we were among the victims of Technology Related Anxiety (TRA), specifically, 'computer rage.' The study reported high levels of PC-related abuse by colleagues 'as a result of frustration' with information technology. The abuses included 'swearing at their PC,' kicking it, and 'bullying the IT department'. Dick, David J. Usability Interface (1999). Articles>Technology>Usability
12.#11826
Getting Started With Usability
Practical experience and training helps me to go beyond usability fundamentals. I have learned about usability from books, news groups on the Internet, and university courses. Putting usability to practice means applying the lessons I have learned to small projects that have minimal impact on systems and services, but provide me with an opportunity to gain experience.

Giveaways to Thank Helpful Users--What's Best?

Review: GUI Bloopers 2.0: Common User Interface Design DON'Ts and DO's
GUI Bloopers 2.0 describes common user-interface mistakes found in today's software products and services, and provides design rules and guidelines to avoid them. Johnson describes the design decisions that lead to misuse of controls, poor navigation, prose-riddled labels, bad design and layout, faulty interaction, and poor responsiveness. GUI Bloopers 2.0 is well illustrated with hundreds of examples from real products and online services, and stories from his own experience.Dick, David J. Usability Interface (2007).

How Critical Reading and Thinking Can Enhance Your Writing
Whether you create documents from multiple sources or from original work, you should follow a discipline of understanding what you read by that I mean checking sources, and verifying currency and accuracy of information with subject matter experts.

How to Encourage Good Use of SharePoint
Many organizations are adopting Microsoft SharePoint as a content management system, and view it as a low-cost alternative to a high-end content management system. However, just because an organization has SharePoint, does not mean that everyone is aware it is available. Dick, David J. Carolina Communique (2011).

inHow to Win User Acceptance and Influence Change 
As technical writers, we do not drive user acceptance, but we can influence it by writing about a system’s new features and functions, providing training, and answering users’ questions. I believe we can do a little more to help win user acceptance if we understand the challenges users face when confronted with change.Dick, David J. Carolina Communique (2013).

Innovations in Card Sorting
Creating a product that has a logical information structure is critical to the success of the product. A good structure helps users find information and accomplish their tasks with ease. Card sorting is one method that can help us understand how users think the information and navigation should be within a product.Dick, David J. Usability Interface (2007).

Is it Time to Upgrade?
How many times has a vendor’s help desk operator told you that the  solution to a problem is either an upgrade or a patch? Those of us in the  IT industry are familiar with this reply because that’s the advice our  own helpdesk operators tell our customers. If corporate profits depend on  improving product design, and selling upgrades, there is no profit in  supporting old software and creating patches. The profit is in selling new  and improved products. Some questions you need to consider before buying a software upgrade.Dick, David J. Usability Interface (2004). Articles>Management>Software

Justification for Documentation Testing
Is documentation testing a part of your production process? If not, don't you think that it should be? Generally, Technical Writers work to tight schedules, which often does not include documentation testing because there is no time. Besides, who wants to take the risk of causing a rewrite or correcting product design and not shipping on schedule? Nobody! What is needed is a justification for including documentation testing in the production schedule. In 'Liability for Defective Documentation,' Cem Kaner provides valuable justification for documentation testing to ensure quality. Bad documentation, he says, has a ripple effect on the number of users it impacts such as Product Development, Training, and Customer Support.Dick, David J. Usability Interface (2000).

Review: Paper Prototyping: The Fast and Easy Way to Design and  Refine User Interfaces
If you want to learn about paper prototyping from a renowned  practitioner then I highly recommend Paper Prototyping by Carolyn  Snyder. Snyder advocates paper prototyping because it’s easy to design  (requires minimal drawing skills), cheap to create (needs only paper and  markers), and offers and opportunity for developers and users to evaluate  design concepts. If you wonder where the beginning of the design process  starts, it begins when great minds meet and brainstorm ideas, and drawing  is a natural approach to illustrate them.Dick, David J. Usability Interface (2004). Resources>Reviews>Workflow
25.#28584
Review: The Persona Lifecycle: Keeping People in Mind Throughout Product Design
The Persona Lifecycle describes the value of personas, and offers detailed techniques and tools to conceive, create, communicate, and use personas to create [great] product designs. John Pruitt and Tamara Adlin provide examples, samples, and illustrations for persona practitioners to imitate and model. It is important to emphasize that the use of personas is a method that compliments other user-centered design techniques, including user testing, scenario-based design, and cognitive walkthroughs.Dick, David J. Usability Interface (2007). Articles>Reviews>User Centered Design>Personas
