SCI Engineered Materials, Inc. Announces Joint Project to Evaluate Replacement Materials for CIGS Thin Film Solar Products

COLUMBUS, OH--(Marketwired - Jun 28, 2017) -  SCI Engineered Materials, Inc. ("SCI") (OTCQB: SCIA), a global supplier and manufacturer of advanced materials for physical vapor deposition thin film applications that works closely with end users and OEMs to develop innovative, customized solutions, today announced it has entered into a joint project with Case Western Reserve in their Summer Undergraduate Research in Energy and Sustainability program.
The goal of this project is to measure the band gaps and work function of several materials currently being developed by SCI through in-house R&D activities. Specifically, Case Western Reserve will evaluate test films to determine if SCI's materials have superior properties to replace Cadmium Sulfide and/or intrinsic Zinc Oxide in Copper Indium Gallium Selenide ("CIGS") thin film solar products. Band gaps and work functions impact the electrical conversion efficiency of CIGS solar cells. This project is expected to be completed during the third quarter of 2017. Successful evaluation of these materials is anticipated to enhance their market adoption.
Jing Yang PhD., SCI's Senior Product Development Engineer, stated, "Based on our current research and the outcome of data to be confirmed by Case Western Reserve, SCI may be able to offer replacement materials with competitive advantages of a wider band gap than Cadmium Sulfide to CIGS thin film solar cell manufacturers. In addition to superior electrical conversion efficiencies, solar cell manufacturers will be able to label their product Cadmium free which is especially important during the manufacture of solar cells and recycling this toxic material."
About SCI Engineered Materials, Inc.

SCI Engineered Materials, Inc. Announces Joint Project to Evaluate Replacement Materials for CIGS Thin Film Solar Products 








06/28/2017










































COLUMBUS, OH--(Marketwired - Jun 28, 2017) -  SCI Engineered Materials, Inc. ("SCI") (OTCQB: SCIA), a global supplier and manufacturer of advanced materials for physical vapor deposition thin film applications that works closely with end users and OEMs to develop innovative, customized solutions, today announced it has entered into a joint project with Case Western Reserve in their Summer Undergraduate Research in Energy and Sustainability program.
The goal of this project is to measure the band gaps and work function of several materials currently being developed by SCI through in-house R&D activities. Specifically, Case Western Reserve will evaluate test films to determine if SCI's materials have superior properties to replace Cadmium Sulfide and/or intrinsic Zinc Oxide in Copper Indium Gallium Selenide ("CIGS") thin film solar products. Band gaps and work functions impact the electrical conversion efficiency of CIGS solar cells. This project is expected to be completed during the third quarter of 2017. Successful evaluation of these materials is anticipated to enhance their market adoption.
Jing Yang PhD., SCI's Senior Product Development Engineer, stated, "Based on our current research and the outcome of data to be confirmed by Case Western Reserve, SCI may be able to offer replacement materials with competitive advantages of a wider band gap than Cadmium Sulfide to CIGS thin film solar cell manufacturers. In addition to superior electrical conversion efficiencies, solar cell manufacturers will be able to label their product Cadmium free which is especially important during the manufacture of solar cells and recycling this toxic material."[Native Advertisement]

Company History - SCI Engineered Materials


















































 

SCI Engineered MaterialsThe SCIence of Engineered Materials

You are here: Home / Company HistoryCompany History



The late Dr. Edward Funk, Sc.D., and his late wife Ingeborg founded Superconductive Components, Inc., in 1987. Dr. Funk, formerly a Professor of Metallurgy at The Ohio State University and a successful entrepreneur, envisioned significant market potential for the newly discovered High Temperature Superconductivity (HTS) material YBCO (Tc of 90° K). The Company’s first product was a 99.999% pure, co-precipitated YBCO 1-2-3 powder. Over the years the Company expanded its product line by adding other High Tc Powders, sintered shapes, single crystal substrates, and non-superconducting sputtering targets.
In 1989 Superconductive Components Inc. became a publicly held company and currently trades under the symbol SCIA. The stock continues to trade under this symbol on the OTCQB exchange. Superconductive Components Inc. opened a subdivision, Target Materials Inc. (TMI), in 1991 to supply the increasing worldwide demand for sputtering and laser ablation targets. TMI became a full service manufacturer of high performance thin film materials, providing a wide selection of metals, ceramics, and alloys for sputtering targets, evaporation sources, and other PVD applications. TMI served the R&D as well as the Industrial and Decorative Coating markets. During this time, TMI began to manufacture targets for the Photovoltaic, Flat Panel Display, and Semiconductor industries.
In July of 2002 the Company’s two divisions, Superconductive Components Inc. and Target Materials Inc., were merged. The resulting Company operates under the name SCI Engineered Materials™. The Company began to manufacture complex ceramic, metal, and alloy products for the thin film battery, photovoltaic, media storage, flat panel display, semiconductor, electronic, and photonic industries.
By 2004, the Company needed more space for its growing business, but desired to remain in Columbus, Ohio. Central Ohio is a regional center for materials science expertise due to the presence of The Ohio State University, Case Western Reserve University, the University of Toledo, Battelle Memorial Institute, Edison Welding Institute, NASA-Lewis, the Air Force Research Laboratory, and EMTEC. Other local organizations supporting material science endeavors include The American Ceramic Society, the Orton Foundation, Chemical Abstracts, and OCLC. As a result, the company relocated to a nearby facility with 32,000 ft2 of manufacturing and office space.
In 2017, SCI Engineered Materials™ received ISO 9001:2015 registration and had ISO 9001:2000 registration dating back to 2005.
Throughout its history, the Company has conducted funded research primarily under grants from entities such as the Department of Energy, the National Science Foundation, NASA, and the Ohio Department of Development. These activities are generally limited to funded research that is consistent with the Company’s focus on commercial applications in its principal markets.
Over the past three decades, the Company has developed considerable expertise in the development and ramp-up manufacturing of novel materials. Today, SCI Engineered Materials™’ serves a diverse base of domestic and multi-national corporations, universities, and leading research institutions. SCI Engineered Materials™ actively seeks to partner with organizations to provide solutions for difficult material challenges.
On August 22, 2007 the Company’s shareholders approved the change of the corporate name to SCI Engineered Materials, Inc. It is consistent with the name that has been used in the Company’s marketing since 2003 and is integral to current corporate branding activities. It also reflects the Company’s transformation to a more diversified manufacturer of ceramic and metal sputtering targets as well as other industrial applications from a company founded to develop high temperature superconductive materials.

Placing an Order with SCI Engineered Materials™
 
Due to the very technical nature of our products, SCI requires that all orders be placed IN WRITING. This allows the customer to communicate their complete specification, eliminating misunderstandings. In cases where SCI has generated a written quote, we can begin an order after receipt of a purchase order number with the appropriate quote reference. However, we still require a written purchase order. Please fax written purchase orders to (614) 486-0912 for faster processing.
Order Confirmation
All orders placed with SCI will be confirmed in writing prior to shipment. Order Acknowledgements contain critical information; the material, specification, and expected ship date. SCI makes every effort to fax the Order Acknowledgement to the end user or the purchasing authority, if applicable, within 5 business days. For orders that are placed based on our written quote, and for which SCI has not received a written purchase order, we require a signature on our Sales Order Acknowledgment prior to shipment. This confirms that our Sales Order correctly reflects the customer’s specifications and expectations.
Terms of Sale
Our minimum order is $150.00. Our standard payment terms are Net 30 (after shipment). We typically prepay and add shipping and insurance charges to the final customer invoice. All sales are made EXW (Ex Works) our dock unless other arrangements have been made in writing prior to shipment. Our carrier of choice is United Parcel Service (UPS), but we use other carriers, as specified by the purchasing authority. Shipping insurance is added to your invoice based on the value of the product.
Please also note the following Terms of Sale, also sent with our Order Acknowledgement.
The seller shall not be liable for any failure to perform or for any delay in the delivery or shipment of products, or for any damage suffered by the buyer for the following reasons; earthquakes, fires, floods, acts of God, accidents, riots, war, government interferences, strike, shortages of labor or materials, inadequate transportation facilities or any other causes beyond seller’s control.
Date of shipment is based on seller’s best judgement and is subject to conditions beyond its reasonable control; any such shipment date cannot be guaranteed.
Cancellations shall be by mutual agreement in writing based on any adjustment necessary to cover seller’s labor expended and material procured, processed or partly processed.
Specification changes made subsequent to placing an order are subject to price revisions and to any adjustment necessary to cover material procured and processed and any labor expended prior to receipt of revised specifications.
No claims made for shortage or damage will be considered unless made in writing within fifteen days after receipt of material and accompanied by reference to customer’s purchase order number.
Upon written notice by seller issued Returned Materials Request (RMR) and upon return of goods only; not later than thirty days after receipt of material by buyer, seller will at its option, repair, replace, or credit any material which is not in accordance with the specifications set forth in the buyer’s purchase order, as accepted by seller. SELLER ASSUMES NO LIABILITY OR CLAIM FOR EXPENSES OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE USE AND/OR SALE OF SAID PRODUCT.
No liability is assumed for infringement of any patents held by others.
Seller represents that, with respect to the production of goods or services covered on any order, it has fully complied with the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 as amended.
Seller reserves the right to revise any price quoted, without notice to buyer, at any time prior to acceptance of buyer’s order by seller, provided that all such original or revised prices shall not exceed the maximum prices permitted under applicable government regulations, if any.
Some shipments of precious metal cannot be made via truck or rail. In such instances and unless otherwise instructed, the order for such metals will be shipped via express or parcel post. Shipments of other material will be by a carrier at seller’s discretion unless otherwise specified by buyer. In any event, the risk after shipment leaves seller’s plant shall be on buyer.
Metal prices quoted by seller and/or shown on orders as received from buyer are subject to change in accordance with metal markets on the day order is shipped, except where specifically confirmed to a fixed price by written agreement. Prices are based on fabricated markets as published by Engelhard industries of American Metal Market as appropriate.
Materials are sold to accepted industry and manufacturing variations or tolerances, except where otherwise agreed to by both parties.
Materials are shipped to buyer FOB seller’s plant. Seller is not responsible for goods lost or damaged in transit and consequently buyer should immediately notify the carrier in writing of such.
In addition to any other legal remedy, if buyer fails to fulfill the terms of payments, seller may defer further shipments or may at its option, cancel the un-shipped balance. Seller reserves the right, previous to making any shipments, to require from buyer, satisfactory security for performance of buyer’s obligations.
All sales contracts become effective only when the buyer’s order, specifications and terms of payment are approved and accepted in writing by the home office of seller. The material will be shipped as indicated on seller’s factory acknowledgment copy of buyers order, which the buyer receives. Unless buyer notifies seller of any exception to the acknowledgement immediately after its receipt, the order as acknowledged shall constitute an agreement between both parties.
Special Requests
