AdvancePierre Foods Mourns the Loss of Board Member Margaret M. 
      Cannella






November 29, 2016 12:00 PM Eastern Standard Time



CINCINNATI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Margaret M. Cannella, a Director of AdvancePierre Foods Holdings (NYSE: 
      APFH), passed away on November 24, 2016. Cannella began serving as a 
      Director of AdvancePierre in 2008, following its acquisition by a fund 
      managed by Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. (“Oaktree”).
    


      “Margaret was an original board member when we acquired Pierre Foods in 
      late 2008 and helped to guide the company through recapitalizations, 
      acquisitions and, ultimately, an Initial Public Offering in July 2016. 
      She played an integral part in the success of this company and will be 
      greatly missed by all of us,” said Matthew Wilson, Director of 
      AdvancePierre and Co-Portfolio Manager at Oaktree.
    

      “Margaret was a true industry icon. We are so fortunate Margaret lent 
      her insights and talents to the AdvancePierre Board, serving as a 
      steadfast champion of the business for the past eight years,” said Dean 
      Hollis, Chairman of the Board. “Our thoughts and prayers are with her 
      family and friends during this difficult time.”
    

      Gary L. Perlin, a Director and member of the Audit Committee of the 
      Company's Board of Directors, will serve as interim Chair of the Audit 
      Committee in addition to the other positions he currently holds.
    

About Margaret M. Cannella


      Cannella was an Adjunct Professor in the Heilbrunn Center for Value 
      Investing at Columbia Business School where she taught courses in 
      leveraged financing and credit markets. In 2009, after 30 years in 
      investment banking in the U.S., Europe and Asia, Cannella retired from 
      JPMorgan Chase & Co. as Managing Director and Head of Global Credit 
      Research. She previously served as Head of U.S. Equity and Credit 
      Research at JPMorgan. In these roles, she was a member of the operating 
      committee for global markets, chaired JPMorgan’s capital market strategy 
      function and represented JPMorgan on regulatory and self-regulatory 
      bodies. Prior to joining JPMorgan in 1998, Cannella was a Managing 
      Director at Citigroup Inc., and ultimately responsible for Global 
      Research. In addition to her role on AdvancePierre’s Board of Directors, 
      Cannella served on the Board of Directors of Watford Re Ltd., an 
      affiliate of Arch Capital Group Ltd., and functioned as an independent 
      trustee of the Schroder Funds. She had previously served on the Board of 
      Directors of Avolon Aircraft Holdings, Inc., and was a member of the 
      Wilshire Mutual Funds, where she chaired the investment 
      committee. Cannella earned an undergraduate degree from Princeton 
      University in East Asian Studies and an M.B.A. degree in Finance from 
      Columbia Business School.
