                                Report abuseTranscript of Front Crawl Propulsion - Deep Catch or Scull?Front Crawl Propulsion - Deep Catch or Scull?BackgroundTechnique BreakdownDeep Catch TechniqueDeep Catch TechniqueIn deep catch, the arm enters the water with the elbows locked (or nearly locked) and palms perpendicular to the plane of swimming.To generate propulsion, the arm is then pulled straight back through and against as much water as possible.Success within the sport of swimming, and in this particular case, front crawl, is attributed to the successful employment and combination of genetic and technical factors. Of these many factors, one in particular remains a source of fairly constant controversy - hand movement through the pulling phase of front crawl.IntroductionLimited information about either technique prior to mid/late 1960s - early 1970s.Prior to this point, deep catch is the preferred method of pulling during front crawlSculling technique was developed in 1960s by James Counsilman, Indiana University swim coach at the time (Carter, 2012)."He argued that the lift force it generated was more effective at producing thrust than the drag force employed by deep catch.(Carter 2012)"After this, sculling became the preferential method of pulling during front crawl, steadily increasing in popularity until peaking in the late 1990s.Post 2000, teaching preference shifted back in the direction of the deep catch with some qualifications.Technique Breakdown Cont...Sculling TechniqueSculling TechniqueIn the sculling technique, the swimmer's arm is bent at the elbow as the hand enters the water.During the pull phase, the elbow stays bent and the hand carves out an elongated "S" shape to generate lift as the arm pulls back against and through the water.This method is thought to generate most of its thrust through lift forces as the hand has significant motion perpendicular to plane of swimming.Modern ThoughtAfter the late 1990s, a slow shift in in teaching trends within swimming began to take place.Until recently, there has been a lack of comparative information to analyze regarding the differences in lift and drag forces generated by each pulling technique.Shortly before the 2012 London Olympics, Johns Hopkins mechanical engineering professor Rajat Mittal conducted an investigation to determine which technique, if either, is more effective at generating propulsive thrust (von Loebbecke & Mittal, 2012).Mittal's InvestigationMittal and a team of researchers used underwater video footage of two olympic level swimmers as well as laser scans of an arm with computer animations to produce a model that would investigate the effects of lift and drag forces on thrust within each respective pull style (von Loebbecke & Mittal, 2012).Professor Mittal briefly explains his findings...A Short VideoSo to summarize....Mittal first finds that contrary to accepted notions, lift force generates most of the propulsive thrust in both styles of pull.Mittal's findings also suggest that the Deep Catch style of pull is more effective at producing propulsive thrust (the investigation noted almost 50% more thrust produced).Lastly, his findings indicate that "not only does pronounced sculling not increase the contribution of lift forces on the hand to overall thrust, it decreases the contribution of drag forces to thrust. Consequently, pronounced sculling seems to reduce the effectiveness of the arm pull. (von Loebbecke & Mittal, 2012)"Qualifications...Though Mittal's findings are generally accepted to be valid, it seems to be conditionally dependent.Because of the increased energy cost requirement of a deep catch pull, it is generally accepted that this style of swimming is not entirely acceptable in longer distance events.Sculling also seems to reduce drag through reduction of frontal area while pulling.Because of these, elite swimmers often utilize a combination of the two pull styles to accomplish the most effective performance in swims over a certain distance (generally considered 100-200m).This also seems to be true of elite-level open water swimmers.Summary of Key PointsEarly technique concentrated on using the deep catch style of pull to maximize thrust generation of the arms duringthe pull-down phase of the front crawl stroke.With the advent of Counsilman's method and argument in the late 1960s, a distinct shift towards the sculling method of pull was observed.After peaking in the late 90s, this trend declined back towards the usage of a deep catch style of pull, especially within shorter-distance, enclosed swimming events.Mittal's findings prior to 2012 London Olympics indicate that a deep catch is more effective than sculling at producing lift and drag based propulsion at a cost of greater energy expenditure.Works CitedCarter, Beth.
