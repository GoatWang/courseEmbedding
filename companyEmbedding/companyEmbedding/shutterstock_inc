History[edit]
Founding and early years (2003-2011)[edit]
Shutterstock was founded in 2003 by American entrepreneur and computer programmer Jon Oringer.[16] Creating his own online marketplace,[4] Oringer initially uploaded 30,000 of his own stock photos and made them available via subscription,[4] with unlimited downloads and a monthly starting fee of USD $49.[4] When demand exceeded his photo supply,[4] he became an agent[17] and began hiring additional contributors.[4] Helping pioneer the subscription based microstock photography business model,[17] Shutterstock claimed that it was the "largest subscription-based stock photo agency in the world" as of 2006, with 570,000 images in its collection.[18] Shutterstock branched into film in 2006 with the launch of Shutterstock Footage,[18] and by 2007, the company had 1.8 million photos.[7] Insight Venture Partners invested in the company that year.[4] Shutterstock expanded beyond subscriptions into a la carte pricing in August 2008, with its "On Demand" service removing daily download limits.[8]
On September 23, 2009, Shutterstock announced that it had purchased Bigstock, a rival credit-based microstock photography agency.[11] Fast Company argued the deal put "Shutterstock on a competitive playing field with Getty, whose iStockPhoto is also credit-based."[19] Shutterstock's CEO Jon Oringer stated the addition would "enable Shutterstock to better satisfy the diverse payment preferences of stock photo buyers worldwide."[11] Shutterstock had 11 million royalty-free stock images by early 2010.[20] In February 2011, Shutterstock announced a two-year partnership with the American Institute of Graphic Arts (AIGA) to provide creative inspiration to its members.[21] Claiming it licensed more images than "any other brand worldwide" in 2011,[21] that November Shutterstock debuted Shutterstock for iPad, which it provided for free.[22]
Acquisitions and IPO (2012-2013)[edit]
With 200 million licensed image downloads as of February 2012,[23] by April 2012 the company had 18 million royalty-free stock images,[20] which grew to 19 million the following month.[24] Shutterstock Images LLC announced the Shutterstock Instant tool in May 2012, which displayed images in an interlocking mosaic to increase viewing speed.[25] Shutterstock Instant was launched under the auspices of the newly formed Shutterstock Labs, which develops tools and interfaces for Shutterstock, among other projects.[25][26] Also in May 2012, Shutterstock filed for an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange, which it completed on October 17, 2012 under the ticker SSTK.[9][10] In November 2012, Shutterstock debuted a universal iOS application meant for iPhone and iPad, among other devices.[27]
Shutterstock, Inc. announced Spectrum, a new "image discovery tool," in March 2013.[26] At the time, Shutterstock had 24 million licensable photos, vectors and illustrations in its portfolio.[26] Shutterstock launched Skillfeed in June 2013, a subscription-based online marketplace to connect the creators of instructional videos with consumers.[28] In August 2013, Shutterstock and Facebook announced a partnership to integrate Shutterstock's library within Facebook's Ad Creator, allowing advertisers to select from Shutterstock's images when creating ads.[29] At the time, Shutterstock was available in 20 languages including Thai, Korean, French, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, German, Russian, Chinese, and Japanese.[30]
Offset and new partnerships (2013-2014)[edit]
In September 2013, Shutterstock launched Offset, marketplace prioritizing high end curated photos from established artists.[31] A few months later, it launched its first Android app.[32] In October 2013, Shutterstock opened offices in Berlin, Germany.[33] At the time, Shutterstock stated it served 750,000 customers, with 30 percent of those customers in Europe.[33] Shutterstock's shares had reached a $2.5 billion market value by the fall of 2013,[4] while revenue for 2013 was USD $235 million.[34]
In March 2014, Shutterstock acquired Webdam, a provider of online digital asset management software.[12] Also in March 2014, Shutterstock relocated its headquarters to the Empire State Building.[35] In May 2014, Shutterstock and Salesforce partnered to integrate Shutterstock's image library into Salesforce's Social Studio.[36] Shutterstock debuted its Palette tool in July 2014, a "multi-color image discovery tool."[37] Shutterstock announced it had surpassed 2 million video clips on September 2, 2014.[38] Shortly afterwards it revealed a new app meant to help contributors with uploading and categorizing photos.[39] Shutterstock's revenue was $328 million in 2014, an increase of 39% from 2013.[16] In 2014, Shutterstock paid "over $83 million to its roughly 80,000 contributors."[16]
Recent developments (2015-2016)[edit]
In January 2015, Shutterstock acquired both Rex Features, Europe's largest independent photo press agency, and PremiumBeat, a stock music and sound effects service.[13] The Rex acquisition was estimated at $33 million,[40] while PremiumBeat was purchased for $32 million.[13] Penske Media Corporation formed a partnership with Shutterstock in June 2015 to create and license entertainment and fashion images. According to the terms of the deal, by 2016 Shutterstock would have an exclusive right and license to PMC's archive,[14] which included magazines such as Variety, Women's Wear Daily,[40] and Deadline.[16] Crain's wrote that with the partnership, "Shutterstock, a provider of stock imagery and music tracks, is stepping into the world of red carpets and fashion runways—and taking a key provider of fashion and entertainment photos and video away from archrival Getty Images."[40]
By March 2016, the company had "over 100,000 contributors," with around 70 million images and 4 million video clips available for licensing and sale.[6] That month Shutterstock announced it would be distributing material from the Associated Press in the United States, with the deal to last 3 years and cover 30 million photos and around 2 million videos. The photos were expected to go live in April.[6] According to Entrepreneur, Shutterstock also had an "active customer base of 1.4 million people in 150 countries."[15]
Facilities and staff[edit]
Shutterstock is headquartered in New York City's Silicon Alley. In October 2013 Shutterstock opened its new European headquarters in Berlin, Germany in the Kulturbrauerei,[33] and by March 2014, Shutterstock had additional offices in Amsterdam, Chicago, Denver, London, Montréal, Paris and San Francisco.[33] After maintaining its New York headquarters for years in a Wall Street office,[4] in March 2014 Shutterstock relocated into the Empire State Building.[35] According to Inc., the office was selected with the goal of decreasing commute times for New York employees.[35] The new location was built with no private offices, instead with 23 "pop-in rooms" for private meetings and conferences when needed.[35]
After its founding in 2003 with CEO Jon Oringer as the sole employee, by 2007 Shutterstock had grown to 30 people. In 2010 Oringer hired Thilo Semmelbauer as COO, who had previously worked with TheLadders.com and Weight Watchers.[4] With 295 employees as of October 2013,[4] that had grown to 700 employees as of 2016.[2] In 2014, Fast Company published an article featuring Shutterstock as an example of a successful "intrapreneur"-reliant company, touting the company's "hackathons" for fostering staff creativity. Explains Fast Company, "the most obvious benefit of intrapreneurship is the ability to pursue more opportunities, allowing Shutterstock to test boundaries and experiment with offshoot products that can keep their core consumer base from turning to a competitor for their needs."[41]
Business model[edit]
Shutterstock licenses media for online download on behalf of photographers, designers, illustrators, videographers and musicians,[4] maintaining a library of around 90 million royalty-free stock photos, vector graphics, and illustrations.[42] Shutterstock also has around 4 million video clips and music clips in its portfolio.[38] While Shutterstock currently has several payment models, The Atlantic wrote in 2012 that Shutterstock "pioneered the subscription approach to stock photo sales, allowing customers to download images in bulk rather than à la carte."[24] The Atlantic further wrote that Shutterstock is "a web community in the manner of a Facebook or a Twitter or a Pinterest, with its value relying almost entirely on the enthusiasms of its contributors."[24]


"Shutterstock is e-commerce with a twist, and its success depends on its contributors' ability to predict, and then provide, products that its subscribers will want to buy."


— The Atlantic (May 18, 2012)[24]


With potential contributors able to apply to the site for free,[16] Shutterstock has a team of reviewers "charged with ensuring editorial consistency and quality."[24] As of 2016, if one of ten of a photographer's pictures are accepted, then they become a Shutterstock contributor.[43] As of 2011, only around 20 percent of applicants were approved, and "less than 60 percent of all the images uploaded by those approved contributors were ultimately put up on the site."[24] Once approved, contributors can begin uploading their work through the website. They supply keywords, categorize the images, and submit them to the "inspection queue", where images are examined for quality, usefulness and copyright and trademark laws. Each time an image is downloaded, the photographer receives a flat rate.[7][44][45] Explains VICE, "photographers retain copyright over their images, but Shutterstock is given full permission to market, display, and license the image to the customers on their site without final approval from the photographer."[16] As of March 2015, contributors added around 50,000 new images daily, and Shutterstock had paid around $250 million to contributors since its founding. In 2014, it paid $80 million to contributors.[42]
Products[edit]
Shutterstock film and music[edit]
Shutterstock began selling stock video in February 2006. Shutterstock Footage operates similarly to their image library, offering video clips by subscription or on a per-clip basis.[18] As of 2014, Shutterstock Footage contained around 2 million royalty-free video clips.[38] Shutterstock Music debuted later, with new content submittable by contributors.[46]
Shutterstock apps[edit]
See also: Shutterstock for iPad
Shutterstock for iPad was launched in November 2011,[22] and in May 2012 the app received a Webby Award for People's Voice in the tablet app category for utilities and services.[47] Shutterstock for iPad was followed in 2012 by a universal iOS app,[27] which by 2013 had been downloaded 650,000 times. The iOS app originally lacked the ability to download images, with that functionality added later.[32] The universal iOS app also included new features for Shutterstock, including the ability to filter image searches by color.[27] Shutterstock debuted an Android App in 2013,[32] and in September 2014, Shutterstock launched an app dedicated to its contributors, both available for iOS and Android. The app allows contributors to upload, keyword and categorize new images.[39]
Shutterstock Labs[edit]
In 2012, Shutterstock launched Shutterstock Labs, a lab for "exploratory tools and products."[26] In May 2012, Shutterstock Images LLC announced the Shutterstock Instant tool, which according to the company was inspired by Shutterstock for iPad. The interface displays images in an interlocking mosaic view, allowing users to view more photos in less time.[25] Shutterstock Instant was made available on the Shutterstock Labs website.[25][26] The prototype for the search tool Spectrum was launched on March 21, 2013. With development in-house by Shutterstock Labs, the tool "indexes hexagram data to yield search results by color."[26] In July 2014, Shutterstock launched Palette, which allows users to add colors to the terms of the search, in addition to keywords.[37]
Offset[edit]
In September 2013 Shutterstock launched Offset, a stock photography marketplace that focuses on high-quality curated images from established artists.[31] Described as a "high-end imagery service,"[12] the photo marketplace is operated by an independent company, which in turn is owned by Shutterstock.[16] Explains Fast Company in 2014, Offset "was created to serve the adjacent needs of existing customers who were looking for premium imagery for billboards, book covers, and high-profile signage for a fraction of the cost of a custom photo shoot."[41] At its launch, Offset had 45,000 images from around 100 artists and publishers such as National Geographic.[31]
Computer vision[edit]
Shutterstock has developed a number of tools utilizing a "convolutional neural network" that it created[15] to help with reverse image search technology.[48] The network is "essentially a computer system that is trained to recognize images - there are millions of specific items such as cats, bicycles, the night sky - and pull up the most relevant photos."[15] The network was dubbed computer vision by Shutterstock, and it "breaks down the key components of a photo numerically, drawing from its pixel data instead of metadata that is pulled from those tags and keywords."[15]

"So a lot of image databases fill in those gaps with user behavior. If people searching the words 'bike' and 'fence' download a particular image more often, that one probably contains those two things in it.... Computer vision [like Shutterstock's] can change all that by eliminating the need for keywords in the first place. Using a series of algorithms, a model can progressively survey each pixel in an image to pick out different features in it—the color, the shapes, the sharpness of the angles. Each calculation is a layer of the deep learning network."

On March 10, 2016, Shutterstock debuted its Reverse Image Search tool. According to Entrepreneur, with the tool "users can upload an image, either from Shutterstock or another source, and the tool will call up images that look like and have a similar feel to the original photo."[15] The reverse image search allows users to not just search by keywords, but to also find images based on "color schemes, mood, or shapes."[48] Later that month, Shutterstock also debuted its Similar Search and Discovery tools,[15] with the "similar search" option provided beneath photos on the Shutterstock website.[48]

History[edit]
Founding and early years (2003-2011)[edit]
Shutterstock was founded in 2003 by American entrepreneur and computer programmer Jon Oringer.[16] Creating his own online marketplace,[4] Oringer initially uploaded 30,000 of his own stock photos and made them available via subscription,[4] with unlimited downloads and a monthly starting fee of USD $49.[4] When demand exceeded his photo supply,[4] he became an agent[17] and began hiring additional contributors.[4] Helping pioneer the subscription based microstock photography business model,[17] Shutterstock claimed that it was the "largest subscription-based stock photo agency in the world" as of 2006, with 570,000 images in its collection.[18] Shutterstock branched into film in 2006 with the launch of Shutterstock Footage,[18] and by 2007, the company had 1.8 million photos.[7] Insight Venture Partners invested in the company that year.[4] Shutterstock expanded beyond subscriptions into a la carte pricing in August 2008, with its "On Demand" service removing daily download limits.[8]
On September 23, 2009, Shutterstock announced that it had purchased Bigstock, a rival credit-based microstock photography agency.[11] Fast Company argued the deal put "Shutterstock on a competitive playing field with Getty, whose iStockPhoto is also credit-based."[19] Shutterstock's CEO Jon Oringer stated the addition would "enable Shutterstock to better satisfy the diverse payment preferences of stock photo buyers worldwide."[11] Shutterstock had 11 million royalty-free stock images by early 2010.[20] In February 2011, Shutterstock announced a two-year partnership with the American Institute of Graphic Arts (AIGA) to provide creative inspiration to its members.[21] Claiming it licensed more images than "any other brand worldwide" in 2011,[21] that November Shutterstock debuted Shutterstock for iPad, which it provided for free.[22]
Acquisitions and IPO (2012-2013)[edit]
With 200 million licensed image downloads as of February 2012,[23] by April 2012 the company had 18 million royalty-free stock images,[20] which grew to 19 million the following month.[24] Shutterstock Images LLC announced the Shutterstock Instant tool in May 2012, which displayed images in an interlocking mosaic to increase viewing speed.[25] Shutterstock Instant was launched under the auspices of the newly formed Shutterstock Labs, which develops tools and interfaces for Shutterstock, among other projects.[25][26] Also in May 2012, Shutterstock filed for an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange, which it completed on October 17, 2012 under the ticker SSTK.[9][10] In November 2012, Shutterstock debuted a universal iOS application meant for iPhone and iPad, among other devices.[27]
Shutterstock, Inc. announced Spectrum, a new "image discovery tool," in March 2013.[26] At the time, Shutterstock had 24 million licensable photos, vectors and illustrations in its portfolio.[26] Shutterstock launched Skillfeed in June 2013, a subscription-based online marketplace to connect the creators of instructional videos with consumers.[28] In August 2013, Shutterstock and Facebook announced a partnership to integrate Shutterstock's library within Facebook's Ad Creator, allowing advertisers to select from Shutterstock's images when creating ads.[29] At the time, Shutterstock was available in 20 languages including Thai, Korean, French, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, German, Russian, Chinese, and Japanese.[30]
Offset and new partnerships (2013-2014)[edit]
In September 2013, Shutterstock launched Offset, marketplace prioritizing high end curated photos from established artists.[31] A few months later, it launched its first Android app.[32] In October 2013, Shutterstock opened offices in Berlin, Germany.[33] At the time, Shutterstock stated it served 750,000 customers, with 30 percent of those customers in Europe.[33] Shutterstock's shares had reached a $2.5 billion market value by the fall of 2013,[4] while revenue for 2013 was USD $235 million.[34]
In March 2014, Shutterstock acquired Webdam, a provider of online digital asset management software.[12] Also in March 2014, Shutterstock relocated its headquarters to the Empire State Building.[35] In May 2014, Shutterstock and Salesforce partnered to integrate Shutterstock's image library into Salesforce's Social Studio.[36] Shutterstock debuted its Palette tool in July 2014, a "multi-color image discovery tool."[37] Shutterstock announced it had surpassed 2 million video clips on September 2, 2014.[38] Shortly afterwards it revealed a new app meant to help contributors with uploading and categorizing photos.[39] Shutterstock's revenue was $328 million in 2014, an increase of 39% from 2013.[16] In 2014, Shutterstock paid "over $83 million to its roughly 80,000 contributors."[16]
Recent developments (2015-2016)[edit]
In January 2015, Shutterstock acquired both Rex Features, Europe's largest independent photo press agency, and PremiumBeat, a stock music and sound effects service.[13] The Rex acquisition was estimated at $33 million,[40] while PremiumBeat was purchased for $32 million.[13] Penske Media Corporation formed a partnership with Shutterstock in June 2015 to create and license entertainment and fashion images. According to the terms of the deal, by 2016 Shutterstock would have an exclusive right and license to PMC's archive,[14] which included magazines such as Variety, Women's Wear Daily,[40] and Deadline.[16] Crain's wrote that with the partnership, "Shutterstock, a provider of stock imagery and music tracks, is stepping into the world of red carpets and fashion runways—and taking a key provider of fashion and entertainment photos and video away from archrival Getty Images."[40]
By March 2016, the company had "over 100,000 contributors," with around 70 million images and 4 million video clips available for licensing and sale.[6] That month Shutterstock announced it would be distributing material from the Associated Press in the United States, with the deal to last 3 years and cover 30 million photos and around 2 million videos. The photos were expected to go live in April.[6] According to Entrepreneur, Shutterstock also had an "active customer base of 1.4 million people in 150 countries."[15]
Facilities and staff[edit]
Shutterstock is headquartered in New York City's Silicon Alley. In October 2013 Shutterstock opened its new European headquarters in Berlin, Germany in the Kulturbrauerei,[33] and by March 2014, Shutterstock had additional offices in Amsterdam, Chicago, Denver, London, Montréal, Paris and San Francisco.[33] After maintaining its New York headquarters for years in a Wall Street office,[4] in March 2014 Shutterstock relocated into the Empire State Building.[35] According to Inc., the office was selected with the goal of decreasing commute times for New York employees.[35] The new location was built with no private offices, instead with 23 "pop-in rooms" for private meetings and conferences when needed.[35]
After its founding in 2003 with CEO Jon Oringer as the sole employee, by 2007 Shutterstock had grown to 30 people. In 2010 Oringer hired Thilo Semmelbauer as COO, who had previously worked with TheLadders.com and Weight Watchers.[4] With 295 employees as of October 2013,[4] that had grown to 700 employees as of 2016.[2] In 2014, Fast Company published an article featuring Shutterstock as an example of a successful "intrapreneur"-reliant company, touting the company's "hackathons" for fostering staff creativity. Explains Fast Company, "the most obvious benefit of intrapreneurship is the ability to pursue more opportunities, allowing Shutterstock to test boundaries and experiment with offshoot products that can keep their core consumer base from turning to a competitor for their needs."[41]
Business model[edit]
Shutterstock licenses media for online download on behalf of photographers, designers, illustrators, videographers and musicians,[4] maintaining a library of around 90 million royalty-free stock photos, vector graphics, and illustrations.[42] Shutterstock also has around 4 million video clips and music clips in its portfolio.[38] While Shutterstock currently has several payment models, The Atlantic wrote in 2012 that Shutterstock "pioneered the subscription approach to stock photo sales, allowing customers to download images in bulk rather than à la carte."[24] The Atlantic further wrote that Shutterstock is "a web community in the manner of a Facebook or a Twitter or a Pinterest, with its value relying almost entirely on the enthusiasms of its contributors."[24]


"Shutterstock is e-commerce with a twist, and its success depends on its contributors' ability to predict, and then provide, products that its subscribers will want to buy."


— The Atlantic (May 18, 2012)[24]


With potential contributors able to apply to the site for free,[16] Shutterstock has a team of reviewers "charged with ensuring editorial consistency and quality."[24] As of 2016, if one of ten of a photographer's pictures are accepted, then they become a Shutterstock contributor.[43] As of 2011, only around 20 percent of applicants were approved, and "less than 60 percent of all the images uploaded by those approved contributors were ultimately put up on the site."[24] Once approved, contributors can begin uploading their work through the website. They supply keywords, categorize the images, and submit them to the "inspection queue", where images are examined for quality, usefulness and copyright and trademark laws. Each time an image is downloaded, the photographer receives a flat rate.[7][44][45] Explains VICE, "photographers retain copyright over their images, but Shutterstock is given full permission to market, display, and license the image to the customers on their site without final approval from the photographer."[16] As of March 2015, contributors added around 50,000 new images daily, and Shutterstock had paid around $250 million to contributors since its founding. In 2014, it paid $80 million to contributors.[42]
Products[edit]
Shutterstock film and music[edit]
Shutterstock began selling stock video in February 2006. Shutterstock Footage operates similarly to their image library, offering video clips by subscription or on a per-clip basis.[18] As of 2014, Shutterstock Footage contained around 2 million royalty-free video clips.[38] Shutterstock Music debuted later, with new content submittable by contributors.[46]
Shutterstock apps[edit]
See also: Shutterstock for iPad
Shutterstock for iPad was launched in November 2011,[22] and in May 2012 the app received a Webby Award for People's Voice in the tablet app category for utilities and services.[47] Shutterstock for iPad was followed in 2012 by a universal iOS app,[27] which by 2013 had been downloaded 650,000 times. The iOS app originally lacked the ability to download images, with that functionality added later.[32] The universal iOS app also included new features for Shutterstock, including the ability to filter image searches by color.[27] Shutterstock debuted an Android App in 2013,[32] and in September 2014, Shutterstock launched an app dedicated to its contributors, both available for iOS and Android. The app allows contributors to upload, keyword and categorize new images.[39]
Shutterstock Labs[edit]
In 2012, Shutterstock launched Shutterstock Labs, a lab for "exploratory tools and products."[26] In May 2012, Shutterstock Images LLC announced the Shutterstock Instant tool, which according to the company was inspired by Shutterstock for iPad. The interface displays images in an interlocking mosaic view, allowing users to view more photos in less time.[25] Shutterstock Instant was made available on the Shutterstock Labs website.[25][26] The prototype for the search tool Spectrum was launched on March 21, 2013. With development in-house by Shutterstock Labs, the tool "indexes hexagram data to yield search results by color."[26] In July 2014, Shutterstock launched Palette, which allows users to add colors to the terms of the search, in addition to keywords.[37]
Offset[edit]
In September 2013 Shutterstock launched Offset, a stock photography marketplace that focuses on high-quality curated images from established artists.[31] Described as a "high-end imagery service,"[12] the photo marketplace is operated by an independent company, which in turn is owned by Shutterstock.[16] Explains Fast Company in 2014, Offset "was created to serve the adjacent needs of existing customers who were looking for premium imagery for billboards, book covers, and high-profile signage for a fraction of the cost of a custom photo shoot."[41] At its launch, Offset had 45,000 images from around 100 artists and publishers such as National Geographic.[31]
Computer vision[edit]
Shutterstock has developed a number of tools utilizing a "convolutional neural network" that it created[15] to help with reverse image search technology.[48] The network is "essentially a computer system that is trained to recognize images - there are millions of specific items such as cats, bicycles, the night sky - and pull up the most relevant photos."[15] The network was dubbed computer vision by Shutterstock, and it "breaks down the key components of a photo numerically, drawing from its pixel data instead of metadata that is pulled from those tags and keywords."[15]

"So a lot of image databases fill in those gaps with user behavior. If people searching the words 'bike' and 'fence' download a particular image more often, that one probably contains those two things in it.... Computer vision [like Shutterstock's] can change all that by eliminating the need for keywords in the first place. Using a series of algorithms, a model can progressively survey each pixel in an image to pick out different features in it—the color, the shapes, the sharpness of the angles. Each calculation is a layer of the deep learning network."
— Popular Science (March 10, 2016)[49]

On March 10, 2016, Shutterstock debuted its Reverse Image Search tool. According to Entrepreneur, with the tool "users can upload an image, either from Shutterstock or another source, and the tool will call up images that look like and have a similar feel to the original photo."[15] The reverse image search allows users to not just search by keywords, but to also find images based on "color schemes, mood, or shapes."[48] Later that month, Shutterstock also debuted its Similar Search and Discovery tools,[15] with the "similar search" option provided beneath photos on the Shutterstock website.[48]

History[edit]
Founding and early years (2003-2011)[edit]
Shutterstock was founded in 2003 by American entrepreneur and computer programmer Jon Oringer.[16] Creating his own online marketplace,[4] Oringer initially uploaded 30,000 of his own stock photos and made them available via subscription,[4] with unlimited downloads and a monthly starting fee of USD $49.[4] When demand exceeded his photo supply,[4] he became an agent[17] and began hiring additional contributors.[4] Helping pioneer the subscription based microstock photography business model,[17] Shutterstock claimed that it was the "largest subscription-based stock photo agency in the world" as of 2006, with 570,000 images in its collection.[18] Shutterstock branched into film in 2006 with the launch of Shutterstock Footage,[18] and by 2007, the company had 1.8 million photos.[7] Insight Venture Partners invested in the company that year.[4] Shutterstock expanded beyond subscriptions into a la carte pricing in August 2008, with its "On Demand" service removing daily download limits.[8]
On September 23, 2009, Shutterstock announced that it had purchased Bigstock, a rival credit-based microstock photography agency.[11] Fast Company argued the deal put "Shutterstock on a competitive playing field with Getty, whose iStockPhoto is also credit-based."[19] Shutterstock's CEO Jon Oringer stated the addition would "enable Shutterstock to better satisfy the diverse payment preferences of stock photo buyers worldwide."[11] Shutterstock had 11 million royalty-free stock images by early 2010.[20] In February 2011, Shutterstock announced a two-year partnership with the American Institute of Graphic Arts (AIGA) to provide creative inspiration to its members.[21] Claiming it licensed more images than "any other brand worldwide" in 2011,[21] that November Shutterstock debuted Shutterstock for iPad, which it provided for free.[22]
Acquisitions and IPO (2012-2013)[edit]
With 200 million licensed image downloads as of February 2012,[23] by April 2012 the company had 18 million royalty-free stock images,[20] which grew to 19 million the following month.[24] Shutterstock Images LLC announced the Shutterstock Instant tool in May 2012, which displayed images in an interlocking mosaic to increase viewing speed.[25] Shutterstock Instant was launched under the auspices of the newly formed Shutterstock Labs, which develops tools and interfaces for Shutterstock, among other projects.[25][26] Also in May 2012, Shutterstock filed for an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange, which it completed on October 17, 2012 under the ticker SSTK.[9][10] In November 2012, Shutterstock debuted a universal iOS application meant for iPhone and iPad, among other devices.[27]
Shutterstock, Inc. announced Spectrum, a new "image discovery tool," in March 2013.[26] At the time, Shutterstock had 24 million licensable photos, vectors and illustrations in its portfolio.[26] Shutterstock launched Skillfeed in June 2013, a subscription-based online marketplace to connect the creators of instructional videos with consumers.[28] In August 2013, Shutterstock and Facebook announced a partnership to integrate Shutterstock's library within Facebook's Ad Creator, allowing advertisers to select from Shutterstock's images when creating ads.[29] At the time, Shutterstock was available in 20 languages including Thai, Korean, French, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, German, Russian, Chinese, and Japanese.[30]
Offset and new partnerships (2013-2014)[edit]
In September 2013, Shutterstock launched Offset, marketplace prioritizing high end curated photos from established artists.[31] A few months later, it launched its first Android app.[32] In October 2013, Shutterstock opened offices in Berlin, Germany.[33] At the time, Shutterstock stated it served 750,000 customers, with 30 percent of those customers in Europe.[33] Shutterstock's shares had reached a $2.5 billion market value by the fall of 2013,[4] while revenue for 2013 was USD $235 million.[34]
In March 2014, Shutterstock acquired Webdam, a provider of online digital asset management software.[12] Also in March 2014, Shutterstock relocated its headquarters to the Empire State Building.[35] In May 2014, Shutterstock and Salesforce partnered to integrate Shutterstock's image library into Salesforce's Social Studio.[36] Shutterstock debuted its Palette tool in July 2014, a "multi-color image discovery tool."[37] Shutterstock announced it had surpassed 2 million video clips on September 2, 2014.[38] Shortly afterwards it revealed a new app meant to help contributors with uploading and categorizing photos.[39] Shutterstock's revenue was $328 million in 2014, an increase of 39% from 2013.[16] In 2014, Shutterstock paid "over $83 million to its roughly 80,000 contributors."[16]
Recent developments (2015-2016)[edit]
In January 2015, Shutterstock acquired both Rex Features, Europe's largest independent photo press agency, and PremiumBeat, a stock music and sound effects service.[13] The Rex acquisition was estimated at $33 million,[40] while PremiumBeat was purchased for $32 million.[13] Penske Media Corporation formed a partnership with Shutterstock in June 2015 to create and license entertainment and fashion images. According to the terms of the deal, by 2016 Shutterstock would have an exclusive right and license to PMC's archive,[14] which included magazines such as Variety, Women's Wear Daily,[40] and Deadline.[16] Crain's wrote that with the partnership, "Shutterstock, a provider of stock imagery and music tracks, is stepping into the world of red carpets and fashion runways—and taking a key provider of fashion and entertainment photos and video away from archrival Getty Images."[40]
By March 2016, the company had "over 100,000 contributors," with around 70 million images and 4 million video clips available for licensing and sale.[6] That month Shutterstock announced it would be distributing material from the Associated Press in the United States, with the deal to last 3 years and cover 30 million photos and around 2 million videos. The photos were expected to go live in April.[6] According to Entrepreneur, Shutterstock also had an "active customer base of 1.4 million people in 150 countries."[15]
Facilities and staff[edit]
Shutterstock is headquartered in New York City's Silicon Alley. In October 2013 Shutterstock opened its new European headquarters in Berlin, Germany in the Kulturbrauerei,[33] and by March 2014, Shutterstock had additional offices in Amsterdam, Chicago, Denver, London, Montréal, Paris and San Francisco.[33] After maintaining its New York headquarters for years in a Wall Street office,[4] in March 2014 Shutterstock relocated into the Empire State Building.[35] According to Inc., the office was selected with the goal of decreasing commute times for New York employees.[35] The new location was built with no private offices, instead with 23 "pop-in rooms" for private meetings and conferences when needed.[35]
After its founding in 2003 with CEO Jon Oringer as the sole employee, by 2007 Shutterstock had grown to 30 people. In 2010 Oringer hired Thilo Semmelbauer as COO, who had previously worked with TheLadders.com and Weight Watchers.[4] With 295 employees as of October 2013,[4] that had grown to 700 employees as of 2016.[2] In 2014, Fast Company published an article featuring Shutterstock as an example of a successful "intrapreneur"-reliant company, touting the company's "hackathons" for fostering staff creativity. Explains Fast Company, "the most obvious benefit of intrapreneurship is the ability to pursue more opportunities, allowing Shutterstock to test boundaries and experiment with offshoot products that can keep their core consumer base from turning to a competitor for their needs."[41]
Business model[edit]
Shutterstock licenses media for online download on behalf of photographers, designers, illustrators, videographers and musicians,[4] maintaining a library of around 90 million royalty-free stock photos, vector graphics, and illustrations.[42] Shutterstock also has around 4 million video clips and music clips in its portfolio.[38] While Shutterstock currently has several payment models, The Atlantic wrote in 2012 that Shutterstock "pioneered the subscription approach to stock photo sales, allowing customers to download images in bulk rather than à la carte."[24] The Atlantic further wrote that Shutterstock is "a web community in the manner of a Facebook or a Twitter or a Pinterest, with its value relying almost entirely on the enthusiasms of its contributors."[24]


"Shutterstock is e-commerce with a twist, and its success depends on its contributors' ability to predict, and then provide, products that its subscribers will want to buy."


— The Atlantic (May 18, 2012)[24]


With potential contributors able to apply to the site for free,[16] Shutterstock has a team of reviewers "charged with ensuring editorial consistency and quality."[24] As of 2016, if one of ten of a photographer's pictures are accepted, then they become a Shutterstock contributor.[43] As of 2011, only around 20 percent of applicants were approved, and "less than 60 percent of all the images uploaded by those approved contributors were ultimately put up on the site."[24] Once approved, contributors can begin uploading their work through the website. They supply keywords, categorize the images, and submit them to the "inspection queue", where images are examined for quality, usefulness and copyright and trademark laws. Each time an image is downloaded, the photographer receives a flat rate.[7][44][45] Explains VICE, "photographers retain copyright over their images, but Shutterstock is given full permission to market, display, and license the image to the customers on their site without final approval from the photographer."[16] As of March 2015, contributors added around 50,000 new images daily, and Shutterstock had paid around $250 million to contributors since its founding. In 2014, it paid $80 million to contributors.[42]
Products[edit]
Shutterstock film and music[edit]
Shutterstock began selling stock video in February 2006. Shutterstock Footage operates similarly to their image library, offering video clips by subscription or on a per-clip basis.[18] As of 2014, Shutterstock Footage contained around 2 million royalty-free video clips.[38] Shutterstock Music debuted later, with new content submittable by contributors.[46]

Shutterstock for iPad was launched in November 2011,[22] and in May 2012 the app received a Webby Award for People's Voice in the tablet app category for utilities and services.[47] Shutterstock for iPad was followed in 2012 by a universal iOS app,[27] which by 2013 had been downloaded 650,000 times. The iOS app originally lacked the ability to download images, with that functionality added later.[32] The universal iOS app also included new features for Shutterstock, including the ability to filter image searches by color.[27] Shutterstock debuted an Android App in 2013,[32] and in September 2014, Shutterstock launched an app dedicated to its contributors, both available for iOS and Android. The app allows contributors to upload, keyword and categorize new images.[39]
Shutterstock Labs[edit]
In 2012, Shutterstock launched Shutterstock Labs, a lab for "exploratory tools and products."[26] In May 2012, Shutterstock Images LLC announced the Shutterstock Instant tool, which according to the company was inspired by Shutterstock for iPad. The interface displays images in an interlocking mosaic view, allowing users to view more photos in less time.[25] Shutterstock Instant was made available on the Shutterstock Labs website.[25][26] The prototype for the search tool Spectrum was launched on March 21, 2013. With development in-house by Shutterstock Labs, the tool "indexes hexagram data to yield search results by color."[26] In July 2014, Shutterstock launched Palette, which allows users to add colors to the terms of the search, in addition to keywords.[37]
Offset[edit]
In September 2013 Shutterstock launched Offset, a stock photography marketplace that focuses on high-quality curated images from established artists.[31] Described as a "high-end imagery service,"[12] the photo marketplace is operated by an independent company, which in turn is owned by Shutterstock.[16] Explains Fast Company in 2014, Offset "was created to serve the adjacent needs of existing customers who were looking for premium imagery for billboards, book covers, and high-profile signage for a fraction of the cost of a custom photo shoot."[41] At its launch, Offset had 45,000 images from around 100 artists and publishers such as National Geographic.[31]
Computer vision[edit]
Shutterstock has developed a number of tools utilizing a "convolutional neural network" that it created[15] to help with reverse image search technology.[48] The network is "essentially a computer system that is trained to recognize images - there are millions of specific items such as cats, bicycles, the night sky - and pull up the most relevant photos."[15] The network was dubbed computer vision by Shutterstock, and it "breaks down the key components of a photo numerically, drawing from its pixel data instead of metadata that is pulled from those tags and keywords."[15]

"So a lot of image databases fill in those gaps with user behavior. If people searching the words 'bike' and 'fence' download a particular image more often, that one probably contains those two things in it.... Computer vision [like Shutterstock's] can change all that by eliminating the need for keywords in the first place. Using a series of algorithms, a model can progressively survey each pixel in an image to pick out different features in it—the color, the shapes, the sharpness of the angles. Each calculation is a layer of the deep learning network."
— Popular Science (March 10, 2016)[49]

On March 10, 2016, Shutterstock debuted its Reverse Image Search tool. According to Entrepreneur, with the tool "users can upload an image, either from Shutterstock or another source, and the tool will call up images that look like and have a similar feel to the original photo."[15] The reverse image search allows users to not just search by keywords, but to also find images based on "color schemes, mood, or shapes."[48] Later that month, Shutterstock also debuted its Similar Search and Discovery tools,[15] with the "similar search" option provided beneath photos on the Shutterstock website.[48]

History[edit]
Founding and early years (2003-2011)[edit]
Shutterstock was founded in 2003 by American entrepreneur and computer programmer Jon Oringer.[16] Creating his own online marketplace,[4] Oringer initially uploaded 30,000 of his own stock photos and made them available via subscription,[4] with unlimited downloads and a monthly starting fee of USD $49.[4] When demand exceeded his photo supply,[4] he became an agent[17] and began hiring additional contributors.[4] Helping pioneer the subscription based microstock photography business model,[17] Shutterstock claimed that it was the "largest subscription-based stock photo agency in the world" as of 2006, with 570,000 images in its collection.[18] Shutterstock branched into film in 2006 with the launch of Shutterstock Footage,[18] and by 2007, the company had 1.8 million photos.[7] Insight Venture Partners invested in the company that year.[4] Shutterstock expanded beyond subscriptions into a la carte pricing in August 2008, with its "On Demand" service removing daily download limits.[8]
On September 23, 2009, Shutterstock announced that it had purchased Bigstock, a rival credit-based microstock photography agency.[11] Fast Company argued the deal put "Shutterstock on a competitive playing field with Getty, whose iStockPhoto is also credit-based."[19] Shutterstock's CEO Jon Oringer stated the addition would "enable Shutterstock to better satisfy the diverse payment preferences of stock photo buyers worldwide."[11] Shutterstock had 11 million royalty-free stock images by early 2010.[20] In February 2011, Shutterstock announced a two-year partnership with the American Institute of Graphic Arts (AIGA) to provide creative inspiration to its members.[21] Claiming it licensed more images than "any other brand worldwide" in 2011,[21] that November Shutterstock debuted Shutterstock for iPad, which it provided for free.[22]
Acquisitions and IPO (2012-2013)[edit]
With 200 million licensed image downloads as of February 2012,[23] by April 2012 the company had 18 million royalty-free stock images,[20] which grew to 19 million the following month.[24] Shutterstock Images LLC announced the Shutterstock Instant tool in May 2012, which displayed images in an interlocking mosaic to increase viewing speed.[25] Shutterstock Instant was launched under the auspices of the newly formed Shutterstock Labs, which develops tools and interfaces for Shutterstock, among other projects.[25][26] Also in May 2012, Shutterstock filed for an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange, which it completed on October 17, 2012 under the ticker SSTK.[9][10] In November 2012, Shutterstock debuted a universal iOS application meant for iPhone and iPad, among other devices.[27]
Shutterstock, Inc. announced Spectrum, a new "image discovery tool," in March 2013.[26] At the time, Shutterstock had 24 million licensable photos, vectors and illustrations in its portfolio.[26] Shutterstock launched Skillfeed in June 2013, a subscription-based online marketplace to connect the creators of instructional videos with consumers.[28] In August 2013, Shutterstock and Facebook announced a partnership to integrate Shutterstock's library within Facebook's Ad Creator, allowing advertisers to select from Shutterstock's images when creating ads.[29] At the time, Shutterstock was available in 20 languages including Thai, Korean, French, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, German, Russian, Chinese, and Japanese.[30]
Offset and new partnerships (2013-2014)[edit]
In September 2013, Shutterstock launched Offset, marketplace prioritizing high end curated photos from established artists.[31] A few months later, it launched its first Android app.[32] In October 2013, Shutterstock opened offices in Berlin, Germany.[33] At the time, Shutterstock stated it served 750,000 customers, with 30 percent of those customers in Europe.[33] Shutterstock's shares had reached a $2.5 billion market value by the fall of 2013,[4] while revenue for 2013 was USD $235 million.[34]
In March 2014, Shutterstock acquired Webdam, a provider of online digital asset management software.[12] Also in March 2014, Shutterstock relocated its headquarters to the Empire State Building.[35] In May 2014, Shutterstock and Salesforce partnered to integrate Shutterstock's image library into Salesforce's Social Studio.[36] Shutterstock debuted its Palette tool in July 2014, a "multi-color image discovery tool."[37] Shutterstock announced it had surpassed 2 million video clips on September 2, 2014.[38] Shortly afterwards it revealed a new app meant to help contributors with uploading and categorizing photos.[39] Shutterstock's revenue was $328 million in 2014, an increase of 39% from 2013.[16] In 2014, Shutterstock paid "over $83 million to its roughly 80,000 contributors."[16]
Recent developments (2015-2016)[edit]
In January 2015, Shutterstock acquired both Rex Features, Europe's largest independent photo press agency, and PremiumBeat, a stock music and sound effects service.[13] The Rex acquisition was estimated at $33 million,[40] while PremiumBeat was purchased for $32 million.[13] Penske Media Corporation formed a partnership with Shutterstock in June 2015 to create and license entertainment and fashion images. According to the terms of the deal, by 2016 Shutterstock would have an exclusive right and license to PMC's archive,[14] which included magazines such as Variety, Women's Wear Daily,[40] and Deadline.[16] Crain's wrote that with the partnership, "Shutterstock, a provider of stock imagery and music tracks, is stepping into the world of red carpets and fashion runways—and taking a key provider of fashion and entertainment photos and video away from archrival Getty Images."[40]
By March 2016, the company had "over 100,000 contributors," with around 70 million images and 4 million video clips available for licensing and sale.[6] That month Shutterstock announced it would be distributing material from the Associated Press in the United States, with the deal to last 3 years and cover 30 million photos and around 2 million videos. The photos were expected to go live in April.[6] According to Entrepreneur, Shutterstock also had an "active customer base of 1.4 million people in 150 countries."[15]
Facilities and staff[edit]
Shutterstock is headquartered in New York City's Silicon Alley. In October 2013 Shutterstock opened its new European headquarters in Berlin, Germany in the Kulturbrauerei,[33] and by March 2014, Shutterstock had additional offices in Amsterdam, Chicago, Denver, London, Montréal, Paris and San Francisco.[33] After maintaining its New York headquarters for years in a Wall Street office,[4] in March 2014 Shutterstock relocated into the Empire State Building.[35] According to Inc., the office was selected with the goal of decreasing commute times for New York employees.[35] The new location was built with no private offices, instead with 23 "pop-in rooms" for private meetings and conferences when needed.[35]
After its founding in 2003 with CEO Jon Oringer as the sole employee, by 2007 Shutterstock had grown to 30 people. In 2010 Oringer hired Thilo Semmelbauer as COO, who had previously worked with TheLadders.com and Weight Watchers.[4] With 295 employees as of October 2013,[4] that had grown to 700 employees as of 2016.[2] In 2014, Fast Company published an article featuring Shutterstock as an example of a successful "intrapreneur"-reliant company, touting the company's "hackathons" for fostering staff creativity. Explains Fast Company, "the most obvious benefit of intrapreneurship is the ability to pursue more opportunities, allowing Shutterstock to test boundaries and experiment with offshoot products that can keep their core consumer base from turning to a competitor for their needs."[41]
Business model[edit]
Shutterstock licenses media for online download on behalf of photographers, designers, illustrators, videographers and musicians,[4] maintaining a library of around 90 million royalty-free stock photos, vector graphics, and illustrations.[42] Shutterstock also has around 4 million video clips and music clips in its portfolio.[38] While Shutterstock currently has several payment models, The Atlantic wrote in 2012 that Shutterstock "pioneered the subscription approach to stock photo sales, allowing customers to download images in bulk rather than à la carte."[24] The Atlantic further wrote that Shutterstock is "a web community in the manner of a Facebook or a Twitter or a Pinterest, with its value relying almost entirely on the enthusiasms of its contributors."[24]


"Shutterstock is e-commerce with a twist, and its success depends on its contributors' ability to predict, and then provide, products that its subscribers will want to buy."


— The Atlantic (May 18, 2012)[24]


With potential contributors able to apply to the site for free,[16] Shutterstock has a team of reviewers "charged with ensuring editorial consistency and quality."[24] As of 2016, if one of ten of a photographer's pictures are accepted, then they become a Shutterstock contributor.[43] As of 2011, only around 20 percent of applicants were approved, and "less than 60 percent of all the images uploaded by those approved contributors were ultimately put up on the site."[24] Once approved, contributors can begin uploading their work through the website. They supply keywords, categorize the images, and submit them to the "inspection queue", where images are examined for quality, usefulness and copyright and trademark laws. Each time an image is downloaded, the photographer receives a flat rate.[7][44][45] Explains VICE, "photographers retain copyright over their images, but Shutterstock is given full permission to market, display, and license the image to the customers on their site without final approval from the photographer."[16] As of March 2015, contributors added around 50,000 new images daily, and Shutterstock had paid around $250 million to contributors since its founding. In 2014, it paid $80 million to contributors.[42]
Products[edit]
Shutterstock film and music[edit]
Shutterstock began selling stock video in February 2006. Shutterstock Footage operates similarly to their image library, offering video clips by subscription or on a per-clip basis.[18] As of 2014, Shutterstock Footage contained around 2 million royalty-free video clips.[38] Shutterstock Music debuted later, with new content submittable by contributors.[46]
Shutterstock apps[edit]

In September 2013 Shutterstock launched Offset, a stock photography marketplace that focuses on high-quality curated images from established artists.[31] Described as a "high-end imagery service,"[12] the photo marketplace is operated by an independent company, which in turn is owned by Shutterstock.[16] Explains Fast Company in 2014, Offset "was created to serve the adjacent needs of existing customers who were looking for premium imagery for billboards, book covers, and high-profile signage for a fraction of the cost of a custom photo shoot."[41] At its launch, Offset had 45,000 images from around 100 artists and publishers such as National Geographic.[31]
Computer vision[edit]
Shutterstock has developed a number of tools utilizing a "convolutional neural network" that it created[15] to help with reverse image search technology.[48] The network is "essentially a computer system that is trained to recognize images - there are millions of specific items such as cats, bicycles, the night sky - and pull up the most relevant photos."[15] The network was dubbed computer vision by Shutterstock, and it "breaks down the key components of a photo numerically, drawing from its pixel data instead of metadata that is pulled from those tags and keywords."[15]

"So a lot of image databases fill in those gaps with user behavior. If people searching the words 'bike' and 'fence' download a particular image more often, that one probably contains those two things in it.... Computer vision [like Shutterstock's] can change all that by eliminating the need for keywords in the first place. Using a series of algorithms, a model can progressively survey each pixel in an image to pick out different features in it—the color, the shapes, the sharpness of the angles. Each calculation is a layer of the deep learning network."
— Popular Science (March 10, 2016)[49]

On March 10, 2016, Shutterstock debuted its Reverse Image Search tool. According to Entrepreneur, with the tool "users can upload an image, either from Shutterstock or another source, and the tool will call up images that look like and have a similar feel to the original photo."[15] The reverse image search allows users to not just search by keywords, but to also find images based on "color schemes, mood, or shapes."[48] Later that month, Shutterstock also debuted its Similar Search and Discovery tools,[15] with the "similar search" option provided beneath photos on the Shutterstock website.[48]

History[edit]
Founding and early years (2003-2011)[edit]
Shutterstock was founded in 2003 by American entrepreneur and computer programmer Jon Oringer.[16] Creating his own online marketplace,[4] Oringer initially uploaded 30,000 of his own stock photos and made them available via subscription,[4] with unlimited downloads and a monthly starting fee of USD $49.[4] When demand exceeded his photo supply,[4] he became an agent[17] and began hiring additional contributors.[4] Helping pioneer the subscription based microstock photography business model,[17] Shutterstock claimed that it was the "largest subscription-based stock photo agency in the world" as of 2006, with 570,000 images in its collection.[18] Shutterstock branched into film in 2006 with the launch of Shutterstock Footage,[18] and by 2007, the company had 1.8 million photos.[7] Insight Venture Partners invested in the company that year.[4] Shutterstock expanded beyond subscriptions into a la carte pricing in August 2008, with its "On Demand" service removing daily download limits.[8]
On September 23, 2009, Shutterstock announced that it had purchased Bigstock, a rival credit-based microstock photography agency.[11] Fast Company argued the deal put "Shutterstock on a competitive playing field with Getty, whose iStockPhoto is also credit-based."[19] Shutterstock's CEO Jon Oringer stated the addition would "enable Shutterstock to better satisfy the diverse payment preferences of stock photo buyers worldwide."[11] Shutterstock had 11 million royalty-free stock images by early 2010.[20] In February 2011, Shutterstock announced a two-year partnership with the American Institute of Graphic Arts (AIGA) to provide creative inspiration to its members.[21] Claiming it licensed more images than "any other brand worldwide" in 2011,[21] that November Shutterstock debuted Shutterstock for iPad, which it provided for free.[22]
Acquisitions and IPO (2012-2013)[edit]
With 200 million licensed image downloads as of February 2012,[23] by April 2012 the company had 18 million royalty-free stock images,[20] which grew to 19 million the following month.[24] Shutterstock Images LLC announced the Shutterstock Instant tool in May 2012, which displayed images in an interlocking mosaic to increase viewing speed.[25] Shutterstock Instant was launched under the auspices of the newly formed Shutterstock Labs, which develops tools and interfaces for Shutterstock, among other projects.[25][26] Also in May 2012, Shutterstock filed for an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange, which it completed on October 17, 2012 under the ticker SSTK.[9][10] In November 2012, Shutterstock debuted a universal iOS application meant for iPhone and iPad, among other devices.[27]
Shutterstock, Inc. announced Spectrum, a new "image discovery tool," in March 2013.[26] At the time, Shutterstock had 24 million licensable photos, vectors and illustrations in its portfolio.[26] Shutterstock launched Skillfeed in June 2013, a subscription-based online marketplace to connect the creators of instructional videos with consumers.[28] In August 2013, Shutterstock and Facebook announced a partnership to integrate Shutterstock's library within Facebook's Ad Creator, allowing advertisers to select from Shutterstock's images when creating ads.[29] At the time, Shutterstock was available in 20 languages including Thai, Korean, French, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, German, Russian, Chinese, and Japanese.[30]
Offset and new partnerships (2013-2014)[edit]
In September 2013, Shutterstock launched Offset, marketplace prioritizing high end curated photos from established artists.[31] A few months later, it launched its first Android app.[32] In October 2013, Shutterstock opened offices in Berlin, Germany.[33] At the time, Shutterstock stated it served 750,000 customers, with 30 percent of those customers in Europe.[33] Shutterstock's shares had reached a $2.5 billion market value by the fall of 2013,[4] while revenue for 2013 was USD $235 million.[34]
In March 2014, Shutterstock acquired Webdam, a provider of online digital asset management software.[12] Also in March 2014, Shutterstock relocated its headquarters to the Empire State Building.[35] In May 2014, Shutterstock and Salesforce partnered to integrate Shutterstock's image library into Salesforce's Social Studio.[36] Shutterstock debuted its Palette tool in July 2014, a "multi-color image discovery tool."[37] Shutterstock announced it had surpassed 2 million video clips on September 2, 2014.[38] Shortly afterwards it revealed a new app meant to help contributors with uploading and categorizing photos.[39] Shutterstock's revenue was $328 million in 2014, an increase of 39% from 2013.[16] In 2014, Shutterstock paid "over $83 million to its roughly 80,000 contributors."[16]
Recent developments (2015-2016)[edit]
In January 2015, Shutterstock acquired both Rex Features, Europe's largest independent photo press agency, and PremiumBeat, a stock music and sound effects service.[13] The Rex acquisition was estimated at $33 million,[40] while PremiumBeat was purchased for $32 million.[13] Penske Media Corporation formed a partnership with Shutterstock in June 2015 to create and license entertainment and fashion images. According to the terms of the deal, by 2016 Shutterstock would have an exclusive right and license to PMC's archive,[14] which included magazines such as Variety, Women's Wear Daily,[40] and Deadline.[16] Crain's wrote that with the partnership, "Shutterstock, a provider of stock imagery and music tracks, is stepping into the world of red carpets and fashion runways—and taking a key provider of fashion and entertainment photos and video away from archrival Getty Images."[40]
By March 2016, the company had "over 100,000 contributors," with around 70 million images and 4 million video clips available for licensing and sale.[6] That month Shutterstock announced it would be distributing material from the Associated Press in the United States, with the deal to last 3 years and cover 30 million photos and around 2 million videos. The photos were expected to go live in April.[6] According to Entrepreneur, Shutterstock also had an "active customer base of 1.4 million people in 150 countries."[15]
Facilities and staff[edit]
Shutterstock is headquartered in New York City's Silicon Alley. In October 2013 Shutterstock opened its new European headquarters in Berlin, Germany in the Kulturbrauerei,[33] and by March 2014, Shutterstock had additional offices in Amsterdam, Chicago, Denver, London, Montréal, Paris and San Francisco.[33] After maintaining its New York headquarters for years in a Wall Street office,[4] in March 2014 Shutterstock relocated into the Empire State Building.[35] According to Inc., the office was selected with the goal of decreasing commute times for New York employees.[35] The new location was built with no private offices, instead with 23 "pop-in rooms" for private meetings and conferences when needed.[35]
After its founding in 2003 with CEO Jon Oringer as the sole employee, by 2007 Shutterstock had grown to 30 people. In 2010 Oringer hired Thilo Semmelbauer as COO, who had previously worked with TheLadders.com and Weight Watchers.[4] With 295 employees as of October 2013,[4] that had grown to 700 employees as of 2016.[2] In 2014, Fast Company published an article featuring Shutterstock as an example of a successful "intrapreneur"-reliant company, touting the company's "hackathons" for fostering staff creativity. Explains Fast Company, "the most obvious benefit of intrapreneurship is the ability to pursue more opportunities, allowing Shutterstock to test boundaries and experiment with offshoot products that can keep their core consumer base from turning to a competitor for their needs."[41]
Business model[edit]
Shutterstock licenses media for online download on behalf of photographers, designers, illustrators, videographers and musicians,[4] maintaining a library of around 90 million royalty-free stock photos, vector graphics, and illustrations.[42] Shutterstock also has around 4 million video clips and music clips in its portfolio.[38] While Shutterstock currently has several payment models, The Atlantic wrote in 2012 that Shutterstock "pioneered the subscription approach to stock photo sales, allowing customers to download images in bulk rather than à la carte."[24] The Atlantic further wrote that Shutterstock is "a web community in the manner of a Facebook or a Twitter or a Pinterest, with its value relying almost entirely on the enthusiasms of its contributors."[24]


"Shutterstock is e-commerce with a twist, and its success depends on its contributors' ability to predict, and then provide, products that its subscribers will want to buy."


— The Atlantic (May 18, 2012)[24]


With potential contributors able to apply to the site for free,[16] Shutterstock has a team of reviewers "charged with ensuring editorial consistency and quality."[24] As of 2016, if one of ten of a photographer's pictures are accepted, then they become a Shutterstock contributor.[43] As of 2011, only around 20 percent of applicants were approved, and "less than 60 percent of all the images uploaded by those approved contributors were ultimately put up on the site."[24] Once approved, contributors can begin uploading their work through the website. They supply keywords, categorize the images, and submit them to the "inspection queue", where images are examined for quality, usefulness and copyright and trademark laws. Each time an image is downloaded, the photographer receives a flat rate.[7][44][45] Explains VICE, "photographers retain copyright over their images, but Shutterstock is given full permission to market, display, and license the image to the customers on their site without final approval from the photographer."[16] As of March 2015, contributors added around 50,000 new images daily, and Shutterstock had paid around $250 million to contributors since its founding. In 2014, it paid $80 million to contributors.[42]
Products[edit]
Shutterstock film and music[edit]
Shutterstock began selling stock video in February 2006. Shutterstock Footage operates similarly to their image library, offering video clips by subscription or on a per-clip basis.[18] As of 2014, Shutterstock Footage contained around 2 million royalty-free video clips.[38] Shutterstock Music debuted later, with new content submittable by contributors.[46]
Shutterstock apps[edit]
See also: Shutterstock for iPad
Shutterstock for iPad was launched in November 2011,[22] and in May 2012 the app received a Webby Award for People's Voice in the tablet app category for utilities and services.[47] Shutterstock for iPad was followed in 2012 by a universal iOS app,[27] which by 2013 had been downloaded 650,000 times. The iOS app originally lacked the ability to download images, with that functionality added later.[32] The universal iOS app also included new features for Shutterstock, including the ability to filter image searches by color.[27] Shutterstock debuted an Android App in 2013,[32] and in September 2014, Shutterstock launched an app dedicated to its contributors, both available for iOS and Android. The app allows contributors to upload, keyword and categorize new images.[39]
Shutterstock Labs[edit]
In 2012, Shutterstock launched Shutterstock Labs, a lab for "exploratory tools and products."[26] In May 2012, Shutterstock Images LLC announced the Shutterstock Instant tool, which according to the company was inspired by Shutterstock for iPad. The interface displays images in an interlocking mosaic view, allowing users to view more photos in less time.[25] Shutterstock Instant was made available on the Shutterstock Labs website.[25][26] The prototype for the search tool Spectrum was launched on March 21, 2013. With development in-house by Shutterstock Labs, the tool "indexes hexagram data to yield search results by color."[26] In July 2014, Shutterstock launched Palette, which allows users to add colors to the terms of the search, in addition to keywords.[37]
Offset[edit]
In September 2013 Shutterstock launched Offset, a stock photography marketplace that focuses on high-quality curated images from established artists.[31] Described as a "high-end imagery service,"[12] the photo marketplace is operated by an independent company, which in turn is owned by Shutterstock.[16] Explains Fast Company in 2014, Offset "was created to serve the adjacent needs of existing customers who were looking for premium imagery for billboards, book covers, and high-profile signage for a fraction of the cost of a custom photo shoot."[41] At its launch, Offset had 45,000 images from around 100 artists and publishers such as National Geographic.[31]
Computer vision[edit]
Shutterstock has developed a number of tools utilizing a "convolutional neural network" that it created[15] to help with reverse image search technology.[48] The network is "essentially a computer system that is trained to recognize images - there are millions of specific items such as cats, bicycles, the night sky - and pull up the most relevant photos."[15] The network was dubbed computer vision by Shutterstock, and it "breaks down the key components of a photo numerically, drawing from its pixel data instead of metadata that is pulled from those tags and keywords."[15]

"So a lot of image databases fill in those gaps with user behavior. If people searching the words 'bike' and 'fence' download a particular image more often, that one probably contains those two things in it.... Computer vision [like Shutterstock's] can change all that by eliminating the need for keywords in the first place. Using a series of algorithms, a model can progressively survey each pixel in an image to pick out different features in it—the color, the shapes, the sharpness of the angles. Each calculation is a layer of the deep learning network."

On March 10, 2016, Shutterstock debuted its Reverse Image Search tool. According to Entrepreneur, with the tool "users can upload an image, either from Shutterstock or another source, and the tool will call up images that look like and have a similar feel to the original photo."[15] The reverse image search allows users to not just search by keywords, but to also find images based on "color schemes, mood, or shapes."[48] Later that month, Shutterstock also debuted its Similar Search and Discovery tools,[15] with the "similar search" option provided beneath photos on the Shutterstock website.[48]

Shutterstock CEO Says New Business Plan Hinged Upon Total Overhaul of IT
Shutterstock has grown rapidly since 2003, evolving from crowdsourced photo market into a one-stop shop for agencies and creative professionals in need of pictures, video, music, editing tools and more. “Getting to the point where we can sell any asset, any time, to any customer, under a simplified license was one of the reasons why we have migrated and why we continue to push toward a unified platform,” says Jon Oringer, founder and CEO. “Change is hard. Not everyone was up for it.”

Shutterstock CEO Says New Business Plan Hinged Upon Total Overhaul of IT
Shutterstock has grown rapidly since 2003, evolving from crowdsourced photo market into a one-stop shop for agencies and creative professionals in need of pictures, video, music, editing tools and more. “Getting to the point where we can sell any asset, any time, to any customer, under a simplified license was one of the reasons why we have migrated and why we continue to push toward a unified platform,” says Jon Oringer, founder and CEO. “Change is hard. Not everyone was up for it.”

							Review:  I purchased by using the Internet site of the A goods which is enhanced license download 25 images for 1 year from Shutterstock on Dec **,2013. My English is poor So I made the wrong order.
I didn't know the facts about wrong order However I've used image all 25 for two days.
I want to change B goods which is standard license download 25 images every day for 1 year.
Try to change the order from the shutterstock.
And Paymented automatically by credit card after I have downloaded the image of all 25, It become repurchase.
As a result, it was supposed to be a payment of twice. I was not received the receipt about repurchase from e-mail.
However, I received an answer from the shutterstock that you can not change it already used up the product of A goods.
When I purchased A goods, Shutterstock did not say to mention about updated automatically.Desired Settlement:  Automatic repurchased should be deleted in web site.
All people do not know the fact about the payment twice when you run out of downloads or your plan expires.
I can request to make a refund or change A goods.

							Review:  The terms of agreement upon my one-time purchase of two downloads for $26.00 with Shutterstock.com did not explicitly state that there was an auto-renewal policy.  Within the four-corners of my contract, I did not agree to an auto-renewal and it was imposed after the submission of my credit card payment.  I demand a return of my money for the auto-renewed month in the amount of the full $29.00 billed.Desired Settlement:  Full refund of $29.00 to my billed credit card.

                        Response:
                    Shutterstock emailed me it would give me a refund. I still think their auto-renewal practices are wrong due to their lack of exclusivity at time of payment. 

Sincerely,

							Review:  Someone got ahold of my credit card information so I called shutter stock to recieve my full refund for the two transactions that were processed 11/**/14 . When I called shutter stock they told me they noticed that account was a fraudulent account and had suspicious activity so they flagged it and refunded the money back on to the card the following day which would have been ****** november **,2014 they "refunded" the money before I had called them about my complaint about the Chargers that were made, and now iv called them about 7 times and they keep asking me for my credit card information and on their automated call directory it says for billing department press 4 and I have spoken to the same person EVERYTIME which is weird to me and they won't send me a confirmation of the refund and when they say "I will talk to my billion team to get his refund sorted out " they hang up on me and still no refund or confirmation that a refund was issued to my account ,I'm sure if I called and pressed the number four to be transferred to the billing department it would send me directly to them but it doesn't I speak to the same woman named ****** and two times iv spoken to someone named *** and nothing has been done because iv called my bank 5 times to see if there was anything processing going IN to my account and they said nothin has been processed . I am sick of the run around and they are being unprofessional and not giving me my money back .Desired Settlement:  Full refund.

							Review:  The Shutterstock.com website has a glitch; it says that I downloaded 5 clips, when, in reality, I have only downloaded four. I am asking for a substitute 5th clip. To resolve this, I spoke with two customer service reps, ***** and *****, and one **********, ****, who were unwilling to honor the fact that there was a glitch and I didn't download a 5th clip in a 5 clip purchase. Here's a little background.
On day one, I purchased a license to download five clips. I put then selected 'download' for each of the five clips, which put them into a sort of shopping cart. Next to each clip was a red 'download' button. At the top left of the page was the option to 'Download All' of the five clips. I selected the "Download All" button for these five clips. Up popped an option to place these 5 clips into a third party "Dropbox'.  When this dialogue to place them in the Dropbox appeared, I declined. None of the 5 clips, at this point, were downloaded. They were placed into a 'Download History' folder.  On the same original screen (with individual Download buttons and the Download All button), I individually downloaded four of the five clips. I never downloaded the 5th clip. The reason I never downloaded the 5th clip is that I was unsure that my client would want this, and I wanted to come back on day two and download a 5th clip, either the original or another that I had downloaded a Comp image to run by my client (the license has a duration of one year). So, at this point, I have downloaded 4 images in the 5 image package.  On day two, the client indicated that he wanted the Comp image (I never showed him the original 5th clip that we were considering).  So, I went back to Shutterstock to get the 5th clip, anticipating that, since I had only downloaded four of the five clips, that I could get a substitute 5th clip. When I went to check out (after having logged in), the website says I needed to pay $79 for this 5th clip. I stopped my edit and called Shutterstock. I talked with ***** about 4 pm eastern. He informed me that because I had used the 'Select All' button, that the 5 original clips were now in my "Download History" and that I had all 5 clips. Reality is that I had only downloaded four clips. I asked to speak to a **********, and was told that I would be put into a cue and a ********** would call me back. I waited 90 minutes. I called back at 5:30 pm eastern and spoke with *****. I told him that I had previously spoken to *****, and what had happened, the glitch with the 'Download All' button (specifically that I declined putting them into the third party Dropbox and never downloaded them). ***** stated that  I had access to all five clips in the Download History, therefore, I couldn't substitute a 5th clip (even though, I still have not downloaded the 5th clip). I asked to speak to his **********. ***** mentioned that all the **********s go home at 5 pm eastern, and that I would receive a callback on Friday morning (this is day one, or Thursday).  I waited until 9:30 am Friday to receive a call from ****, a ********** at Shutterstock. **** had listened to one or both of my recordings, and instructed me that since I had hit the 'Download All' button, and that the 5 clips were in my 'Download History' regardless of whether I had possession of the downloads, and regardless of the glitch that when declining to place all 5 images from the "Download All' option into a third party Dropbox, I still don't have a 5th clip. As of right now, I do not have a 5th clip. I am asking Shutterstock to honor the download of a 5th clip!
When I spoke with the ********** ****, and asked to speak to his **********, he denied assisting me.  He told me that there was no one higher to talk with. So, I am contacting the Revdex.com and asking for resolution.Desired Settlement:  I would like to have access to download a substitute 5th clip ($79 value) instead of the original clip that was never downloaded.  And since I have invested over an hour with three representatives trying to resolve this, I would request a full refund of $295 for the 5 clip package.

                        Response:
                    Dear ********** ****,

Shutterstock, Inc. ("Shutterstock") is hereby responding to Revdex.com Complaint #******** (the "Complaint"). Promptly upon receiving the Complaint, Shutterstock investigated this matter. 

Shutterstock determined that the customer, ***** ****** (the "Customer"), purchased a five-pack license on or about June **, 2014. Shortly thereafter, the Customer licensed five video clips by selecting "Download All". However, the Customer only downloaded four out of the five clips to his computer; the remaining clip was fully licensed and was in the Customer's download history, available for use. The Customer was frustrated that he had licensed all five clips when he did not actually download all of them. On separate calls to Shutterstock, he spoke with three customer service representatives, who advised him that the clips had been licensed when the Customer clicked on the "Download All" button and it was not possible to issue a refund.

Following Shutterstock's receipt of the Complaint, a fourth customer service representative reached out to the Customer on July *, 2014 and advised him that even though the clips had been fully licensed, Shutterstock would issue a refund for the fifth clip in an effort to resolve this matter. The Customer advised Shutterstock that he had purchased another clip (a sixth clip) because he had not received a refund quickly enough and Shutterstock refunded the sixth clip as well. At this time, Shutterstock has offered to refund both the fifth and sixth clip in an effort to resolve this matter.

I called the Customer today to confirm that this matter had been fully resolved and he stated that he considered it resolved. 

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you need any further information. 

Best,

***** ********

							Review:  Shutterstock spams its new customers.  I just signed up for their service and during the sign up process they asked me if I'd like to receive "promotional" emails.  I unchecked the box to indicate no.  The next day I got an email with the subject "Discover more ways to be creative".Desired Settlement:  I want them to make sure their website works properly so that people that uncheck the box don't get signed up for their spam list.

I want them to have the box unchecked by default so that people that forget don't get automatically signed up.

I want them to consider how much they value my business and what they are going to do to compinsate me for my time to get removed from the list and to file this complaint.  I bill my time at $75 per hour.  I have now wasted an hour on this.

Promptly upon receiving the Complaint, Shutterstock investigated this matter.  On or about November *, 2014, the Complainant created a Shutterstock account and received a confirmation email for signing up. On or about the same day, the Complainant contacted Shutterstock and requested removal of Complainant's email address from marketing emails, which Shutterstock promptly did. Unfortunately, due to a technical error, Complainant did receive one additional marketing email the following day.On or about November **, 2014, I called the Complainant and apologized for the errant email. I also offered the Complainant a complimentary package of five Shutterstock images. Following our conversation, the Complainant indicated that he considered this matter resolved. On or about November **, 2014, a Shutterstock customer service representative called the Complainant to follow up and provided the complimentary package of images.Shutterstock believes this matter is now fully resolved.  Please do not hesitate to contact me if you need any further information. Best,***** ********

							Review:  Purchased pictures from Shutterstock and took advantage of the 5 for $49 offer. They apparently automatically place your credit card on renewal and a page later is where you are told this and you have to go to yet another page to turn it off. I looked at additional pictures before I realized this and have now been charged for those additional I looked at. While they have only charged me $9.80 for the pic I looked at, it's poor, poor business practice to automatically sign someone up for something and then not refund the price when it was done accidentally.  I did call them an explain this  but they said I already purchased it and it was too late. Worst is that it's the same image I had already bought.Desired Settlement:  Refund my credit card that additional $9.80;

Later that same day, after receiving the Complaint, Shutterstock contacted the Complainant and offered a refund for the remaining image. As of November **, 2014, the Complainant received a full refund for the second package of five images. Shutterstock believes this matter is now fully resolved.  Please do not hesitate to contact me if you need any further information. Best,***** ********Shutterstock, Inc.********* *******

							Review:  I purchased a package of 26 downloads for a total of $1970. USD.
Well before the expiration date of my package, I notified Shutterstock that I could not use my purchase, my account had not been touched.
After several months of attempting to get a refund I have had no success.
They refuse a refund even though their losses are nil. They've basically just taken my money and they ignore my attempts to resolve this now.
This is simply terrible customer service and questionable at best business practices.Desired Settlement:  I want my money back.

                    Dear ****** *******,

Shutterstock, Inc. ("Shutterstock") is hereby responding to Revdex.com Complaint #********* (the "Complaint"). Promptly upon receiving the Complaint, Shutterstock investigated this matter.  

Shutterstock initially determined that ****** ******** (the "Complainant") reached out to Shutterstock in March of 2013 in order to obtain a license for use of images in connection with merchandise.  She purchased such a license on May **, 2013. The Complainant then reached out again in February 2014 concerning remaining downloads on the account, claiming that her business plans had changed and she had not used the image downloads, nor did she intend to use the downloads.  Shutterstock advised the Complainant that it would provide an extension on the time available to use the downloads or it would transfer her subscription to an alternative product but could not offer a refund.

Following receipt of the present complaint, Shutterstock contacted the Complainant again on May **, 2014 and did not receive a response.  Shutterstock left two more voicemails for the Complainant between May **and May **, 2014. Shutterstock and the Complainant attempted to reach each other on May **, 2014. In Shutterstock's last message to Complainant on May **, 2014, Shutterstock advised the Complainant that Shutterstock had fully refunded Complainant's order.

Shutterstock believes this matter is now fully resolved.  Please do not hesitate to contact me if you need any further information.

							Review:  On April **, 2014, there was $2,013.00 taken out of my bank account at 3:24 a.m.  I do not and not anyone in my household knows what this site is nor have we ever used it.  We did not authorize the eleven payments of $183.00 to be deducted from our account.  We did not go on the site until I saw the charges on our bank account. The bank has taken $180.00  out in overdraft charges because of this.  This is a total of $2193.00.  We went to where it stated to contact them and it gave us a telephone number only.   We tried to call the number and all we got was enter the pin code you were given when you signed up for the account.  This in turn made us not be able to talk to anyone about this since we never signed up for an account.  We have tried several times since to contact them through the number and all we get is enter your pin code.  What can be done to return the money to my account?  Please help.Desired Settlement:  I would like a refund check so I can put it back into my account.  I think something like this should be punishable by law.  They should have better verification policies in place to stop this from happening to anyone else.

							Review:  I signed up for a one-month subscription only.  Their system is such that you must cancel subsequent renewals, which I did one week before the expiration date.  They billed me anyway using an old credit card number that I used two-years ago because I closed the credit card account that I used for the one month subscription.  This is with their subsidiary BigStock *************.
These people are ********.Desired Settlement:  They need to refund the $69.00 dollars they charged me today because I cancelled my subscription on their website form one week before the expiration date (expiration April **).  I cancelled in either late March or April **.

							Review:  The company has several different options for purchasing their products; which is primarily photos.  I purchased a package of five photos for 49 dollars.  After I purchased this package it allows you to select the photos that you want and states as you go as to how many photos you have left.  I clicked on the first, second, and third photos that I wanted; but the counter stated that I still had three images left to download.  So I downloaded three more images.  When I checked my credit card statement shutter stock charged me two charges of 49 dollars for a total of 98 dollars.  There website is purposely misleading so the customer will download an additional photo and they will then charge them for it.  I would also like to state that you can buy two photos for 29 dollars, yet i was charged 49 dollars for one.  I called there customer support and they gave me the run around before giving me a partial refund for 32 or 39 dollars; although I have yet to receive it.Desired Settlement:  I would like there company to be reprimanded.
For shutter stock to behave ethically/morally and stop being misleading.
A full refund.

							Review:  I used this service to purchase a license to use two stock photos for an article I was working on.

I paid $29.00 for two images. When I attempted to download the images, I receive an "error" message on the Shutterstock website. My photos did not download. I attempted to download them again and I was informed by then website that my account was out of credits and I'd need to purchase them again to download the photos! Now again, I never got the photos in the first place due to the website issue.

I contacted Shutterstock three times over the course of the next two days. I explained the problem and mentioned I was on a tight deadline. The deadline came and passed before anyone got back to me.

Finally, on day three, someone named ****** ****** responded to tell me the "company does not give refunds when photos have been downloaded." I attempted to explain to *** ****** that I NEVER received the photos as paid for in the first place, and due to the delay in a response from the company, I had to buy photos elsewhere. I paid for something I didn't receive. *** ****** didn't feel this warranted a refund.Desired Settlement:  I'm asking for a refund of the $29.00 I was charged for photos I didn't receive. If this simple request is unsuccessful, I will have no choice but to dispute the charge with my credit card company, and if needed, I'll pursue the matter in small claims court. 

I realize $29.00 is a small amount of money, however, I refuse to pay for something I didn't receive, especially when the company has treated me so rudely and was so lax to respond to my inquires. Additionally, I have filed a complaint with the ******* ***** ********** regarding this issue.

Shutterstock responded the same day and advised the Complainant that the images were available for redownload at his convenience. Unfortunately, it appears the Complainant did not redownload the images and used an alternative service due to what he perceived as a time delay on the part of Shutterstock. On November**, 2014, Shutterstock reviewed this matter and issued a full refund for $29, which is the total value of the two licensed images. Shutterstock sent the Complainant an email to confirm the refund on November**, 2014.Shutterstock believes this matter is fully resolved.  Please do not hesitate to contact me if you need any further information. Best,***** ********

                    Dear ****** ******, We are writing in further response to Complaint No. ******** (the "Complaint"). Shutterstock has endeavored to respond to Complainant's Complaint quickly and amicably and is disappointed that Complainant does not view this matter as resolved, particularly as he received his desired settlement in full (See Complaint, wherein the Complainant stated: "I'm asking for a refund of the $29.00 I was charged for photos I didn't receive."). Notwithstanding the complete resolution of this matter pursuant to Complainant's request, the Complainant remains dissatisfied by what the Complainant claims is "fibs" told by Shutterstock. While Shutterstock does not normally disclose its customer communications, we are providing a copy of the Complainant's November * correspondence in order to corroborate Shutterstock's initial response (see attached Exhibit A). The complete chronology of Complainant's correspondence with Shutterstock is as follows:November*: Complainant contacted Shutterstock, identifying his issue with downloading images and requesting assistance.November*: Shutterstock responded and informed the Complainant that he may redownload his content for a period of time following the initial download. (This is the "same day" response to which Shutterstock referred in its earlier response in this matter). November*: Complainant sent a second email and stated that he still could not access the content. November**: Complainant sent a third email and stated that he had not received assistance.November**: Shutterstock redownloaded the content and attempted to provide it to Complainant directly. November**: Complainant responded and stated that due to the delay, he used another service and would not be using the content.November**: Shutterstock issued a refund to the Complainant, as requested.Following our further review of the correspondence, we believe that the discrepancy may be due to a time zone issue, as it appears that Complainant sent his initial email late on November* (his time), so it appears from Shutterstock records that it was actually sent on November*. Accordingly, Complainant believes that Shutterstock is not being truthful when it states that Shutterstock responded the "same day". Notwithstanding that discrepancy, Complainant is correct that there was a delay in Shutterstock's second response. As noted, Shutterstock refunded the Complainant's purchase in full and believes that this matter is fully resolved.Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any further questions or concerns.Best,*****

							Review:  I was solicited by shutterstock for a new service skillfeed.  You were suppose to receive one month free to try the service.  I signed up on 8/*/13 (gave my credit card information) and looked it over, on 8/**/13 I cancelled and received an email saying the service was cancelled.  On 9/*/13 my credit card was charged.  I have sent emails asking why and that they need to issue a credit to my credit card ASAP!  no reply.  I tried to call shutterstock for a phone number to be able to talk to someone, shutterstock said they aren't responsible and they would have to have a manager call me back.  They would not let me speak to a manager while I was on the phone.  The person taking my call did not speak English very well.
This company solicited me to try a service for FREE, but that is not the case.  I want a credit applied to my credit card ASAP!Desired Settlement:  Credit card refund ASAP, as well as the phone number to contact the people responsible for Skillfeed!

							Review:  Shutterstock has auto-billed me twice without my permission.

Their service allows for auto-billing. After I no longer needed their service I turned auto-billing off. The first month I was billed again a thought I was mistaken about having turned it off. Two weeks ago I specifically logged in to turn off auto billing, so I know that I did it. This morning, I received noticed that I was auto-billed again.Desired Settlement:  Now that I know that I was not mistaken the first time, I want a full refund for both months of service that my account was billed without my permission.

                    I am writing in response to the present complaint. Upon receiving the complaint, Shutterstock promptly investigated this matter. The Complainant has been an active customer of Shutterstock since January 2012 and has made a number of purchases. For the Complainant's most recent subscription, which was purchased on or about June **, 2015, Shutterstock issued a refund on June **, 2015, immediately upon receiving the Complainant's request concerning the auto-renewing subscription.However, Complainant's request for a second refund concerns a subscription that dates back to 2012 and under which the Complainant has downloaded approximately 300 images. The Complainant actively used the subscription and did not appear to dispute the charges or contact Shutterstock concerning a potential issue. Moreover, the Complainant continued to download under that subscription as recently as June **, 2015. If the Complainant can demonstrate that he sought to cancel the subscription and did not continue to use it, Shutterstock would consider refunding the amount of the subscription. In the event that Shutterstock does provide a refund, all licenses issued for content downloaded under that subscription will be invalid. We are happy to investigate this matter further upon receiving additional information from the Complainant.Best regards,HeidiAssistant General CounselShutterstock, Inc.

							If you decide to create a contributors account please take not that when all your pictures keep getting instantly rejected and you decide you want to delete the account  that the only way to delete it is through the contact us button and it doesn't work. You will keep getting an email saying that the host does not receive emails from the domain your email is linked to which is ironic since it is the same one that you sign up with.

							Review:  Shutterstock sells video footage on their website. For each video they have a 'comp download' which is the video that they are selling but it has a watermark on it to prevent you from using it. So it's essentially a free sample. I found a video that I liked and I downloaded the comp download and it was exactly what I was looking for. The resolution was good, there was no video flickering, and the file size was only 3.5MB. The file size for this is very important because many people are using these for web purposes and you can't have visitors trying to download a 500MB file each time they visit your website. So I purchased the video labelled 'WEB'. This was a 7MB file version which is the smallest available for purchase. Logic would dictate that the 7MB file would be of better quality than the 3.5MB file, right? Very very wrong. It was unusable. Extremely distorted and heavy flickering. On top of that, while it was labeled as "WEB" it was in MOV format, which is NOT web compatible. So I complained to Shutterstock and they told me that the comp download was actually the HD version of the video which costs more, and not the WEB version. That would be fine, except that the HD version is 500MB. So not even their HD product matches the free sample. The free sample is high res & low file size, but the available products are only one or the other. I felt very deceived by this. I was offered a refund, but that's not the point. The point is that they are misleading people. If they offer a free sample, they need to sell the product they are handing out as it is, not intentionally degraded it.Desired Settlement:  I want the 'comp download' as it was but without the watermark. That's it. Simple. Give me the product that you sold me on and that I paid for. I'd gladly pay the full $80 for it. I also want all comp downloads to match the product offered so that others are not deceived into purchasing a poor product like I was.

                    Dear ******* *****:Shutterstock, Inc. ("Shutterstock") is hereby responding to Revdex.com Complaint #******** (the "Complaint"). Promptly upon receiving the Complaint, Shutterstock investigated this matter.  We will first provide background about Shutterstock's process for licensing clips of this nature, including so-called "comps". When a customer elects to download a comp, the resolution size is not listed on the download page because these sizes vary. After the clip is downloaded, the customer can see the resolution. If the customer then elects to license the clip, he must do so by selecting an option from the licensing page, where the resolution is clearly set forth (i.e., HD, SD or Web). The customer can also see the resolution listed when the clip is downloaded. In this instance, the resolution of the comp clip is in between the "SD" and the "Web" size. When the Complainant contacted Shutterstock about this issue, he was given a full refund for the purchase with which he was not satisfied. In the event the Complainant would be satisfied by licensing the "SD" version of the clip, Shutterstock could provide that but would not be able to provide it at the lower file size. Furthermore, the comp clip at the size the Complainant prefers is not available without a watermark and it is not technically feasible to provide it to the Complainant.In an effort to resolve this matter, I reached out to the Complainant on or about May **, 2015. I left him a voicemail and requested that he call me so that we could discuss the best resolution. Shutterstock would like to work with the Complainant to provide a satisfactory clip, to the extent it is technically possible. To date, I have not heard back from the Complainant, but Shutterstock remains open and available to resolving this matter.Please contact me if you have further questions or concerns.Best,*****

							Review:  I thought I was making a one-time purchase of two images.  After I completed payment, I received an email stating that I would be charged an additional $29.00 for an auto-renewal subscription.  I did not buy a subscription, they charged me for one anyway.  After I read the email, I logged back in to their website and cancelled any further subscriptions, but I was unable to cancel the initial subscription.

							Review:  On ** of Jul 2013 we purchased a few photos from this website, we was asked to buy 5 photos, we needed 2-3 only, we proceed with the 5 photos and that was ok to pay $49 for that transaction, until we fond out on ** Jul 2014 that we got charged anther $49 then I called them to find out, they said it is an auto renewal for the account, I got so upset because I didn't signed up for that and I asked for a refund which they did after few days.
Then I was checking the history of my account with them, I fond that they charge me twice for the transaction that I did on ** Jul 2013 as follow: ** Jul 2013   365-day Images On Demand, with 5 Standard License Downloads  $49.00 	******** ** Jul 2013   365-day Images On Demand, with 5 Standard License Downloads   $49.00 	********
I requested one of them to be refunded because I have ordered only one of them and the respond I got is: "Per our policy, we only refund charges that happened 6 months ago or less. Please note we could add 5 downloads to your account so you could take advantage of the 5 downloads oyu missed in the past."
I refused that offer because I do not need their service anymore and I do not want to be forced to buy something that I do not need, than I asked to talk to a manager, they told me he is going to call later, which is he did, surprising on Sunday morning, he was just repeating what they said before which is non since to me and insisting that is auto renewal that just happened on the same day of the original transaction.

Upon contacting Shutterstock, the Complainant was promptly provided with a refund of the charge from 7/**/14 and advised that the 2013 charge could not be refunded due to the lapse of time. In exchange, Shutterstock provided the Complainant with a complimentary on-demand package of five images.

Following receipt of the present Complaint and Shutterstock's investigation, in an effort to resolve this matter, Shutterstock contacted the Complainant on or about 8/**/14 and provided the requested refund for the initial renewed package from 2013. The Complainant confirmed that he would withdraw the present Complaint upon receiving the requested refund. 

Shutterstock believes that this matter is now fully resolved.  Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns.

Best,

							Review:  My account (*************) was billed $1699 in 2013 and 2104. I was given credit for 2014 but not for 2013.
I was enrolled in an auto renewal program that I did not sign up for. I did not select the option.  I did not use the product and did not sign for the subscription.
When you purchase video clips in "PACKS" of 5,10,25. They are called "PACKS" when you purchase them you are buying a subscription that is automatically auto renewed. It is a practice unsavory and not clear to the user. According to my states law they are in violation. It is not clear on the purchase page and I was not given a written copy for my records. SEE BELOW
Section 17602 requires that the essential terms be presented “clearly and conspicuously” or in a manner that obviously calls attention to the language.  Terms & Conditions(1)  In larger type than the surrounding text; (2)  In contrasting type, font, or color to the surrounding text; or (3)  Set off from the surrounding text by symbols or other marks.
The Essential terms FAIL this definition.(1) the type is smaller, the smallest on the page. (2) Type for essential term is not contrasting.
After the subscriber is enrolled, the business must provide acknowledgement of the consumer’s enrollment by providing a copy of the following information in a form the subscriber can retain for his or her records: I never recieved send a notice via mail or email.
I would like to be refunded the money I paid, for a service I did not knowingly sign up for or use. The sad part is i have a monthly subscription with shutter stock for photos images and have spend over $20,000 with this company. Yet they will not refund my money for a Video clips i did not use. It did not cost Shutterstock.com any expense, they did not deliver any goods or service. yet they feel that keep $1699.00 of my money is just.
I am not the only complaint for the auto-renewal on shutter stock. There is a problem here.Desired Settlement:  I would like a full refund . I would like them to follow the law. This practice is unsavory and not in good faith.
It s a calculated business decision. Let the customer click the auto renewal button or at the very least follow the law.
Terms & Conditions(1)  In larger type than the surrounding text; (2)  In contrasting type, font, or color to the surrounding text; or (3)  Set off from the surrounding text by symbols or other marks.

                        Response:
                    Dear ******* ******,

Shutterstock, Inc. ("Shutterstock") is hereby responding to Revdex.com Complaint #********. (the "Complaint"). Promptly upon receiving the Complaint, Shutterstock investigated this matter.

The complaining party, **** ****** (the "Complainant"), reached out to Shutterstock concerning this issue on September *, 2014, to request a refund. Given that the initial renewal occurred on August **, 2013, it was over one year old. Shutterstock offered him an additional year to complete the downloads available through the subscription, which he declined. The requested amount (US $1631.04), was then refunded in full on or about September **, 2014. Shutterstock attempted to contact the Complainant to ensure his receipt of the refund, but has not been able to reach him. 

Shutterstock believes this matter is now fully resolved. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you need any further information.

Best,
***** ********

							Review:  My college student  accidentally signed up  to ************* and did not know it and then cancelled it. I also cancelled it, they continue to pull out $20 per month from my college kids account, and this has gone on for four months.  They called me last month (October) promising to correct and give us our money back and we never got anything back and they took out again this month (November) another $20. Please get them to stop and give us back his money.Desired Settlement:  Cancelled subscription and pay back money.
