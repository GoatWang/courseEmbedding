What a fabulous hotel! The staff at the hotel are just brilliant and I was really made to feel like a star. Our suite was out of this world. Thank you and hopefully will be back one day. Their onsite restaurant served some of the best food I've ever had.

Upon arriving to the Baccarat, we were greeted by lovely gracious hotel staff! Going inside the gorgeous Baccarat, we walked into the finest fragrance ever. The rest of the hotel staff were just as amazing, dinning, decor, staff, amazing fantastic food selections,the room was beautiful! Please experience this fabulous place yourself. you won't regret it~ I am in love with the Baccarat, planning a trip back the Baccarat soon!

As soon as you step into the hotel, you are greeted with the most delightful smell and courteous staff. Once at check-in, I was greeted with friendly faces and then I was escorted to my guest room so the clerk could show me the amenities of the hotel. You can't beat free Evian water and soft drinks in the refrigerator. The rooms are gorgeus --marble walls and bathrooms. The beds and pillows are so comfortable. I can't say enough great things. The downstairs bar and restaurant are also gorgeous. . .and the gym also has a pool. The Baccarat is amazing --there is no reason to stay at other hotels!

It was my first stay at Bacarrat. So nice and pleasant experience in general. Room was so clean and well organized, and the services and staffs were very kind. All amenities were top qualities. Its location was also very convenient near to 5th avenue and 6th avenues, including MoMA.

I had the pleasure of experiencing (you don't stay at the Baccarat- you experience it!) for the first time last week and it has unequivocally become my favourite hotel in NYC. This beautiful, elegant and understated hotel seduces you from the moment you arrive in the downstairs entrance with its signature Baccarat scent- a theme that follows you throughout the hotel all the way to the generous Baccarat bathroom products....Even the classic rooms benefit from clever minimalist design and understated opulence...As someone with a global business, I am fortunate to have stayed in many fine 5 star hotels throughout he world. However I have only been seduced and inevitably fallen in love with one!

No words can explain this experience for us. Very impressive hotel with beautiful decorations, the terrasse in the middle of the city opposite to Moma let us dream, we were there at the sunset time and it was amazing, the service was excellent and thanks to MATTHIEU for all the advices concerning the wine and champagne. Definitely our best place in New York.

I generally stop by the hotel bar for a cup of tea/coffee or to talk business over a drink. Upscale and elegant atmosphere with a luxury French touch. For a more cosy and quieter environment get a table in the main room. If you are into champagne and cocktails, you must try "Bonbons & bubbles". Excellent service.

This is one of my FAVORITE hotels in NYC! I love staying here. The rooms are modern and extremely comfortable. The accommodations are incredible and the location is hard to beat as well. Absolutely love the bar area and the restaurant is a great place for afternoon tea or to have business meetings. The furnishings and of course the crystal make this hotel a spectacle all in itself.

...Upon passing the threshold to ascend to the 2nd floor lobby, you greeted with a visual merging of floor to ceiling digital art and classic Baccarat chandeliers, in ultra cool dark space. Attention to the visual details, from the glass enclosed fireplace to cool aural soundscape that envelopes this anteroom. Once you enter the lobby on the second floor, you experience the lightness and the glamor of the hotel... Even though I was staying in a classic king room, they made me feel like a VIP. Whenever I needed a table at the very busy and sought after bar, they instantly reacted and within 10 mins. a space was cleared for me... This hotel even has a pool in the basement with private cabanas! Plus as a bonus a La Mer spa! I would definitely recommend the hotel to everyone, stay at least once there, with the added bonus of MOMA being across the street!

We have just returned from a 4 night stay at the Baccarat and we have to say, that in every aspect, this is one of the best hotels we have stayed in. From the minute we arrived, tired after flight delay and transfer hiccup, we were greeted with charm and open friendliness, from the door men to reception, we could feel the tension and stress dissipate. The hotel itself is beautiful, the Baccarat glass everywhere, so stunning. The design and attention to detail breathtaking... Should we return to NYC, there is no doubt, we will be staying here.

From the moment you step into the grandiose doors of The Baccarat, the hotel exudes over-the-top luxury in every well-thought-out detail. The entire experience is impeccable, from the decadent decor to the hyper-attentive staff, to the indulgent cuisine and cocktails, served in the hotel's infamous lobby bar or the Grand Salon (which resembles a museum more than a hotel lobby). The rooms are comfortable, crisp and equipped with high-tech touches to enhance your stay. Our favorite feature was the flat screen tv, sneakily concealed within a gorgeous mirror. This hotel is truly the best of the best. The only downfall was never wanting to leave the property to explore NYC!

Absolutely astonishing. Surrounded by crystal but nothing stuffy or old world about it. The perfect combination of uber luxury and hip. Top end from top to bottom and everything in between. Impeccable service. The night doorman (I wish I could remember his name) was outstanding. Greeted me by name every time. The personal checkin is a great service and a nice touch. Restaurant and bar is a great place to see and be seen. If you are looking for a great place in the perfect location this is it. Can't wait to go back.

My first visit to this boutique hotel. Personalized service, beautiful functional rooms and a great indoor pool were the highpoints. It has a great location between the theater district and Central Park. Breakfast is pricey and nice but not a typical American Breakfast. I loved this hotel and would return if I am back in Midtown.

We spent three nights at this lovely hotel in april and had two connecting rooms.... The highlight of the hotel though is the lounge area on the main reception floor. The chandeliers and eccentric over the top decor, still remains very tasteful. Lovely breakfasts, and cocktails in the evening. The bar is also VERY chic, but a little too loud for our taste and very popular so therefore crowded. Our course this hotel is expensive.... but you get what you pay for.

The Baccarat Hotel is amazing and if you can, try to book a massage with Diane at the La Mer spa on the bottom floor, you won't be disappointed. The spa is beautiful and the staff could not be nicer or more accommodating but The massage therapist named Diane makes this spa experience incredible. I have traveled all over the world and I have gone to every spa along the way and Diane is the best by far. She's an incredible therapist and a very nice person. I live in the west village but I battle the uptown traffic once a week just to see Diane for an incredible and relaxing massage. The La Mer Spa, staff, and Diane are a must if your are ever in NYC.

What a fabulous hotel! The staff at the hotel are just brilliant and I was really made to feel like a star. Our suite was out of this world. Thank you and hopefully will be back one day. Their onsite restaurant served some of the best food I've ever had.

As soon as you step into the hotel, you are greeted with the most delightful smell and courteous staff. Once at check-in, I was greeted with friendly faces and then I was escorted to my guest room so the clerk could show me the amenities of the hotel. You can't beat free Evian water and soft drinks in the refrigerator. The rooms are gorgeus --marble walls and bathrooms. The beds and pillows are so comfortable. I can't say enough great things. The downstairs bar and restaurant are also gorgeous. . .and the gym also has a pool. The Baccarat is amazing --there is no reason to stay at other hotels!

It was my first stay at Bacarrat. So nice and pleasant experience in general. Room was so clean and well organized, and the services and staffs were very kind. All amenities were top qualities. Its location was also very convenient near to 5th avenue and 6th avenues, including MoMA.

I had the pleasure of experiencing (you don't stay at the Baccarat- you experience it!) for the first time last week and it has unequivocally become my favourite hotel in NYC. This beautiful, elegant and understated hotel seduces you from the moment you arrive in the downstairs entrance with its signature Baccarat scent- a theme that follows you throughout the hotel all the way to the generous Baccarat bathroom products....Even the classic rooms benefit from clever minimalist design and understated opulence...As someone with a global business, I am fortunate to have stayed in many fine 5 star hotels throughout he world. However I have only been seduced and inevitably fallen in love with one!

No words can explain this experience for us. Very impressive hotel with beautiful decorations, the terrasse in the middle of the city opposite to Moma let us dream, we were there at the sunset time and it was amazing, the service was excellent and thanks to MATTHIEU for all the advices concerning the wine and champagne. Definitely our best place in New York.

I generally stop by the hotel bar for a cup of tea/coffee or to talk business over a drink. Upscale and elegant atmosphere with a luxury French touch. For a more cosy and quieter environment get a table in the main room. If you are into champagne and cocktails, you must try "Bonbons & bubbles". Excellent service.

This is one of my FAVORITE hotels in NYC! I love staying here. The rooms are modern and extremely comfortable. The accommodations are incredible and the location is hard to beat as well. Absolutely love the bar area and the restaurant is a great place for afternoon tea or to have business meetings. The furnishings and of course the crystal make this hotel a spectacle all in itself.

...Upon passing the threshold to ascend to the 2nd floor lobby, you greeted with a visual merging of floor to ceiling digital art and classic Baccarat chandeliers, in ultra cool dark space. Attention to the visual details, from the glass enclosed fireplace to cool aural soundscape that envelopes this anteroom. Once you enter the lobby on the second floor, you experience the lightness and the glamor of the hotel... Even though I was staying in a classic king room, they made me feel like a VIP. Whenever I needed a table at the very busy and sought after bar, they instantly reacted and within 10 mins. a space was cleared for me... This hotel even has a pool in the basement with private cabanas! Plus as a bonus a La Mer spa! I would definitely recommend the hotel to everyone, stay at least once there, with the added bonus of MOMA being across the street!

Wow! Absolutely incredible suite, stunning decor which is stylish and chic, coolest bar ever, service to die for, wonderful touches, spotlessly clean and generally one of the best hotels in the world. Door men just fantastic. Couldn't have asked for more. Totally recommend 100 per cent.

We have just returned from a 4 night stay at the Baccarat and we have to say, that in every aspect, this is one of the best hotels we have stayed in. From the minute we arrived, tired after flight delay and transfer hiccup, we were greeted with charm and open friendliness, from the door men to reception, we could feel the tension and stress dissipate. The hotel itself is beautiful, the Baccarat glass everywhere, so stunning. The design and attention to detail breathtaking... Should we return to NYC, there is no doubt, we will be staying here.

From the moment you step into the grandiose doors of The Baccarat, the hotel exudes over-the-top luxury in every well-thought-out detail. The entire experience is impeccable, from the decadent decor to the hyper-attentive staff, to the indulgent cuisine and cocktails, served in the hotel's infamous lobby bar or the Grand Salon (which resembles a museum more than a hotel lobby). The rooms are comfortable, crisp and equipped with high-tech touches to enhance your stay. Our favorite feature was the flat screen tv, sneakily concealed within a gorgeous mirror. This hotel is truly the best of the best. The only downfall was never wanting to leave the property to explore NYC!

Absolutely astonishing. Surrounded by crystal but nothing stuffy or old world about it. The perfect combination of uber luxury and hip. Top end from top to bottom and everything in between. Impeccable service. The night doorman (I wish I could remember his name) was outstanding. Greeted me by name every time. The personal checkin is a great service and a nice touch. Restaurant and bar is a great place to see and be seen. If you are looking for a great place in the perfect location this is it. Can't wait to go back.

My first visit to this boutique hotel. Personalized service, beautiful functional rooms and a great indoor pool were the highpoints. It has a great location between the theater district and Central Park. Breakfast is pricey and nice but not a typical American Breakfast. I loved this hotel and would return if I am back in Midtown.

We spent three nights at this lovely hotel in april and had two connecting rooms.... The highlight of the hotel though is the lounge area on the main reception floor. The chandeliers and eccentric over the top decor, still remains very tasteful. Lovely breakfasts, and cocktails in the evening. The bar is also VERY chic, but a little too loud for our taste and very popular so therefore crowded. Our course this hotel is expensive.... but you get what you pay for.

Staff is always friendly, professional and accommodating. Rooms are elegant, spacious and well appointed with beautiful furnishings and comfortable bedding and linens. Common spaces such as the grand salon are great areas to relax and enjoy a delicious meal and have a cocktail in signature Bacarrat crystal.

The Baccarat Hotel is amazing and if you can, try to book a massage with Diane at the La Mer spa on the bottom floor, you won't be disappointed. The spa is beautiful and the staff could not be nicer or more accommodating but The massage therapist named Diane makes this spa experience incredible. I have traveled all over the world and I have gone to every spa along the way and Diane is the best by far. She's an incredible therapist and a very nice person. I live in the west village but I battle the uptown traffic once a week just to see Diane for an incredible and relaxing massage. The La Mer Spa, staff, and Diane are a must if your are ever in NYC.

Well, I can tell you that it is all that! It is absolutely beautiful. All the crystal and rich colors in the public spaces give way to the gorgeous white bedrooms/suites... Just a beautiful place. Splurge, you will love it.

The Hotel





MAISON BACCARAT 

A deep calm, warm and generative.
An orchard of sconces and chandeliers hanging heavy, bright geometry.
In white daylight, rainbows cascading, a spectrum of swatches cast from a trillion facets.
By night, dimmed shimmer and champagne flutes. Gem-red spheres of fresh roses.
This is Baccarat.




DESIGN & DÉCOR
The otherworldly interiors within the Baccarat realm were both imagined and realized by Gilles & Boissier. The acclaimed Paris-based design duo lavished their attention on its soaring salons and 114 rooms and suites, each accented with Baccarat crystal and the fiery crimson shade of Baccarat red. 
The hotel’s modern, vibrantly eccentric social spaces are anchored by luxe elements—pleated silk walls, a rug printed in a crystal glass pattern, a monumental white marble table. 
New York design masters Tony Ingrao and Stephen Sills, respectively, oversaw the aesthetics of Baccarat’s 60 magnificent residences.
SERVICES AND AMENITIES 
Discover the services and amenities at Baccarat New York including our Artisans of Service and Spa de La Mer. 


PRIVATE ART COLLECTION
Parisian art connoisseur Frédéric Chambre spent eighteen months in Paris auction houses seeking extraordinary pieces for Baccarat New York. The resulting collection, spanning from the 18th century to the present day, is eclectic: paintings, photography, and compelling works in other mediums, all uniquely suited to Baccarat.
THE HARCOURT VITRINES
Beyond the exceptional artwork collected for the hotel by Frédéric Chambre, Baccarat New York also tapped his talents to commission new work from 11 extraordinary artists. Each was given ten iconic Baccarat Harcourt glasses to incorporate into art. Diverse and inventive, these pieces are displayed as a dramatically lit glass vitrines, standing silent and radiant in the doorways of the suites.

Industry Update




Press Release22 February 2017Concord Hospitality Breaks Ground on Pittsburgh’s First Autograph Collection® Hotel, The Oaklander Hotel

PITTSBURGH – Concord Hospitality announced today that it plans to open Pittsburgh's first Autograph Collection® Hotel in the heart of the Oakland neighborhood. Construction began on the 167-room property, The Oaklander Hotel, last month. The development team is led by Oakland Fifth Avenue Hotel Associates LP, a partnership between Concord and Callay Capital.

The new hotel will be located centrally to the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, Carlow College and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and is expected to open fall 2018. An Oakland original, the property will be a nod to the city's glorious past and a freshly-fused look into the neighborhood's exciting future.

"The Autograph Collection is a remarkable group of upper upscale and luxury independent hotels with iconic properties located in gateway and emerging cities around the world," said Mark Laport, co-founder, president and CEO of Concord. "The Oaklander Hotel enriches Concord's vision to create irresistible places within vibrant communities."
The ten-story hotel will feature a rooftop lobby with an inspired lounge and restaurant, as well as 2,200 square feet of meeting space and a fitness center. There will be an independent, street-level restaurant located on Bigelow Blvd. and a coffee shop located on Lytton St.
"With a diverse, urban-inspired and cosmopolitan vibe, Pittsburgh is a true renaissance city," said Keith McGraw, longtime partner of Concord. "It is home to renowned universities, medical centers and museums, research centers and libraries, which is why we believe The Oaklander Hotel will be very successful here."
Concord Hospitality has partnered with Marriott International on the development of new hotel brands for the last two decades. That alignment for strategic growth and passion for delivering best-in-class service is represented in Concord's achievement of winning the coveted Marriott Partnership Circle Award 10 times and in 2016, being inducted into Marriott's Partnership Circle Hall of Fame for hospitality excellence.
"Oakland has continued its prominence as a center for culture, education and innovation in Pittsburgh," said Joshua Lavrinc, Chief Executive Officer of Callay Capital. "We are excited for The Oaklander Hotel and its impressive accommodations to harbor new intellectual and social collisions among visitors and locals alike."
A member of Marriott's industry-leading portfolio, the Autograph Collection debuted in 2010 and includes 100 independently branded hotels and resorts that respect the distinct attributes of their market. Each is unique in terms of product offering and target customers. The result is an array of properties that is nothing less than unique and nothing short of collectively exceptional.
Concord broke ground on the AC Hotel Smallman by Marriott, located in Pittsburgh's vibrant Strip District, last November. The property is scheduled to open in spring 2018.

The rest of the hotel staff were just as amazing, dinning, decor, staff, amazing fantastic food selections,the room was beautiful! Please experience this fabulous place yourself. you won't regret it~ I am in love with the Baccarat, planning a trip back the Baccarat soon!

As soon as you step into the hotel, you are greeted with the most delightful smell and courteous staff. Once at check-in, I was greeted with friendly faces and then I was escorted to my guest room so the clerk could show me the amenities of the hotel. You can't beat free Evian water and soft drinks in the refrigerator. The rooms are gorgeus --marble walls and bathrooms. The beds and pillows are so comfortable. I can't say enough great things. The downstairs bar and restaurant are also gorgeous. . .and the gym also has a pool. The Baccarat is amazing --there is no reason to stay at other hotels!

It was my first stay at Bacarrat. So nice and pleasant experience in general. Room was so clean and well organized, and the services and staffs were very kind. All amenities were top qualities. Its location was also very convenient near to 5th avenue and 6th avenues, including MoMA.

I had the pleasure of experiencing (you don't stay at the Baccarat- you experience it!) for the first time last week and it has unequivocally become my favourite hotel in NYC. This beautiful, elegant and understated hotel seduces you from the moment you arrive in the downstairs entrance with its signature Baccarat scent- a theme that follows you throughout the hotel all the way to the generous Baccarat bathroom products....Even the classic rooms benefit from clever minimalist design and understated opulence...As someone with a global business, I am fortunate to have stayed in many fine 5 star hotels throughout he world. However I have only been seduced and inevitably fallen in love with one!

No words can explain this experience for us. Very impressive hotel with beautiful decorations, the terrasse in the middle of the city opposite to Moma let us dream, we were there at the sunset time and it was amazing, the service was excellent and thanks to MATTHIEU for all the advices concerning the wine and champagne. Definitely our best place in New York.

I generally stop by the hotel bar for a cup of tea/coffee or to talk business over a drink. Upscale and elegant atmosphere with a luxury French touch. For a more cosy and quieter environment get a table in the main room. If you are into champagne and cocktails, you must try "Bonbons & bubbles". Excellent service.

This is one of my FAVORITE hotels in NYC! I love staying here. The rooms are modern and extremely comfortable. The accommodations are incredible and the location is hard to beat as well. Absolutely love the bar area and the restaurant is a great place for afternoon tea or to have business meetings. The furnishings and of course the crystal make this hotel a spectacle all in itself.

...Upon passing the threshold to ascend to the 2nd floor lobby, you greeted with a visual merging of floor to ceiling digital art and classic Baccarat chandeliers, in ultra cool dark space. Attention to the visual details, from the glass enclosed fireplace to cool aural soundscape that envelopes this anteroom. Once you enter the lobby on the second floor, you experience the lightness and the glamor of the hotel... Even though I was staying in a classic king room, they made me feel like a VIP. Whenever I needed a table at the very busy and sought after bar, they instantly reacted and within 10 mins. a space was cleared for me... This hotel even has a pool in the basement with private cabanas! Plus as a bonus a La Mer spa! I would definitely recommend the hotel to everyone, stay at least once there, with the added bonus of MOMA being across the street!

We have just returned from a 4 night stay at the Baccarat and we have to say, that in every aspect, this is one of the best hotels we have stayed in. From the minute we arrived, tired after flight delay and transfer hiccup, we were greeted with charm and open friendliness, from the door men to reception, we could feel the tension and stress dissipate. The hotel itself is beautiful, the Baccarat glass everywhere, so stunning. The design and attention to detail breathtaking... Should we return to NYC, there is no doubt, we will be staying here.

From the moment you step into the grandiose doors of The Baccarat, the hotel exudes over-the-top luxury in every well-thought-out detail. The entire experience is impeccable, from the decadent decor to the hyper-attentive staff, to the indulgent cuisine and cocktails, served in the hotel's infamous lobby bar or the Grand Salon (which resembles a museum more than a hotel lobby). The rooms are comfortable, crisp and equipped with high-tech touches to enhance your stay. Our favorite feature was the flat screen tv, sneakily concealed within a gorgeous mirror. This hotel is truly the best of the best. The only downfall was never wanting to leave the property to explore NYC!

Absolutely astonishing. Surrounded by crystal but nothing stuffy or old world about it. The perfect combination of uber luxury and hip. Top end from top to bottom and everything in between. Impeccable service. The night doorman (I wish I could remember his name) was outstanding. Greeted me by name every time. The personal checkin is a great service and a nice touch. Restaurant and bar is a great place to see and be seen. If you are looking for a great place in the perfect location this is it. Can't wait to go back.

My first visit to this boutique hotel. Personalized service, beautiful functional rooms and a great indoor pool were the highpoints. It has a great location between the theater district and Central Park. Breakfast is pricey and nice but not a typical American Breakfast. I loved this hotel and would return if I am back in Midtown.

We spent three nights at this lovely hotel in april and had two connecting rooms.... The highlight of the hotel though is the lounge area on the main reception floor. The chandeliers and eccentric over the top decor, still remains very tasteful. Lovely breakfasts, and cocktails in the evening. The bar is also VERY chic, but a little too loud for our taste and very popular so therefore crowded. Our course this hotel is expensive.... but you get what you pay for.

The Baccarat Hotel is amazing and if you can, try to book a massage with Diane at the La Mer spa on the bottom floor, you won't be disappointed. The spa is beautiful and the staff could not be nicer or more accommodating but The massage therapist named Diane makes this spa experience incredible. I have traveled all over the world and I have gone to every spa along the way and Diane is the best by far. She's an incredible therapist and a very nice person. I live in the west village but I battle the uptown traffic once a week just to see Diane for an incredible and relaxing massage. The La Mer Spa, staff, and Diane are a must if your are ever in NYC.

It was my first stay at Bacarrat. So nice and pleasant experience in general. Room was so clean and well organized, and the services and staffs were very kind. All amenities were top qualities. Its location was also very convenient near to 5th avenue and 6th avenues, including MoMA.

I had the pleasure of experiencing (you don't stay at the Baccarat- you experience it!) for the first time last week and it has unequivocally become my favourite hotel in NYC. This beautiful, elegant and understated hotel seduces you from the moment you arrive in the downstairs entrance with its signature Baccarat scent- a theme that follows you throughout the hotel all the way to the generous Baccarat bathroom products....Even the classic rooms benefit from clever minimalist design and understated opulence...As someone with a global business, I am fortunate to have stayed in many fine 5 star hotels throughout he world. However I have only been seduced and inevitably fallen in love with one!

No words can explain this experience for us. Very impressive hotel with beautiful decorations, the terrasse in the middle of the city opposite to Moma let us dream, we were there at the sunset time and it was amazing, the service was excellent and thanks to MATTHIEU for all the advices concerning the wine and champagne. Definitely our best place in New York.

I generally stop by the hotel bar for a cup of tea/coffee or to talk business over a drink. Upscale and elegant atmosphere with a luxury French touch. For a more cosy and quieter environment get a table in the main room. If you are into champagne and cocktails, you must try "Bonbons & bubbles". Excellent service.

This is one of my FAVORITE hotels in NYC! I love staying here. The rooms are modern and extremely comfortable. The accommodations are incredible and the location is hard to beat as well. Absolutely love the bar area and the restaurant is a great place for afternoon tea or to have business meetings. The furnishings and of course the crystal make this hotel a spectacle all in itself.

...Upon passing the threshold to ascend to the 2nd floor lobby, you greeted with a visual merging of floor to ceiling digital art and classic Baccarat chandeliers, in ultra cool dark space. Attention to the visual details, from the glass enclosed fireplace to cool aural soundscape that envelopes this anteroom. Once you enter the lobby on the second floor, you experience the lightness and the glamor of the hotel... Even though I was staying in a classic king room, they made me feel like a VIP. Whenever I needed a table at the very busy and sought after bar, they instantly reacted and within 10 mins. a space was cleared for me... This hotel even has a pool in the basement with private cabanas! Plus as a bonus a La Mer spa! I would definitely recommend the hotel to everyone, stay at least once there, with the added bonus of MOMA being across the street!

We have just returned from a 4 night stay at the Baccarat and we have to say, that in every aspect, this is one of the best hotels we have stayed in. From the minute we arrived, tired after flight delay and transfer hiccup, we were greeted with charm and open friendliness, from the door men to reception, we could feel the tension and stress dissipate. The hotel itself is beautiful, the Baccarat glass everywhere, so stunning. The design and attention to detail breathtaking... Should we return to NYC, there is no doubt, we will be staying here.

From the moment you step into the grandiose doors of The Baccarat, the hotel exudes over-the-top luxury in every well-thought-out detail. The entire experience is impeccable, from the decadent decor to the hyper-attentive staff, to the indulgent cuisine and cocktails, served in the hotel's infamous lobby bar or the Grand Salon (which resembles a museum more than a hotel lobby). The rooms are comfortable, crisp and equipped with high-tech touches to enhance your stay. Our favorite feature was the flat screen tv, sneakily concealed within a gorgeous mirror. This hotel is truly the best of the best. The only downfall was never wanting to leave the property to explore NYC!

Absolutely astonishing. Surrounded by crystal but nothing stuffy or old world about it. The perfect combination of uber luxury and hip. Top end from top to bottom and everything in between. Impeccable service. The night doorman (I wish I could remember his name) was outstanding. Greeted me by name every time. The personal checkin is a great service and a nice touch. Restaurant and bar is a great place to see and be seen. If you are looking for a great place in the perfect location this is it. Can't wait to go back.

My first visit to this boutique hotel. Personalized service, beautiful functional rooms and a great indoor pool were the highpoints. It has a great location between the theater district and Central Park. Breakfast is pricey and nice but not a typical American Breakfast. I loved this hotel and would return if I am back in Midtown.

We spent three nights at this lovely hotel in april and had two connecting rooms.... The highlight of the hotel though is the lounge area on the main reception floor. The chandeliers and eccentric over the top decor, still remains very tasteful. Lovely breakfasts, and cocktails in the evening. The bar is also VERY chic, but a little too loud for our taste and very popular so therefore crowded. Our course this hotel is expensive.... but you get what you pay for.

Common spaces such as the grand salon are great areas to relax and enjoy a delicious meal and have a cocktail in signature Bacarrat crystal.

The Baccarat Hotel is amazing and if you can, try to book a massage with Diane at the La Mer spa on the bottom floor, you won't be disappointed. The spa is beautiful and the staff could not be nicer or more accommodating but The massage therapist named Diane makes this spa experience incredible. I have traveled all over the world and I have gone to every spa along the way and Diane is the best by far. She's an incredible therapist and a very nice person. I live in the west village but I battle the uptown traffic once a week just to see Diane for an incredible and relaxing massage. The La Mer Spa, staff, and Diane are a must if your are ever in NYC.

Well, I can tell you that it is all that! It is absolutely beautiful. All the crystal and rich colors in the public spaces give way to the gorgeous white bedrooms/suites... Just a beautiful place. Splurge, you will love it.

Four Points by Sheraton San Francisco Bay Bridge                         3.0                     Basic Hotel but good if traveling on BusinessStayed there June of 2013 for vacation, not as nice as I expected but clean and the customer service was excellent. All the staff was nice, it is centrally located to San Francisco, Concord, Oakland, and Richmond/Napa. Unfortunately one of the elevators was broke for the entire 6 days I stayed there. The swimming pool has yellow tape around it for 5 out of the 6 days we stayed there so I was unable to swim. The Jacuzzi worked but both the pool and Jacuzzi had huge handicap machines next to them so cosmetically the pool area did not look that attractive the way it looks on their website.                                          4 years ago                     by Drwilla                                              from New York, NY                                      Open Four Points by Sheraton San Francisco Bay Bridge hotel guest reviewsRed Lion Hotel Oakland International Airport                         4.0                     Close to Oakland Airport with reasonable ratesThe hotel is very close to the airport with easy access. The rooms were nice appointed, well maintained and relatively clean.I did note something sticky on the dresser from a previous guest that hadn't been cleaned off(which I did) and when I returned for my second night, I noticed the carpet hadn't been vacuumed. Trash can liners TOO small; after throwing one item in them, the fell off the edges and it was impossible to insure trash went in the liner. The breakfast buffet (that came with my room package) was very good-freshly made food and included ethnic Chinese food one morning because a tour group had stayed at the hotel-I found this very accommodating. I was surprised that yogurt wasn't available, however, since it is so popular and common at other hotel breakfasts and buffets. There was no hotel directory in the room so hard to find TV channels, location of restaurant and fitness center, etc. When I asked at the desk, they said there were none-that was a first for me, even at lower cost hotels!                                           3 months ago                     by A verified traveler                                              from San Diego                                      Open Red Lion Hotel Oakland International Airport hotel guest reviewsExtended Stay America Oakland - Alameda Airport                         4.0                     Nice and clean!It is a decent hotel for what you pay.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
