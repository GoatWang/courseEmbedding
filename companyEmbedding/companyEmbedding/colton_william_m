                Oil company says it fully appreciates global climate risks
            



                Senior executive says Exxon admires, supports Paris accord

Exxon Mobil Corp., the U.S. oil giant that’s facing investigations over what it knew and when about climate change, sees the Paris agreement to mitigate global warming as a “monumental” achievement, according to a top executive.The company supports the December 2015 Paris accord as a “very meaningful and constructive process,” William M. Colton, Exxon’s vice president for corporate strategic planning, said in an interview in Berlin on Wednesday. Adhering to the accord’s commitments are achievable and compatible with Exxon’s business strategy, he said.President Donald Trump’s pick for secretary of state, former Exxon Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson, cleared a key confirmation hurdle Tuesday in Washington, overcoming objections that his appointment would threaten climate-change efforts. Before taking office, Trump dubbed global warming a Chinese invention to hurt U.S. manufacturing and subsequently promised to keep an “open mind” on the Paris deal.








Exxon “fully appreciates and acknowledges the risk posed by climate change,” Colton said, following a panel discussion at an energy conference. “We really admire the Paris process, where you have all the major nations of the world coming together on a global basis -- for it is a global challenge.”Court FightsExxon lost a bid earlier this month to block a subpoena by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey as part of her investigation into whether the company misled consumers and investors about the potential impact of climate change on its finances. Irving, Texas-based Exxon for months has been fighting in state courts in Massachusetts and New York, as well as in federal court in Texas, to block probes by Healey and New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman.The Paris agreement entered force Nov. 4, binding its signatories to keep a global temperature rise “well below” 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) from pre-industrial levels.Trump may opt to keep the U.S. in the Paris Accord while effectively reneging on commitments, according to Liz Gallagher, senior associate at the policy research group E3G, who has been critical of the administration’s climate policy. While the likelihood of the U.S. withdrawing from the Paris Accord is narrowing, “staying in and undermining it from within would be just as bad,” she said.‘America First’

Tillerson said earlier this month that the U.S. should stay “at the table” on the Paris climate pact and hinted that Trump conceivably could keep the U.S. in the deal -- as long as it can be squared with his “America first” campaign vow. Trump stoked conflict this week with climate activists and native Americans by rescinding a decision by former President Barack Obama to block construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access oil pipelines.




Exxon, which expects oil to remain the primary global energy source through 2030, sets the most store on technology to curb greenhouse gas emissions, Colton said. Global carbon dioxide emissions will peak in the 2030s and then fall as energy efficiency and clean power increase, he said.

In a bottomless moan that started deep in his throat and exploded into his lungs before slamming like a fist into the depths of his gut Tom Colton had never known such fear. He’s in way over his head. He’s a frustrated attorney who joins the CIA to repay America for his family’s honor. He’s sent to Riyadh and on his first day he’s kidnapped, heavily drugged and scheduled to have his head cut off and thrown into a camel’s trough. What can he do? He can’t think straight; he’s bound and gagged with only minutes to live…. What would you do? 

Colton begins with the terror of Dean Koontz’s “Intensity,” and follows with the gut-wrenching action of Ludlum’s “The Bourne Identity.” It’s a great ride you won’t want to miss.

Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice Form
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") is a United States copyright law that provides guidelines for online service providers in case of copyright infringement. Below is the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to us as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the DMCA, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office website, http://www.copyright.gov.
To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide us with the items specified below. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that the material is infringing your copyright. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
This notice and any attachments we receive will be forwarded to the alleged infringer, who will then have the opportunity to file a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. Should a properly filed counter notification be filed, you will be notified and have 10 business days within which to file for a restraining order in Federal Court to prevent the reinstatement of the material.
