Product Description
Brian J.Millard – Channel Analysis. The Key to Improved Timing of Trades

 
It is shown that share prices consist of a proportion of random movement and a proportion of predictable cyclical movement. The amount of random movement and the status of the various cycles that make up the cyclical movement can be determined easily either by graphical method that needs no more than a chart of the share price, or by the use of moving averages. Channel analysis will show how these cycles should behave in the near future, giving the investor the key to the prediction of the future share price.
