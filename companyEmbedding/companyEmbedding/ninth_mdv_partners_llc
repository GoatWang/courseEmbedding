Adamas Pharmaceuticals, Inc. insider trades are found here. Insiders are officers, directors, or significant investors in a company.
            In general, it is generally illegal for insiders to make trades in their companies based on specific, non-public information. This does not mean
            it is illegal for them to make any trades in their own companies. However, they must report all trades to the SEC via a Form 4.
