Transmitting this data to users and / or healthcare professionals via a Smartphone App, the technology will allow real-time monitoring of medical conditions and chronic diseases for better management or treatment.
Encouraging compliance due to its ease and flexibility of use, our technology is expected to provide substantial savings to patients while potentially helping to significantly reduce future health complications for many medical conditions.
Applications
Key market applications include: diabetes, a growing concern for healthcare providers and governments across the globe as diabetes cases continue to soar.
Potential critical care applications include lactate monitoring to prevent lactic acidosis, a potentially fatal drop in the pH of tissues and blood due to a build-up of lactate after a trauma or depletion of body fluids.

Nemaura Medical Announces Joint Venture for European Launch of sugarBEAT® System | Business Wire


























































Nemaura Medical Announces Joint Venture for European Launch 
      of sugarBEAT® System






December 02, 2015 09:06 AM Eastern Standard Time



LOUGHBOROUGH, England--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nemaura Medical Inc. (OTC BB: NMRD),("Nemaura"), a 
      medical device company developing a minimally invasive wireless 
      continuous glucose monitoring (“CGM”) system known as sugarBEAT®, 
      announced today that it has entered into an equal Joint Venture 
      agreement with DBJ Jersey to market the sugarBEAT® system in 
      Europe.
    


      The sugarBEAT® CGM System is designed to display real time 
      glucose readings on the device and on a mobile phone app via blue tooth, 
      or allow retrospective evaluation of the data for glucose trending. 
      Nemaura has patents that allow the device to self-calibrate using an 
      internal standard concept, which is expected to eliminate the need for 
      routine daily finger-prick calibrations. The company anticipates a 
      launch in Europe during 2016, pending obtaining requisite product 
      approvals, for which the operational aspects of the launch will be 
      entirely managed by DBJ Jersey under the terms of the agreement, with 
      product support from Nemaura Medical.
    

      DBJ Jersey is headed by its founder, Dr. Dallas Burston (MBBS), a 
      pharmaceutical entrepreneur with an outstanding track record having 
      founded and sold companies in this field totaling over US$150M, with the 
      most recent sale led by Cavendish Corporate Finance.
    

      Dr. Burston stated, “The methods of measuring blood glucose levels, and 
      managing the longer-term complications of diabetes are expanding very 
      quickly. The landscape is rapidly changing towards less invasive 
      wearable devices. Europe represents a US$ 3 billion market opportunity 
      and together with intelligent use of data, I believe that there is 
      potential to reduce the overall healthcare burden.”
    

      In addition, Dr. Burston purchased 5 million shares in Nemaura Medical 
      for US$10M, and was issued a warrant to acquire an additional ten 
      million shares at an exercise price of $0.50, subject to customary 
      anti-dilution provisions and other conditions on exercise set forth in 
      the warrant agreement.
    

      Dr. Faz Chowdhury, CEO of Nemaura Medical Inc., stated “Nemaura's 
      sugarBEAT® system has been developed to provide a very cost 
      effective and minimally invasive alternative for diabetics. We are very 
      excited to have DBJ, with its impeccable track record of advancing the 
      adoption of new technologies, as our partner in Europe once requisite 
      product approvals have been obtained.”
    

About Nemaura Medical, Inc.


      Nemaura Medical is developing the sugarBEAT® System as a 
      minimally-invasive, wireless, continuous glucose monitoring system for 
      use as an adjunct device for blood glucose monitoring. Further 
      opportunity may exist for use of the device in intensive care hospital 
      settings, where continuous glucose monitoring is critical.

      development and preliminary marketing efforts, Nemaura’s ability to 
      secure additional commercial partnering arrangements, risks and 
      uncertainties relating to Nemaura and its partners' ability to develop, 
      market and sell the sugarBEAT® System, the availability of substantial 
      additional equity or debt capital to support its research, development 
      and product commercialization activities, and the success of its 
      research, development, regulatory approval, marketing and distribution 
      plans and strategies, including those plans and strategies related to 
      its sugarBEAT® System. These and other risks and 
      uncertainties are identified and described in more detail in Nemaura’s 
      filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, without 
      limitation, its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the current year, its

Nemaura Medical Inc., to present sugarBEAT® Poster at the Advanced Technologies and Treatments for Diabetes Symposium (ATTD) in Paris, February 16th 2017 | Business Wire


























































Nemaura Medical Inc., to present sugarBEAT® 
      Poster at the Advanced Technologies and Treatments for Diabetes 
      Symposium (ATTD) in Paris, February 16th 2017






February 15, 2017 06:18 AM Eastern Standard Time



LOUGHBOROUGH, England--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nemaura Medical Inc. (OTC BB:NMRD), (“Nemaura”), a medical device 
      company developing a non-invasive, needle-free, pain-free, 
      daily-disposable, and cost effective wireless CGM (Continuous Glucose 
      Monitoring) patch known as sugarBEAT® today announced that 
      its multicentre open label clinical study has been selected for poster 
      exhibit at the Advanced Technologies and Treatments for Diabetes (ATTD) 
      Conference in Paris from the 15th to 18th February 
      2017.
    


      The poster will illustrate sugarBEAT®’s miniaturized wireless 
      format, as a discreet coin sized oval device less than 10mm in height, 
      and also showcase the sugarBEAT® mobile phone application 
      which is designed to display blood glucose readings at any point in time 
      and provide summary ambulatory glucose profiles (AGP).
    

      The company expects to launch sugarBEAT® in Europe this year 
      through its European Licensee, and following two rounds of discussions 
      with the FDA Nemaura has completed its clinical investigation plan (CIP) 
      for a PMA application, and expects to complete the studies for a PMA 
      submission by the end of the year.
    

      SugarBEAT® is expected to be cost competitive due to its 
      non-invasive design and low-cost consumables. These consist of a 
      reusable electronic body-worn device and daily disposable patches, 
      linked to a smart phone app.
    

      Nemaura Medical CEO Dr Faz Chowdhury said: “Our sugarBEAT® 
      technology is a more flexible way for anyone living with diabetes to 
      monitor their glucose levels. Users can choose which days to wear the 
      patch, without having to endure long wear durations of up to 14 days”.
    

      The 10th annual conference on Technologies and Treatments for 
      Diabetes will attract over 2,500 delegates from all over the globe. The 
      conference is attended by the world’s leading researchers, clinical 
      practitioners and Industry/corporate professionals, and provides a forum 
      for lively exchange of ideas and research relating to technologies, 
      treatment and prevention of diabetes related illnesses.
    

About Nemaura Medical, Inc.


      Nemaura Medical is developing the sugarBEAT® System as a 
      non-invasive, needle-free, pain-free and cost-effective wireless, 
      continuous glucose monitoring system (CGM) for use as an adjunct device 
      for blood glucose monitoring. Further opportunity may exist for use of 
      the device in intensive care hospital settings, where continuous glucose 
      monitoring is critical.

The future of diagnostic technology














Replacing traditional invasive methods of diagnosis and healthcare observation procedures, our BEAT™ technology will allow for remote continuous monitoring of chronic diseases and health conditions.
An intuitive patient-friendly daily disposable skin-patch, applied while the user goes about their daily life, it is expected to significantly reduce the current and future burden on healthcare services by greatly enhancing health and wellness or disease management.









How it works




Passing a mild, non-perceptible electric current across the skin, our patented BEAT™ technology draws a small amount of selected molecules, such as glucose, into a patch placed on the skin. These molecules are drawn out of the interstitial fluid which naturally sits just below the top layer of skin.
Via a sensor, the patient-friendly patch measures the amount of that molecule present, converting it into a meaningful concentration value for clinical diagnosis or preliminary guidance for self-treatment.

















Multiple Applications




Easily extended to other molecules (or analytes) and medicinal drugs present in the interstitial fluid of the skin, our BEAT™ technology has broad ranging potential clinical and non-clinical applications, including:

– Diabetes (glucose monitoring)
– Athletic performance monitoring (lactate monitoring)
– Intensive care (glucose monitoring and oxygen depletion)

 
Our blood glucose monitoring product, sugarBEAT® is anticipated to launch in Europe in 2017, with at least one additional application expected to also commence clinical trials in 2017.











SugarBEAT®

Suitable for Type 1, Type 2 and pre-diabetics, sugarBEAT® provides real-time monitoring for better health management  through its non-invasive, affordable, patented wearable technology.

Nemaura Medical Inc., a medical device company developing a minimally invasive, needle-free, wireless CGM (Continuous Glucose Monitoring) patch known as sugarBEAT, today announced that it has signed a letter of intent (LOI) with a Chinese corporation, Shenzen CAS Health Corporation Limited, which is a partially owned subsidiary of the Chinese Academy of Science.
The letter of intent covers three potential joint venture arrangements relating specifically to sugarBEAT including (a) setting up a joint venture company to distribute in China, (b) setting up a manufacturing facility in China and (c) obtaining CFDA approval. Nemaura Medical recognizes the size and importance of the Chinese market. As a result, the Company has prioritized obtaining CFDA regulatory approvals as the next step in fulfilling a primary objective under the LOI.
Nemaura Medical anticipates a sugarBEAT product launch in Europe in 2017, where it has previously obtained CE approval. In the U.S., Nemaura Medical has had discussions with the FDA and anticipates completing its clinical program and submitting a PMA application around mid 2017.
SugarBEAT differs from existing CGM’s given it comprises an adhesive daily-disposable skin-patch which does not require insertion of a needle-like sensor inside the skin. SugarBEAT also provides users with tremendous flexibility as to when and how often they choose to wear the patch. Both of these factors are expected to empower users in a way current CGM’s cannot.
About Nemaura Medical, Inc.
Nemaura Medical is developing the sugarBEAT System as a minimally-invasive, needle-free, wireless, continuous glucose monitoring system for use as an adjunct device for blood glucose monitoring. Further opportunity may exist for use of the device in intensive care hospital settings, where continuous glucose monitoring is critical.
