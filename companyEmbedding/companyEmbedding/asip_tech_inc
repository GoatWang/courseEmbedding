AS-IP Tech, Inc.  IPTK www.asiptech.com          Corporate History In 2007 ASIP Tech, Inc., licensed ASIQ Pty. Ltd. to commercialise a new inflight connectivity concept (originally known as Safecell), to establish an alternative course of connectivity in the global aerospace industry. Several years of R&D and flight testing led to the creation of BizjetMobile for corporate jets, and fflya for airlines. The core technology uses Bluetooth to connect multiple clients in a closed-network to facilitate data optimization and cost control.    The first BizjetMobile product was launched in 2014, and by the end of 2015 over forty installations had been completed globally. ASIQ had successfully delivered to AS-IP Tech, Inc. a full commercialised global program. By the start of 2016 the core technology had been flight-proven and ASIP distributor in Europe signed its first fleet deal with Jetfly.   ASIP is driving this development of an exciting new inflight connectivity solution that will revolutionise connectivity in the airline world. Our mission is to be the first in the world to deliver inflight communications to airline passengers for the same price in the air as on the ground.    ASIP is a public-listed USA company incorporated in Delaware.  			  Products  ASIP is a World Leader in Bluetooth Smart Inflight Connectivity Solutions.  ASIP has created an alternative to Wi-Fi that utilises Bluetooth Smart technology to deliver low-cost airline and corporate jet communications. CHiiMP Smart CHiiMP Smart is the world's first inflight connectivity solution to utilise Bluetooth Smart technology and connect via the Iridium satellite constellation.  CHiiMP Smart is the smallest, lightest and most inexpensive connectivity system in the industry, creating an intelligent gateway for all voice and messaging communications on your aircraft.  KONNG KONNG is a pay-as-you-go live Internet App that provides passengers with real-time information on data usage and cost. KONNG provides live Internet for surfing the web and downloading large files, in addition to unlimited global SMS and connectivity to your email.  KONNG comes with a free router that connects via any existing Wi-Fi network on your aircraft.  fflya  fflya is the world's first Bluetooth Smart App specifically designed for commercial airlines.  fflya delivers free app messaging and destination savings that will enhance the passenger's flight experience and allow the airline to earn revenue without having to charge. fflya leverages off the latest narrowband networks to deliver inflight messaging - the number one service that every traveller wants. 			   Management DIRECTORS  RICHARD LUKSO - Chairman & Director Richard is Chairman and Director for ASIP Tech, Inc. After commencing his aviation career in 1953 at USMC Marine Air Wing, Richard went on to claim senior executive positions at Lear Inc., Garrett Airesearch and Learjet. In 1988 Richard became President, GM and Co-owner of Securaplane Technologies Inc. Securaplane has since grown from five employees to 100 employees with five innovative products serving airlines and general aviation. In 2000, he sold Securaplane to the Danaher Corporation.  RON CHAPMAN - President Ron founded the ASI Group in 1986. He is currently a Director and President of ASIP Tech, Inc. Ron has successfully overseen product development and marketing across the ASI Group, having launched several products globally. Between 1983 and 1986 Ron formed Chapman International, a developer of home, marine and aircraft security systems. The incorporation of the ASI Group allowed Ron to develop the world's first monitored aircraft security surveillance system in the late 1980s.

AS-IP Tech, Inc.’s World’s First Bluetooth Smart Inflight 
      Connectivity Solution To Be Launched by Jetfly






May 24, 2016 11:49 AM Eastern Daylight Time



GENEVA, Switzerland--(BUSINESS WIRE)--AS-IP Tech, Inc. (OTCMKTS:IPTK) announced today that its distributor 
      BizjetMobile Europe has secured Jetfly as the launch customer for CHiiMP 
      Smart, the world’s first Bluetooth Smart inflight connectivity solution.
    

      CHiiMP Smart was unveiled at the European Business Aviation Convention & 
      Exhibition (EBACE) as the smallest, lightest and most inexpensive 
      inflight connectivity system in the industry that utilises Bluetooth 
      Smart technology to provide voice, text and email functions.
    

      At EBACE, Jetfly CEO Cedric Lescop said, “We’re excited to be installing 
      the CHiiMP Smart system on our fleet of Pilatus PC-12’s. Our aircraft 
      owners, crew and clients will now be able to stay in contact wherever 
      and whenever they fly. We chose CHiiMP Smart because of its simplicity, 
      easy installation and low operating costs. It will further enhance our 
      commitment to be ‘simply closer.’”
    

      AS-IP Tech, Inc. CEO Ron Chapman said, “AS-IP Tech, Inc. is pioneering 
      an alternate course of connectivity in the global aerospace industry. We 
      expect CHiiMP Smart to show the world that our range of Bluetooth Smart 
      connectivity solutions are an exciting alternative to the traditionally 
      expensive Wi-Fi platform. Our ambition is to be the first in the world 
      to deliver inflight communications to passengers for the same price in 
      the air as on the ground. We believe AS-IP Tech, Inc.’s unique Bluetooth 
      Smart platform will be the catalyst that upheaves traditional 
      communication models on airlines and beyond.”
