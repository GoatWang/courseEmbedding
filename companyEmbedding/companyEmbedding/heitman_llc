Private Real Estate — Equity
A known leader in the development of private equity investment strategies, Heitman actively manages separate account and commingled fund portfolios across North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. Our core, value-added, and opportunistic strategies stem from decades of experience, focusing on our clients along with their risk and return objectives to consistently generate competitive overall returns.









Global investment strategies 
We acquire property outright or acquire interests in joint venture formats for our clients. Our experience spans across property types, both traditional (e.g., office, industrial, rented residential, and retail) as well as specialty (e.g., self-storage, senior housing, and student housing). Our investment professionals are skilled at executing investments across the risk/return spectrum. The private equity team has extensive resources, including accounting, acquisitions, dispositions, portfolio and asset management, due diligence, and construction/engineering professionals. The team is supported by the broader Heitman platform, which includes all of our key business service groups.  


Extensive experience
Heitman has over 30 years of experience investing in private real estate equity. Our real estate experience, business platform, and investment track record make us one of the leading managers in the industry. Our business is structured to provide the highest level of service and meet the objectives of our investors. We have built our reputation on a track record of strategically investing on behalf of our clients. Through periods of market recovery and expansion or market correction, we have maintained an active market presence, searching for mispriced opportunities, building our client base, and expanding our organization's resources.
















Global investment philosophy
Our collaborative, multi-disciplined approach to investment has been shaped over multiple market cycles. We are acutely aware of each property sector’s vulnerabilities and behavior during periods of illiquidity, as well as its potential under improving economic conditions. Our time-tested investment philosophy and process is based on three key principles: 










FOCUS




Emphasis on high-quality, well-located property with the functional attributes to stand the test of time. 









DISCIPLINE




Conduct extensive analysis and risk mitigation to ensure that investments meet our standards.









VALUE CREATION




Identify inefficiencies to implement value-creation programs through active asset management, strategically using capital at each stage of the process.














Global Assets Under Management









33.6
Billion in assets under management
USD as of June 30, 2017










 


Investing in private real estate equity has been a cornerstone of our firm over the past 30 years. We offer investment strategies across the risk/return spectrum. 

Our approach is customized to achieve our clients’ goals. We focus on three primary strategies:
Core
Concentrated on investments in high-quality “stabilized” property, where a large percentage of the total return is generated by current income with low volatility. Portfolio construction is driven by sector weightings and asset selection that consider the economic exposure of a particular metropolitan area and geography.

Global or regional separate account
Commingled fund
Collective investment trust

Value-added
Consists of investments in “non-stabilized” property, where approximately half the total return is generated by growth with higher volatility. Investments with this risk profile are typically time-sensitive and by their nature are in a less efficient part of the investable universe. We seek quality property where we can identify a physical, operational, or financial improvement opportunity that we can address through active management and that has been mispriced by the market. Higher leverage is typically employed as part of the capitalization to enhance the return on equity.

Global or regional separate account
Commingled fund

Opportunistic
Designed for clients who seek investments in “non-stabilized” property, where the majority of the total return is generated by growth with higher volatility. These investments are typically capitalized utilizing a higher level of leverage to enhance the return on equity.

Global or regional separate account

 
For more information on how to access these solutions, please visit the Vehicles page.
 

 

 
 


We strive to build long-standing partnerships with our clients — we succeed when they succeed. 

Recognizing that no two investors are the same, we provide clients several alternatives for accessing our private equity investment capabilities. Commingled funds
Heitman has formed and managed nearly 30 commingled fund portfolios since the 1980s. We offer both open- and closed-end commingled fund opportunities in North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. Current commingled offerings include:
Core

Heitman America Real Estate Trust: Core, open-end North American fund with the primary strategy of investing in stabilized properties. Capital raising is ongoing and commitments are accepted on a quarterly basis.


Heitman European Residential Investment Partners: Core/core-plus, closed-end European fund with the primary strategy of acquiring and managing rented residential assets in Western Europe, primarily within Germany and the Netherlands.

Value-added

Heitman Value Partners series: Value-added, closed-end North American fund series with the primary strategy of forming property-level joint ventures with public and private real estate operating companies to implement value-creation strategies using capital wisely, along with active management to enhance the investment returns.


Heitman European Property Partners series: Value-added, closed-end European fund series with the primary strategy of implementing physical, financial, or operational value-creation strategies using capital wisely, along with active management to enhance the investment returns.


Heitman Asia-Pacific Property Investors: Value-added, closed-end Asia-Pacific fund series with the primary strategy of forming property-level joint ventures with public and private real estate operating companies in the region to implement value-creation strategies using capital wisely, along with active management to enhance the investment returns. We are currently marketing the first fund in the series.

Defined Contribution – CITs
Heitman offers collective investment trusts, or CITs, to professional managers of defined contribution plans such as 401(k)s and other similar qualified retirement plans. CITs are transparent and operationally-friendly for defined contribution plans such as target date funds and real asset strategies. Heitman’s CITs provide a meaningful real estate allocation and the pursuit of improved retirement savings outcomes through stable income return and real asset diversification.
 
Our CITs trade via the National Securities Clearing Corporation with daily valuation, and provide access to private, core, commercial real estate assets that mutual funds cannot accommodate. This vehicle can also be utilized for public equity strategies. Current private equity CIT offerings include:
Core

Heitman Real Estate Retirement Strategy: HRS allocates 85% of funds to Heitman America Real Estate Trust, the firm’s marquee private, open-ended, core real estate investment strategy, and 15% to Heitman’s US Diversified Strategy, in a CIT that offers institutional-tiered pricing. Through these complementary strategies, HRS delivers access to daily-valued private, core commercial real estate across a diversified mix of property types and geographies that are designed to generate consistent income return and outperformance.

Separate account
Heitman has managed assets in separate account formats for a variety of clients for over 30 years. Our approach to these relationships is customized to meet or exceed each client’s needs and objectives. Each relationship is managed by a seasoned team of real estate investment professionals. Minimum relationship size may vary depending on a client’s return and risk objectives, in addition to the strategy and region in which it’s executed.

The Heitman Difference
In a business where changing market conditions are as much a constant as unexpected challenges, what differentiates a leading company is how it navigates these challenges to meet its goals. We embrace an environment of intellectual honesty as a cornerstone of our foundation. What does this mean? It means that we thoughtfully plan each step of our evolution, communicating transparently and respectfully. And we put all hands on deck, bringing our best investment, management, and research expertise together in one nimble, multi-disciplined team.

















Delivering on trust
We don’t just work for our clients — we work to know them, building relationships over time and helping them see every angle of an investment. We earn their trust and their business by delivering the outcome they’re seeking while working to exceed their expectations. Over multiple economic and property market cycles, through capital market downturn and improvement, we have applied our knowledge, experience, and dedication to forging effective client relationships.

Synthesizing research

We integrate research and investment in real time, with truly multi-disciplinary teams that are more informed, in-tune, and invested in your success.





















Integrating multiple disciplines
We are active in three key segments of the global real estate property and capital markets, with over $38 billion in assets under management. Our private and public market investment teams are based on the ground in North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific to execute investment strategies across the risk/return spectrum for our clients.
Our three complementary business units foster a creative atmosphere within Heitman that translates into an information exchange, helping the firm stay abreast of changing conditions in all areas of real estate across the globe.



Ownership in our business
Heitman is 50% owned by senior officers who control all strategic, ownership, and day-to-day operational decisions.
This ownership structure results in a distinct and valuable alignment of interest between Heitman and our clients, and creates proper incentives to meet or exceed our clients' investment objectives. Our investment professionals' total compensation is tied directly to the performance of the investments under their management and the degree to which they’ve met client objectives over multiple periods.






















Leading with experience
Our real estate investment solutions are created by some of the most experienced and innovative professionals in the industry. Headquartered in Chicago since 1966 with offices on four continents, Heitman’s senior managers have an average of 28 years of industry experience. These leaders in the field have gained expertise investing across a variety of economic environments, from periods of property market decline to periods of recovery and expansion.


Meet the team













Executive Leadership
While history never repeats itself exactly, we believe that knowledge of past cycles gives predictive power, which translates into sound investment ideas. The collective experience of our executive team applies across the life cycle of an investment, from strategy setting and execution to realization.

Corporate social responsibility
We believe there is always room for goodness in the pursuit of greatness. Our corporate social responsibility initiatives are designed to define and differentiate us, and ensure our relevance in the global effort to improve the environment amid changing social conditions. These initiatives include:





















Building sustainabilityEvery aspect of a property affects the environment. For this reason, it’s crucial that we recognize the long-term implications of sustainability on building value, tenant location decisions, and global climate change, as well as the overall impact that our investments have on the environment. At Heitman, we understand the need to effectively incorporate sustainability into all of our investments in order to reduce our carbon footprint and contribute to global environmental initiatives.Responsible governanceOur internal policies and international business practices also consider the social and governance responsibilities of our operations. We have highly experienced compliance professionals who are responsible for ensuring that our business is run ethically and in accordance with all regulatory requirements under which our operations are governed. We incorporate responsible governance into our investment process by selecting service providers and operating partners who display strong ethical and corporate governance and meet our high standards for transparency and integrity. Additionally, we are supportive of the Institutional Limited Partners Association (ILPA) and similar organizations that stress the importance of responsible governance.Environmental awareness and efficiencyWe are aware that we can play an important role in contributing to long-term, global efforts to improve environmental conditions. Finding effective solutions to these challenges is a priority for Heitman. Our professionals and service providers keep abreast of advancements in technology and changes in environmental policies on a global basis to ensure our compliance with market standards at a minimum, including those defined by Energy Star and LEED certifications. We strive to improve energy and water consumption in our portfolios to create an investment outcome that balances the long-term needs of the community with the investment objectives of our clients.Civic involvementWorking to improve our communities is an extension of our company’s purpose. While Heitman employees make the most of our corporate donation and matching contribution programs, their commitment to community service goes beyond simply writing a check. In all of our regions, they take pride in coming together and devoting their time and energy to community projects such as cleaning up playgrounds, painting classrooms, and restoring interim housing facilities for the homeless.
