Business Standard: Cognizant’s Head of Continental Europe and Asia-Pacific Says Europe Merits Cognizant’s Continued Focus and Investment 

“The overall European IT services market is roughly the same size as the North American IT services market, yet the penetration of the global-delivery model in Europe is currently a fraction of that in North America. As such, Cognizant believes that Europe merits its continued focus and investment,” says Santosh Thomas, following Cognizant’s acquisition of Equinox, a financial services consulting firm in France.
“Today, European clients are looking to buy a broader range of services—consulting, applications, infrastructure, and business process services,” he adds. “Another significant shift Cognizant is seeing in Europe is that clients want to navigate both cyclical and structural shifts simultaneously. As such, they are seeking a partner who can drive cost-savings and innovation on one integrated platform, and are increasingly turning to partners such as Cognizant.”
Thomas says, “Europe is a very important market and the company continues to focus on the market. In particular, Cognizant focuses on building local teams on the ground across key markets in Europe such as France to address the specific needs of European clients. The leadership team of Equinox will help us fulfill those needs in the French market.”
He points out that the European market demands a localized approach to address linguistic and cultural differences. “Cognizant’s strategy is to build its talent for local domain, regulatory and language capabilities and better cultural compatibility to enter into transformational client partnerships.”
