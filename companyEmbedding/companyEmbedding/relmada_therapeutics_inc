Pain Treatment Market






Pain Market Characteristics

Largest prescription drug market in the world - 334 million RXs in US in 2013
Affects 1.5 billion people worldwide
Most frequent reason for physician visits in the United States
Affects more Americans than diabetes, heart disease, and cancer combined
US annual economic cost of health care due to pain is in excess of $560 billion
 






An Unsatisfied Market

Better pain drugs are needed
Only 55% feel their pain is âunder controlâ
Only 23% believe their pain medications are âvery effectiveâ
The unmet medical need allows new pain drugs to expand the market rather than interfere with existing products
Greater demand exists for new Extended Release (ER) products because of their limited availability in the market today
