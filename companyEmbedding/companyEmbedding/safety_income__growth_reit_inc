Replace TIPS With Safety, Income And Growth - Safety, Income and Growth Inc. (Pending:SAFE) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Replace TIPS With Safety, Income And GrowthJul.24.17 | About: Safety, Income (SAFE) Dane Bowler Value, hedge fund analyst, REITs, long/short equity2nd Market CapitalSummarySAFE is a new REIT with long-term potential.Its cashflows are eponymously safe relative to most equities.Ground leases provide stable income for decades.A new REIT, Safety, Income and Growth, Inc. (Pending:SAFE) provides a superior-risk adjusted return than TIPS. With about as much income surety as something that is not government insured can have, SAFE gives investors more than double the return of the iShares TIPS Bond ETF (NYSEARCA:TIP). Further, it provides a similar inflation hedge in that its revenues have CPI adjustments. Investors with a reasonable risk tolerance should look into SAFE as a higher return alternative to TIP. We will begin by introducing this brand new REIT and follow with a demonstration of its advantages over TIP. Additionally, once it starts paying a yield, which management is targeting at 3%, it will provide a larger current return. The Company Safety, Income and Growth Inc., is a New York-based REIT specializing in long-term land leases. Through ownership of land in prominent areas, it collects a steady stream of income by leasing its land to the businesses and properties that sit on top of it. SAFE IPOed on 6/21/17 at $20 per share. 

 (Source: SNL Financial) In addition to its common stock, the company has an equal number of OP units and a $300 million credit facility. 

 (Source: SNL Financial) This capital structure leaves SAFE with an implied market cap of just over $700 million.
 

 (Source: SNL Financial) It is still rather small but bigger than most REITs that are just starting out. At $700 million, it is large enough to be included in the RMZ, which gets it in the hands of institutions and ETFs. With a total of 12 properties, the REIT has spent most of the money it raised in the IPO. 

 (Source: SNL Financial) While REITs have had land lease assets before, this is the first one where such assets are the focus. Naturally, investors will have some questions, including the following:  What returns can be expected? What are the terms of the leases? How big is the total addressable market?  We will answer these questions with a look at SAFE's properties and leases as of the IPO, all of which are shown below. 

 (Source: SAFE prospectus) The property types as of the IPO were mostly hotel, with some office, 1 MOB, 1 multi-family and 1 self-storage. The most important column in the chart above is the ground rent coverage, which indicates the tenant's ability and willingness to pay. Ground leases sit at the op-co level, which puts them at the top of the food chain, pari passu with utility bills. If the tenant wants to operate their business, they must pay SAFE. In the event the tenant fails to pay, the REIT can take control of the land and the building on top of it. Thus, there is actually upside for SAFE in default, as it would get to claim ownership of the building, which is often more valuable than the land. In most cases, the land is only 30-40% of the value, with the collateral being worth significantly more.
 Given high rent coverage and the recourse in default, it is quite likely tenants will pay. SAFE's properties can be thought of as a proxy for growing perpetuities. The rents start out small but get big over time through CPI-based escalators. 

 (Source: SAFE prospectus) Total cash rent from its IPO portfolio is $17.4 million. Note the contrast with GAAP rent of $21.5 million. The difference here represents straight-lining, since GAAP reports the average rent over the life of the leases. Given the escalators and the lease terms as long as 99 years, it is quite a bit larger. Importantly, these are net leases, with the tenant responsible for taxes and maintenance of property. As such, rent is roughly equivalent to NOI. These properties were acquired from iStar at a 5% initial cash cap rate, indicating a value of $348 million. Any time properties are contributed in an IPO by the manager (iStar is the external manager of SAFE), we are skeptical. Such a contribution is an easy way for managers to give themselves a big payday and potentially even get far more than the properties are worth. Thus, we must analyze if a 5% cap rate on these properties is a fair deal for shareholders. Most ground leases on high-quality properties tend to go for 3-5%, so it is on the upper end of the range indicating a fair deal, but there are some property location concerns. I am a bit skeptical of the residual value of land in Detroit and Milwaukee. Let's take a closer look. The Milwaukee location is just off of highway 94 and within the main part of the city. 


 (Source: SAFE prospectus) This seems like a decent location, but it is definitely not a top MSA. The building itself has Class A apartments and looks quite nice, meaning the collateral is substantial. 

 (Source: SAFE prospectus) We are further comforted by strong rent coverage of 9.20X and a 96-year remaining lease term. 

 (Source: SAFE prospectus) The Detroit property is land that is ground-leased to an office tower shown below. 

 (Source: SAFE prospectus) Once again, I consider this ample collateral to protect from default, and the lease coverage is strong at 5X. Overall, I am inclined to believe that a 5% cap rate was fair for the initial portfolio. Pipeline The total addressable market for ground leases is quite large and somewhat untapped due to the lack of public funding for this sort of investment. Aside from SAFE, ground lease assets are mostly owned by wealthy individuals and some PE. Through iStar, SAFE has access to a considerably larger network than a $700 million REIT would typically have. This gives the REIT a pipeline well in excess of its available capital. Already in its short tenure as a public REIT, SAFE has made a sizable acquisition: a $142 million ground lease under an apartment complex on Hollywood Boulevard. The lease terms are shown below.
 

 (Source: SAFE prospectus) It is on a corner location, with the first floor retail and the rest apartments. 

 Short of California going underwater from some geological forces, this land will always be of value. It is a true trophy asset, but it comes with a trophy cap rate of just 3.52%. Valuation and expected returns If one agrees with my analysis that the initial properties were acquired at fair market value, SAFE is basically trading at its asset value. The IPO proceeds are still in cash, with the exception of the Hollywood Boulevard acquisition, which, in my opinion, was also at fair value. Thus, we think SAFE is at an acceptable price but not discounted. That being said, it still has an attractive risk adjusted return profile. Once the IPO capital is spent, the REIT should have a real return of ~4% annually. We call it a real return because a majority of the leases are CPI-adjusted, which provides an excellent inflation hedge. At 2nd Market Capital, we target a significantly larger return, so this one is not for us (at the current market price), but there are plenty of investors for whom SAFE makes a good investment. Its risk profile is about as low as an equity security's risk can be. Cash flow interruptions are likely to be rare or non-existent, and even if they happen, there is a healthy excess of collateral to make up for it. The long lease terms provide superior visibility into future cash flows, and the low leverage minimizes volatility.
 We began this article with a suggestion that SAFE is a better version of TIP, and we will elaborate on this conclusion below. Similar inflation hedge Just as Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities are intended to deliver a real return, SAFE's escalators convert its perpetuity-like cash flow stream into a real return. Similar cash flow security There is clearly going to be market price volatility due to the trading nature of equities, and there is slightly more long-term risk, as the cash flows are not guaranteed by the US government, but we view SAFE as having a low level of risk. For those with a long investment horizon that can tolerate a little bit of risk, SAFE is about as close as an equity can get to a government bond level of risk. Roughly double the returns TIP has a yield of 1.86%, which is less than half our estimated real return on SAFE of about 4%. Potential concerns SAFE does not currently pay a dividend, so those who need immediate income may not like this as an alternative to bonds. However, it is a REIT and will legally have to pay a dividend soon to maintain REIT status. In the prospectus, management indicated a $0.60 annual dividend, which is a yield of about 3%, but over time I expect this to grow to closer to $0.80. Another concern could be the external management. Many investors, particularly those in the REIT world, are leery of external management due to conflicts of interest which can cause managers to seek growth even when it is not accretive. The bottom line Those with some degree of risk tolerance who own TIP or other inflation-protected bonds should give some consideration to owning SAFE instead. It provides the same inflation hedge but with materially larger returns. Disclosure: This article is for informational purposes only.

New York Based REIT, Safety Income And Growth, Prepares For IPO - Safety, Income and Growth Inc. (Pending:SAFE) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»New York Based REIT, Safety Income And Growth, Prepares For IPOJun.21.17 | About: Safety, Income (SAFE) Don Dion Long/short equity, special situations, momentum, event-drivenMarketplaceIPO InsightsSummarySafety, Income and Growth has filed for an IPO seeking $215.3 million through its offering of 10.3 million shares.The commercial real estate company expects to price the IPO between $19 and $21 per share.The company will trade on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “SAFE.”.Its net lease structure, high quality portfolio, and experience management team make up optimistic on the deal. We recommend REIT investors consider investing.IPO article: Safety, Income and Growth On April 10, 2017, Safety, Income and Growth (Pending:SAFE) filed for an S-11/A (IPO) with the SEC, seeking to raise $215.3 million. The company plans to offer 10.25 million shares with 1.5 million shares as an over-allotment option for underwriters at a price range of between $19 to $21. iStar Inc., plans to purchase $45 million worth of shares at the IPO price at the time of the offering, representing a 27.6% stake in the company. Assuming SAFE prices at the mid-point of its proposed price range it would commend a fully diluted market cap value of $363.8M. The company is expected to IPO on Thursday (6.22). Underwriters for the IPO include: Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Raymond James and Associates, Mizuho Securities USA and Citigroup. The company plans to use approximately $142 million of its total proceeds from the offering to purchase the acquisition GNLs. Safety, Income and Growth is one of three REITs expected to IPO this week. Company Overview New York-based Safety, Income and Growth was founded in 2017 with the objective of acquiring, owning, managing, financing and capitalizing on ground net leases (GNLs). GNLs involves leasing land, typically for a long period of time (ranging from 30 to 99 years), to a tenant for the purpose of building real estate on the property and are most often "triple net" leases, which means the tenant is responsible for costs including: development costs, capital expenditures and all property operating expenses. The objective in creating the GNL provide a safe, secure and growing cash flow stream in the form of rental income. GNL lists the following criteria for properties: (i) the initial value of the GNL represents 30% to 45% of the Combined Property Value; (ii) the Ground Rent Coverage of the GNL is between 2.0x to 5.0x; and (iii) the GNL contains contractual rent escalation clauses or percentage rent that participates in gross revenues generated by the commercial real estate on the land.
 Currently its portfolio consists of 12 properties located in major metropolitan areas that were identified by iStar. It intends to acquire two additional GNLs shortly after the closing of the offering. After the IPO, SAFE will be externally managed by SFTY Manager LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of iStar. iStar has been an real estate investor for over 20 years. Based in New York, New York, it has $5.3 billion in total assets seven regional offices across the US. Although SAFE believes it's the first publicly-traded company formed to acquire and manage GNLs, it faces tough competition both for tenants as well as investment opportunities from other investors, financial institutions, real estate companies and numerous commercial developers for both tenants and investment opportunities. We first covered this deal on our IPO Insights Platform. Executive Management Jay Sugarman has served as the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of iStar Inc. since 1997. Previously, he founded and acted as Co-General Partner of Starwood Mezzanine Investors LP, a private investment partnership that specializes in structured real estate finance. Mr. Sugarman graduated summa cum laude from Princeton University and completed his Master of Business Administration degree at Harvard Business School. Nina B. Matis serves as chief investment officer since October 2016, as well as iStar's executive vice president, chief legal officer and chief investment officer, positions she has held since 2008. Ms. Matis previously served as a partner in the law firm of Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP, one of iStar's principal outside law firms. She received a B.A. degree, with honors, from Smith College and a J.D. degree from New York University School of Law. Financial Details SAFE has strong revenue growth. Revenue generated was: $18.5M, and 21.6M in 2015 and 2016, respectively, representing YOY growth of 17%. Interest expense has remained relatively consistent as a percentage of revenue. Interest expense was equal to 38% of revenue in 2016. Other expenses included real estate expense, depreciation and amortization, and general administration. The company has generated profits each year of $5.71M and $6.6M in 2015 and 2016, respectively.
 As of its IPO, SAFE has total assets of $155.6M and total debt obligations of $221.3M. 

 (S-11/A) Conclusion: Consider A Modest Investment SAFE's revenue growth, experienced management team, and relationship with iStar boosts our optimism it this deal. We also like that ground net leases offer greater certainty that tenants will make rent payments, due to the fact that if a tenant default, the GNL lessor typically has the right to regain possession of the land as well as take ownership of the building. This provides a strong incentive for tenants to make payments. Although rising interest rates and stiff competition in the real estate space add risk, we are bullish on the deal and recommend investors looking for increased exposure to the space consider a small investment. We hear the book continues to build.

IPO article: Safety, Income and Growth
On April 10, 2017, Safety, Income and Growth (Pending:SAFE) filed for an S-11/A (IPO) with the SEC, seeking to raise $215.3 million.
The company plans to offer 10.25 million shares with 1.5 million shares as an over-allotment option for underwriters at a price range of between $19 to $21. iStar Inc., plans to purchase $45 million worth of shares at the IPO price at the time of the offering, representing a 27.6% stake in the company.
Assuming SAFE prices at the mid-point of its proposed price range it would commend a fully diluted market cap value of $363.8M. The company is expected to IPO on Thursday (6.22).
Underwriters for the IPO include: Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Raymond James and Associates, Mizuho Securities USA and Citigroup. The company plans to use approximately $142 million of its total proceeds from the offering to purchase the acquisition GNLs.
Safety, Income and Growth is one of three REITs expected to IPO this week.
Company Overview
New York-based Safety, Income and Growth was founded in 2017 with the objective of acquiring, owning, managing, financing and capitalizing on ground net leases (GNLs). GNLs involves leasing land, typically for a long period of time (ranging from 30 to 99 years), to a tenant for the purpose of building real estate on the property and are most often "triple net" leases, which means the tenant is responsible for costs including: development costs, capital expenditures and all property operating expenses.
The objective in creating the GNL provide a safe, secure and growing cash flow stream in the form of rental income. GNL lists the following criteria for properties: (i) the initial value of the GNL represents 30% to 45% of the Combined Property Value; (ii) the Ground Rent Coverage of the GNL is between 2.0x to 5.0x; and (iii) the GNL contains contractual rent escalation clauses or percentage rent that participates in gross revenues generated by the commercial real estate on the land.

Clark Street Value: Safety, Income & Growth Inc: iStar's Ground Net Lease REIT

Safety, Income & Growth Inc: iStar's Ground Net Lease REIT






This is a pretty ridiculous name/logo right?  It's pretty clear the target market is yield hungry dividend investors who are looking "to sleep well at night".


Despite the awful name, I think iStar (STAR) has a chance to make this work (for iStar) as its a good sales pitch and would be a unique REIT in the market, plus they're selling 12 of their assets for $340MM or a ~5% cap rate.

This week, iStar filed the registration statement for a new REIT, Safety, Income & Growth Inc (SFTY), they've been kicking around quietly since last August.  According to the filing, it would be the first REIT targeted at ground net leases, a structure where the company would own the land, but not the building/improvements, and enter into very long term leases (30-99 years) with the building owner.  The safety part comes from the ground net lease structure, in the event of a default, despite only owning the land, the lessor can foreclose on both the land and the structure built on it.  The leasee and the mortgage lender (if there is one) on the property have every incentive to make the lease payment.  In effective, there's a significant overcollateralization built into the lease, the value of the lease is worth 30-45% of the combined value of the land/buildings, so often times in a foreclosure scenario a ground net lessor can make more than a full recovery.

At first I thought this was a public listing of the net lease JV iStar has setup with a sovereign wealth fund (GIC), however it appears to be a separate portfolio, but with investors in that fund participating in the SFTY IPO.  Safety, Income & Growth Inc will start out life with 12 assets from iStar's net lease portfolio, all 12 are either ground leases or at least look/function similarly if you squint.  The two primary assets will be One Ally Center which is the largest office building in Michigan, leased out to Ally Financial and PwC, and a portfolio of 5 Hilton branded hotels leased to the recent spinoff, Park Hotels & Resorts.


A good strategy in recent years has been buying net lease REITs that are discounted because of concentrated tenant exposure (GPT, FCPT, CSAL)  before they make deals to diversify their rent roll.  iStar says they're looking at a pipeline of over $500MM ground net lease deals, so expect them to diversify fairly quickly after listing.  They're starting with $227MM in debt at a rate of 3.773%, after the deal is done they'll enter into a new $300MM credit facility giving them additional room to add ground leases.

iStar will be the external manager of SFTY, it'll have one of the more unique external management agreements I've seen: 1) waiving their fee altogether for the first year, 2) no incentive fee or termination fee, 3) base management fee of 1% on equity up to $2.5B and 0.75% above, 4) the management fee will be paid in stock.  Granted, there's little work in managing a lease that expires in 2114 (doesn't even look like a valid year), but it's another reason this entity should be an easy to sell to the masses.

Safety, Income & Growth is paying about a 5% cap rate for iStar's assets (combination of cash and stock), the company argues that ground net leases should trade even lower than that:


This seems somewhat reasonable given the overcollateralization built into the structure, if it trades anywhere near a 4.5% cap rate, iStar should be able to source a lot of deals that make sense, especially early on when they can do small individual deals that still move the needle.

We're still waiting on an IPO date, but again, I think this has potential to do well and gather a decent amount of assets.

What does this all mean for iStar?
At year end, they had a $1.5B net lease portfolio (includes accumulated depreciation added back) that generated an NOI yield of 9.1%, in my initial post last summer I argued the net lease portfolio should be valued at 6.5% cap rate, which adds about $600MM mark-to-market above the carrying value on iStar's balance sheet.  It's probably incorrect to assign a 5% cap rate to the entire portfolio, but that would produce a $1.2B mark-to-market gain, quite significant for a company with a market cap of $1B.  But now iStar monetizes some assets at an attractive valuation by putting them in a simpler vehicle the market will be able to digest and assign a higher multiple to -- all while earning a (small) carry on their remaining investment going forward.  It's hard to argue iStar is anything but very cheap, hopefully they use some of the proceeds to buyback stock.

Thanks to the commenter in the original iStar post for bringing this deal to my attention.

AnonymousApril 12, 2017 at 10:10 AMWhen you say that iStar is the manager of the new entity, are we referring to our REIT iStar, or to the external manager of that entity.  In other words, does this management fee accrue to us or to Jay Sugarman?ReplyDeleteRepliesMDCApril 12, 2017 at 10:43 AMiStar is an internally managed REIT, the new entity will be managed by iStar, so the management fee accrues to iStar the company, not Jay Sugarman personally.DeleteReplyAnonymousApril 12, 2017 at 10:20 AMyou waste no time! I have been following iStar as I consider Sugarman a master of sorts with out he managed capital allocation through the crisis. I still struggle to see a favorable risk / reward on the STAR business given liquidity/leverage levels but this newco is interesting. It is a way to sort of revalue a portion of the book to a higher multiple while receiving cash flows to delever but struggling to quantify benefit at Star. Any thoughts? See analysis here https://twitter.com/IveBeenHad/status/852176539429023744ReplyDeleteRepliesMDCApril 12, 2017 at 10:54 AMYou view STAR as a forced seller?  Seems harsh or a mischaracterization of their situation in my mind.  I do like that they're a seller generally, seems like the right time in the cycle and would help unveil the value. But given they have access to the capital markets -just recently refinanced their term facility like everyone else - I think they can be more opportunistic.DeleteReplyAnonymousApril 12, 2017 at 11:20 AMMaybe forced seller is too harsh a word but liquidity this year is tight while timing of cash flows from development book is lumpy.  Interest expense alone consumes up nearly their entire cash income from the "stable" assets including pref. payments.  Cash G&A adds another $80 million plus guided capex of $100M+.  I realize prefs can be deferred but still looks harsh. The gap needs to come from land production, remaining condos, and asset monetizations from its existing stable book (e.g. net leases). ReplyDeleteAnonymousApril 12, 2017 at 11:58 AMAgree maturities this year are a concern and will require some monetizations but should be manageable. This should help a bit:http://www.bizjournals.com/southflorida/news/2017/04/10/lennar-to-restate-earnings-after-losing-140m-to.htmlPlus, sale of Apple Silicon Valley GNL for total of $75-$100 million in total (~$35 million GNL to SFTY) should also help. -KHReplyDeleteAnonymousApril 12, 2017 at 3:41 PMany idea when istar will reinstate dividends? and how much?ReplyDeleteRepliesMDCApril 12, 2017 at 4:04 PMNo, but I would be surprised if it was any time soon.DeleteReplyAnonymousApril 12, 2017 at 5:33 PMany idea with all the recent transations, settlements and spin off, what's the leftover NOLs carrying over? And do iStar shareholders get any new shares for the GNL?ReplyDeleteRepliesMDCApril 12, 2017 at 8:03 PMThe latest NOL number in the 10-K was $902.9MM.  Shareholders won't get shares directly, its not a true spinoff, iStar has created a new entity and is selling some of their assets into SFTY.  As part of the transaction, iStar is receiving some stock in SFTY, so shareholders will indirectly benefit that way if its well received by the market.  There's a part of me that is interested in SFTY if it trades cheaply initially, might take a little time for the market to warm up to the idea.DeleteReplyAnonymousApril 15, 2017 at 12:46 PMHey MDC, I love the write-ups. Very interesting stuff. Any new thoughts on DFIN? Thanks!ReplyDeleteRepliesMDCApril 17, 2017 at 8:10 AMI'm still holding DFIN, it's pretty clear they were completely unprepared for the spinoff and operating separately, management has been all over the place on expense guidance and that Form 10 bothers me a bit, misleading how much of their revenue was really recurring in nature.  But the IPO market seems to be picking back up, so maybe they have a bounce back year on the transactional side of the business, its cheap and all of the near term cash flow is earmarked at debt reduction which I view as a positive.  Thanks for reading.DeleteReplyAnonymousApril 22, 2017 at 4:20 PMisn't istar's leverage low? 2x? many reits out there are way more leveraged. and they are profitable, no? a bit confused from comments. If it wasn't for their NOL's, they would be paying dividends now? they only issue now is the remaining land porfolio which has improved a lot.ReplyDeleteRepliesMDCApril 24, 2017 at 4:06 PMThe 2x headline number includes the preferred stock as equity, if you buy the common shares, its more effectively debt so the leverage is a lot higher.  I think the others are bringing up the near term maturities more than the absolute level of leverage.DeleteReplyADLApril 25, 2017 at 12:18 AMSo happy to have stumbled onto this blog. STAR is one of my largest long-term holdings (along with BBXT, RDNT, Fincantieri...). Have you ever taken a look at BRT? Pretty plain vanilla middling REIT at this point, with NOLs likely to be exhausted in the next 2 years or so and a dividend reinstated unless they find some creative way to avoid or blow up. Gould Investors, their external manager, is something I've been meaning to spend some time on as well. Thanks for the blog--great stuff!ReplyDeleteRepliesMDCApril 25, 2017 at 8:37 AMNot familiar with BRT, thanks for the idea, I'll add to my research list.DeleteReplyAdd commentLoad more...
