We estimate that we will receive net proceeds from this offering, after
deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and the estimated
offering expenses payable by us and based upon an assumed initial public
offering price of US$6 per Ordinary Share, of approximately $5,485,000 if we
sell the minimum number of Ordinary Shares and approximately $9,205,000 if we
sell the maximum number of Ordinary Shares. Assuming the number of Ordinary
Shares offered by us as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus remains
the same, and after deduction of the estimated commissions to the underwriter
and the estimated offering expenses payable by us, a US$1.00 increase (decrease)
in the assumed initial public offering price of US$6.00 per Ordinary Share would
increase (decrease) the net proceeds of this offering by approximately US$1.0
million if the minimum offering amount is sold, or approximately US$1.5 million
if the maximum offering amount is sold.

We plan to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering for the following
purposes:

The foregoing represents our current intentions based upon our present plans and
business conditions to use and allocate the net proceeds of this offering. Our
management, however, will have significant flexibility and discretion to apply
the net proceeds of this offering. If an unforeseen event occurs or business
conditions change, we may use the proceeds of this offering differently than as
described in this prospectus. To the extent that the net proceeds we receive
from this offering are not immediately used for the above purposes, we intend to
invest our net proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing bank deposits or debt
instruments.


We face competition from a number of reward-based crowdfunding platforms such as
z.dj.com, and izhongchou.taobao.com. Many of these platforms are well
established in the e-commerce market in China, and have more resources and are
better funded and better known than we are, and also have a significant
proprietary user base. The top five largest rewards-platforms in China, z.jd.com
(operated and owned by JD.com), Zhongchou.cn, Hi.taobao.com, Demohour.com and
Dreamore.com, are reported to have raised an aggregate of RMB 270 million
(approximately $40.5 million), which accounted for 60.8% of the total money
raised in the reward-based crowdfunding market in China.

We also face competition from other crowdfunding platforms that specialize in
either loan-based, equity-based or royalty-based crowdfunding offerings, such as
AngelCruch, AngelClub and Dajiaotou. Market leaders such as dj.JD.com, an equity
crowdfunding platform operated by JD.com, utilizes a lead-and-follow mechanism,
where Institutional VC firms and angel funds will lead and manage the investment
deals and allowing individual investors to participate on the same terms.

We believe that, by offering business incubation services, we attract high
quality prospective projects with valuable services in addition to the funds
that could be raised using our platform. We market these services, as well as
the possibility that we may be able to introduce them to offline funding sources
and potential business relationship through our formal and informal
relationships. We believe that, because these additional services could assist
the projects is developing their business, we will be able to attract more
quality projects. We believe that we are one of the few platforms in the PRC
market that provides high-quality business incubation services to entrepreneurs,
although we are aware that there are a number of incubation facilities,
including those with which we have a formal or informal relationship. By
providing these value-added services, we believe that projects on our platform
could have a better chance of success in both product development and completing
a fundraising campaign.


Company Description
We operate a fast growing reward-based crowdfunding platform in the PRC and
provide quality incubation services and financial services to entrepreneurs and
business entities with funding needs utilizing our crowdfunding platform.

Our revenue is generated from three sources:

• A percentage of the


 funds raised through our reward based crowdfunding
  platform, which is generally 0-3%.

• Fees resulting from our incubation services.

• Finder’s fees paid to us for acting as a finder to projects for raising funds
  offline, and for introductions to business partners, acquisition candidates or
  other strategic relationships.

Our Reward Based Crowdfunding Platform.

Crowdfunding is a process by which a project raises money from a large number of
people, primarily through an internet-based platform. Parties involved in
crowdfunding are the platforms, such as our platform, the entrepreneurs or
project sponsors, and the participants or other funding sources who make a
payment for the reward. There are five basic types of crowdfunding
programs — equity crowdfunding, reward-based crowdfunding, debt-based
crowdfunding, royalty-based crowdfunding, where the participants receive
payments based on revenue generated by the project, and donation-based
crowdfunding. Currently we are only engaged in reward-based crowdfunding in
China.

We launched our online crowdfunding platform, 5etou, at www.5etou.cn in March
2015. We do not provide crowdfunding services in the United States or for 
projects in the United States. All of the participants and projects are located
in China. Our 5etou platform is designed to enable projects searching for 
funding to connect with funding sources. Our platform enables projects to access
to initial seed money and to establish a track record in product/service 
development and operation history. Participants get involved in these projects
for rewards, often in the form of the product or service. Since the inception of
the 5etou platform, all of the successfully funded reward-based projects have 
been able to fulfill and/or deliver the promised rewards in the form of services
or products.

For a reward-based crowdfunding project, the participant uses our platform to
review opportunities and to consider whether he wants to make a payment to one
or more of the projects that are then raising funds through our platform. In
exchange for his payment, the participant receives a reward from the project. If
the project is developing a product, the project can offer the finished product
as reward, which is, in effect, a pre-order of the product. This reward
mechanism enables the project to use the pre-sale proceeds to develop or
manufacture the product. The project may require certain amount of payment in
order to receive the product, and participants who pay a lesser amount may
receive a lesser benefit, such as a company t-shirt or acknowledgement on the 
company’s website. If the project is developing a service, the project can offer
a service or other benefit. In each offering, the project sets the offering 
amount, the offering period, and the nature of the offering, including minimum 
contribution threshold to qualify the participant for a specified reward or 
benefit.

We have a participant base comprised of those potential participants who have
registered to use our platform. Although it is not necessary for a participant
to become a registered user in order to view available projects on our platform,
the participant must register before making any payment through our platform.
5etou attracts unregistered users to view the information about projects seeking
funding, including information provided by the project sponsor as well as the
number of users who expressed an interest in the project and who made
investments in a specific project, and the remaining time for a project to reach
its target before its offering is terminated. Only registered users are able to
make contributions to projects raising funding.

Our registered users size has been increasing steadily from quarter to quarter
since our inception.
---

As of March 31, 2017, we had approximately 4.15 million registered users, an
increase of 0.84 million or 25.4% from December 31, 2016, an increase of 1.57
million or 61% from September 30, 2016, an increase of 2.98 million or 255% from
March 31, 2016. From our inception to September 30, 2015, approximately 17% of
registered users participated in at least one project, and approximately 4%
participated in at least two projects. From our inception to March 31, 2016,
approximately 18.8% of registered users participated in at least one project,
and approximately 4.7% participated in at least two projects. From our inception
to September 30, 2016, approximately 18.2% of registered users participated in
at least one project, and approximately 4.8% participated in at least two
projects. From our inception to March 31, 2017, approximately 17.6 % of
registered users participated in at least one project, and approximately 4.4%
participated in at least two projects. We believe that increases in the number
of registered users generally positively affect our revenue because such
increase may provide more investors to participate in our crowdfunding projects
and may provide us with more opportunities for monetization.

We require all reward-based projects that successfully raise funds using our
platform to provide us and contributors to such projects, with key financial
information update, operation and product updates from time to time, although we
do not verify the accuracy or completeness of such information.

Our Incubation Services

In addition to the operation of our funding platforms, we offer business
incubation services to the projects utilizing our platform for their projects,
at the election of the projects on an ongoing or as-needed basis. These services
include business and operation advisory services relating to marketing, sales,
strategic planning, and guidance and general resources in ancillary services
such as human resources, legal, accounting, assisting with feasibility studies
and other types of services that projects may need. Our services are not
intended to substitute for professional services providers such as business
operation professionals, accountants, or lawyers and will make referrals to
third-party providers when needed.

We negotiate our fees for incubation services on a case-by-case basis, taking
into consideration the specific services that our team provides, the nature of
the projects, our business relationships with the project owners, and whether
the services are ongoing or as-needed. Clients utilizing our business incubation
services are typically business and technology startups in the fields such as
information technology, media, entertainment, and tourism. Projects fundraising
through our platform typically involve the development and/or sales of products
or services, based upon a viable business proposition or prototypes still in
development. We provide quality business consulting and advisory services to our
projects in each of their development stages from initiation to implementation,
and seek to assist those projects to reach profitability. However, we are not
involved with the management of these projects and we cannot assure that the
projects can or will ever operate profitably.

In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, we generated $595,980 through our
business incubation services. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, we
generated $2,707,008 through our business incubation services. For our
incubation services, we have continued to allocate a significant part of our
resources to fulfill the demand for incubation services as they arise. Our main
strategy is to continue to grow our crowdfunding platform segment to increase
the total number of projects successfully funded via our platform. To date, all
of the projects receiving our business incubation services have previously
raised capital via our crowdfunding platform. Although there is no guarantee
that demand for our incubation services will consistently grow along with the
increase in the number of our crowdfunding projects, we believe our crowdfunding
platform has played a critical role in providing us with incubation clients and,
in turn, generating incubation-service-related revenues.

We believe our business operation continues to root in providing crowdfunding
platform service to various projects, as we believe that our crowdfunding
platform service segment is key to our business operation and revenue growth.

Our Financial Services

From time to time, we also assist projects which have successfully funded their
projects through our platform to seek additional equity or debt financing by
introducing them to potential investors, business partners, merger candidates or
other strategic relationships. We charge a portion of the proceeds in the form
of cash, as a finder’s fee. We negotiate the rate on a case by case basis and
there is no guarantee that we would be able to secure a consistent rate in the
future. We generally only introduce projects to a limited number of funds or
groups that are financially sophisticated in making risky investment. Unlike the
United States, where either issuer is not allowed to pay a finder’s fee or
broker’s fee for raising funds from either a public or private issuer, in the
PRC, as long as the issuer is (a) not a public company, and (b) the fundraising
transaction does not involve any “public offering” of equity or debt securities
pursuant to PRC securities laws, a finder is not required to obtain any special
administrative approval for receiving finder’s fee or brokers fee for making
business introductions or referrals, and assisting fundraising in private
financing transactions. Under PRC securities laws, “securities” refers to
publicly-issued stock, privately-issued stock by a public company, company
bonds, listed government bonds, listed securities investment fund units,
securities derivatives and other securities identified by the State Council of
the PRC. Pursuant to PRC securities laws, a non-public issuer conducting private
financings of either equity or loan, is a financing transaction that does not
involve “an offer or sale of securities,” and thus such a non-public issuer may
pay a finder’s fee to us, and we may receive a finder's fee without any special
administrative approval. These are usually one-off services, and we provide such
services only when a client’s need arises.
