FRESNO, Calif., July 18, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- United Security Bancshares (Nasdaq:   UBFO), today announced its unaudited financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2017.  The Company reported consolidated net income of $2,492,000, or $0.15 per basic and diluted common share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, as compared to $2,021,000, or $0.12 per basic and diluted common share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2016.  The Company recognized net income of $4,263,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2017, an increase of 12.48% compared to the net income of $3,790,000 recognized for the six months ended June 30, 2016.  Basic and diluted earnings per share increased to $0.25 for the six months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to $0.22 for the six months ended June 30, 2016. 








Dennis Woods, President and Chief Executive Officer, added: "This quarter we resumed payment of a cash dividend, reflecting solid earnings and improved credit quality, as well as our commitment to our shareholders."
Additionally, Mr. Woods noted that "There is an important matter not apparent to the casual reader of this earnings release that I wanted to point out. Excluding Non-Core items such as the Fair Value Adjustment for Trust Preferred Securities ("TRUPS") and the gain on sale of Other Real Estate Owned (OREO), net income was $4,422,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2017, an increase of approximately 27.22% compared to net income of $3,476,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2016. Neither of these items are part of Core Income and specifically the TRUPS Fair Value Adjustment is dependent upon market rates, which can 'add to' or 'subtract from' Core Income and mask Core Income change." 
A reconciliation of Core Income, as a non-GAAP measure, to Net Income appears at the end of this Press Release.
Second Quarter 2017 Highlights (at or for the quarter ended June 30, 2017)

Net interest income after provision for credit losses increased to $7,724,000 compared to $6,654,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, and $7,207,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. 
Annualized net interest margin increased to 4.25% from 3.92% for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. 
Net recoveries totaled $110,000, compared to net recoveries of $25,000 in the preceding quarter and net charge-offs of $821,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. 
Total loans decreased to $568,163,000, compared to $570,834,000 at December 31, 2016. 
Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets decreased to 2.28%, compared to 2.40% at December 31, 2016. 
Nonperforming assets decreased approximately $1,070,000 between December 31, 2016 and June 30, 2017. 
Other real estate owned balances decreased to $5,745,000 at June 30, 2017 when compared to $6,471,000, at December 31, 2016. 
The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of gross loans increased to 1.59%, compared to 1.56% at December 31, 2016.

Shareholders' equity at June 30, 2017 was $99,521,000, up $2,867,000 from shareholders' equity of $96,654,000 at December 31, 2016.  
Total assets decreased $6,406,000, or 0.81%, for the six months ended June 30, 2017, due partially to declines of $4,030,000 in the investment portfolio, $3,524,000 in overnight funds, and $2,671,000 in gross loan balances. 
Total deposits decreased $10,318,000, or 1.52%, to $666,311,000 during the six months ended June 30, 2017.  The overall decrease was lead by $35,203,000 in maturities of non-core brokered certificates and non-relationship time deposits. Offsetting these maturities, interest bearing transaction and savings accounts increased 0.19% to $311,520,000 at June 30, 2017, compared to $310,941,000 at December 31, 2016.  Noninterest bearing deposits increased 9.25% to $287,003,000 at June 30, 2017, compared to $262,697,000 at December 31, 2016. As a result of the increases in non-interest bearing deposits and interest bearing transactions and saving accounts, net core deposits increased $24,885,000.
The Board of Directors of United Security Bancshares declared cash dividends on common stock on April 25, 2017, and June 27, 2017, for $0.05 per share.  The dividends were payable May 18, 2017, to shareholders of record as of  May 17, 2017, and will be payable on July 21, 2017, to shareholders of record as of July 17, 2017.  No assurances can be provided that future dividends, whether payable in stock or cash, will be declared and/or as to the timing of such future dividends, if any.
Net interest income after the provision for credit losses for the six months ended June 30, 2017 totaled $14,931,000, an increase of $1,644,000, or 12.37%, from the net interest income of $13,287,000 for the same period ended June 30, 2016. The Company's net interest margin increased from 4.02% for the six months ended June 30, 2016 to 4.17% for the six months ended June 30, 2017.  The 15 basis point increase in net interest margin in the period-to-period comparison was the result of higher yields on both the loan portfolio and overnight deposits, partially offset by declining yields on the investment portfolio.  The yield on loans increased from 5.23% for the six months ended June 30, 2016 to 5.33% for the six months ended June 30, 2017. The 10 basis point increase in loan yields is primarily the result of growth of the higher-yielding student loan portfolio and increases on rates throughout the loan portfolio reflecting the increase in the prime rate.  The increase in net interest income on a year-over-year comparison is the result of an increase in high-yielding loans.  Net interest income after the recovery of provision for credit losses for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 totaled $7,724,000, an increase of $1,070,000 from the net interest income of $6,654,000 for the same period ended June 30, 2016.
Non-interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2017 totaled $1,975,000, reflecting a decrease of $1,013,000 from $2,988,000 in non-interest income reported for the six months ended June 30, 2016.  Customer service fees, which represent the largest portion of the Company's non-interest income, totaled $1,938,000 and $1,943,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  On a year-over-year comparative basis, non-interest income decreased primarily due to the change in fair value option of financial liability caused by fluctuations in the LIBOR yield curve.  The Company recorded a $601,000 loss on the fair value option of financial liability for the six months ended June 30, 2017, compared to a $471,000 gain for the same period ended June 30, 2016.
Non-interest income for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 totaled $1,066,000, reflecting a decrease of $361,000 from $1,427,000 in non-interest income reported for the quarter ended June 30, 2016.  This decrease was primarily due to a $264,000 loss recorded on the fair value option of financial liability for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, compared to a $113,000 gain for the same period ended 2016. The change in the fair value of financial liability was primarily caused by fluctuations in the LIBOR yield curve. Customer service fees totaled $997,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, as compared to $1,017,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2016.  
For the six months ended June 30, 2017, non-interest expense totaled $9,798,000, a decrease of $326,000 compared to $10,124,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2016.  On a year-over-year comparative basis, non-interest expense decreased primarily due to decreases of $454,000 in the net cost on operation and sale of OREO, $232,000 in regulatory assessments, and $190,000 in professional fees, partially offset by an increase of $513,000 in salaries and employee benefit expenses.  Professional fees for the six months ended June 30, 2016, included a $125,000 legal settlement. Salaries and employee benefit expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2017, reflect increases in salaries, higher group insurance expenses, and increases in incentives and bonuses.
Non-interest expense totaled $4,607,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, a decrease of $217,000 as compared to $4,824,000 reported for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. On a quarter-over-quarter comparative basis, non-interest expense decreased primarily due to decreases in regulatory assessments and net cost on operation and sale of OREO.  
The Company recorded a recovery of provision for credit losses of $31,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2017, compared to a recovery of provision of $10,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2016.  Net loan recoveries totaled $136,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to net charge-offs of $794,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2016.  The Company recorded a recovery of provision for credit loss of $52,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, compared to a provision for credit losses of $12,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. Net loan recoveries totaled $110,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, as compared to net loan charge-offs of $821,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2016.
The Company has maintained an adequate allowance for loan losses which totaled 1.59% of total loans at June 30, 2017, compared to 1.56% of total loans at December 31, 2016. In determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, the judgment of the Company's management is a significant factor and management considers the allowance for credit losses at June 30, 2017 to be adequate. 
Non-performing assets, comprised of nonaccrual loans, troubled debt restructures (TDR), other real estate owned through foreclosure (OREO), and loans more than 90 days past due and still accruing interest, decreased approximately $1,070,000 between December 31, 2016 and June 30, 2017 to $17,811,000.  Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets decreased from 2.40% at December 31, 2016 to 2.28% at June 30, 2017.  The decrease in nonperforming assets is mainly attributed to decreases in nonaccrual loans.  Nonaccrual loans decreased $1,756,000 between December 31, 2016 and June 30, 2017 to $5,508,000.  Impaired loans totaled $16,024,000 at June 30, 2017, a decrease of $155,000 from the balance of $16,179,000 at December 31, 2016. OREO totaled $5,745,000 at June 30, 2017 as compared to $6,471,000 at December 31, 2016.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESThis press release and the accompanying financial tables contain a non-GAAP financial measure (Net Income before Non-Core) within the meaning of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation G. In the accompanying financial tables, the Company has provided a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. The Company's management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information about the Company's results of operations and/or financial position to both investors and management. The Company provides this non-GAAP financial measure to investors to assist them in performing their analysis of its historical operating results. The non-GAAP financial measure shows the Company's operating results before consideration of certain adjustments and, consequently, this non-GAAP financial measure should not be construed as an alternative to net income (loss) as an indicator of the Company's operating performance, as determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company may calculate this non-GAAP financial measure differently than other companies.
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThis news release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended and the Company intends such statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are based on management's knowledge and belief as of today and include information concerning the Company's possible or assumed future financial condition, and its results of operations, business and earnings outlook. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. A number of factors, some of which are beyond the Company's ability to control or predict, could cause future results to differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements. These factors include (1) changes in interest rates, (2) significant changes in banking laws or regulations, (3) increased competition in the company's market, (4) other-than-expected credit losses, (5) earthquake or other natural disasters impacting the condition of real estate collateral, (6) the effect of acquisitions and integration of acquired businesses, (7) the impact of proposed and/or recently adopted changes in laws, and regulations on the Company and its business; (8) changing bank regulatory conditions, policies, whether arising as new legislation or regulatory initiatives or changes in our regulatory classifications, that could lead to restrictions on activities of banks generally or as to the Bank, including specifically the formal order between the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and the Company and the Bank, (9) failure to comply with the written regulatory agreement under which the Company is subject and (10) unknown economic impacts caused by the State of California's budget issues, including the effect on Federal spending due to sequestration required by the Budget Control Act of 2011. Management cannot predict at this time the severity or duration of the effects of the recent business slowdown on the Company's specific business activities and profitability. Weaker or a further decline in capital and consumer spending, and related recessionary trends could adversely affect the Company's performance in a number of ways including decreased demand for our products and services and increased credit losses. Likewise, changes in interest rates, among other things, could slow the rate of growth or put pressure on current deposit levels and affect the ability of borrowers to repay loans. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the Company does not undertake to update forward-looking statements to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the date the statements are made, or to update earnings guidance including the factors that influence earnings. For a more complete discussion of these risks and uncertainties, see the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, and particularly the section entitled "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."  Readers should carefully review all disclosures the Company files from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").

United Security Bancshares (NASDAQ:UBFO)Historical Stock Chart
1 Month : From Jun 2017 to Jul 2017



FRESNO, Calif., July 18, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- United Security Bancshares (Nasdaq: UBFO), today announced its unaudited financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2017.  The Company reported consolidated net income of $2,492,000, or $0.15 per basic and diluted common share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, as compared to $2,021,000, or $0.12 per basic and diluted common share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2016.  The Company recognized net income of $4,263,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2017, an increase of 12.48% compared to the net income of $3,790,000 recognized for the six months ended June 30, 2016.  Basic and diluted earnings per share increased to $0.25 for the six months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to $0.22 for the six months ended June 30, 2016. 
Dennis Woods, President and Chief Executive Officer, added: "This quarter we resumed payment of a cash dividend, reflecting solid earnings and improved credit quality, as well as our commitment to our shareholders."
Additionally, Mr. Woods noted that "There is an important matter not apparent to the casual reader of this earnings release that I wanted to point out. Excluding Non-Core items such as the Fair Value Adjustment for Trust Preferred Securities ("TRUPS") and the gain on sale of Other Real Estate Owned (OREO), net income was $4,422,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2017, an increase of approximately 27.22% compared to net income of $3,476,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2016. Neither of these items are part of Core Income and specifically the TRUPS Fair Value Adjustment is dependent upon market rates, which can 'add to' or 'subtract from' Core Income and mask Core Income change." 
A reconciliation of Core Income, as a non-GAAP measure, to Net Income appears at the end of this Press Release.
Second Quarter 2017 Highlights (at or for the quarter ended June 30, 2017)

Net interest income after provision for credit losses increased to $7,724,000 compared to $6,654,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, and $7,207,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.
Annualized net interest margin increased to 4.25% from 3.92% for the quarter ended June 30, 2016.

Total loans decreased to $568,163,000, compared to $570,834,000 at December 31, 2016.
Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets decreased to 2.28%, compared to 2.40% at December 31, 2016.

Annualized return on average equity (ROAE) for the six months ended June 30, 2017 was 8.72%, compared to 8.30% for the six months ended June 30, 2016.  Annualized return on average assets (ROAA) was 1.09% for the six months ended June 30, 2017, compared to 1.03% for the six months ended June 30, 2016.  Annualized ROAE for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 was 10.06% compared to 8.76% for the same period in 2016.  Annualized ROAA was 1.26% for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, compared to 1.07% for the same period in 2016.  The annualized average cost of deposits was 0.22% for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, up from 0.17% for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. Shareholders' equity at June 30, 2017 was $99,521,000, up $2,867,000 from shareholders' equity of $96,654,000 at December 31, 2016.  
Total assets decreased $6,406,000, or 0.81%, for the six months ended June 30, 2017, due partially to declines of $4,030,000 in the investment portfolio, $3,524,000 in overnight funds, and $2,671,000 in gross loan balances. 
Total deposits decreased $10,318,000, or 1.52%, to $666,311,000 during the six months ended June 30, 2017.  The overall decrease was lead by $35,203,000 in maturities of non-core brokered certificates and non-relationship time deposits. Offsetting these maturities, interest bearing transaction and savings accounts increased 0.19% to $311,520,000 at June 30, 2017, compared to $310,941,000 at December 31, 2016.  Noninterest bearing deposits increased 9.25% to $287,003,000 at June 30, 2017, compared to $262,697,000 at December 31, 2016. As a result of the increases in non-interest bearing deposits and interest bearing transactions and saving accounts, net core deposits increased $24,885,000.
The Board of Directors of United Security Bancshares declared cash dividends on common stock on April 25, 2017, and June 27, 2017, for $0.05 per share.  The dividends were payable May 18, 2017, to shareholders of record as of  May 17, 2017, and will be payable on July 21, 2017, to shareholders of record as of July 17, 2017.  No assurances can be provided that future dividends, whether payable in stock or cash, will be declared and/or as to the timing of such future dividends, if any.
Net interest income after the provision for credit losses for the six months ended June 30, 2017 totaled $14,931,000, an increase of $1,644,000, or 12.37%, from the net interest income of $13,287,000 for the same period ended June 30, 2016. The Company's net interest margin increased from 4.02% for the six months ended June 30, 2016 to 4.17% for the six months ended June 30, 2017.  The 15 basis point increase in net interest margin in the period-to-period comparison was the result of higher yields on both the loan portfolio and overnight deposits, partially offset by declining yields on the investment portfolio.  The yield on loans increased from 5.23% for the six months ended June 30, 2016 to 5.33% for the six months ended June 30, 2017. The 10 basis point increase in loan yields is primarily the result of growth of the higher-yielding student loan portfolio and increases on rates throughout the loan portfolio reflecting the increase in the prime rate.  The increase in net interest income on a year-over-year comparison is the result of an increase in high-yielding loans.  Net interest income after the recovery of provision for credit losses for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 totaled $7,724,000, an increase of $1,070,000 from the net interest income of $6,654,000 for the same period ended June 30, 2016.
Non-interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2017 totaled $1,975,000, reflecting a decrease of $1,013,000 from $2,988,000 in non-interest income reported for the six months ended June 30, 2016.  Customer service fees, which represent the largest portion of the Company's non-interest income, totaled $1,938,000 and $1,943,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  On a year-over-year comparative basis, non-interest income decreased primarily due to the change in fair value option of financial liability caused by fluctuations in the LIBOR yield curve.  The Company recorded a $601,000 loss on the fair value option of financial liability for the six months ended June 30, 2017, compared to a $471,000 gain for the same period ended June 30, 2016.
Non-interest income for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 totaled $1,066,000, reflecting a decrease of $361,000 from $1,427,000 in non-interest income reported for the quarter ended June 30, 2016.  This decrease was primarily due to a $264,000 loss recorded on the fair value option of financial liability for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, compared to a $113,000 gain for the same period ended 2016. The change in the fair value of financial liability was primarily caused by fluctuations in the LIBOR yield curve. Customer service fees totaled $997,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, as compared to $1,017,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2016.  
For the six months ended June 30, 2017, non-interest expense totaled $9,798,000, a decrease of $326,000 compared to $10,124,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2016.  On a year-over-year comparative basis, non-interest expense decreased primarily due to decreases of $454,000 in the net cost on operation and sale of OREO, $232,000 in regulatory assessments, and $190,000 in professional fees, partially offset by an increase of $513,000 in salaries and employee benefit expenses.  Professional fees for the six months ended June 30, 2016, included a $125,000 legal settlement. Salaries and employee benefit expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2017, reflect increases in salaries, higher group insurance expenses, and increases in incentives and bonuses.
Non-interest expense totaled $4,607,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, a decrease of $217,000 as compared to $4,824,000 reported for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. On a quarter-over-quarter comparative basis, non-interest expense decreased primarily due to decreases in regulatory assessments and net cost on operation and sale of OREO.  
The Company recorded a recovery of provision for credit losses of $31,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2017, compared to a recovery of provision of $10,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2016.  Net loan recoveries totaled $136,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to net charge-offs of $794,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2016.  The Company recorded a recovery of provision for credit loss of $52,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, compared to a provision for credit losses of $12,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. Net loan recoveries totaled $110,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, as compared to net loan charge-offs of $821,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2016.
The Company has maintained an adequate allowance for loan losses which totaled 1.59% of total loans at June 30, 2017, compared to 1.56% of total loans at December 31, 2016. In determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, the judgment of the Company's management is a significant factor and management considers the allowance for credit losses at June 30, 2017 to be adequate. 
Non-performing assets, comprised of nonaccrual loans, troubled debt restructures (TDR), other real estate owned through foreclosure (OREO), and loans more than 90 days past due and still accruing interest, decreased approximately $1,070,000 between December 31, 2016 and June 30, 2017 to $17,811,000.  Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets decreased from 2.40% at December 31, 2016 to 2.28% at June 30, 2017.  The decrease in nonperforming assets is mainly attributed to decreases in nonaccrual loans.  Nonaccrual loans decreased $1,756,000 between December 31, 2016 and June 30, 2017 to $5,508,000.  Impaired loans totaled $16,024,000 at June 30, 2017, a decrease of $155,000 from the balance of $16,179,000 at December 31, 2016. OREO totaled $5,745,000 at June 30, 2017 as compared to $6,471,000 at December 31, 2016.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESThis press release and the accompanying financial tables contain a non-GAAP financial measure (Net Income before Non-Core) within the meaning of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation G. In the accompanying financial tables, the Company has provided a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. The Company's management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information about the Company's results of operations and/or financial position to both investors and management. The Company provides this non-GAAP financial measure to investors to assist them in performing their analysis of its historical operating results. The non-GAAP financial measure shows the Company's operating results before consideration of certain adjustments and, consequently, this non-GAAP financial measure should not be construed as an alternative to net income (loss) as an indicator of the Company's operating performance, as determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company may calculate this non-GAAP financial measure differently than other companies.
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThis news release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended and the Company intends such statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are based on management's knowledge and belief as of today and include information concerning the Company's possible or assumed future financial condition, and its results of operations, business and earnings outlook. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. A number of factors, some of which are beyond the Company's ability to control or predict, could cause future results to differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements. These factors include (1) changes in interest rates, (2) significant changes in banking laws or regulations, (3) increased competition in the company's market, (4) other-than-expected credit losses, (5) earthquake or other natural disasters impacting the condition of real estate collateral, (6) the effect of acquisitions and integration of acquired businesses, (7) the impact of proposed and/or recently adopted changes in laws, and regulations on the Company and its business; (8) changing bank regulatory conditions, policies, whether arising as new legislation or regulatory initiatives or changes in our regulatory classifications, that could lead to restrictions on activities of banks generally or as to the Bank, including specifically the formal order between the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and the Company and the Bank, (9) failure to comply with the written regulatory agreement under which the Company is subject and (10) unknown economic impacts caused by the State of California's budget issues, including the effect on Federal spending due to sequestration required by the Budget Control Act of 2011. Management cannot predict at this time the severity or duration of the effects of the recent business slowdown on the Company's specific business activities and profitability. Weaker or a further decline in capital and consumer spending, and related recessionary trends could adversely affect the Company's performance in a number of ways including decreased demand for our products and services and increased credit losses. Likewise, changes in interest rates, among other things, could slow the rate of growth or put pressure on current deposit levels and affect the ability of borrowers to repay loans. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the Company does not undertake to update forward-looking statements to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the date the statements are made, or to update earnings guidance including the factors that influence earnings. For a more complete discussion of these risks and uncertainties, see the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, and particularly the section entitled "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."  Readers should carefully review all disclosures the Company files from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").

		Air Products & Chemicals, Inc. (APD) and United Security Bancshares (USBO) Lead 14 Investor Filings	
Strategic Value Investors discloses an activist stake in USBO

May 18, 2017, 11:30 am EDT  |  By Fintel



 
 

When a person or group of persons acquires beneficial ownership of more than 5% of a company’s equity securities, they are required to file a Schedule 13D or 13G with the SEC.
If these groups intend to influence management into changing the business strategy, they are considered “activist” investors. There is considerable academic research that suggest activist investors contribute to excess returns in equities in the subsequent twelve months after the event.
Investors that acquire 10% or more of a company’s shares, or that gain a board seat, are considered insiders by the SEC and are subject to stricter insider trading filing requirements.
Investors that acquire more than 5% of the shares of a company and intend to influence management are considered activist investors and must file a 13D, and investors that acquire more than 5% of the shares of a company but have no intention of influencing management are considered passive investors and must file a 13G.
Here are 14 recent notable filings:

United Security Bancshares (NASDAQ:UBFO)Historical Stock Chart
1 Month : From Jun 2017 to Jul 2017



FRESNO, Calif., July 18, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- United Security Bancshares (Nasdaq: UBFO), today announced its unaudited financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2017.  The Company reported consolidated net income of $2,492,000, or $0.15 per basic and diluted common share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, as compared to $2,021,000, or $0.12 per basic and diluted common share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2016.  The Company recognized net income of $4,263,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2017, an increase of 12.48% compared to the net income of $3,790,000 recognized for the six months ended June 30, 2016.  Basic and diluted earnings per share increased to $0.25 for the six months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to $0.22 for the six months ended June 30, 2016. 
Dennis Woods, President and Chief Executive Officer, added: "This quarter we resumed payment of a cash dividend, reflecting solid earnings and improved credit quality, as well as our commitment to our shareholders."
Additionally, Mr. Woods noted that "There is an important matter not apparent to the casual reader of this earnings release that I wanted to point out. Excluding Non-Core items such as the Fair Value Adjustment for Trust Preferred Securities ("TRUPS") and the gain on sale of Other Real Estate Owned (OREO), net income was $4,422,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2017, an increase of approximately 27.22% compared to net income of $3,476,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2016. Neither of these items are part of Core Income and specifically the TRUPS Fair Value Adjustment is dependent upon market rates, which can 'add to' or 'subtract from' Core Income and mask Core Income change." 
A reconciliation of Core Income, as a non-GAAP measure, to Net Income appears at the end of this Press Release.
Second Quarter 2017 Highlights (at or for the quarter ended June 30, 2017)

Net interest income after provision for credit losses increased to $7,724,000 compared to $6,654,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, and $7,207,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.
Annualized net interest margin increased to 4.25% from 3.92% for the quarter ended June 30, 2016.

Total loans decreased to $568,163,000, compared to $570,834,000 at December 31, 2016.
Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets decreased to 2.28%, compared to 2.40% at December 31, 2016.

Annualized return on average equity (ROAE) for the six months ended June 30, 2017 was 8.72%, compared to 8.30% for the six months ended June 30, 2016.  Annualized return on average assets (ROAA) was 1.09% for the six months ended June 30, 2017, compared to 1.03% for the six months ended June 30, 2016.  Annualized ROAE for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 was 10.06% compared to 8.76% for the same period in 2016.  Annualized ROAA was 1.26% for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, compared to 1.07% for the same period in 2016.  The annualized average cost of deposits was 0.22% for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, up from 0.17% for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. Shareholders' equity at June 30, 2017 was $99,521,000, up $2,867,000 from shareholders' equity of $96,654,000 at December 31, 2016.  
Total assets decreased $6,406,000, or 0.81%, for the six months ended June 30, 2017, due partially to declines of $4,030,000 in the investment portfolio, $3,524,000 in overnight funds, and $2,671,000 in gross loan balances. 
Total deposits decreased $10,318,000, or 1.52%, to $666,311,000 during the six months ended June 30, 2017.  The overall decrease was lead by $35,203,000 in maturities of non-core brokered certificates and non-relationship time deposits. Offsetting these maturities, interest bearing transaction and savings accounts increased 0.19% to $311,520,000 at June 30, 2017, compared to $310,941,000 at December 31, 2016.  Noninterest bearing deposits increased 9.25% to $287,003,000 at June 30, 2017, compared to $262,697,000 at December 31, 2016. As a result of the increases in non-interest bearing deposits and interest bearing transactions and saving accounts, net core deposits increased $24,885,000.
The Board of Directors of United Security Bancshares declared cash dividends on common stock on April 25, 2017, and June 27, 2017, for $0.05 per share.  The dividends were payable May 18, 2017, to shareholders of record as of  May 17, 2017, and will be payable on July 21, 2017, to shareholders of record as of July 17, 2017.  No assurances can be provided that future dividends, whether payable in stock or cash, will be declared and/or as to the timing of such future dividends, if any.
Net interest income after the provision for credit losses for the six months ended June 30, 2017 totaled $14,931,000, an increase of $1,644,000, or 12.37%, from the net interest income of $13,287,000 for the same period ended June 30, 2016. The Company's net interest margin increased from 4.02% for the six months ended June 30, 2016 to 4.17% for the six months ended June 30, 2017.  The 15 basis point increase in net interest margin in the period-to-period comparison was the result of higher yields on both the loan portfolio and overnight deposits, partially offset by declining yields on the investment portfolio.  The yield on loans increased from 5.23% for the six months ended June 30, 2016 to 5.33% for the six months ended June 30, 2017. The 10 basis point increase in loan yields is primarily the result of growth of the higher-yielding student loan portfolio and increases on rates throughout the loan portfolio reflecting the increase in the prime rate.  The increase in net interest income on a year-over-year comparison is the result of an increase in high-yielding loans.  Net interest income after the recovery of provision for credit losses for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 totaled $7,724,000, an increase of $1,070,000 from the net interest income of $6,654,000 for the same period ended June 30, 2016.
Non-interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2017 totaled $1,975,000, reflecting a decrease of $1,013,000 from $2,988,000 in non-interest income reported for the six months ended June 30, 2016.  Customer service fees, which represent the largest portion of the Company's non-interest income, totaled $1,938,000 and $1,943,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  On a year-over-year comparative basis, non-interest income decreased primarily due to the change in fair value option of financial liability caused by fluctuations in the LIBOR yield curve.  The Company recorded a $601,000 loss on the fair value option of financial liability for the six months ended June 30, 2017, compared to a $471,000 gain for the same period ended June 30, 2016.
Non-interest income for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 totaled $1,066,000, reflecting a decrease of $361,000 from $1,427,000 in non-interest income reported for the quarter ended June 30, 2016.  This decrease was primarily due to a $264,000 loss recorded on the fair value option of financial liability for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, compared to a $113,000 gain for the same period ended 2016. The change in the fair value of financial liability was primarily caused by fluctuations in the LIBOR yield curve. Customer service fees totaled $997,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, as compared to $1,017,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2016.  
For the six months ended June 30, 2017, non-interest expense totaled $9,798,000, a decrease of $326,000 compared to $10,124,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2016.  On a year-over-year comparative basis, non-interest expense decreased primarily due to decreases of $454,000 in the net cost on operation and sale of OREO, $232,000 in regulatory assessments, and $190,000 in professional fees, partially offset by an increase of $513,000 in salaries and employee benefit expenses.  Professional fees for the six months ended June 30, 2016, included a $125,000 legal settlement. Salaries and employee benefit expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2017, reflect increases in salaries, higher group insurance expenses, and increases in incentives and bonuses.
Non-interest expense totaled $4,607,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, a decrease of $217,000 as compared to $4,824,000 reported for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. On a quarter-over-quarter comparative basis, non-interest expense decreased primarily due to decreases in regulatory assessments and net cost on operation and sale of OREO.  
The Company recorded a recovery of provision for credit losses of $31,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2017, compared to a recovery of provision of $10,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2016.  Net loan recoveries totaled $136,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to net charge-offs of $794,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2016.  The Company recorded a recovery of provision for credit loss of $52,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, compared to a provision for credit losses of $12,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. Net loan recoveries totaled $110,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, as compared to net loan charge-offs of $821,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2016.
The Company has maintained an adequate allowance for loan losses which totaled 1.59% of total loans at June 30, 2017, compared to 1.56% of total loans at December 31, 2016. In determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, the judgment of the Company's management is a significant factor and management considers the allowance for credit losses at June 30, 2017 to be adequate. 
Non-performing assets, comprised of nonaccrual loans, troubled debt restructures (TDR), other real estate owned through foreclosure (OREO), and loans more than 90 days past due and still accruing interest, decreased approximately $1,070,000 between December 31, 2016 and June 30, 2017 to $17,811,000.  Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets decreased from 2.40% at December 31, 2016 to 2.28% at June 30, 2017.  The decrease in nonperforming assets is mainly attributed to decreases in nonaccrual loans.  Nonaccrual loans decreased $1,756,000 between December 31, 2016 and June 30, 2017 to $5,508,000.  Impaired loans totaled $16,024,000 at June 30, 2017, a decrease of $155,000 from the balance of $16,179,000 at December 31, 2016. OREO totaled $5,745,000 at June 30, 2017 as compared to $6,471,000 at December 31, 2016.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESThis press release and the accompanying financial tables contain a non-GAAP financial measure (Net Income before Non-Core) within the meaning of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation G. In the accompanying financial tables, the Company has provided a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. The Company's management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information about the Company's results of operations and/or financial position to both investors and management. The Company provides this non-GAAP financial measure to investors to assist them in performing their analysis of its historical operating results. The non-GAAP financial measure shows the Company's operating results before consideration of certain adjustments and, consequently, this non-GAAP financial measure should not be construed as an alternative to net income (loss) as an indicator of the Company's operating performance, as determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company may calculate this non-GAAP financial measure differently than other companies.
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThis news release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended and the Company intends such statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are based on management's knowledge and belief as of today and include information concerning the Company's possible or assumed future financial condition, and its results of operations, business and earnings outlook. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. A number of factors, some of which are beyond the Company's ability to control or predict, could cause future results to differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements. These factors include (1) changes in interest rates, (2) significant changes in banking laws or regulations, (3) increased competition in the company's market, (4) other-than-expected credit losses, (5) earthquake or other natural disasters impacting the condition of real estate collateral, (6) the effect of acquisitions and integration of acquired businesses, (7) the impact of proposed and/or recently adopted changes in laws, and regulations on the Company and its business; (8) changing bank regulatory conditions, policies, whether arising as new legislation or regulatory initiatives or changes in our regulatory classifications, that could lead to restrictions on activities of banks generally or as to the Bank, including specifically the formal order between the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and the Company and the Bank, (9) failure to comply with the written regulatory agreement under which the Company is subject and (10) unknown economic impacts caused by the State of California's budget issues, including the effect on Federal spending due to sequestration required by the Budget Control Act of 2011. Management cannot predict at this time the severity or duration of the effects of the recent business slowdown on the Company's specific business activities and profitability. Weaker or a further decline in capital and consumer spending, and related recessionary trends could adversely affect the Company's performance in a number of ways including decreased demand for our products and services and increased credit losses. Likewise, changes in interest rates, among other things, could slow the rate of growth or put pressure on current deposit levels and affect the ability of borrowers to repay loans. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the Company does not undertake to update forward-looking statements to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the date the statements are made, or to update earnings guidance including the factors that influence earnings. For a more complete discussion of these risks and uncertainties, see the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, and particularly the section entitled "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."  Readers should carefully review all disclosures the Company files from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").

    United Security Bank Online Banking Agreement

(This is a duplicate of the Agreement electronically signed at time of enrollment.

Please see a bank representative for more information.)

    APPLICATION FOR ONLINE ACCESS AGREEMENT

    By clicking on "I Agree", you are agreeing to the "Terms and Conditions" that govern your use of the online banking service (the "Service") and will
    proceed to the Enrollment Form which will allow United Security Bank to setup a Personal Online Banking account for New Users. The terms and conditions of
    this agreement are in addition to, will supplement, and supersede where inconsistent, the terms, conditions, rules and regulations of your account
    agreement with United Security Bank.

    Acceptance of this agreement authorizes United Security Bank to provide access to some or all banking products. These include but may not be limited to
    checking accounts, savings accounts, certificate of deposits and loan accounts you maintain with us. Your use of the Service will be further evidence of
    your agreement to these terms and other agreements that we provide to you.

    ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION

    By clicking on the "I Agree" button below, you are accepting to enter into this Agreement electronically. You also are confirming that you have downloaded
    or printed a copy of the Online Banking Agreement for your records. We will provide a copy of the Online Banking Agreement to you in written form at your
    request.

    The Service allows you to:


        Obtain account balances
    

        View and print monthly activity including images of checks, deposits and statements
    

        Pay bills electronically
    

        Transfer funds between United Security Bank accounts
    

        Verify the amount of a direct deposit on its scheduled due date
    

        Request a Stop Payment on a check
    

        Generate reports on your account activity
    

        Export your transactions to popular financial software packages
    

        Reorder checks from Harland Clark
    

    TRANSFERS

    Transfers are limited to occur only between accounts established at United Security Bank and identified within your log-in portfolio. Transfers may be
    scheduled as an "Express Transfer", one time occurrence, or as a "Scheduled Transfer", set to occur at a pre-established time and for the same amount. You
    agree that a request to conduct a transfer of funds will be conducted only when a sufficient balance is, or will be, available in your designated account
    at the Bank at the time of withdrawal. The bank is not obligated to complete any transfer if sufficient funds, including overdraft lines of credit or
    overdraft privileges, are not available in the account you designate. Express Transfers will only be allowed if there are current available funds in the
    designated account at the time of transfer. Scheduled Transfers will be allowed if there are current available funds, including any overdraft lines of
    credit or overdraft privileges, in the designated account at the close of the business day on which the transfer is to occur.

    Transfers must be completed online by 6:00 pm on a business day in order to receive same day credit. It is recommended that you complete all transfers at
    least 15 minutes prior to the cut-off time. Transfers conducted after hours, on Saturday or Sunday, or on banking holidays will be processed the following
    business day.

    Refer to the Truth In Savings Disclosure for Personal and/or Business Accounts for a description of any transfer limitations. Transfers or payments from
    savings or money market accounts may be limited (see Transaction Limitations below).

    The bank will not be liable for transfers conducted by persons or entities who obtain online access through the multifactor authentication process. Users
    are responsible for maintaining the security of their online credentials.

    TRANSACTION LIMITATIONS

    Federal law limits the number of transfers and withdrawals from savings accounts and money market deposit accounts. You may not make more than six
    withdrawals and/or transfers from these accounts each monthly statement period by check (applicable to Money Market accounts only), pre-authorized or
    automatic transfer, draft, debit card, data transmission, or telephonic agreement. Please see your account agreement for further details.

    BUSINESS DAYS

    In this Agreement, the term "Business Days" refers to Monday through Friday, excluding bank holidays.

    AVAILABILITY OF SERVICE

    The Service is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The Services may be temporarily unavailable for system maintenance. Services may also be
    unavailable in the event of an emergency, such as failure of computer or communication equipment. We shall not be liable under this Agreement for the
    inability to access the Services.

    COMPUTER REQUIREMENTS

    The following conditions must be fulfilled for the system to function properly and effectively:

General Instructions


        The browser should preferably be Microsoft Internet Explorer 8.0 or higher, or an equivalent alternate browser.
    

        After logging-in the online banking system, it is advisable not to use the REFRESH (RELOAD) and STOP keys, and not to use the BACK key to move to pages
        other than those used by the system (secure environment - https).
    

        For reasons of security and in order to provide better service to our clients, there is a 15-minute limit to complete transactions ("Process Timeout").
        After the expiration of the 15-minutes the client is automatically disconnected from the system. In addition, if after logging-in to the system the
        client does not perform any transaction within 3 minutes, the client is again automatically disconnected ("Idle Timeout").
    

    United Security Bank has obtained the maximum possible security currently available on the Internet (128-bit encryption). Thus, in every transaction
    performed, the messages exchanged between the client and the Bank's Web Server are encrypted. Beyond encryption, subscribers use multifactor authentication
    to log-in, while the Bank also uses additional security systems (Firewall) which control and record each user's access to its systems.

    STOP PAYMENTS ON CHECKS

    A stop payment order may be placed on a check using the Service. To place the order you must precisely identify the check number, date, the EXACT amount of
    the check (dollars and cents) and the payee. If any information is incomplete or incorrect, we will not be responsible for failing to stop payment on the
    item. Additionally, we must receive it in time to give us a reasonable opportunity to act on it before our stop payment cut-off time. To place a stop
    payment on a blank check or a range of checks that are missing or stolen, you must contact your banking office for personal assistance. Other terms and
    conditions governing stop payments are covered in your Deposit Account Terms and Conditions disclosure.

    CANCELLATION

    This Agreement will remain in effect until terminated by you or The Bank. You may cancel this Agreement at any time by notifying The Bank by mail at:
    United Security Bank, 2126 Inyo Street, Fresno, CA 93721; Attention: Data Processing Center. The Bank may cancel this Agreement and terminate your use of
    the Internet Banking Service if: you breach this or any other agreement with us; we have reason to believe that there has been or may be an unauthorized
    use of your account or PIN; there are conflicting claims to the funds in your account; upon your request that we do so; or for any other reason, at any
    time. The Bank may use commercially reasonable measure to notify you in advance of any such termination, but The Bank is not obligated to do so.

    ACCESS ID AND PASSWORD

    During your first use of the Service, you will be required to select your own personalized Access ID and Password. If you already have an Access ID and
    Password a new one will not be issued. If you designate different users for your Service, each will be issued a separate Access ID and Password. Your
    Password may be changed at any time within the Service. To help safeguard your security, you should change your Password frequently. Do not write your
    Access ID or Password on your Computer. If you forget your Access ID and/or Password, you must contact us to have a new Access ID and/or Password issued to
    you. You agree to keep your Access ID and Password confidential in order to prevent unauthorized access to your accounts and the Service. No United
    Security Bank employee will ever ask you for your password. You should never include your password in any verbal, written, faxed, or e-mail communication
    with us.

    ELECTRONIC MAIL (E-mail)

    One way we may communicate with you is through e-mail, by sending us an e-mail or otherwise providing us with an e-mail or text message address. We may
    respond to your request by e-mail, but we will never send you an e-mail to ask confidential information about your account. Furthermore, you cannot use an
    e-mail message to conduct transactions on your accounts.

    REPORTING UNAUTHORIZED TRANSACTIONS

    If you believe your Access ID, User Password or Personal Identification Number (PIN) has been lost or compromised, or that funds have been transferred from
    your account without your permission, you must contact us immediately at (559) 248-4930 or Toll Free (888) 683-6030 or mail notices to United Security
    Bank, 2126 Inyo Street, Fresno, CA 93721, ATTN: Centralized Operations.

    ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER PROVISIONS FOR CONSUMERS

    Transfers that debit or credit a consumer's deposit account are subject to the Electronic Funds Transfer Act as implemented by Regulation E (12 CFR 1005).

    Liability for Unauthorized Electronic Funds Transfers (EFT)

    Your liability for an unauthorized EFT or a series of related unauthorized EFTs will be determined as follows:

    1. If you notify us within two business days after learning of the loss or theft of your password, or other information that could allow unauthorized
    access to your account, your liability will not exceed the lesser of $50 or the amount of unauthorized EFTs that occur before notice to us.

    2. If you fail to notify us within two business days after learning of the loss or theft of your password or other information that could allow
    unauthorized access to your account, but do notify us within 60 days of our transmittal of your statement, your liability will not exceed the lesser of
    $500 or the sum of:

    · $50 or the amount of unauthorized EFTs that occur within the two business days, whichever is less; and

    · The amount of unauthorized EFTs that occur after the close of two business days and before notice to us, provided we establish that these EFTs would not
    have occurred had you notified us within that two-day period.

    3. You must report an unauthorized EFTs that appears on a periodic statement within 60 days of our transmittal of the statement to avoid unlimited
    liability for unauthorized transfers (including liability for bank fees, including overdraft fees, etc.) and to avoid liability for subsequent transfers.
    If you fail to do so, your liability will not exceed the amount of the unauthorized EFTs that occur after the close of the 60 days and before notice to us,
    and that we establish would not have occurred had you notified us within the 60-day period. You may, as applicable, also be liable for the amounts
    described in the immediately preceding sections 1 or 2 above.

    4. If your delay in notifying us was due to extenuating circumstances as reasonably determined by the bank, we will extend the times specified in the
    immediately preceding paragraphs 1, 2, or 3 above to a reasonable period.

    5. You may notify us in person, by telephone, by email during a secure session using the appropriate form, or in writing. You will need to include in your
    correspondence (1) Name and account number. (2) Describe the error or the transfer you believe is inaccurate, and explain as clearly as you can why you
    believe there is an error or why you need more information. (3) Tell us the dollar amount of the suspected error. If you tell us orally, we may require
    that you send us your complaint or question in writing within 10 Business Days.

    6. You will be notified within 10 Business Days after we hear from you and will correct any error promptly. If we need more time, however, we may take up
    to 45 days to investigate your complaint or question. If we decide to do this, we will re-credit your account within 10 Business Days for the amount you
    think is in error, so that you will have the use of the money during the time that it takes us to complete our investigation. If we request you to put your
    complaint in writing and do not receive that notice within 10 Business days, we may not re-credit your account. If we find that there was no error, we will
    send you notification with a written explanation within 3 Business Days after completing our investigation. You may request copies of the documents that we
    used in our investigation.

    The time limits and provisional re-crediting procedures described in the preceding paragraph do not apply to businesses, which are subject to the
    provisions of the Accounts Terms & Conditions Disclosure.

    SEVERABILITY

    If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or void, the rest of the Agreement will remain in full force and effect.

    OUR RESPONSIBILITY FOR PROCESSING TRANSACTIONS

    Regardless of anything to the contrary in this Agreement, or any other agreement, unless otherwise required by law, we will not be liable for untimely or
    incorrect transfers, including but not limited to the following scenarios: you fail to provide us with timely, complete and accurate information for any
    transactions; through no fault of ours, you do not have enough money in your account to make the payment or transfer requested; the payment or transfer
    would exceed any permitted overdraft line of credit or overdraft privileges you have with us; circumstances beyond our control (such as fire, flood, water
    damage, power failure, strike, labor dispute, computer malfunction, interruption of telephone, Internet service, or telecommunications facilities or a
    natural disaster) prevent or postpone the transfer, despite reasonable precautions taken by us; the funds in your Account were subject to legal process, an
    uncollected funds hold or otherwise not available; your account is closed, dormant, frozen or blocked; you did not properly follow Service instructions on
    how to make the transfer (this includes incorrect date, amount, or untimely completion of the transfer to meet the cut-off time); your operating system,
    Internet connection and/or software malfunctioned for any reason; or the transaction could not be completed due to inability to access the service during
    maintenance. In addition may be other liability exclusions stated in our Account Agreement.

First US Bancshares, Inc. Reports Second Quarter Results 
0





 
14
0









      THOMASVILLE, Ala., July 27, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- First US
      Bancshares, Inc. (Nasdaq:FUSB) (the “Company”) today reported
      net income of $416,000, or $0.06 per diluted share, for the
      quarter ended June 30, 2017 and $820,000, or $0.13 per
      diluted share, for the six months ended June 30, 2017. 
      The six-month results represent an increase of $0.01 per
      diluted share compared to the same period of 2016.  The
      improved six-month results were achieved despite an increase
      in the provision for loan losses of $388,000 and a reduction
      in gains on sale and prepayment of securities of $348,000 for
      the six months ended June 30, 2017, compared to the same
      period in 2016. 


Financial Highlights



Interest Income – Interest and fees on loans
        increased by $707,000 during the six months ended June 30,
        2017, compared to the corresponding period of 2016. 
        The increase resulted from increased average loan volume
        and was partially offset by a decrease of $188,000 in
        interest on investment securities as proceeds from the
        scheduled maturity of investments were redeployed into the
        loan portfolio.   
         
      

Loan Growth – Net loans increased $12.8 million
        during the second quarter, an increase of 4.0% from March
        31, 2017, or 16.2% on an annualized basis.  Growth in
        the Company’s banking subsidiary, First US Bank (the
        “Bank”), totaled $9.5 million during the quarter, while the
        Company’s finance company subsidiary, Acceptance Loan
        Company, Inc. (“ALC”), grew its loan portfolio by $3.3
        million during the quarter.   Year-to-date growth
        in net loans as of June 30, 2017 totaled $7.8 million, or
        4.8% on an annualized basis.  Of the total growth,
        $5.3 million and $2.5 million was attributable to the Bank
        and ALC, respectively.
         
      

Asset Quality Improvement – 
        Non-performing assets, including loans in non-accrual
        status and other real estate owned, decreased to $6.2
        million, or 1.01% of total assets, as of June 30, 2017,
        compared to $8.0 million, or 1.33% of total assets, as of
        June 30, 2016.   
         
      

Provision for Loan Loss – The increase in interest
        income was partially offset by an increase in the Company’s
        provision for loan losses of $388,000, comparing the six
        months ended June 30, 2017 to the six months ended June 30,
        2016.  The lower provision in 2016 was attributable to
        a reduction in reserves for loan losses at the Bank of
        $450,000 in 2016 that was not repeated in 2017 due to
        growth in the loan portfolio over the past year. 
        Total provision expense, including both the Bank and ALC,
        was $1.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017,
        compared to $703,000 for the six months ended June 30,
        2016.
      


      “We are pleased to report a modest improvement in earnings
      during the first half of 2017,” stated James F. House,
      President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. “This
      is particularly true given that those earnings resulted
      directly from the loan growth we experienced during 2016 and
      the first half of 2017. Our management team remains committed
      to improving revenue through loan growth at the Bank and
      sustained performance at ALC,” continued Mr. House. 
        
    

Results of Operations


Pre-provision net interest income totaled $7.1 million in
      the second quarter of 2017, compared to $6.9 million in the
      second quarter of 2016.  The increase in net interest
      income resulted from loan growth.  Average loans totaled
      $325.7 million during the second quarter of 2017, compared to
      $275.9 million during the second quarter of 2016.  
      Net yield on interest-earning assets was 5.09% for the second
      quarter of 2017, compared to 5.19% during the second quarter
      of the previous year.  For the six months ended June 30,
      2017, pre-provision net interest income totaled $14.0
      million, compared to $13.6 million during the same period of
      the previous year.  Average loans totaled $325.4 million
      and $268.0 million during the six months ended June 30, 2017
      and 2016, respectively.  Net yield on interest-earning
      assets was 5.07% during the first six months of 2017,
      compared to 5.15% during the first six months of 2016.

         
      


The provision for loan losses was $576,000 for the second
      quarter of 2017, compared to $536,000 during the second
      quarter of 2016.  For the six months ended June 30,
      2017, the provision for loan losses totaled $1.1 million,
      compared to $703,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2016.
       The increase in the provision in both periods of 2017
      compared to the previous year resulted from reductions in
      reserves that occurred at the Bank in 2016 that were not
      repeated in 2017 due to growth in the loan portfolio over the
      past year.  The allowance for loan losses as a
      percentage of loans was 1.46% as of June 30, 2017, compared
      to 1.48% as of December 31, 2016.
         
      
Non-interest income totaled $930,000 in the second
      quarter of 2017, compared to $1.5 million in the second
      quarter of 2016.   For the six months ended June
      30, 2017, non-interest income totaled $2.1 million, compared
      to $2.5 million for the first six months of the previous
      year.  The decrease in non-interest income in both the
      three- and six-month periods of 2017 resulted primarily from
      gains on sales of securities that occurred in 2016 but were
      not repeated in 2017. 
         
      
Non-interest expense totaled $6.9 million in the second
      quarter of 2017, compared to $7.3 million in the second
      quarter of 2016.  For the six months ended June 30, 2017
      and 2016, non-interest expense totaled $13.9 million and
      $14.3 million, respectively.  The decrease in
      non-interest expense in both periods presented resulted
      primarily from reductions in regulatory assessments,
      insurance expense, and occupancy and equipment expense. 
      These reductions were partially offset by increases in
      salaries and benefits expense. 
      


Balance Sheet Management


Net loans totaled $330.5 million as of June 30, 2017,
      compared to $322.8 million as of December 31, 2016. The
      increase in net loans included increases of $5.3 million and
      $2.5 million at the Bank and ALC, respectively.  The
      growth in loan volume was funded primarily through cash flows
      generated from the scheduled maturity of investment
      securities.  Investment securities totaled $200.8
      million as of June 30, 2017, compared to $207.8 million as of
      December 31, 2016. Investment securities serve to both
      enhance interest income and provide an additional source of
      liquidity available to fund loan growth and capital
      expenditures. Management has structured the investment
      portfolio to provide cash flows through interest earned and
      the maturity or payoff of securities in the portfolio on a
      monthly basis. In the current environment, it is expected
      that cash flows from the investment portfolio will continue
      to serve as a significant source of liquidity available for
      the funding of future loan growth.
         
      
Premises and equipment increased by $7.4 million during
      the six months ended June 30, 2017 due to capital
      expenditures associated with the construction of an office
      complex in the Birmingham, Alabama area.  Construction
      of the office complex is nearing completion.  The
      facility will house a retail branch of the Bank, as well as
      the Birmingham-based commercial lending team and certain
      members of the Bank’s executive management team.
         
      
Liabilities increased to $537.8 million as of June 30,
      2017, compared to $530.7 million as of December 31, 2016. The
      increase resulted primarily from an increase in deposits of
      $11.7 million, partially offset by decreases in short-term
      borrowings and long-term debt totaling $4.5 million. Deposits
      generated through the Bank’s branch system are considered the
      Company’s primary funding source to meet short- and long-term
      liquidity needs. Deposit levels fluctuate throughout the year
      based on seasonality, as well as specific circumstances
      impacting deposit customers. In addition to deposits,
      significant external sources of liquidity are available to
      the Bank, including access to funding through federal funds
      lines, Federal Home Loan Bank advances and brokered
      deposits.
         
      
Shareholders’ equity increased to $78.4 million, or
      $12.91 per outstanding common share, as of June 30, 2017,
      compared to $76.2 million, or $12.62 per outstanding common
      share, as of December 31, 2016. The increase in shareholders’
      equity resulted primarily from continued growth in retained
      earnings and increases in other comprehensive income
      resulting from changes in the fair value of investment
      securities available-for-sale.
         
      
The Company declared a cash dividend of $0.02 per share
      on its common stock in the second quarter of 2017. This
      amount is consistent with the Company’s quarterly dividend
      declarations for the first quarter of 2017 and each quarter
      of 2016.
         
      
During the second quarter, the Bank continued to maintain
      capital ratios at higher levels than the ratios required to
      be considered a “well-capitalized” institution under
      applicable banking regulations. As of June 30, 2017, the
      Bank’s common equity Tier 1 capital and Tier 1 risk-based
      capital ratios were each 18.88%. Its total capital ratio was
      20.13%, and its Tier 1 leverage ratio was 12.23%.
