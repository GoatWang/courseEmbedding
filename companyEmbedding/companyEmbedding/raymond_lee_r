Early life and education[edit]
Lee Raymond was born in Watertown, South Dakota on August 13, 1938. He graduated from Watertown High School in 1956. Raymond received a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1960. Raymond went on to earn his PhD in Chemical Engineering from the University of Minnesota. He was awarded an honorary doctorate from the same university in 2001. Raymond met his wife, Charlene née Hocevar, while studying at the University of Wisconsin–Madison; she was pursuing, and later earned a degree in journalism.
Career[edit]
Raymond began working for ExxonMobil in 1963. Raymond became a director of ExxonMobil in 1984 and in 1987 he became the President of the company. In 1993, he became CEO, a post he held until 2005. On August 14, 2005, Raymond announced that he would retire at the end of 2005 as ExxonMobil's Chairman and CEO. ExxonMobil president Rex W. Tillerson succeeded Raymond on 1 January 2006. On April 14, 2006, it was reported that Raymond's retirement package was worth about $400 million, the largest in history for a U.S. public company.[2] However, the majority of that sum consisted of retirement-independent salary, bonuses, stock options, and restricted stock awards from his final year and prior years that, while high, are not unprecedented among major American CEOs. Retirement-specific payments in accordance with the standard pension plan provided to all ExxonMobil employees totaled around $100 million, calculated based on his over forty years of service and his salary upon retirement. Raymond was also chair of the National Petroleum Council (NPC), when it was asked to produce a report on the future of oil supply and demand.[3] Raymond was one of the most outspoken executives in the United States against regulation to curtail global warming.[4]
Legacy[edit]
Lee Raymond was at the helm of Exxon while it remained one of the last large companies to omit gay employees in its anti-discrimination policy. He was also at the helm during the takeover of Mobil, when the new Exxon-Mobil corporation rescinded Mobil's pre-existing anti-discrimination policy.[5] HR policy was eventually updated in 2015 to include a prohibition on discrimination against gay employees, but from 1999-2014 the board annually rejected a resolution brought by shareholders to compel the company to implement a non-discrimination policy.[6]
Raymond was also one of the few Fortune 500 CEOs to publicly speak against the Kyoto Protocol. He questioned the science behind global warming, and warned that regulations would be ineffective.
His son, John T. Raymond, is active in the oil and gas industry. John partnered with the Jim Flores and Paul Allen-backed Vulcan Capital in the buyout of Plains Resources.[7]
Lee Raymond received the Woodrow Wilson Award from the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars of the Smithsonian Institution for Corporate Citizenship during a dinner held in his honor in Dallas, Texas in early 2003.[citation needed]

Retirement-specific payments in accordance with the standard pension plan provided to all ExxonMobil employees totaled around $100 million, calculated based on his over forty years of service and his salary upon retirement. Raymond was also chair of the National Petroleum Council (NPC), when it was asked to produce a report on the future of oil supply and demand.[3] Raymond was one of the most outspoken executives in the United States against regulation to curtail global warming.[4]
Legacy[edit]
Lee Raymond was at the helm of Exxon while it remained one of the last large companies to omit gay employees in its anti-discrimination policy. He was also at the helm during the takeover of Mobil, when the new Exxon-Mobil corporation rescinded Mobil's pre-existing anti-discrimination policy.[5] HR policy was eventually updated in 2015 to include a prohibition on discrimination against gay employees, but from 1999-2014 the board annually rejected a resolution brought by shareholders to compel the company to implement a non-discrimination policy.[6]
Raymond was also one of the few Fortune 500 CEOs to publicly speak against the Kyoto Protocol. He questioned the science behind global warming, and warned that regulations would be ineffective.
His son, John T. Raymond, is active in the oil and gas industry. John partnered with the Jim Flores and Paul Allen-backed Vulcan Capital in the buyout of Plains Resources.[7]
Lee Raymond received the Woodrow Wilson Award from the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars of the Smithsonian Institution for Corporate Citizenship during a dinner held in his honor in Dallas, Texas in early 2003.[citation needed]

      ■ Lee R. Raymond headed one of the most powerful corporations in
      the world, Exxon Mobil Corporation. He began his career after receiving a
      PhD in chemical engineering from the University of Minnesota. The son of a
      railroad engineer from Watertown, South Dakota, Raymond kept his personal
      life out of the limelight while steering one of the world's largest
      corporations. Raymond set his course with Exxon early on with innovative
      moves that cut costs and increased profits, the hallmark of his entire
      career. With a changing view on petroleum-based products, Raymond defended
      Exxon against environmentalists and human rights activists while denying
      the viability of renewable energy sources. He continued to pursue natural
      gas projects and grew Exxon in other parts of the world, despite war and
      threats of war in oil-rich countries in the early years of the 21st
      century. As a result, Exxon continued to grow even though the protests
      grew louder.
    

      RELUCTANT PUBLIC FIGURE REVEALS LITTLE
    

      Raymond prided himself on the lack of information in the media about his
      personal life. He was born in Watertown, South Dakota, in 1938 in the
      Great Plains area of the United States. Watertown sits on the shores of
      Lake Kempeska, and by 2004 its population had grown to 20,000. Most
      accounts note that Raymond's father was a railroad engineer, but
      little is known of Raymond's early years in South Dakota. He began
      his college career at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, some 400
      miles east of Watertown. He completed his education with a PhD from the
      University of Minnesota in 1963. Both of his degrees were in chemical
      engineering. Even though Raymond did not venture very far from the Midwest
      during his early years, his career began in the oil industry in Texas when
      he was hired by the Exxon Corporation, which is the successor company to
      John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil.
    

      EXXON'S RISING STAR
    

      Exxon hired Raymond in 1963 and put him to work as a production research
      engineer in Tulsa, Oklahoma. For the next 14 years, he received promotions
      as an engineer, eventually ending up on the island of Aruba in the
      Caribbean. It was in that tropical paradise that he set the course for his
      career in the oil company by turning around profits at the refinery on the
      island. At the time of his appointment, the refinery was losing $10
      million a month. By cutting costs and convincing Venezuela to provide
      extra-heavy crude oil, he had turned the losses into a profit of $25
      million per month by 1979.
    

      Executives at Exxon took notice of the major turnaround and named Raymond
      vice president of Exxon Enterprises in 1981. Raymond said that he received
      no directives on how to proceed with this diversified company that
      produced items from solar energy products to a computer chipmaker. After
      studying the company, Raymond decided to shut down some operations, a move
      approved by the leadership at Exxon. The company eventually shut down or
      sold all of the Enterprise businesses in existence. This move garnered
      Raymond the top slot in Esso Inter-America, a job used to groom future
      executives for Exxon.
    

      Raymond continued to impress his superiors with his cost-cutting measures,
      especially after such failures as Enterprise, Reliance Electric, and a
      shale oil program. As the 1980s began,
       Raymond's style fit right in with Exxon's new direction on
      profit enhancement rather than on growth.
    

      APPOINTED CEO
    

      During the first four years after his appointment as CEO, Raymond
      increased profits on operations from the company's oil fields,
      refineries, and convenience stores. He solidly built up the return on
      capital, which determined for Exxon the measure of profitability. By 1996
      Raymond had brought up the return to 14.7 percent, a feat that, according
      to analysts, other companies had been attempting to achieve for years.
      However, some analysts believed that Raymond's record was not all
      that impressive. Some contended that Exxon was ready for a monopoly
      breakup, but Raymond insisted that such a move would make little sense.
      The analysts cited the decline in the production of crude oil during the
      1990s.
    

      Raymond responded to those critics by buying back stock rather than by
      starting new oil fields. Without the distraction of exploring for oil
      fields, Raymond spent nearly five years getting the most out of a barrel
      of oil. Pinching pennies with the processes of oil production,
      transportation, and marketing had paid off by 1997, when it was shown that
      operating costs had been reduced by $1.3 billion annually.
    

      The analyst William Randol told 
      
        Fortune
      
       in 1997, "Exxon has proven itself to be very, very stingy. They
      just don't piss away money the way other integrated companies
      do" (April 28, 1997).
    

      GROWS COMPANY AGAIN
    

      In 1997 Raymond made a decision to begin growing Exxon once again. When
      Exxon reported income of $7.5 billion in 1996, Raymond decided to change
      course after spending his first few years as CEO concentrating on the
      cost-cutting methods on which his reputation within the company had been
      founded.
    

      Raymond began by pursuing a new patent that would convert natural gas into
      a diesel-like fuel or heating oil. He hoped this new method would boost
      revenues because a barrel of this new fuel could be produced for $20 in
      1997, the cost of a regular barrel of oil. The process itself involved
      simply adding steam, oxygen, and catalysts to natural gas. Even though
      Exxon owned large gas fields, transporting the gas had been cost
      prohibitive. With the conversion of natural gas into a liquid form,
      transportation became less costly and required less extensive plants to
      process the new fuel. Cooling the natural gas to minus 260 degrees
      Fahrenheit converts the gas to its liquid form, which takes up much less
      space. Industry insiders called this new invention a revolution in the oil
      industry.
    

      Opportunities began arising in Russia, Indonesia, and Africa to develop
      gargantuan fields at low costs. These countries had begun settling down
      politically by the late 1990s, and Raymond took advantage of
      analysts' predictions that Asia's demand for oil products
      would begin to expand. Raymond set a goal of increasing Exxon's
      crude oil output by 3 percent over the next 10 years.
    

      MANAGEMENT STYLE
    

      Noted for his reticence to talk to the press, Raymond kept his own counsel
      after his appointment as CEO. Industry insiders said that he had no
      hobbies, nor did he have any colleagues to whom he turned when he needed
      advice. Public relations officials with Exxon adamantly protected his
      privacy. In 1997 insiders noted that he was the only Exxon CEO ever to
      operate without a clear second in command. Some found his lack of an inner
      circle refreshing. His predecessor, Lawrence Raul, had an intimate inner
      circle, and many who worked for Exxon found it difficult to judge whom to
      court and whom leave alone. No such worries existed under the leadership
      of Raymond.
    

      Raymond was the only Exxon CEO ever to have earned a PhD. Many found his
      extreme intelligence to be intimidating while others characterized him as
      arrogant. He was extremely well informed on anything related to Exxon. 
      
        BusinessWeek
      
       described Raymond's workplace in Irving, Texas, as being located
      in "a fortress-like building" with his office located at the
      end of a long row of anterooms (April 9, 2001). His desk was placed under
      the painting of a ferocious-looking tiger. This interior suite for
      management at the Exxon headquarters was referred to as "the God
      pod." A visitor reporting to 
      
        BusinessWeek
      
       said that Raymond was always courteous but unmovable. "If he gives
      his word, which he is reluctant to do, he will keep it. But he is very
      difficult to deal with" (April 9, 2001).
    

      Even though Exxon ruled as the oil giant, industry insiders described
      Raymond's management style as centralized. Raymond was noted for
      his penchant personally to have a hand in all sorts of deals within the
      company, becoming characterized as a micromanager.
    

      MERGER SUCCESSFUL, BUT NOT FOR EMPLOYEES
    

      When Exxon and Mobil announced a merger in 1998, regulators required the
      companies to sell some of their assets to allow competition within the oil
      industry. Bringing together the two major oil companies meant that the new
      Exxon Mobil Corporation increased its net earnings by $1.2 billion in the
      first year of the merger, with the potential of bringing a total of $2.5
      billion in growth by 2003. When the merger was announced, it immediately
      became clear that Raymond would lead the combined corporation, giving the
      Mobil CEO a back seat in the top echelon of Exxon Mobil.
    

      Before the merger was finished, Raymond had cut annual costs by $1.2
      billion. After the merger, to increase profits Raymond reverted to his
      former cost-cutting methods, eliminating 2,000 executive positions out of
      the 3,000 in place between the two companies. Raymond also made sure that
      the requirements made by the Securities and Exchange Commission did not
      hurt the profit sheets either. The sales of such assets as service
      stations and a refinery brought $3 billion in cash to Exxon Mobil.
    

      In addition to cutting executive positions and selling assets, Raymond
      began cutting employees throughout the company, bringing a total savings
      of $3.8 billion a year within four years of the merger. These huge savings
      came as a result of the elimination of 16,000 jobs. Despite the dire news
      for employees, Exxon Mobil stock rose to $84.25 on the day of the
      announcement of the job losses. Analysts applauded the savings and
      calculated that Raymond's estimates were low, predicting that the
      corporation would become a moneymaking machine.
    

      When Raymond announced the job cuts, he noted that the entire blueprint
      for the elimination of 16,000 jobs had not been completed but said that
      10,000 cuts would occur within two years, with 6,000 outside of the United
      States and the remaining 4,000 at U.S. facilities. Some of the job losses,
      approximately 6,000, came as a result of attrition, and those positions
      were not refilled. The rest of the employees were laid off, although they
      were offered a severance package that included four weeks' salary
      for every year worked at the company plus their highest bonus earned.
    

      With cost-cutting measures in place, Raymond readied the company to become
      the biggest fish in the ocean, literally. Oil exploration in deep ocean
      waters beckoned Raymond despite the high costs associated with this type
      of experiment, especially in the uncharted waters off the coast of Africa
      and South America.
    

      NEW CENTURY MARKS CRITICAL PERIOD
    

      As the 21st century loomed, Raymond still remained steadfast in his
      defense of the fossil fuel business, stating at an industry conference in
      2000 that Exxon would stay away from renewable sources of energy. He cited
      Exxon's history of concentrating on oil and said that oil would
      continue to be the corporation's focus.
    

      The 
      
        Oil Daily
      
       reported that Raymond was a "vehement campaigner on behalf of the
      fossil fuel lobby [and] has argued for years that limiting the greenhouse
      emissions from fossil fuels believed to cause global warning will have a
      devastating impact on world economic growth" (February 16, 2000).
    

      Raymond made this announcement despite the entrance into the renewables
      business of such competitors as BP, Amoco, and Shell. Those companies
      predicted that renewables would provide half of the world's power
      within 50 years.
    

      Raymond's adamant stance brought protests from the company's
      religious shareholders. In 2000 the Dominican Sisters of Caldwell, New
      Jersey, filed a resolution. According to the 
      
        Oil Daily
      
      , the resolution stated that Exxon "has misinformed shareholders
      about global warming with inaccurate statements and unreliable
      information" (December 13, 2000).
    

      Further, the group accused Raymond of making false statements based on
      unreliable sources. They based their findings on a report by Dr. Lloyd
      Keigwin, a scientist who had completed studies for Exxon on global
      warming, who said that Exxon had used his information in a misleading way.
    

      Campaign Exxon Mobil, the group of religious shareholders in Exxon, cited
      Raymond's claim that he had a petition containing signatures of
      17,000 scientists who believed that there was no consensus on global
      warning. Campaign Exxon Mobil argued that the signatures had been obtained
      from the Internet with no verification, stating that the names included
      those of TV sitcom characters, the Spice Girls, and the singer James
      Brown.
    

      Raymond did not respond to the charges. Instead he announced that he would
      seek out methods to increase Exxon's efficiency while bringing
      larger returns to its stockholders, but he drew the line at outsourcing to
      other countries for research and development.
    

      By 2001 Raymond's strategies had made Exxon Mobil one of the
      world's most powerful corporations. An industry insider told 
      
        BusinessWeek
      
       that Exxon had only one way to do things: "the most efficient with
      the least risk. They want to see the studies. If the studies are yours,
      they want to redo them" (April 9, 2001).
    

      As Exxon's power base grew, so did resentment over the
      company's arrogance, which caused analysts to turn skeptical when
      predicting the future of Exxon. While analysts respected Raymond's
      leadership, they did not have positive feelings about his methods. These
      skeptics pointed to Exxon's isolation within the industry as
      causing its own set of problems. Most of the other large corporations
      banded together to cut the cost of exploration and development, but Exxon
      went its own way.
    

      RETIREMENT POSTPONED
    

      When Raymond turned 63 in 2001, Exxon announced that he would stay beyond
      his official retirement in 2003, when he would turn 65. The company said
      that it needed time to groom a successor to the CEO. Analysts suggested
      that the announcement signaled the company's intention to choose a
      younger CEO rather than someone within the ranks just behind Raymond.
    

      The decision may have been based on some of the difficult situations that
      loomed in the future for the company as Exxon was awarded gas development
      projects in Saudi Arabia.
    

      In addition, in 2002 Raymond announced a host of projects in the works
      regarding natural gas, including the production and exploration of major
      gas sources in Bolivia, Indonesia, Australia, and Russia. Raymond also
      assured analysts that Exxon would still be able to produce the 3 percent
      annual average increase in oil and gas production despite the interference
      of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in initiating
      restraints on production as well as the war and unrest within the
      countries from which Exxon obtained most of its products.
    

      Raymond continued to push his company on researching the technology that
      would turn natural gas into a diesel form of fuel. He also said that the
      company was concentrating on its North American sources through new
      drilling and seismic technologies.
    

      By 2002 the gains from the merger of Exxon and Mobil showed that early
      predictions had underestimated the potential growth. The projection of a
      $4 billion gain in efficiency production by 2002 turned out to be low.
      Within the first quarter of 2002, the figure was upped to $7 billion, with
      another $1 billion added in 2003. Raymond said his predictions had proven
      that he knew how to produce profits despite changes in the economy.
    

      DEFENDING ENVIRONMENTAL AND HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD
    

      Raymond often defended the environmental and human rights record of Exxon
      against protesters who said that the oil giant did not use accurate
      research or treat all of its employees across the globe fairly.
    

      Despite his acknowledgment at a 2002 shareholder meeting that there might
      be a high risk of climate change due to the use of fossil fuels, Raymond
      still maintained that huge differences of opinion remained among the
      different researchers in climate science. He asked for further research
      but also insisted that an initiative in emissions reductions with car
      manufacturers was still needed.
    

      During this June 2002 meeting, shareholders were asked to vote on two
      proposals, both opposed by Raymond. One concerned more development of
      renewable energy sources. The other involved a ban on discrimination
      against homosexuals.
    

      Amnesty International and Greenpeace both hosted protest rallies in Dallas
      the day before the meeting, and their representatives also attended the
      meeting. While advisers on the voting suggested that shareholders support
      the renewable energy proposal, the motion was rejected by an 80 percent
      vote.
    

      Raymond continued his campaign to discredit the viability of renewable
      energy sources. 
      
        Weekly Petroleum Argus
      
       reported that Raymond said "Even 'green' energy has
      an impact on the environment, noting that large-scale solar and wind farms
      take up land and can affect wildlife" (June 3, 2002).
    

      To appease the protesters, Raymond did concede that Exxon would report
      greenhouse gas emissions while cutting the emissions at facilities in an
      attempt to reduce energy consumption by 15 percent over a several-year
      period. In addition, Raymond continued to stress Exxon's dedication
      to work with automobile manufacturers on reducing vehicle emissions. He
      announced that new methods might include advancement in the internal
      combustion engine and more dependence on fuel cells.
    

      Raymond told shareholders that the company was committed to work with the
      new technologies in an effort to remain competitive within the oil
      industry. He stressed that these new technologies would reduce not only
      costs but also the impact on the environment. His commitment to this goal
      was reflected in the $500 million spent by Exxon by 2002 on renewable
      energy sources research.
    

      In 2003 Raymond maintained that he would remain patient as the project to
      convert natural gas continued its slow progress to completion. Also the
      expansion into Russia entered into negotiations in 2003. Analysts
      speculated that an agreement with Russia remained Raymond's goal
      before he entered into a discussion about his retirement. Raymond told 
      
        Petroleum Intelligence Weekly
      
      , "I totally recognize I can't shed my Exxon background, and
      whatever I do reflects on the company, so that's why I'm a
      lifer. And I'm pleased to be a lifer" (November 10, 2003).
