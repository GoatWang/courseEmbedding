  A hedge fund that invested $96.1 million in Theranos is suing the
  blood-testing company, 
  The Wall Street Journal reports.


  Partner Fund Management LP invested in Theranos back in 2014. The
  firm, among other investors that collectively funneled hundreds
  of millions of dollars into Theranos, largely remained silent as
  the startup withered under increasing scrutiny during the past
  year, The Journal said.


  "Through a series of lies, material misstatements, and omissions,
  the defendants engaged in securities fraud and other violations
  by fraudulently inducing PFM to invest and maintain its
  investment in the company," the company said in a letter to
  investors that 
  The Journal reviewed.


  The suit comes less than a week after Theranos 
  stopped all of its clinical operations, cutting 340 positions
  and closing its Wellness Centers where blood tests were
  performed.


  Instead, Theranos will focus solely on its technology, namely the
  miniLab platform it introduced in August at a scientific
  conference. 
  The product reveal didn't go over too well because those in
  attendance were hoping for large amounts of independently
  reviewed data that validated the company's blood-test results.


  "We are fortunate to have supporters and investors who believe
  deeply in our mission of affordable, less invasive lab testing,
  and to have the runway to realize our vision," Theranos CEO
  Elizabeth Holmes said 
  in an open letter published Wednesday.


  Theranos until Wednesday was trying to own all the parts of the
  blood-testing industry by building the technology as well as
  administering the tests to patients.


  The company's business model was based on offering more than 100
  simple blood tests at a cost much lower than at traditional blood
  labs, in addition to developing its own technology to test that
  blood, which Holmes had emphasized would need to be drawn in only
  very small amounts.


  In the past year, however, Theranos' aspirations to be a one-stop
  shop have been derailed, with the company having to void 
  two years' worth of tests. The government agency that
  regulates clinical labs found that Theranos' Northern California
  lab posed "immediate
  jeopardy to patient health and safety."

  The firm alleges, according to The Journal


That Theranos said it could do more forms of its finger-prick
  blood tests than it actually could.
  
That the company overstated how much it had submitted to the
  Food and Drug Administration.
  
That the company couldn't uphold its partnerships with
  companies like Walgreens, 
    which ended its partnership with Theranos back in June,
    closing 40 Wellness Center locations.
  


  Here's Theranos' response:


  "The suit, filed by a hedge fund, is without merit and Theranos
  will fight it vigorously. The hedge fund is engaging in
  revisionist history, making claims that are not rooted in facts.
  The company remains committed to its mission and is appreciative
  of its strong investor base that understands and continues to
  support those efforts."

Academy Bank


                                            They cancelled my secured credit card without informing me.  Did not refund the money from secured card without me calling,. Guess they thought I might forget.  Will be closing all accounts with them today.  Worst customer service of any bank I've dealt with

PenFed Credit Union


                                            HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! They do not work with you at all to satisfy the customer. Other credit unions help you ESPECIALLY if you have great credit. This CU doesn't tell you everything so verify everything with two other reps. Total Nightmare!

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services
Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services
Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.
