Glossary






Biodiesel: The biofuel substitute for diesel. It derives from oilseed based crops – mainly oilseed rape (OSR) in the UK, and palm oil in South East Asia.
Bioethanol: The biofuel substitute for petrol (gasoline). It derives from cereal based crops – mainly wheat in the UK, and maize (corn), soya beans and sugarcane in the US and South America.
Biofiltration: A pollution control technique using living material to capture and biologically degrade process pollutants. Common uses include processing waste water, capturing harmful chemicals or silt from surface runoff, and microbiotic oxidation of contaminants in air.
Biofuels : Fuels derived from renewable raw materials, such as bark, black liquor or logging residuals.
Biogas: The biofuel substitute for natural gas. It derives from organic waste materials including animal waste and waste generated from municipal, commercial and industrial sources through the process of anaerobic digestion. Biogas is a ‘second generation fuel’, i.e. it is derived from non-food sources.
Biomass Energy: A renewable energy source, is biological material from living, or recently living organisms, such as wood, waste, (hydrogen) gas, and alcohol fuels. Biomass is commonly plant matter grown to generate electricity or produce heat. In this sense, living biomass can also be included, as plants can also generate electricity while still alive. The most conventional way biomass is used however, still relies on direct incineration.
Blended Value: Blended value represents a broader way of thinking about the nature of value creation by organizations, whether for-profit, nonprofit or hybrid, and through the application of capital. Emerson coined the “blended value” term to transcend the previously bifurcated definitions of value as either economic or social/environmental so that the focus could shift to maximizing companies, communities and capital.
Building Automation : Describes the functionality provided by the control system of a building. A building automation system (BAS) is an example of a distributed control system. The control system is a computerized, intelligent network of electronic devices, designed to monitor and control the mechanical and lighting systems in a building. BAS core functionality keeps the building climate within a specified range, provides lighting based on an occupancy schedule, and monitors system performance and device failures and provides email and/or text notifications to building engineering staff. The BAS functionality reduces building energy and maintenance costs when compared to a non-controlled building. Buildings with these systems are sometimes called “Smart Buildings.”
Building Deconstruction: The selective dismantlement of building components, specifically for re-use, recycling, and waste management. It differs from demolition where a site is cleared of its building by the most expedient means. Deconstruction has also been defined as “construction in reverse.”
Building Information Modeling (BIM): The process of generating and managing building data during its life cycle. Typically it uses three-dimensional, real-time, dynamic building modeling software to increase productivity in building design and construction. The process produces the Building Information Model (also abbreviated BIM), which encompasses building geometry, spatial relationships, geographic information, and quantities and properties of building components.
Cap and Trade: A cap being placed on the total amount of allowable emissions, the distribution of this total between polluters, and the creation of a marketplace where owners of the permits can trade with each other.
Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS): The process of capturing carbon that is emitted from energy production and diverting it into ground storage areas, to reduce the amount of CO2 emitted into the atmosphere.
Carbon Credits: A generic term for any tradable certificate or permit representing the right to emit one ton of carbon dioxide or carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-e). They represent a component of national and international attempts to mitigate the growth in concentrations of greenhouse gases.
Carbon Dioxide Equivalents (CO2e): The internationally recognised way of expressing the amount of global warming of a particular greenhouse gas in terms of the amount of CO2 required to achieve the same warming effect over 100 years.
Carbon Footprint: The total emissions of greenhouse gases (in carbon equivalents) from whichever source is being measured – be it at an individual, organisation or product level.
Carbon Labeling: Used to measure for the consumers the amount of embedded carbon there is in the product.
Carbon Neutral: Through carbon offsetting organisation to individual are counterbalancing the emissions they produce to make themselves carbon neutral.
Carbon Offsetting: The process of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by purchasing credits from others through emissions reductions projects, or carbon trading schemes. The term often refers to voluntary acts, arranged by a commercial carbon offset provider.
Carbon Sink: An absorber of carbon dioxide; oceans and forests are natural carbon sinks.
Ceres: A non-profit organization advocating for sustainability leadership. Ceres mobilizes a powerful network of investors, companies and public interest groups to accelerate and expand the adoption of sustainable business practices and solutions to build a healthy global economy with a mission to mobilize investor and business leadership to build a thriving, sustainable global economy.
CERFLOR: Sistema Brazileiro de Certificacão Florestal – a Brazilian forest certification system endorsed by PEFC.
CGI: The Clinton Global Initiative – The mission of the CGI is to turn ideas into action.
