So when it’s time to talk, and you need the support of an experienced and dedicated team for your divorce and family law matters, count on Diana L. Skaggs + Partners, PLLC.Child Custody and VisitationNow a Fellow of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, Michelle Eisenmenger Mapes joined Diana L. Skaggs + Associates in 2004, following her 2003 graduation from the Louis D. Brandeis School of Law at the University of Louisville with a Juris Doctor degree. While working toward her degree, Mapes worked as Editor-in-Chief for the Journal of Law & Education, as a law clerk in Indiana courtrooms and Kentucky and Indiana law firms and as a research assistant at the Brandeis School of Law. The youngest of five children, Mapes became interested in family law after watching her siblings experience the difficulties of divorce. “I witnessed the emotional and financial devastation that can result from divorce as well as disputes over child custody, visitation and support. In each case, I wished that my brother or sister could achieve a peaceful and speedy resolution and thought this would best be accomplished by attorneys who consider not only the financial, but also the emotional results for their clients and their children,” says Mapes, who today enjoys advocating for her clients’ interests and goals, while working to achieve legal resolutions that remain in the best interest of all parties involved. In 2014, Michelle was made a partner in the firm and the firm name was changed to Diana L. Skaggs + Partners, PLLC; and in 2016, Michelle was granted fellowship in the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, a national group of highly skilled family law attorneys.Spousal SupportCriminal LawAssaultSend to PhoneMapes, Michelle Eisenmenger623 W Main St, Louisville, KY 40202(502) 562-0050Send this business listing as a text message to a mobile phone.I agree to the Terms and ConditionsCancelSendYour text message was sent.To opt out at anytime, send the word STOP to YP411.To get a help message, send the word HELP to YP411.There was an error sending your text.Please try again.E-MailMapes, Michelle Eisenmenger623 W Main St, Louisville, KY 40202(502) 562-0050Send this business details to yourself or up to 5 friends.Up to 5 email addresses, separate addresses with a commaSend Yourself a CopyCancelSend

(more...)The payment made to a lawyer for legal services. These fees may take several forms: hourly per job or service -- for example, $350 to draft a will contingency (the lawyer collects a percentage of any money she wins for her client and nothing if there is no recovery), or retainer (usually a down payment as part of an hourly or per job fee agreement). Attorney fees must usually be paid by the client who hires a lawyer, though occasionally a law or contract will require the losing party of a lawsuit to pay the winner's court costs and attorney fees. For example, a contract might contain a provision that says the loser of any lawsuit between the parties to the contract will pay the winner's attorney fees. Many laws designed to protect consumers also provide for attorney fees -- for example, most state laws that require landlords to provide habitable housing also specify that a tenant who sues and wins using that law may collect attorney fees. And in family law cases -- divorce, custody and child support -- judges often have the power to order the more affluent spouse to pay the other spouse's attorney fees, even where there is no clear victor.

DIVORCEThe legal termination of marriage. All states require a spouse to identify a legal reason for requesting a divorce when that spouse files the divorce papers wit... (more...)The legal termination of marriage. All states require a spouse to identify a legal reason for requesting a divorce when that spouse files the divorce papers with the court. These reasons are referred to as grounds for a divorce.

(more...)An adult who has been given the legal right by a court to control and care for a minor or her property. Someone who looks after a child's property is called a 'guardian of the estate.' An adult who has legal authority to make personal decisions for the child, including responsibility for his physical, medical and educational needs, is called a 'guardian of the person.' Sometimes just one person will be named to take care of all these tasks. An individual appointed by a court to look after an incapacitated adult may also be known as a guardian, but is more frequently called a conservator.

(more...)A tradition that required one spouse to prove that the other spouse was legally at fault, to obtain a divorce. The 'innocent' spouse was then granted the divorce from the 'guilty' spouse. Today, 35 states still allow a spouse to allege fault in obtaining a divorce. The traditional fault grounds for divorce are adultery, cruelty, desertion, confinement in prison, physical incapacity and incurable insanity. These grounds are also generally referred to as marital misconduct.

(more...)A document that provides proof of a marriage, typically issued to the newlyweds a few weeks after they file for the certificate in a county office. Most states require both spouses, the person who officiated the marriage and one or two witnesses to sign the marriage certificate; often this is done just after the ceremony.

INTERLOCUTORY DECREEA court judgment that is not final until the judge decides other matters in the case or until enough time has passed to see if the interim decision is working. ... (more...)A court judgment that is not final until the judge decides other matters in the case or until enough time has passed to see if the interim decision is working. In the past, interlocutory decrees were most often used in divorces. The terms of the divorce were set out in an interlocutory decree, which would become final only after a waiting period. The purpose of the waiting period was to allow the couple time to reconcile. They rarely did, however, so most states no longer use interlocutory decrees of divorce.

(more...)A type of adoption used by agencies to keep a child out of foster care during the adoption process. The child is placed with the adopting parents before the birthmother has legally given up her rights to raise the child. If she then decides not to relinquish her rights, the adopting parents must give the child back. This is a risk for the adopting parents, who may lose a child to whom they've become attached.

(more...)Legal reasons for requesting a divorce. All states require a spouse who files for divorce to state the grounds, court and whether requesting a fault divorce or a no-fault divorce.

SAMPLE LEGAL CASES


Pennington v. Marcum... custody over sole custody. The Court of Appeals concluded that it was in the best
 interests of children for both their parents to be regularly involved in their lives. The
 court recognized the dynamic nature of family law and stated: ...
