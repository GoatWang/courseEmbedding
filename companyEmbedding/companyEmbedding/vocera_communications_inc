Healthcare Communication



    Seamless Communication for Improved Patient Outcomes and Care Team Satisfaction  
 

 Communication breakdowns in healthcare are a top contributing factor in medical errors and profoundly impact care team satisfaction. In addition, it is estimated that a typical 500-bed hospital loses over $4 million due to communication errors and U.S. hospitals lose over $12 billion - annually.1
1University of Maryland, 2010

Communication Challenges in Healthcare

Improve Provider and Staff Communication
Vocera technology improves care team communication and collaboration, connecting people
                  instantly by voice or secure text, without having to know phone numbers or even names.





 
 



Improve Patient Safety
Poor communication is the root cause of medical errors and adverse events. 
                  Vocera technology plays a vital role in reducing medical errors by connecting 
                  the right information to the right person, in the right place, at the right time, 
                  on the right device.







 
 



Improve Staff Safety
Workplace violence is an unfortunate but real issue for front-line healthcare workers. 
                  Vocera technology can connect staff members immediately to security personnel,
                  identifying who needs help and where they are.

“At Vocera we care about you. We have designed a comprehensive and competitive benefits program to support the health and wellness of all employees. From traditional benefits to the fun stuff, we cover it. Employees are eligible for benefits starting on the first day of full time employment. Programs available will vary based on country and location.”




 
 




Caring For You
As a company, we strive to create a culture where employees can thrive at work and at home. We have always been a family oriented company, and we want to create a caring and compassionate environment, where we support each other, and enable employees to spend valuable time with their families during times of need. Our time off policies give all employees the ability to take the time away from work to be there for their families at these critical moments. We offer Compassionate leave up to five days per year, Bereavement leave up to 20 days (amount varies based on situation), and up to twelve weeks of Paid Parental Leave (US Only) and generous leave policies in our international locations.



Comprehensive Health & Compensation plans
We provide a variety of programs to support your health and financial security. Some of these programs include: great health insurance including a FSA or HSA (which includes a company contribution), dental & vision coverage, 401(k) match program, employee assistance program, life and disability, equity & Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) and generous PTO and holiday schedule.



Employee & Family Fun
We love to take advantage of holidays and the opportunity to get together and enjoy some down time. Summer picnics, Halloween competitions (we are very serious about Halloween), cultural celebrations and holiday craft events for the Vocera kids are some of the events we look forward to all year! Events will vary around the globe, but everyone has fun!



Employee Referral Bonuses
Finding the right blend of talent and cultural fit to add to our teams is invaluable. Our employee referral program rewards employees who actively seek other talented people to join the Vocera team. We offer a generous referral bonus for successfully referring new employees.



Employee Discount Program
Our Passport Unlimited corporate discount program provides our employees access to a wide range of products, goods, and services at a discounted rate. There is but one goal: to make your life easier by saving you time and money. You'll find special offers on services, retail stores, restaurants, entertainment,  travel, and much more.



Volunteer Time Off
Giving back to our Communities is important to us. Our Volunteer Time Off program is designed to provide employees with paid time to participate in Vocera's community involvement and charity events that give back to our local communities.



Employee Community Involvement Council (ECIC)
Our ECIC is an employee-run community involvement team that works to promote employee unity and a sense of community in and out of the office. The ECIC was chartered to encourage employees to be positive forces in their communities around the globe. The mission of the ECIC is to give back to the communities that Vocera serves through financial support and the energy and passion of all its employees, who are located around the globe.



Employee Recognition
Bravo! As a way to recognize each other, Vocera encourages all employees to celebrate others through our recognition and reward program! The program provides the opportunity to acknowledge others who drive for results, demonstrate and uphold our company values, and go above and beyond every day. This social network communication platform shines a light on how important and impressive every employee across the company is to Vocera’s collective success. Through appreciation, recognition, and rewards, the BRAVO program allows all employees to reinforce the positive energy at Vocera. Oh and you get to buy cool stuff with your reward points.

eBook:5 Ways to Improve Care Efficiency with a Mobile Device StrategyHospital IT departments and clinical administrators are charged with getting the value from their clinical technology investments. At the same time, care providers are clamoring for a way to reduce the number of devices they carry such as pagers, smartphones, VOIP phones, and barcode scanners. 

Several health system leaders, such as Reading Health System, have identified five ways to leverage communication technology to improve care efficiency and boost the patient experience.Read MoreWhite Paper:Designing Communication Networks to Optimize Healthcare OutcomesRecent evolution in the healthcare industry has highlighted the need for clinical collaboration inside and outside the hospital, and across the continuum of care.  That's why more emphasis is being placed on effective care team communication and collaboration across sites to improve the overall healthcare experience for patients and staff, while moving the needle on readmission rates and other important outcome measurements. Read MoreThe Right Analytics Engine is the Gateway to Effective Alarm Management Last year, The Joint Commission made alarm management a top priority for all hospitals.  Its April 2013 Sentinel Event Alert noted that 98 alarm-related sentinel events were reported between January 2009 and June 2012.  Because that figure represents voluntarily reported numbers, the actual count may be even higher.

Advanced Search

                There are 3 types of search. Please only use one option at a time.
                
1) Build a boolean search string.
Ensure that document matches include...

...all of these word(s):



...and optionally include these word(s):



...but do not have these word(s):




2) Search for a phrase:

Enter your phrase:




3) Search on part of a word:

Enter the first few characters of a word:




Submit



Information on how to use Search

                    There are 2 types of basic queries: Terms and Phrases.
                    A Term is a single word search.
                    A Phrase would wrap a string of words in quotes and find matches on the extact string.
                

Boolean Operators
You can combine basic queries with Boolean operators to form a more complex query. Boolean operators define the relationships between Terms or Phrases. Our search supports the following Boolean operators: AND, "+", OR, NOT and "-". Please note that Boolean operators must be all uppercase.
                

AND
example search: default AND document
                    This is the default operator. It will be used if there is no Boolean operator between two terms. For example:
                    default document is the same as default AND document. In this case both terms need to exist within a listing to find a match on that listing.The + character is synonymous with using AND.
                

OR
example search: default OR document
                    In this case just one of the terms needs to exist within a listing to find a match on that listing.
                

NOT
example search: default NOT "document type"
                    The NOT operator excludes documents that contain the term (or phrase) after NOT. So a listing match would have to include the word default but not the phrase "document type". The - character is synonymous with using NOT.
                

Wildcard/Prefix queries
You can perform "wildcard" or "prefix" queries using the '*' operator. Whereas all of the previous search found exact matches on the whole term or phrase, a wildcard search will find partial matches.
                    example search: ehr*
                    This query will match all documents containing words beginning with the prefix 'ehr' like the word Ehrlichia.

Company Profile
                 |   March 9, 2001    













Vocera Communications, Inc.





	
	Vocera is hard at work to bring you the next step in instant, wireless communication. Our proprietary technology exploits the new Bluetooth™ standard for wireless communication. The Bluetooth standard is promoted by a consortium including, Ericsson, Intel, Nokia, Toshiba, and Microsoft.

Vocera Communications, Inc. was founded in March 2000 by a team with many years of experience in the design of complex, network-based software and hardware systems.

Robert Shostak, principal founder and acting CEO has been forming successful start-up companies in the Valley for more than fifteen years. His most recent is Portera Systems, of which he was principal founder and CTO. Portera is funded by IVP, Kleiner-Perkins, RRE Ventures, Hambrecht & Quist, Stanford University, and Oracle Corporation, among others. Portera is a supplier of web-hosted services and applications to the professional services industry. It now has nearly 200 employees. Dr. Shostak also co-founded Ansa Software, where he authored the Paradox database. Paradox has sold millions of copies, and is still sold today, fifteen years later, by Corel. Ansa merged with Borland International in 1989, where Shostak spent several years developing new database technology. Shostak previously conducted basic research in computer science at Stanford Research Institute, and holds BA, MA, and PhD degrees in computer science and applied mathematics from Harvard University.

Paul Barsley, founder and Chief Operating Officer, has more than 25 years of product development and operations experience. Prior to Vocera, Barsley held COO and Head of Engineering positions at IDEO Product Development. IDEO is a leading design and product development consultancy that provides expertise to both start-ups and Fortune 500 companies. Barsley was responsible for building IDEO into a multi-branch, international company from a group of 15 to over 300 professionals worldwide. Before IDEO, he held the position of interim VP of Engineering at Presentation Technologies, and earlier at Bytec-Comterm, developer of the Hyperion portable. Barsley's product development experience includes several years in the telephony industry. He holds a BSC degree in Electrical Engineering from Brighton University, UK.

Randy Nielsen, founder and Director of Software Engineering, has been involved in start-ups for over twenty years, and has managed both software and embedded hardware systems engineering. He has worked with Dr. Shostak on several efforts, including the development of Paradox at Ansa Software. More recently, Nielsen was a co-founder of Portera Systems, where he managed the engineering team and worked on hosted server applications. Prior to Portera he spent seven years at Borland International, where he managed groups of engineers. Mr. Nielsen holds a BA in Mathematics from the University of California at Berkeley.

Vocera Badge 


    Hands-Free, Wearable, Lightweight, and Voice-Controlled   


 Say goodbye to overhead paging and long call-and-wait cycles. Say hello to the Vocera Badge.
The Badge is much more than a communication device; it’s your small and mighty gateway to the leading platform for clinical communication and workflow.
That’s right: only the Vocera Platform lets you integrate with more than 120 clinical and operational systems to get the information you need – no more, no less – when and where you need it.
And only the Vocera Badge lets you do it all, hands-free.
If you want to talk to somebody, just tap your Badge and find them (intelligent call routing makes it easy), and have your conversation. Use your Badge hands-free to stay at a patient’s bedside while communicating. Hold it like a handset for more privacy.
