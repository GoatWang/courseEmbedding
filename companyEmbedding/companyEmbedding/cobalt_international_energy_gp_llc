Our business model allows us to move quickly and seamlessly through the exploration, appraisal, development and production processes.

Our History
	Cobalt’s pioneering approach to oil exploration was built on the unique idea that an agile company, armed with exceptional human talent, the best available seismic data, outstanding assets and a disciplined business model, can compete with the world’s largest energy companies. Through our experienced workforce, innovative technology and pioneering siting techniques, the company has built a carefully selected, world-class oil portfolio in the deepwater regions of the Gulf of Mexico and offshore West Africa.

Our Future
	As we transition from an oil exploration company to exploration and development, we continue our endeavor to be a successful, enduring enterprise that will generate wealth for our investors and provide an outstanding professional experience for our team members. Our track record of exploration excellence continues with twelve deepwater discoveries in the Gulf of Mexico and West Africa. These achievements, combined with a disciplined plan for future oil production, position the company exceptionally well for long-term value creation.

At Cobalt, we are discovering opportunity and producing value.

Our people combine the best data and technology with the expertise and collective insight necessary to locate the next best opportunities, and reduce cycle times at every phase of the exploration, appraisal, development and production process.

Recruiting Fraud

		We will never request an applicant to email information to an email address not ending in "@cobaltintl.com.”

		URLs that do not begin with “www.cobaltintl.com” are not official Cobalt International Energy websites and should not be used to submit any type of personal or recruiting-related information. 

		Cobalt International Energy will never require applicants to submit money to pay for travel, immigration or other fees or expenses.


	If you experience any of the above, or have doubts regarding the legitimacy of an email communication, website, or any other relevant issue relating to Cobalt International Energy, please email your concern or question to: recruiting@cobaltintl.com.

	Over the next several years, through focused exploration and appraisal, Cobalt will leverage its world-class deepwater portfolio to also become a company layered with project development and production, delivering greater value to its shareholders. Our demonstrated track record of exploration excellence, combined with a disciplined plan for future oil production, position the company exceptionally well for long-term value creation.



Assets


	Through our discriminating “first mover” approach, Cobalt has compiled an impressive and unique portfolio of assets in highly attractive oil prone basins, both in the United States and abroad. Cobalt operates the majority of these assets, thereby influencing the pace of operations and enhancing value creation. We acquire the industry’s best subsurface and seismic data to identify deepwater oil reservoirs trapped in subsalt and pre-salt layers in the deepwaters of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and West Africa.



Gulf of Mexico
	The Gulf of Mexico’s deepwater oil basin, one of the most prolific in the world, has been a focus for major oil exploration companies for more than three decades. Increasingly, focus has shifted to the technically challenging, but highly promising, deepwater subsalt regions. The primary technical challenge in these regions is to seismically resolve potential structures below thick layers of salt. Consequently, Cobalt has spent over $400 million since our inception to acquire and process the highest quality seismic data and technology. The investment in seismic data and its utilization by our experienced workforce have been essential elements in Cobalt’s success in identifying prospects, acquiring the leases and successfully drilling discoveries in the Gulf of Mexico.

	As a major player in the Gulf of Mexico, Cobalt holds lease interests in over 150 deepwater blocks in the Inboard Lower Tertiary and Miocene plays. We operate approximately 90 percent of our Gulf of Mexico leases, providing Cobalt the ability to influence pace between oil exploration and oil production and realize significant value.

West Africa
	Through the development of an early geologic regional model, Cobalt had the foresight to acquire several high-potential licenses off the coast of Angola and Gabon, pioneering West Africa’s pre-salt play.

	To date, Cobalt has drilled nine exploratory wells, three appraisal wells and four development wells (one of which was drilled to be used as a pressure-maintenance well in the Cameia development) in the northern pre-salt Kwanza Basin offshore Angola, and one exploratory well in the pre-salt deepwater region offshore Gabon. Fifteen of these wells have been successful in finding pre-salt hydrocarbons. This is a remarkable and a highly unusual start in establishing a position in such an immense new regional play.

	Off the coast of Angola, Cobalt holds a 40 percent working interest in, and is the operator of, two blocks— 20 and 21—covering a combined 2.4 million acres. Our Cameia #1 discovery on Block 21 confirmed the presence of an expansive pre-salt hydrocarbon reservoir, proving our geologic model and de-risking the new pre-salt play in the deepwater offshore Angola. The Cameia #2 and #3 appraisal wells provided the validating evidence that allowed us to accelerate work toward the sanctioning of an early production system. We then drilled the Cameia #3, #4 and #5 as successful development wells, followed by completion of drilling operations on the Cameia #1A well, each of which is planned to be used as part of the Cameia Development. Our Mavinga #1 pre-salt discovery on Block 21 mirrored our Cameia pre-salt discovery from the perspective of fluid and reservoir quality. Our Lontra #1 pre-salt discovery on Block 20 confirmed an oil and gas accumulation with better than expected reservoir quality. Our Bicuar #1A discovery in Block 21 was our first discovery where mobile hydrocarbons were found in the deeper pre-salt syn-rift reservoir. Our Orca #1 well on Block 20 resulted in the company’s fifth consecutive pre-salt discovery in Angola’s Kwanza Basin and our Orca #2 appraisal well confirmed the presence of a large oil accumulation in the Sag section of the pre-salt, and also confirmed the discovery of oil in the deeper syn-rift pre-salt reservoir. Orca is the largest oil discovery found to date in the Kwanza Basin and has an estimated resource potential of between 400 – 700 MMBO. Also in Block 20, our Zalophus and Golfinho exploratory wells resulted in additional discoveries.

	In August 2015, we executed a purchase and sale agreement with Sociedade Nacional de Combustíveis de Angola—Empresa Pública (“Sonangol”) for the sale of our working interests in Blocks 20 and 21 offshore Angola. However, because the sale to Sonangol did not close within one year of execution of the purchase and sale agreement, the sale was terminated in August 2016. Cobalt is seeking extensions to the Block 20 and 21 license agreements pursuant to the terms of the purchase and sale agreement, and is continuing to market its interest in these blocks to interested third parties.

	In Gabon, we have a 21.25 percent interest in the 2.2 million acre Diaba license operated by Total Gabon. Results of our Diaman #1 discovery well successfully confirmed the existence of a working petroleum system. This was the first test of the pre-salt in deepwater Gabon.

Oil Exploration


	Cobalt’s investment in seismic data, technology and talented and experienced professionals has significantly enhanced our ability to quickly identify the geological and geophysical characteristics of the subsalt and pre-salt formations. This has directly led to our early access of leading positions in both the Gulf of Mexico and West Africa.



	Cobalt’s approach to exploration begins with an in-depth regional understanding of the Petroleum Systems of oil prone basins. This requires an integrated approach, utilizing the latest technology by highly experienced explorationists with an impressive track-record of world-class discoveries. This approach led to our leading positions in the subsalt play in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and the pre-salt play in offshore West Africa.

	Following the integrated regional analysis, prospects are identified and further refined through a constant effort of high-grading and ranking of opportunities. This disciplined approach provides an updated re-evaluation of the portfolio based upon the latest data and geologic thinking. Instrumental to all these evaluations is a constant focus on the relative commercial attractiveness of each of the basins and prospects. Cobalt has specifically chosen our focus areas and drilling candidates in order to optimize Cobalt’s value.

	 

Gulf of Mexico

Heidelberg
	The Heidelberg discovery, in which Cobalt owns a 9.375 percent working interest, was drilled in approximately 5,000 feet of water. The discovery well was drilled to a total depth of 30,000 feet and encountered more than 200 feet of high-quality, Miocene reservoir sands. Appraisal drilling at Heidelberg has confirmed commerciality of this field, given the excellent quality, continuous and pressure-connected reservoirs with high-quality oil. The Heidelberg field commenced production in January 2016, representing Cobalt’s first production and revenue.

North Platte
	Cobalt’s first operated Inboard Lower Tertiary discovery is North Platte, located in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Cobalt owns a 60 percent working interest, and pre-drill gross unrisked resources have been calculated to be 400 - 850 MMBOE (mean – upside range), per independent assessment by DeGolyer and MacNaughton (February 2011). At a well depth of 34,500 feet, North Platte’s discovery well is one of the deepest in the region, and encountered over 550 net feet of oil pay in multiple high quality Inboard Lower Tertiary reservoirs. This well’s results exceeded pre-drill expectations, confirming Cobalt’s geologic model for the Inboard Lower Tertiary trend. In late 2015, we completed drilling the initial North Platte appraisal well as a successful well. This appraisal well encountered over 550 feet of net oil pay, which is similar to the discovery well, but with evidence of better developed reservoirs. We then completed additional sidetrack appraisal drilling operations at North Platte, which were successful and encountered approximately 500 feet of net oil pay in what appears to be excellent reservoir quality rock. In 2016, we drilled an additional appraisal well, which encountered approximately 650 feet of net oil pay and results indicate high quality Inboard Lower Tertiary Wilcox reservoirs on the eastern flank of the field. We then sidetracked this appraisal well to further analyze the extent of the eastern flank of the field. As of March 2017, we plan to commence a final sidetrack with the intention of gathering conventional cores which we expect to be completed during the second quarter of 2017.

Anchor
	The Anchor discovery, in which Cobalt owns a 20 percent working interest, was drilled in 5,183 feet of water. The Anchor #2 exploratory well, located in Green Canyon Block 807 and approximately 140 miles off the Louisiana coast, was drilled to a total depth of 33,749 feet and encountered significant high quality pay in multiple Inboard Lower Tertiary Wilcox reservoirs. At the time it was drilled, Cobalt considered the Anchor discovery to be one of Cobalt’s best wells drilled in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Anchor represents Cobalt’s fourth significant discovery in the Gulf of Mexico. The results of the discovery well further confirmed Cobalt’s Inboard Lower Tertiary model. An appraisal sidetrack well was drilled down dip to delineate the Anchor discovery well. The appraisal well encountered 694 feet of net oil pay in a hydrocarbon column of at least 1,800 feet in Inboard Lower Tertiary reservoirs. The Anchor #3 and #4 appraisal wells were successful, as well. Anchor #4, which was spud in late 2016, resulted in approximately 800 feet of net oil pay.

Shenandoah
	The Shenandoah discovery, in which Cobalt owns a 20 percent working interest, is an Inboard Lower Tertiary discovery drilled in approximately 5,750 feet of water. The discovery well was drilled to a total depth of 30,000 feet and encountered approximately 300 feet of unusually high-quality Inboard Lower Tertiary reservoir sands. The Shenandoah #2R appraisal well encountered more than 1,000 net feet of oil pay in multiple high quality Inboard Lower Tertiary-aged reservoirs. Log and pressure data from both the Shenandoah appraisal well and the Shenandoah discovery well indicate the presence of exceptionally high quality reservoirs and hydrocarbons. Our Shenandoah #3 appraisal well found an expanded geologic reservoir section and confirmed excellent reservoir qualities. The Shenandoah #4 appraisal well tested the updip extent of the basin. The subsequent Shenandoah #4 sidetrack encountered over 600 feet of net oil pay, extending the lowest known oil column downdip. The Shenandoah #5 appraisal well encountered approximately 1,000 feet of net pay in multiple high quality Inboard Lower Tertiary sands. The Shenandoah #6 appraisal well encountered wet Wilcox reservoirs and, as of March 2017 is being sidetracked to locate the oil-water contacts.

Angola

Cameia
	Off the coast of Angola, Cobalt has been the front-runner in the exploration of the pre-salt Kwanza Basin. In Angola Block 21, Cobalt drilled the Cameia #1 pre-salt exploratory well as a successful discovery well.

	Results of a production test performed in the Cameia #1 well provided evidence that the well has the potential to produce in excess of 20,000 barrels of hydrocarbons per day, exceeding Cobalt’s pre-drill estimates. The well was drilled in 1,680 meters (5,512 feet) of water to a depth of over 4,880 meters (16,010 feet), and encountered a continuous oil column of nearly 360 meters (1,181 feet) with over 75 percent net-to-gross pay estimate. No oil/gas or oil/water contacts were observed.

	The Cameia #2 appraisal well confirmed the presence of a large hydrocarbon accumulation in a high quality reservoir and discovered a new hydrocarbon-bearing zone at least 134 meters (440 feet) deeper than that which was observed in the Cameia #1 exploratory well. The Cameia #3 appraisal well reconfirmed the estimated field resource range of 300-500 million barrels of hydrocarbons. This well was followed by the successful drilling of the Cameia #4 and #5 development wells, and additional drilling on the Cameia #1A well.

Mavinga
	Following the Cameia pre-salt discovery, Cobalt drilled the Mavinga #1 pre-salt exploratory well as a successful oil discovery well on Block 21. The Cobalt operated Mavinga #1 well, located approximately 8 miles (12.5 kilometers) northwest of Cobalt’s Cameia discovery, reached a total depth of 17,431 feet (5,313 meters) and encountered approximately 100 feet (30 meters) of net oil pay. This discovery was confirmed by the successful production of oil from mini drill stem tests, direct pressure and permeability measurements, and log and core analyses.

	Cobalt estimates a gross oil column of up to 650 feet (200 meters) at the crest of the Mavinga structure updip of the Mavinga #1 well location. Additional drilling will be required to confirm the ultimate gross thickness of the mound and its reservoir quality.

Bicuar
	Cobalt’s Bicuar exploratory well on Block 21 was drilled to a measured depth of 5,739 meters (18,829 feet) in a water depth of approximately 1,500 meters (4,900 feet) and found 56 meters (180 feet) of oil and condensate in multiple pre-salt intervals. Results of an extensive logging, coring and fluid acquisition program confirmed the existence of both oil and condensate in multiple intervals. No free gas zones or water contacts were observed. Importantly, Bicuar was Cobalt’s first discovery where mobile hydrocarbons were found in the deeper pre-salt syn-rift reservoir, which supports the analog to Brazil’s pre-salt basin and potential upside across other Cobalt Kwanza Basin prospects.

	Bicuar was a significant success, not only geologically, but also operationally. Originally estimated to take 130 – 150 days to drill this well, Cobalt was successful in safely drilling this well in only 59 days dramatically reducing the total cost of this well. This performance was achieved through improved drill bit performance, applying learnings from previously drilled wells, and experiencing less rig downtime than expected. While applying these efficiencies, Cobalt rigorously maintained its unwavering commitment to safety and environmental protection.

Lontra
	On Block 20, the Lontra #1 exploratory well was drilled to a total depth of 4,195 meters (13,763 feet) and penetrated approximately 75 meters (250 feet) of net pay in a very high quality reservoir section. The discovery well encountered both a high liquids content gas interval and an oil interval. A drill stem test was conducted in the high liquids content gas interval and successfully produced a sustained flow rate of 2,500 barrels per day of condensate and 39 million cubic feet per day of gas.

Orca
	Cobalt’s Orca #1 deepwater pre-salt exploratory well on Block 20 was Cobalt’s fifth consecutive exploration discovery and sixth consecutive successful well in the deepwater pre-salt Kwanza Basin offshore Angola. The well found 75 meters (250 feet) of net oil pay in multiple pre-salt intervals.

Zalophus
	In 2016, Cobalt drilled the Zalophus deepwater pre-salt exploratory well on Block 20. Zalophus resulted in a significant discovery of condensate and gas and represented Cobalt’s sixth pre-salt discovery offshore Angola and its third discovery on Block 20.

Golfinho
	Cobalt followed the Zalophus success by drilling the Block 20 Golfinho #1 well as Cobalt’s seventh successful pre-salt exploratory well in the Kwanza Basin offshore Angola.

Diaba
	The Total Gabon operated Diaman #1B well, drilled on the Diaba block, offshore Gabon, was the first test of the pre-salt in deepwater Gabon. The well reached its total depth of 5,585 meters (18,323 feet), and encountered approximately 50-55 meters (160-180 feet) of net hydrocarbons in the objective pre-salt formations. The Diaman #1B well successfully confirmed the existence of a working petroleum system, a salt seal, and high-quality sandstone reservoirs.



Oil Development & Production


	We continue the evolution of our business model, transitioning from solely an oil exploration company to exploration, appraisal and development.



	Maintaining a stewardship position in regards to Health, Safety, Security and Environment (HSSE), Cobalt’s team has defined and engineered a standardized and repeatable procedure for sub-sea development. We also leverage third-parties to deliver creative, effective, and timely solutions focused on value creation, cycle-time reduction and cash flow. Through subcontracting and leasing of facilities, staffing requirements are minimized, capital outlays are reduced and energies are focused on resource discovery, development, flow assurance and optimal recovery.

	The Heidelberg field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico was sanctioned in May, 2013, and first oil was achieved in January 2016, significantly ahead of schedule and favorable to budget. As of March 2017, we have five producing wells at Heidelberg.

Our story




Gu-ru / ‘goroō /
Noun:
1. A mentor, a teacher, one who helps you move forward.
2. A source of inspiration and good energy.


GURU
A Story of Organic Growth
Ever since the early days, GURU has always been driven by this idea of crafting the best natural energy drink out there. Founded in Montreal during the summer of 1999 by four college friends, the company marketed the world's first all-natural energy drink.
More than 15 years later, this vision is not only fulfilled but is also thriving and expanding worldwide. GURU has become the #1 Organic Energy Drink in Canada and the US in the Health Channel thanks to a strong network of distribution partnerships and a passionate sales team. 
With research & development at the forefront of our expansion, GURU now tackles a new market and adventure with the recent introduction of our Energy Waters. This new line of product arrives just in time to satisfy a growing demand for organic sugar and calorie-free energy beverages.
In short, GURU has and will always believe that energy should not come at the expense of health. That is what has brought our company a steady and organic growth.
Our Philosophy
Through its corporate philosophy and its beverages, GURU gives good energy for people to make great things, reminding that, with the right dose of will, inspiration and energy, achieving great results is within everyone's reach. 
People today define themselves less by what they have and more by what they do and contribute to the world. Resourcefulness, imagination, inventiveness is today’s new currency. Whether using technology, natural ingredients or just plain common sense, people who Make it Good are the ones who seek to make everything better. We call them Makers.
They are pioneers that never settle. Makers, not followers. Crafters not manufacturers. Some may call them obsessed, exceptional or extraordinary people. But these are men and women who are true innovators, thought leaders and doers in their respective communities. They make the impossible possible.

has a slight citrus taste, gave me the boost i needed without the crash.  much rather drink this than red bull, rockstar or monster as this is organic!  found my new favorite energy drink pre-workout or just when i'm dragging on certain days.  also it doesn't have a ton of calories, big plus!

I don't usually drink energy drinks, but this one is an exception to the rule. It's organic, low calorie, non-GMO and contains ingredients that I can actually trust.  I did not experience a crash afterwards. I read that this has to do with the fact that they use naturally-occurring caffeine from Green Tea and Guarana. I don't know why you would drink any other energy drink than this. Definitely loading up on these again soon! Great price not expensive at all!

Definitely better tasting than something like Red Bull---and just as importantly, better smelling.  I can't be the only person who gags at the smell of Red Bull....  In contrast, this stuff is much more palatable, less artificially sweet, and doesn't leave that horrendous aftertaste coating your tongue.    It's harder to find than Red Bull, so when you see it, stock up.

Having only tried this once in my life, i was shocked at how well it tasted! It didn't feel super heavy with sugars and carbs like alot of energy drinks can feel like after consuming. I let my coworker try some, he said he really enjoyed how well it tasted. I would probably purchase in the future.

I don't drink energy drinks often, mostly because they don't typically taste great and I drink coffee already. However, I was impressed with Guru. I couldn't put my finger on the flavor at first, but reading the ingredients it was the green tea that leaves a mild aftertaste, kind of like matcha. The nose is citrusy and refreshing. That said, although I stayed perky after drinking it; I would say it's safe for people who only drink caffeine moderately to drink it too, and if you're dead tired it might not make much of a difference. It only has caffeine from the tea, so not at all the "crack" type of artificial energy drink like a Monster or Red Bull, which I think taste gross and are horrible for you!

I was extremely pleased with the taste of this drink. There was no bitterness unlike other artificially sweet drinks. The plus point of this drink is that its organic, low calorie and contains ingredients that are not harmful to the body. The caffeine in this drink is derived from natural sources like green tea. So I can have as many drinks I desire without feeling guilty. I tried the Lite version of the drink. The only negative point for this product is the price. Costing around $2 per can is quite expensive!

When it comes to energy drinks, I always prefer to have a more natural drink. With the chemicals and fake flavor of many competitors, this is definitely a healthy alternative to give you that boost you need in your day.  This drink did not give my an amped up feeling or jitters, which I always appreciate. It honestly is a drink I would purchase again. I hope this can pops up on more stores' shelves.

This was actually the first energy drink I ever tried! I was a little skeptical at first but I thought it was delicious! It was a lovely soda, lots of carbonation, no aftertaste (kind of like a citrus apple cider with tea) but there was a little too much sugar. I pay attention to carb intake as I am Type 1 Diabetic and there was quite a bit of sugar...too much for my taste. I don't even think it needed it but it was still yummy!

I'm not big on mainstream energy drinks, so I'm happy that there's a more natural organic variation. I probably won't drink a ton of them, but I would probably try to convert people from drinking big brand energy drinks to drinking GURU. I was happy to find the product provided being sold at Sprouts.

I really enjoyed drinking this energy drink, i love how it has only 10 calories! Everyone should try this organic, vegan and non-gmo drink. Why isn't this the new thing ? Gatorade should not be the energy drink people chose.  I loved how it boosted me up when I'm trying to get things done without having to worry about the down fall.

I was a bit hesitant to try an energy drink as I'd heard some of them make people jittery or make their heart race as side effects. But I decided to give this one a try. I drank this on a day of work that I knew would be busy, and it definitely made a difference. I felt very energetic, and I luckily didn't get any bad side effects. It tasted very good too. Would definitely recommend!

I was pleasantly surprised with the overall energy factor of this drink. It tastes much like that of Redbull, but without the tendency of giving you a throbbing headache. I was quite thrilled with the amount of energy I obtained from a single 8.4 fl oz serving. It does taste much like most traditional energy drinks, a bit canny and tin-like but the energy you get is well worth the metallic taste. I can actually see myself purchasing this on a regular basis. 5/5 stars for sure!

As someone who is always on the run, I like having a large variety of different energy drinks to fuel my day as a substitute for coffee. I tried the GURU organic energy drink out and liked that it didn't taste like the typical energy beverage with the taurine flavor that is so prevalent. Generally if you're putting caffeine into your body, you'd like it to be as unadulterated as possible. I like that the ingredients used in the drink are organic, gluten-free, and NON=GMO verified.

I'm not much an engery drinks kind of person but when I do need a lift of engery I like to drink something that is not super high in sugar or have a list of ingredients I can barely pronounce. Guru engery drinks did the job for when I needed an extra boost. As far as taste go I find it similar to the other drinks I had before. If one is in need of an extra boost of energy and prefer something that is organic Guru is the way to.

The first thing I did when I bought this product was read the ingredients. To my surprise I could read all the ingredients and there was no caffeine. I wake up at 5 o'clock in the morning everyday for work. I'm usually a little tired. About two hours into the workday, this particular work day,  the first thing I did was drink the guru light. I did not feel tired all day and did not feel overly energized.  Plainly said, I felt normal and this was good for me.  That means the drink did what it was supposed to do.  I don't think I'D  drink it everyday but I will definitely keep a few spares around for days when I play hockey until midnight and have to work at 5 in the morning or days where I'm working all day and I need that extra push to get me through. #trynatural

My husband has been gluten-free for almost two years and while I do blend my own gluten-free flour at times, sometimes I'm just pressed for time and looking for an off-the-shelf GF flour that acts like regular flour.

I will definitely buy this brand again when I need GF flour in a hurry!

I usually don't use energy drinks because of the flavor but I tried the Guru Organic energy drink and thought it was a step above the usual Red Bull or Monster drinks.  Upon reading the list of ingredients, I was pleased to see that they were all natural.  I was surprised to see echinacea listed as an ingredient, which I felt was a nice alternative to unpleasant tasting vitamin supplements.  My store did not carry the sugar free variety, so I had to settle for the 30 grams of sugar that came with the regular version.  It was very sweet, but the actual taste was good and I liked the level of carbonation.  I didn't get the jitters nor did I have the "crash and burn" that I would have expected with this type of drink.  I did not drink it all at once, but rather had it throughout the second half of the day, which is usually when I start feeling tired.  If I can find the sugar free version, I will definitely try it.  I do have to limit my caffeine intake, but for those occasions when I absolutely must have an extra boost, a cold sparkly Guru sounds like a great alternative to an iced coffee or tea.

I would very much recommend Guru Organic Energy Drink because it offers a Quality product without all the other unnecessary Chemicals found in other Name Brand Energy Drinks!!! So Thank you Guru!!!

Guru Organic Energy Drink was very delicious and has natural Caffeine and since trying it, I have become a repeat customer and I also tell my co-workers If they want a 'Natural Energy Drink' with just the right amount of Caffeine that GURU doesn't give you the jitters, and it is Vegan of course and I totally recommend Guru, so please give it a try and I'm sure you'll also become a fan! I really Enjoy the Fruity Taste, and my co-workers see that I'm drinking GURU, and they start asking me about it. Haha, now my friends are also purchasing GURU, and I'm glad to say that they learned about it from me which makes me Happy!

I don't usually drink energy drinks because of all the artificial ingredients but I liked Guru because it's organic, low calorie, non-GMO and contains healthy  ingredients like Guarana and Green Tea. There was no initial energy jolt and no hard crash, did not experience any brain fog either.  A little bit too sweet for me but my son liked it, he usually drinks Monster Zero.

I don't drink energy drinks often. I've tried some other brands of regular energy drinks, but this drink tasted the best out of all of the ones i've tried. Not only is it healthier for you because it is organic,  but the taste is very light and refreshing whereas regular energy drinks taste heavy. The combination so ingredients makes this drink taste very delicious. This drink is definitely effective in terms of sustaining energy. I highly recommend this drink.

Guru Energy Drink is one of a kind. This drink smells great. The taste is a little on the bitter side. This is my personal opinion. It does have echinacea flower extract, in which I do like. I feel an organic energy and no jitters at all. I like this drink. It is an acquired taste though.

I bought the Original version -  because I had read reviews on Amazon saying that it was better-flavored.  It had a nice fruity-citrusy taste, and wasn't overly sweet.  Since I usually buy low or no-calorie energy drinks I am used to a different flavor profile.  I got a nice "kick" from this drink, and it helped keep me stay alert during a long-distance drive.  I also appreciate the organic ingredients, since a lot of energy drinks are full of all sorts of "junk".  Will definitely buy this again!

I opted for the original as opposed to the lite. I've had several other brands of energy drinks in the past, and Guru definitely has a cleaner slightly refreshing taste. I like that guru is made with organic cane sugar, which surprised me as other drinks I've had can leave a artificial taste. The drink also contains sparkling water, organic white grape juice, and organic green tea leaf extract which is a great naturally occurring caffeine. Guru organic energy drink definitely holds its own when it comes to energy drinks and I would definitely purchase again.

I easily found this at the store. I opted for the original. When I got home I immediately put it in my chiller so that I could try it right away. I didn't even read the can. I opened it and was pleasantly surprised that it was carbonated. The taste was not overly sweet... it was JUST right. I am not a fan of things that are TOO sweet.  The flavor was slightly fruity, like a mild version of a candy, again, not too sweet.  After about 10 minutes I started feeling more awake and alert. I love that it didn't get me pumped or jittery. It gave me the perfect amount of energy for it to feel natural. I would absolutely​ purchase this again. I never liked energy drinks, but GURU changed my mind.

I got the Lite version & kind of wish I got original instead. On the positive side: it certainly did not have the artificial sugary or metallic lingering taste like red bull or rock star or monster did. It also did keep me energized so thats a plus. 
However, this version had a light soda taste that was kind of fruity (which I am personally not fond of).

I am not a fan of RedBull or coffee, but i like caffeine in other forms, so i decided to try Guru. I was pleasantly surprised, because it has wonderful taste. It is not as overwhelming as RedBull, it is more natural, fruity and refreshing. And the energy in it brought some muracles - on lazy and rainy Sunday afternoon, i did not have much hope to achieve anything, but... with Guru, i completed tasks and chores i was procrastinating about for weeks. The only thing to be aware of: if you live in Bay Area, this drink will cost you hefty tax. I was surprised it has the tax penalty for soft sugary drinks!

I personally am a connoisseur of energy drinks. I rely on caffeine for most of my projects at school and for late night coding sessions as well as marathon gaming. Although energy drinks can be considered a crutch, it's a lifestyle decision that many, many people embrace rather than attempt to avoid... I am one of these people.

That said, Guru Energy is fairly cheap ($1.25USD/can) if you buy it here off Amazon, it comes in the Redbull standard 8.3 fl/oz cans, and is shipped in a surprisingly lightweight and compact case (compare this to Monster, Rockstar, or any other brand with standard 16 fl/oz cans).

The taste, like Guru's website describes, is very indescribable. It is very sharp and light with a medium amount of carbonation. The caffeine buzz is more "natural"... it has more of an upslope and downslope rather than a sudden cracked out (which is arguably awesome too in its own respect) then big crash sort of feeling. This is because the caffeine in Guru is derived from 125mg of Guaranine (Guarana Herb) rather than synthetically separated then added. There is no mention about how much of the 125mg of Guaranine is real caffeine, but since Red Bull checks in at 80mg / 8.3oz it seems that Guru is in pretty good shape.

I think a particular good feature of Guru is that it uses cane sugar rather than high fructose corn syrup. I appreciate a good quality soda, particularly microbrew colas, and they often exclusively contain cane sugar.

So in summary, this energy drink is fairly cheap, good buzz, all natural, and great for coding, gaming, or studying.

The biggest question is DOES IT WORK?? 
The answer to your question is, YES! I was busy all day long and had the best energy I've had in awhile. It feels a lot better than using Redbull.. I'm very sensitive to caffeine so drinking it gives me a lot of energy I have no question about that. But this energy felt like I've slept the whole night without waking up and best bed ever. So pretty much I felt really good!! 
The taste isn't the best but it not a lot you drink so if you hate it a lot then just chug it. It's a little herbaly but not bad. Just different.

Coming from someone who at one point drank a decent amount of Monster Energy drinks, I can say that the GURU Organic Energy drink definitely makes me feel better after consumption.

I don't consume energy drinks often anymore, but I'd grab one of these if they are available the next time I want one.

I really enjoyed the Organic Energy Drink by Guru. It was reminiscent of a Slurpee with a slight aftertaste of cough syrup. But the cough syrup taste was not overwhelming.

I definitely recommend this and will be buying more.

After popping open the can, I had whiffs of the Red Bull scent. So I was quite surprised after tasting it. Not only did it not taste like Red Bull, it had a fruity flavor, which is a plus! I liked how it was carbonated and that all the ingredients were organic and natural. I tried the regular flavor which was a bit too sweet for me so the Lite may have been a better choice; nonetheless, the original was still pretty good. I do not know if I would recommend it since the sugar (30g) is quite high for one serving, but over other energy drinks, I would. It is probably the best tasting energy drink I have tried so far.

For how small the drink is, it did the trick. I had lots of for the next four hours and didn't feel a crash afterwards. I never buy organic energy drinks, but now I believe that there is a huge difference for me to go organic. I love the taste and how I felt clean by not drinking so much chemicals.

Excellent taste and a good source of energy. If you don't care much about sugar content then don't get the lite because the normal one is pretty good too! The can packs a decent punch and the organic components of the product make me feel like I'm not wiring myself up on some synthetic creation that tastes like plastic. The product isn't priced the most competitively but maybe that is because I purchased it at bristol farms, I wouldn't be surprised if whole foods had it for a bit less. I enjoyed my Guru chilled but I totally see how it could be fine on the go at room temperature. Overall I'm happy with my guru experience.

This was the best energy drink I have ever tasted!! it was way better than the other unhealtht energy drinks like redbull and monster. I saved it at my desk and used it when I most needed energy. My coworker asked me what it was and i told him it was a free product I recieved to provide a review for social nature. I recommended it on the spot to my coworker and he bought one at Safeway.

I drink energy drinks often. I drink coffee daily.  With that being said,  guru is pretty good.  I didn't get the jitters like i usually do when trying a new drink for the first time,  so that was a definite plus.  It provided a nice energy boost.  The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the taste. I made the mistake of getting the Lite, so it's my fault but it taste 2 just like anything else that's considered "light", like it's missing an ingredient or mage with fake sugar.  Overall I was satisfied.

Ive never been a big fan of any energy drink so I didn't have high hopes for this product, but to my surprise, it has a great taste and it really gave me the boost that I needed. I had it in the morning before I left for school and by the late evening, I was still pumped. Im not sure if it's the drink, but I was in a good mood that day.

I don't usually buy traditional energy drinks because I prefer clean ingredients. This Guru energy drink is very clean (it's organic, too!), and has very low calories. I actually liked the taste a lot better than I thought I would but you can definitely taste the stevia. It's a little bitter but the lemon juice and added sugar help to balance that out. I did not notice a huge lift in energy but it did perk me up at work. I'd probably purchase this in the future to drink after lunch/early afternoon at work.

I really enjoyed the sustained, healthy energy this drink provided. Other energy drinks contain scary amounts of caffeine and vitamin B (like it could give you irregular heart rhythms scary) which causes an energy crash, This one takes a more natural approach. The result is a productive pep that does not make you feel (or seem) like you're on crack and it doesn't cause a sudden drop in energy either. The energizing ingredients are green tea extract, guarana seed, and ginseng. There is also echinacea which is great for the immune system. At first I found the stevia to be overwhelming, but the berry flavor presumably from the luo han guo fruit kept me sipping. I have a suspicion I would like the non-lite version a bit more, but this drink is great for those who are used to the powerful sweetness of stevia.

This seems to be a rarity of an energy drink that does not have awful additives in it!  It has no color and has a light, refreshing texture and slightly sweet taste, without being too much.  It has natural, organic ingredients that provide energy rather than artificial ones and no sugar alcohols (erythritol etc) which usually cause me problems.  I therefore felt a nice, natural energy boost without any discomfort.  Loved it!

While I occasionally consume energy drinks, I often worry about the ingredients in conventional varieties which are often made up of chemicals that I can hardly pronounce and rarely recognize. I wonder about the safety and potential effects on my health from those products, and I'm also not particularly fond of the often strongly artificial taste. As such. I was really interested in learning about and trying out Guru Organic Energy, which is made up of organic ingredients and naturally occurring caffeine. Given that I avoid calories in drinks, I chose the Lite version to try, and I was pleasantly surprised. The flavor was different, and although I wouldn't say it was delicious, it was refreshing and not as aversive as other energy drinks I've tried. I didn't feel a huge kick of energy, but caffeine rarely has a tremendous effect on me and I did feel alert if not energetic. Overall, I think the Guru Organic Energy Drink is a preferable choice for those looking for energy beverages over the typical energy drink laden with artificial ingredients. Although I'm not a regular connoisseur of energy drinks, the next time I want one I will choose Guru Organic. #trynatural

Surprisingly good!  I wasn't expecting this drink to be (lightly) carbonated....it was a nice surprise!  Flavor was good and it definitely gave noticeable energy.

GURU Lite is very tasty and refreshing, especially on a hot day. Unlike most Stevia sweetened drinks, the taste is well balanced with no bitter aftertaste. There's a nice lemony flavor and the carbonation is on-point.

I don't usually drink energy drinks, but this one is an exception to the rule. It's organic, low calorie, non-GMO and contains ingredients that I can actually trust. Another big bonus I noticed is that I did not experience a crash afterwards. I read that this has to do with the fact that they use naturally-occurring caffeine from Green Tea and Guarana. I don't know why you would drink any other energy drink than this. Definitely loading up on these again soon!

This product is packed with good, natural ingredients, unlike most energy drinks out there, and still packs the same amount of caffeine! The flavor of this drink is somewhat like a gummy bear, although just slightly watered down from the flavors of other energy drinks, which I didn't mind. I have tried other natural energy drinks in the past which did not agree with me, however I did not have the same issues with this drink. I really enjoyed it. If there is one thing i could say about it, is there wasn't any selection at the store I went to. They had one flavor of the drink, in one size. The drink was also about a dollar more than comparable energy drinks. I would be most likely to buy this product if they offered a multi-pack with a small discount.

Not a jittery jolt but just enough to get me out of my slump. I was also happy to know I wasn't filling my body with harmful stuff to achieve that boost. I would recommend this product to friends, family, and co workers.

Really good tasting product! The thing that stood out to me was that it tasted somewhat like redbull, but with a more pleasing aftertaste. It reminded me of cane sugar soda, but much healthier. There are 30g of natural sugar, which is better than most sodas, and there are few ingredients, all of them organic. My only issue was the manufacturer's coupon, which confused the cashier, and in the end, I had to pay sales tax. Other than that, I really enjoyed this experience.

To be honest, I've never been a fan of energy drinks. I usually choose to go with the shots like the 5-hours just because I chug it and it's done. The Guru Energy drink actually has a natural taste though compared to the other energy drinks on the market which is good. The only issue I have with this is availability, This drink is not available a lot of places, which makes it hard to purchase when you do want to indulge. All in all, this is a MUCH better choice for energy drinks, the taste is pleasant and it gave me a nice jolt with absolutely no crash. I would recommend trying this for sure if you could find it!

Refreshing taste, clean and crisp. Gave me a subtle boost of energy without a crazy rush or a harsh crash. Good stuff! I found it at Sprouts Grocery.

I bought the lite version because I try to stay away from high sugar beverages. I like that the lite only has 3g of sugar and is sweetened with stevia. I enjoyed the taste of the energy drink; it has a light and refreshing cherry flavor. I definitely noticed an increase in energy and alertness after about 15 minutes. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it's still a little to sweet for me. I would buy it if I needed a quick boost of energy over other brands of energy drinks but I probably would not buy this on a regular basis since I currently purchase drinks like this only occasionally.

I enjoyed the lite Guru energy drink! It has a refreshingly crisp citrusy flavor but not too heavy a taste.  Only 10 calories! After 30 minutes I could definitely feel a nice boost. Not too jittery either.  #trynatural

I am not a huge energy drink fan, due to the usual caffeinated cough syrup taste and often shakey feeling afterwards. However, with Guru I was actually pleasantly surprised! It tasted much better than other energy drinks that I have tried, and there wasn't such a drastic crash after the caffeine wore off. I like that I didn't experience any shakey feelings or feel ill after drinking. I will definitely be purchasing more when my coffee just isn't doing what I need.

The Guru Energy Drink is a great tasting alternative to other energy drinks. I'm primarily a Red Bull fan but I got to try the Guru Energy Drink. It tastes a bit better than Red Bull but the crashes are way weaker. The price is cheaper than red bull. There are basically no downsides when compared to other energy drinks. All in all, 10/10 would buy again.

I don't usually drink energy drinks or coffee because they make my heart race and I get shaky but with half a can of this drink I didn't feel over-caffeinated.
I liked that it is low in calories and organic but that also limits where I can buy it in the future. I don't usually shop at Sprouts or Whole Foods so this would only be something I would get when I rarely make it into those stores.

The taste, like Guru's website describes, is very indescribable. It is very sharp and light with a medium amount of carbonation. The caffeine buzz is more "natural"... it has more of an upslope and downslope rather than a sudden cracked out (which is arguably awesome too in its own respect) then big crash sort of feeling. This is because the caffeine in Guru is derived from 125mg of Guaranine (Guarana Herb) rather than synthetically separated then added. There is no mention about how much of the 125mg of Guaranine is real caffeine, but since Red Bull checks in at 80mg / 8.3oz it seems that Guru is in pretty good shape.

I usually don't like energy drinks, because I can't deal with the carbonation. Guru Organic Energy Drink was a nice surprise, because the carbonation isn't that bad - I actually let it sit a little and it got a lot better. The taste is very fruity and mild, and I really like how sweet it is. I tried it on a day when I had to be out early, and it really helped me feeling up while running errands. I'd recommend it and buy it again.

There's two sizes. I used the larger sugar free one before starting my 8am shift. I drank it throughout my shift. I absolutely loved the taste of it! The price isn't to bad either. With some of the energy drinks out there at least this one you know is organic and better for you so it's worth it. Energy wise I def felt it when I first started drinking it. It wasn't overpowering but the right amount of energy. I usually sip it throughout my shift. The only problem I had with it was that after the half way point my energy was decreasing but I would definitely recommend it to my friends.

So, I am not an energy drink person & I got this for my husband & he was really skeptic about it cause he's used to the regular energy drinks at the gas station. But, he actually really enjoyed this. He said it gave him more energy without the sugar-y crash that others give him after a couple of hours. This definitely worked for him & I felt better knowing that it has better ingredients for him. I was really against him drinking energy drinks, but thankful that this product is a lot safer for him. I would recommend this product to any & all energy drinkers.

The drink was very cool and refreshing with a taste similar to redbull. I felt energized but didn't experience any crash or over-hype.

I definitely recommend trying once if you regularly consume energy drinks.

At first taste I thought it was a bit bitter and had a weird taste but the more I drank it, the better it began to taste. It was very smooth and not as gassy as red bull. I began to feel very energetic as the day went on. By nightfall it began to wore off and I was able to sleep like normal. It had no lasting effects like Red Bull or Monster drinks and it tasted real good.  I can see myself buying it again, especially because it has natural and organic ingredients. I would definitely recommend this energy drink to others.

I didn't know what to expect from this drink, what if the flavor was not as strong as other competitors? Or what if the effect was not as strong or at least the same? But having the promise that it is a natural product, and non-GMO why not giving it a chance? 
The result? It is great! As long as you drink it cold it is very refreshing, the flavor is delicious, and it really gives you a boost of energy, perfect for those moments when you need help to stay awake. Even when I got my coupon to get a free drink, I noticed the price is not that high, making it an even better option.

I just tried the regular version of the Guru Organic Energy drink and it was quite good. The flavor was sort of similar to a very mild grapefruit flavor.

There is nothing chemical or strange in this drink. I would definitely switch over to this from the other drinks I have tried. If you want something light, refreshing, and tasty pick one of these up!

This product worked so well for my energy level. I was dead drag button tired when I drank it and felt steady energy all day.

I love the fact that it is sweetened with Stevia and uses natural ingredients for the boost of energy you might need mid day or early morning.

It was actually really good. I loved how it wasn't that high in calories it was only 100. But it tasted like a orange energy drink. So afterall it was really good.

This is a great way to boost up your energy without any harmful chemicals of other energy drinks. I drank it early in the morning and it immediately gave me a boost of energy, like a cup of coffee usually does, and I did not feel a crash throughout the day. It lasts a good 10-12 hours, by the time I was ready for bed I slept soundly, definitely a great product!

This was a surprisingly pleasant beverage. I don't usually like energy drinks. Every now and again I break down and purchase one as an alternative to my usual coffee, but I'm not a big energy drink person. I think of them as having a rather off taste and an unpleasant effect on my heartbeat. This one, surprisingly, seemed to have neither of those. It was fresh tasting if you can believe it, and I found myself actually enjoying the flavor instead of merely tolerating it. The one detractor is that it did not seem to supply quite the same kick as a normal energy drink. The energy it did supply, however, came without heart palpitations or other unfortunate side effects, and for that I am quite grateful! I may not buy it often, but next time I reach for an energy drink I'll definitely reach for guru and I will not hesitate to suggest it to friends.

I'm glad that I was able to try this. It's honestly not to bad if you are looking for a more natural energy. But that being said there is some downsides. Natural Guarana has a steady rise of alertness and energy. But also comes with a sudden crash once it's all used up. That's because there are no synthetics that carry the Caffeine. The flavor is mellow yet sharp. Definitely has that "natural" flavor. All in all, it's not a bad drink. Definitely a plus for those looking for non synthetics and wanting natural energy.

I was a big coffee drinker until i realized how much sugar and creamer I was consuming in my 'cup of joe'. I also realized the energy crash later was due to my coffee fix. Discovering Guru was the perfect answer for me! The taste takes a little getting used to, (best ice cold) but the energy boost is just right and I don't seem to have the crash later. My son uses it for work-outs, and my employer and I swear it makes us happy! Also, I have gotten so I like the taste. Please don't ever stop making guru!

Not overpowering like most energy drinks that I buy. This has no B vitamins and doesn't taste like a vitamin B drink. Instead it has a real smooth lite flavor. It has like a light fruit taste, almost like a carbonated flavored water/juice, and is really not too sweet. It taste real unique and is made with all natural ingredients. I like it, I would definitely recommend this product to help support the immune system. #trynatural

I like all the features GURU has but it has interesting taste. I wouldn't say that it is my favorite flavor. This is the only issue I have with GURU energy drink.

So, instead of buying energy drinks that causes health problems, it is better to get an organic one. Nice product overall.

I must admit that I am always needing some sort of energy push, and I most definitely can become a connoisseur of energy drinks. Guru Natural Energy Drink came through 100%. The taste was not too sweet, and actually tasted like a flavorful light fruit beverage. Guru was not too heavy and I could feel the pick up immediately. Bottom line is this energy drink is great in taste, gives me the pick up I need, almost immediately, and does not hurt the pocket book, like so many other energy drinks.

So I love the fact that this energy drink is organic. That is the best thing about it. I only had the one for sampling so I did give me a boost when i needed it and doesn't taste harsh like some of the other energy drinks I have tasted. Some are too sweet or not sweet enough and I think this one was balanced, but that is just my opinion. I liked it but the best things are that its vegan gluten free non gmo and it comes in light for those counting calories

I don't usually drink energy drinks since most are full of ingredients that can do more harm than good.  However, I recently attended an all day training for group fitness and I decided it to try out the GURU natural energy drink  to prepare me for the intense physical activities of the day.  Normally, I am sensitive to caffeine, but I didn't particularly feel any jitters or side effects when I drank GURU natural energy drink.  I liked the taste, which didn't have an aftertaste, as what I would expect...and it kept my energy going throughout the day.  Overall, I enjoyed trying this product out, and like that this is a healthier alternative energy drink than what's on the market.

This actually worked to give me energy. I work in a physically demanding environment, and after 12 hour days, I really just have enough for the commute and then to crash out when I get home. Not so great when I am the primary caretaker of an energetic toddler. Much to my relief, the GURU drink was offered and for me it was a must have.
It actually worked rather well. The taste was smooth and not funky like a lot of energy drinks tend to be. It gave me the energy to keep pushing as I drank it with my break meal. It takes a lot to pep me up, but surprisingly, this did. Kudos!

When taking all factors into consideration this is best energy drink by I've had hands down. The taste is unique, not artificial at all. The effect is more of a smooth climb with a bonus increase in mental awareness. No initial energy jolt and no hard crash because instead of just caffeine anhydrous, this uses a blend of guarana, ginseng, and gingko biloba for energy., I can easily say that GURU is among the very best. Using natural, organic ingredients (organic, vegan, no gluten, no GMO's) and natural caffeine, GURU manages to be tastier than most of the competition without having to resort a bevy of artificial flavors.I find the taste enjoyable,  It's not too harsh and has refreshing flavor.

I drink energy drinks on occasion but not all the time. I usually don’t like getting the jitters and some do cause jitters. I also hate the taste of some of them. I really wanted to try Guru because I have never had Organic energy drinks before. I decided to take one after returning from a trip in the afternoon and decided that I wanted to go to yoga that night but wasn’t sure if I had the energy for it. I took it about an hour before going to the gym I ran for 15 minutes and did an hour yoga class.  I was pleasantly surprised at how good it tasted. It had a light sparkling natural taste. I felt really great throughout my workout. I didn’t get this surge or jolt of energy, but I noticed that I didn’t feel tired at all. I also never got the jitters which was my biggest concern. I really like Guru. I'm very impressed.  I would recommend it to any of my friends.

I always try to eat and drink healthy especially when it's organic.   Normally I am not a fan of energy drinks  because of the ingredients that are hard to read and understand.  Since this one was organic,  I enjoyed it more because of the enjoyable taste, unlike other energy drinks. Plus it's healthier and has organic ingredients.

I am use to drinking energy drinks that most are accustom to, but this drink surely surprised me.  I was thinking that this would not be as good as the one I drink mostly.  Do you know that this drink tasted better?  I was pleasantly surprised that this drink was not only great tasting, but gave me the energy that I needed.  I wish I knew about this brand sooner as it seems that I am always the last to know about great products.

I couldn't personally try it due to being pregnant and not having much caffeine, so I gave it to my husband to try. Took him a bit to get use to the flavor. He's use red bull and monster. I got him the original and it seemed to give him great energy. Will buy more for his long and early work days. We got the original since my husband hates anything "lite". I look forward to having one later.

I'm so glad I found this energy drink. I can so appreciate that it does not include horrible sweeteners like aspertame or splenda. I also prefer the taste of the drink over the taste of Monster or Rockstar. I also really love that it doesn't give me the jitters that those other popular drinks do. I felt the energy, but it was a smooth increase of energy...not something that made me feel sick or anxious. I would totally recommend.

I appreciated the chance to try this drink. It's great to have a healthier organic alternative without the additives & artificial flavours that are part of many energy drinks.  I found it very refreshing, with just enough sweetness. It did increase my energy somewhat without making me feel overly amped up. I also love that it's vegan & non-GMO. The only reason that I wouldn't buy it as frequently is because I found the taste a little strong, but it's a good product that I plan to drink occasionally.

I really loved this product, I am a huge fan of energy drinks. Most conventional ones contain so many terrible ingredients, so it's kind of hard to justify purchasing them. It took a while for me to get a hold of this product since the store is a bit far, I wish they sold this in more locations. I really enjoyed it, it was sweet; but not overwhelming need water feel. It was very smooth and fizzy, and it didn't contain stevia. I usually hate natural organic drinks that contain stevia since they give me a headache; this product didn't do that. I enjoyed every minute of it and didn't want it to end. I would completely recommend this to everyone, I will purchase it on occasion since it's a bit higher in price; although I can justify paying higher for a healthier alternative. Overall I was beyond impressed, I was very surprised by the quality; I truly enjoyed it.

Ive never tried an organic energy drink before. I liked that it was low in calories and was a natural energy drink. I liked that it didnt make me crash because the caffeine was naturally occurring.

This was my first time trying an organic energy drink and it was great! The taste is wonderful along with the energy boost I needed. It did not make me feel jittery nor did I crash. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for either a healthier alternative or just needs a quick boost.

I purchased the original 12 oz Guru . I had to purchase the original due to the sweetener used in the lite. This energy drink had a great taste to it . I read all the ingredients before drinking and was confident I was drinking something better for me. Comparitive to other energy drinks this was the only one I could drink .  I drank this on a day when I had no coffee and it did the job of my coffee .

Sometimes even the healthiest and most conscious of foodies wants to imbibe in a 'naughty' energy drink in a can,   Really cool that Guru has an organic alternative.

I have tried many different energy drinks in the past & Guru fits right in with the rest of them. The plus side is that this did not taste any different than non natural products. Bubbly with a smooth flavor. I felt awake after drinking it without having any of the "bloated" feeling afterward that some dinks leave me feeling. Overall I was very pleased and would recommend especially if you only want to drink natural energy drinks.
