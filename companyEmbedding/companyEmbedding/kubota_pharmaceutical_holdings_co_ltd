Kubota Pharmaceutical Holdings Signs Letter of 
      Intent to Form a Joint Venture with SBI Holdings




Agreement to establish a joint venture to finance the development of 
      ophthalmic drugs and devices






December 26, 2016 02:18 AM Eastern Standard Time



TOKYO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Kubota Pharmaceutical Holdings Co., Ltd. (Tokyo 4596, “Kubota Pharma”), 
      a clinical-stage ophthalmology company committed to translating 
      innovation into a diverse portfolio of drugs and devices to preserve and 
      restore vision for millions of people worldwide, and SBI Holdings, Inc. 
      (“SBI”), a financial services and asset management company based in 
      Japan, announced today the signing of a non-binding letter of intent 
      (“LOI”) to establish a joint venture that will organize and manage 
      special purpose entities to finance the development of ophthalmic drugs 
      and devices. The LOI contemplates that the joint venture will be funded 
      51% by Kubota Pharma and 49% by SBI. Kubota Pharma and SBI have entered 
      negotiations for a definitive joint venture agreement.
    

      Concurrent with the negotiation of the definitive joint venture 
      agreement, the parties intend to negotiate a separate definitive 
      agreement to establish and fund the joint venture’s first special 
      purpose entity, which is expected to be focused on mobile healthcare 
      (mHealth) applications in the field of ophthalmology. mHealth refers to 
      the usage of mobile communications technology and devices to enhance 
      access to healthcare information, improve distribution of routine and 
      emergency health services, and provide diagnostic services. In addition, 
      through this first special purpose entity, Kubota Pharma will explore 
      potential development and commercialization synergies between the 
      mHealth platform and its drug product candidates already in development.
    

      Kubota Pharma’s mission to eradicate blindness through the development 
      of ophthalmic drugs and devices, and SBI’s business focus in the medical 
      and pharmaceuticals arena, contributed to collaborative discussions 
      which led to the signing of the LOI to form the joint venture to develop 
      ophthalmic drugs and devices. This joint venture enables Kubota Pharma 
      to potentially expand its development pipeline and capabilities to 
      further its mission.

Cautionary Statements


      Certain statements contained in this press release are forward-looking 
      statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 
      1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the 
      Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Any statements 
      contained in this press release that are not statements of historical 
      fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. These 
      forward-looking statements include our ability to establish a joint 
      venture with SBI, including the proposed terms of such joint venture; 
      our intention to pursue mobile healthcare applications in the field of 
      ophthalmology; and our ability to successfully develop and commercialize 
      any product candidates pursued by the proposed joint venture. These 
      statements are based on current assumptions that involve risks, 
      uncertainties and other factors that could cause the actual results, 
      events or developments to differ materially from those expressed or 
      implied by such forward-looking statements. These risks and 
      uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, include, but are 
      not limited to: we and SBI may be unable to complete negotiations and 
      establish the proposed joint venture; any investigational product 
      candidates pursued by the joint venture may not demonstrate the expected 
      safety and efficacy; any product candidates pursued by the joint venture 
      may fail in development, may not receive required regulatory approvals, 
      or may be delayed to a point where they are not commercially viable; new 
      developments in the intensely competitive ophthalmic pharmaceutical 
      market may require changes in the joint venture’s proposed clinical 
      trial plans or limit the potential benefits of investigational product 
      candidates; as well as the other risks identified in our filings with 
      the Securities and Exchange Commission. These forward-looking statements 
      speak only as of the date hereof and we assume no obligation to update 
      these forward-looking statements, and readers are cautioned not to place 
      undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. For a detailed

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

Results of Operations
						



Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements


In this document, unless the context otherwise requires, references to "we",
"our", "us", the "Company" or "Kubota Holdings" mean Kubota Pharmaceutical
Holdings Co., Ltd., a Japanese corporation, and its subsidiaries, including
Acucela Inc. All information is provided as of March 31, 2017, unless otherwise
stated. "" refers to Japanese Yen, the lawful currency of Japan, and "$" refers
to U.S. dollars.

This section should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Part I, Item 1
of this report. This discussion contains certain forward-looking statements
within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and
Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking
statements are identified by words such as "believe," "anticipate," "expect,"
"intend," "plan," "will," "may," "seek" and other similar expressions. You
should read these statements carefully because they discuss future expectations,
contain projections of future results of operations or financial condition, or
state other "forward-looking" information. These statements relate to our future
plans, objectives, expectations, intentions and financial performance and the
assumptions that underlie these statements. These forward-looking statements
include, but are not limited to:


? our ability to identify additional products or product candidates;
?          the initiation, timing, cost, progress and success of our research and

           development programs, preclinical studies and clinical trials;



?          our ability to advance product candidates into, and successfully
           complete, clinical trials;


?          our ability to recruit sufficient numbers of subjects for our current
           and future clinical trials;


? our ability to achieve profitability;
? our ability to obtain funding for our operations, including research funding;
? the implementation of our business model and strategic initiatives;


?          our ability to satisfy milestone payment obligations and pay other
           fees and costs related to licensing transactions we enter into;


? our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates;



? our commercialization, marketing and manufacturing capabilities and strategy;


?          our ability to protect our intellectual property and operate our
           business without infringing upon the intellectual property rights of
           others;


? our expectations regarding federal, state and foreign regulatory requirements;



? the therapeutic benefits, effectiveness and safety of our product candidates;


?          the accuracy of our estimates of the size and characteristics of the
           markets that may be addressed by our products and product candidates;


?          the rate and degree of market acceptance and clinical utility of our
           future products, if any;


?          the timing of, and our and our collaborators' ability to obtain and
           maintain regulatory approvals for our product candidates;
? our ability to maintain and establish collaborations;


?          our expectations regarding market risk, including interest rate
           changes and foreign currency fluctuations;


?          the sufficiency of our cash, cash equivalents and investments to meet
           our needs for at least the next 12 months;


? our ability to engage and retain the employees required to grow our business;


?          our future financial performance, projected expenditures, and needs
           for additional financing;


?          developments relating to our competitors and our industry, including
           the success of competing therapies that are or become available;


?          our ability to reduce overhead costs and improve administrative

           efficiencies; and

Overview


We are a clinical stage ophthalmology company that is committed to translating
innovation into a diverse portfolio of drugs and devices to preserve and restore
vision for millions worldwide. We have a broad product candidate portfolio of
multiple technologies in the preclinical and clinical development stages
intended to provide solutions to ophthalmic disorders affecting millions of
people worldwide. We are pursuing development of our product candidates for
debilitating diseases such as diabetic retinopathy/diabetic macular edema,
cataract, retinitis pigmentosa, Stargardt disease, and age-related macular
degeneration. As part of our mobile health application initiatives, we are also
developing technologies intended to detect nascent disease progression to
improve treatment outcome in patients with wet age-related macular degeneration,
diabetic macular edema and other neovascular retinal diseases.

Our lead compound for Stargardt disease is Emixustat. It is administrated as a
once-daily oral tablet and belongs to a novel class of drug candidates called
visual cycle modulators, or VCM. Based on preclinical data, Emixustat is being
evaluated clinically to potentially reduce toxins implicated in the pathogenesis
of Stargardt disease and preserve the integrity of retinal tissue, thereby
slowing disease progression. The U.S. FDA granted orphan drug designation to
Emixustat for the treatment of Stargardt disease in January 2017. The compound
may also have application in other retinal diseases including diabetic
retinopathy. A multi-center Phase 2b/3 clinical trial evaluating Emixustat for
geographic atrophy, or GA, has been recently completed and Emixustat failed to
demonstrate a clinical benefit in GA patients. As a consequence, we announced in
June 2016 that our co-development partner for Emixustat, Otsuka Pharmaceutical
Co., Ltd., or Otsuka, had terminated the Emixustat collaboration agreement.

Our lead technology for neovascular retinal diseases such as wet age related
macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy / diabetic macular edema and retinal
vein occlusion is ACU-6151. ACU-6151 is a small molecule found in animal studies
to suppress vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF, driven vascular leakage
and neovascularization while promoting homeostasis of healthy tissue. In
December 2016, we entered into an R&D Collaboration Agreement, or the
Collaboration Agreement, with EyeMedics LLC, or EyeMedics. Pursuant to the terms
of the Collaboration Agreement, we and EyeMedics will jointly conduct through
human proof of concept the pre-clinical and clinical development of ACU-6151.

Our lead compound for the treatment of cataract is lanosterol. Lanosterol has
been found in animal studies to reverse lens opacification, the medical
condition that defines cataracts. Lanosterol may reverse lens opacification in
humans while maintaining the natural lens ability to accommodate, a process
required to allow for reading and other activities that rely on near vision. We
licensed the global rights, excluding Hong Kong, Taiwan and China, for
lanosterol from YouHealth Eyetech, Inc., or YouHealth, in March 2016. We may
also consider clinical development of lanosterol for presbyopia.

Our lead technology for retinitis pigmentosa, or RP, is an optogenetic therapy
designed to make bipolar cells in the retina light sensitive. It is anticipated
that this may restore some vision in advanced RP patients left with very limited
visual function prior to therapy. We licensed the technology from the University
of Manchester in April 2016.

In addition to a diverse portfolio of drug candidates for various ophthalmic
indications, we have invested in mobile health application initiatives. The
Patient Based Ophthalmology Suite, or PBOS, is being designed to detect nascent
disease progression to improve treatment outcome in patients with wet
age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, diabetic macular edema, or DME, and
other neovascular retinal diseases.

Our long-term strategy is to commercialize drugs and devices that will benefit
people living with debilitating ophthalmological conditions. We intend to
leverage our internal research and development efforts to develop an innovative
portfolio of ophthalmology products. As part of our strategic plan, we are
pursuing external partnerships and in-licensing and M&A opportunities.

Description of Operating Accounts
Revenue from collaborations to date has been generated primarily by our research
and development activities pursuant to our collaboration and licensing
agreements with Otsuka. Our revenue consists of reimbursement from Otsuka for
our fees paid to external service providers in connection with our collaboration
agreements with Otsuka, payment from Otsuka for the development services
provided by our personnel for services rendered as part of our collaborative
research program, Otsuka's funding of our portion of development costs under the
Emixustat Agreement, an initial license fee as part of the Emixustat Agreement,
and milestone payments. We began winding down our collaborations efforts with
Otsuka following their notice to

                                       17

  Table of Contents


terminate their collaboration and licensing agreements with us in June 2016. We
did not recognize any revenue for the three month period ended March 31, 2017
and do not anticipate recognizing any further revenues from Otsuka. In the
absence of any new collaboration agreements, we do not expect revenue in 2017.
We are required by the Tokyo Stock Exchange to generate revenue five years after
our IPO in 2014. Currently, we are pursuing various partnering efforts and, if
such partnering transactions are consummated, expect to generate revenue in the
future through such strategic collaborations.
Research and development expenses incurred to date have substantially focused on
developing potential therapies for sight-threatening diseases. Following entry
into our collaboration agreements with Otsuka and prior to the termination of
such agreements, our efforts had been principally directed towards fulfilling
our commitments thereunder, particularly under the Emixustat Agreement. We
recognize research and development expenses as they are incurred and these costs
primarily consist of fees paid to consultants, contract research organizations,
independent monitors of our clinical trials, and parties acquiring and
evaluating data in conjunction with our clinical trials, including all related
fees such as investigator fees, license fees, patient screening, lab work and
data compilation and statistical analysis; costs related to production of
clinical materials, including fees paid to contract manufacturers; costs related
to compliance with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and European Medicine
Agency regulatory requirements; consulting fees paid to third parties involved
in research and development activities; compensation and related expenses for
personnel in research and development functions; and an allocated portion of
certain general and administrative costs. We expect our research and development
expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we pursue development of our product
candidates in multiple indications and execute in-licensing transactions
resulting in potential upfront and milestone payments.


General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for
employees in executive and administrative functions, including finance,
accounting, legal and human resources. Other significant costs include
facilities costs and professional fees for accounting and legal services,
including legal services associated with obtaining and maintaining patents.


Interest income consists primarily of interest earned on our cash, cash
equivalents and short-term and long-term investments.
Other income (expense) consists primarily of foreign exchange gains/losses
incurred on transactions occurring in Japan, gain or losses from the disposal of
fixed assets or other miscellaneous items.
Income tax expense consists of insignificant deferred income taxes in 2017 and
2016, in addition to the recording of a valuation allowance related to deferred
tax assets for which we do not anticipate future realization. We did not record
an income tax benefit for the periods ended March 31, 2017 or 2016, as the
result of a full valuation allowance.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Comparison of three month periods ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016
                          REVENUE FROM COLLABORATIONS
The following table presents revenues for clinical programs (in thousands,
except percentages):
                Three Months Ended March 31,          2016 to 2017    2016 to 2017

The decrease in revenue from collaborations for the three months ended March 31,
2017 compared to the same period in 2016 was due to the completion of the
Emixustat clinical trial during 2016 and wind-down activities related to
Emixustat following the termination of our collaboration with Otsuka. Wind-down
activities related to Emixustat were completed in December 2016.
Our Phase 2b/3 clinical trial results related to Emixustat for the treatment of
geographic atrophy was completed in May 2016. We do not expect to generate any
revenue from the terminated collaboration with Otsuka related to Emixustat in
the future.
                               OPERATING EXPENSES
Research and development
We anticipate that potential product candidates developed under our strategic
plan may be developed independently, and, in the absence of establishing new
collaborations, our expenditures on such programs will not be funded by
collaborative partners. As a consequence, we expect our total research and
development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we pursue development of
our product candidates in multiple indications and potentially execute
additional in-licensing transactions resulting in potential upfront and
milestone payments.
By program, our research and development expenses were as follows (in thousands,
except percentages):
                                       Three Months Ended March 31,      2016 to 2017     2016 to 2017
                                           2017              2016          $ Change         % Change
Internal Research                    $         3,407     $    5,442     $     (2,035 )       (37.4 )%
Emixustat                                      1,471          3,477           (2,006 )       (57.7 )%
Total                                $         4,878     $    8,919     $     (4,041 )       (45.3 )%


Research and development expense decreased $4.0 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2017, or 45.3%, as compared to the same period in 2016.
Research and development expenses incurred through our internal research
activities decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to same
period in 2016, mainly due to a 2016 upfront non-refundable fee of $5.0 million
paid to YouHealth in connection with the option and license agreement for
lanosterol technology. In 2017, internal research expenses, excluding the
YouHealth payment, increased due to new product development in connection with
execution of our strategic plan.
Research and development expense related to clinical programs under the
Emixustat Agreement decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared
to same period in 2016, mainly due to the completion of the Phase 2b/3 clinical
trial and related wind-down in activities related to such clinical trial
following the termination of the Emixustat Agreement in 2016. In 2017, we
incurred $1.5 million in research and development expense related to the
Emixustat clinical programs for Stargardt disease and proliferative diabetic
retinopathy.

General and administrative expenses decreased $3.6 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2017 compared to same period in 2016 primarily due to the
following:
?          we recognized less stock based compensation expense primarily due to
           market based awards which fully vested in the prior year in the amount
           of $1.9 million;


?          we paid $1.1 million less in corporate legal expenses and charges
           related to the Redomicile Transaction;


?          we incurred fewer charges in labor, taxes, and other benefits of $0.4
           million due to having fewer employees in 2017; and


? other expenses decreased by $0.2 million in the current year.
Income tax expense
Income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 was
immaterial, due to our having established a full valuation allowance against our
deferred tax assets.


Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash and cash equivalents include all short-term, highly liquid investments with
an original maturity date of three months or less as of the date of purchase.
Cash equivalents consist of money market funds. Investments with maturities
between three months and one year at the date of purchase are classified as
short-term investments. Short-term investments are comprised of corporate debt
securities, commercial paper, U.S. government agency securities, and
certificates of deposit.
As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we had cash, cash equivalents and
investments of $133.0 million and $141.3 million, respectively. Amounts on
deposit with third-party financial institutions may exceed the applicable
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Securities Investor Protection
Corporation insurance limits, as applicable.
We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances will
be sufficient to fund our ongoing operating activities, working capital, capital
expenditures and other capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. Our
future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the expansion
of our research and development activities and our ability to successfully
in-license or acquire additional technologies. Other than our exclusive option
to purchase the assets related to our collaboration agreement with EyeMedics,
which option has not been exercised, we are not currently a party to any
agreement or letter of intent regarding potential investments in, or
acquisitions of, complementary businesses, applications or technologies. We may
enter into these types of arrangements, which could require us to seek
additional equity or debt financing.
The following table shows a summary of our cash flows for the three months ended
March 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):
                                             Three Months Ended March 31,
                                                2017               2016

Net cash used in operating activities     $      (8,070 )     $      (6,648 )
Net cash provided by investing activities        11,334
               5,536
Net cash provided by financing activities            24               3,744


Cash Flows from Operating Activities
Net cash used in operating activities was $8.1 million and $6.6 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The change in net cash
used in operating activities is related to a decrease of $5.1 million in cash
collections of accounts receivable from collaborations offset by a decrease of
$3.7 million in cash payments for operating expenses.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
Net cash provided by investing activities was $11.3 million and $5.5 million for
the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Cash inflows
increased primarily due to an increase of $9.2 million in net maturities of
marketable securities held as available for sale offset by an increase of $3.4
million in purchases of marketable securities available for sale.

                                       20

  Table of Contents


Cash Flows from Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities was less than $0.1 million and $3.7
million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. During
2017, cash inflows from financing activities was due to proceeds from the
issuance of common stock related to a former employee exercising their stock
options. During 2016, cash inflows from financing activities related to proceeds
from the issuance of common stock to current and former employees exercising
their stock options offset by employee tax withholdings for equity awards.

Contractual Obligations and Commitments
In addition to the contractual commitments, which consist of operating leases
for corporate office and laboratory space, disclosed in our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, we have not incurred any
additional material contractual obligations or commitments outside of the normal
course of business during the three months ended March 31, 2017 except the
following:


Severance
During the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Company paid $0.5 million in
severance to the former Chief Strategy Officer, Executive Vice President,
General Counsel and other former employees.
Leases

On January 4, 2017, Acucela Inc entered into an amendment to the Lease Agreement
by and between Acucela and Nexus dated February 13, 2006, or the Bothell Lease.
Pursuant to the terms of the amendment, the term of the Bothell Lease was
extended to February 29, 2020, subject to Acucela Inc.'s right to extend the
term for one additional two year period by written notice to Nexus.
On January 12, 2017, Acucela Inc. entered into a Zillow Sublease pursuant to
which Zillow will sublease from Acucela Inc. all 38,723 square feet of the
Current Seattle Premises. The Zillow Sublease is scheduled to commence on June
1, 2017 and will continue until the expiration of the Acucela Sublease on
February 28, 2022, unless Boeing earlier terminates the Acucela Sublease on
November 30, 2021. For the first three months of the term of the Zillow
Sublease, Acucela Inc. will remain responsible for payment of rent to the Boeing
Company.
On March 30, 2017, the Company and Tokyu Land Corporation entered into a lease
agreement, or the Tokyo Lease, relating to the lease of approximately 1,102
square feet of rentable office space located in 3-7-1 Kasumigaseki, Chiyoda-ku,
Tokyo, Room 404, or the Tokyo Premises. The Tokyo Premises will serve as the
Company's headquarters. The term for the Tokyo Lease commences on June 1, 2017
and expires on May 31, 2020.
Contingently Repayable Advances
Pursuant to the terms of the Emixustat Agreement, Otsuka agreed to advance funds
to us, which are secured by an interest in our net profits and royalty payments
and in our entire interests in ownership of the related Emixustat compound and
its backup compounds, certain pharmaceutical formulations developed under the
Emixustat Agreement that contain one of those compounds, and the underlying
intellectual property rights. Amounts previously had been advanced under this
arrangement only to fund our share of development costs under the Emixustat
Agreement, and such advances bear interest at the three month LIBOR rate plus
three percent. These advances are exclusively payable out of:
?       50% of either our share of net profits, as described in the Emixustat

        Agreement, generated from collaboration product sales in North America

        or, if applicable, 50% of the royalty payable to us for those sales;


?       50% of the net profits, as described in the Emixustat Agreement, we
        generate from collaboration product sales outside North America and
        Otsuka's sole territory; and


?       50% of the consideration, as described in the Emixustat Agreement, we
        receive from the sale or license of collaboration compounds and
        collaboration products developed under the agreement outside North
        America and Otsuka's sole territory.


The percentages above will increase to 75%, if we have not repaid the advances
within five years of the first commercial sale of a product based on Emixustat
in North America. There are no financial covenant requirements under our
arrangement with Otsuka. There were outstanding advances of $64.0 million as of
both March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. There was accumulated interest of
$7.8 million and $7.2 million under this arrangement as of March 31, 2017 and
December 31, 2016, respectively.

                                       21

  Table of Contents


Off-Balance Sheet Transactions
Beginning in 2011, we shared the development costs under the Emixustat
Agreement, with Otsuka funding our share of these development costs, subject to
our agreement to repay them from our share of the profits, if any, or sale or
licensing proceeds, if any, from the commercialization of Emixustat. Through
March 31, 2017 and 2016, we have recognized cumulative revenue of approximately
$64.6 million and $63.4 million, respectively, under the agreement as described
above.
To date, we have not had any relationships with unconsolidated entities or
financial partnerships, such as entities referred to as structured finance or
special purpose entities, which are established for the purpose of facilitating
off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited
purposes.
