What is MojiPage?

MojiPage is a free, customizable mobile social webtop. It gives users quick access to their favorite web contents (e.g. feeds, widgets, social networks) by summarizing the information onto a single screen, viewable on mobile and desktop browsers.
			
Streamlined Mobile Experience

			Designed with the limitations of mobile devices in mind, contents on MojiPage are specifically optimized for viewing on mobile browsers.
			
Easy Access
Your personalized MojiPage can be set as the default home page on your mobile browser, and can be customized from any web browser on the mobile or desktop.
Fast
When accessing contents on MojiPage, users will not be redirected to other websites. The loading of information and data is therefore significantly faster.
Cost Savings
MojiPage is customized to meet individual requirements. The mobile data consumption incurred is minimized when unwanted contents are not downloaded.

The MojiPage Advantage
Developer Community
MojiPage is an open system where contents can be easily built by developers using a simple  and familiar API (XHTML, CSS and Javascript).  The open API will allow developers to create their own widgets for MojiPage and made available to all MojiPage users.
Documentations and technical support will also be provided free to developers.  This will ensure that all widgets created will have a consistent end user experience.
The unique technology behind MojiPage allows contents to be loaded and refreshed from the server end instead of the browser’s end like other conventional mobile pages.  This allows MojiPage to be supported on the largest array of mobile devices available.
Business Community
In the interest of providing the largest library of widgets to end users, Moji Labs, Inc. will provide custom widgets creation and hosting services for corporate, commercial and retail businesses.  The company’s branded widget can be a mobilized version of their website, or an application that features any of their core business functionalities.
MojiPage is a white label solution.  It can be skinned and customized to meet the branding needs any company.  If a company requires their own branded mobile start page, MojiPage will provide the technical support, creation and/or hosting services as required.

Please review and confirm our License Agreement.




License to create Emojis with your brandsAgreement: Moji Lab, Inc., a Colorado company, (“Moji,” “Company,” and “us”) is in the business of taking various companies’ brands and turning them into Emojis. It’s a great thing, because we’ll make an Emoji of your products and brands for free, and then it helps spread the word about what we do. Because these are your brands and we’re using them to make Emojis, we figured it was a good idea to get your written permission (“Agreement”).Inventions: Your brands and trademarks are your intellectual property—we don’t want to change that. We’ll call them your “Inventions.” They’re yours and it’s going to stay that way.License: Here’s what we’ll do. By signing this, you grant to Moji a non-exclusive, perpetual, revocable, worldwide, fully-paid right and license, with the right to sublicense through multiple levels of sublicensees, under all of Company’s intellectual property rights in any portion of the Inventions incorporated into or necessary to fully utilize and capitalize the Inventions, (i) to reproduce, create derivative works of, distribute, publicly perform, publicly display, digitally transmit, and otherwise use the Inventions in any medium or format, whether now known or hereafter discovered, (ii) to use, make, have made, sell, offer to sell, import, and otherwise exploit any product or service based on, embodying, incorporating, or derived from the Inventions, and (iii) to exercise any and all other present or future rights in the Invention. What Does that Mean? Just what we said before: Your brands are all yours, but if you sign, we can make Emojis with them and share them with the world.Ownership of the Emoji: When Moji makes an Emoji out of your brand, Moji will own the rights to the Emoji—you will still own the rights to the brand and the trademarks themselves. We will have the rights to use and develop the Emoji, and you’ll have the right to change your mind about us using it at any time. But you can’t use the Emoji we created without us, outside our app or services, unless we give you our written permission; it wouldn’t be fair to us to put all this work into creating your Emojis otherwise.The Right to Change Your Mind: If you decide you don’t want us to make or use Emojis with your brands anymore, that’s fine. That’s your call. Just send an email to info@kushmoji.io, and we at Moji Lab will stop using the Emojis in our products within 72 hours.Limited Authority to Bind and Act as Agent: Outside the specific authorizations in the provisions of this Agreement, neither party will have authority to act on behalf of the other. Also, by agreeing to this contract, you warrant that you are actually authorized to sign on behalf of the company you own or work for.Independent Contractor: This Agreement is not intended to create, and shall not be construed to create, a relationship of principal and agent, master and servant, employer and employee, joint venture, partnership, nor any other relationship other than that of an independent contractor. Payment. Right now, this is free. But Moji might at some point start charging companies for the right to use the Emoji or its services. If we do this, we’ll let you know, and you’ll have the choice then to continue to use and pay, or just stop using.Term: This Agreement may be terminated by either party at any time and for any reason.Not Promoting Illegal Conduct: Moji does not promote, condone, or encourage any illegal behavior, including underage consumption of cannabis, or violations of any state or local laws where behavior might be restricted for whatever reason.Construction/Venue: This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Colorado.  The venue for any lawsuit, mediation, or dispute resolution process arising as a result of this Agreement shall be in Denver, Colorado.Make Love, Not War: We don’t like legal fights. But in the rare chance one of us ever got upset about something, we prefer mediation. If you sign this, you agree to resolve disputes through mediation and we’ll split the cost of mediation. Should mediation prove unsuccessful, next, any claims and disputes arising under this Agreement are to be settled by binding arbitration in the State of Colorado. The arbitration shall be conducted on a confidential basis in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. Any decision or award as a result of such arbitration shall be in writing and shall provide an explanation for all conclusions of law and fact.  An award of arbitration may be confirmed in a court of competent jurisdiction.Let’s Do It!
