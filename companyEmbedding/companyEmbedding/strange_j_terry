In addition, Mr. Strange serves on the Board of Directors, Risk Committee and as Chairman of the Audit and Compliance Committee of BBVA Compass, a banking institution. Mr. Strange received his B.A. and M.B.A. in Accounting from the University of North Texas.
 
Mr. Strange was selected to serve on our Board due to his extensive background in public accounting, auditing, and risk management. His previous and current board positions on other publicly-traded companies have provided extensive years of audit committee experience, including as chair. His knowledge and experience with accounting practices, policies and rulemaking from his 34-year career at KPMG LLP, is especially important in his role as Chairman of the Audit Committee. The Board believes his experience and expertise in these matters make him well qualified to serve as a member of the Board. Mr. Strange qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert."
