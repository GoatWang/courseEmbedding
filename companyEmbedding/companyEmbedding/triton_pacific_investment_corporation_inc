Aggressive yet balanced approach.



Our PhilosophyA tailored approach to value creationThe principals of Triton Pacific believe there are attractive opportunities for equity investments in small and mid-size companies. We believe that many of these entrepreneurial companies become challenged in achieving the next stage of success. Often, this is caused by a need for additional expertise or a lack of capital to support growth initiatives.The principals of Triton Pacific, with their years of industry specific operating expertise can help companies achieve the next level of success by bringing capital coupled with a wealth of strategic, operating and financial expertise. Access to important customers, channel partners, suppliers and technology partnersAccess to our network of industry experts, operating executives and service providersGuidance on best practicesAccess to debt marketsWe are business builders, not asset managers.We selectively buy control in several entrepreneurial companies each year and do so only when we see tremendous potential to build an industry-leading business. It takes time and dedication to build great companies, not just capital. Hands on commitment to investments.
We spend significant time with each company in our portfolio, working from day one to put in place a strategy for accelerated growth. We utilize our proven Value Enhancement ProgramTM to guide overall strategic decisions towards long term value creation for all stakeholders. Partnership not just ownership.We partner with passionate management teams who are the architects of unique business models and that bring a track record of success. Many companies are poised for rapid growth and expansion, but require additional resources, insights, and experience necessary to flourish. Collaboration is the key ingredient to reaching our collective objectives.

Triton Pacific Investment Corporation





































































  Triton Pacific Investment Corporation (TPIC) is an externally managed investment company. TPIC’s objective is to generate growth and income by investing in private businesses.







 











Our portfolio will generally consist of privately owned businesses with a demonstrated track record, strong management, a differentiated business model, and high quality earnings.  Private companies are significant contributors to our country’s growth. However, many of these companies lack access to capital. In particular, the inefficiencies present in the lower middle market allow experienced investors the opportunity to generate attractive risk adjusted returns. By focusing on established private companies, we manage a balanced portfolio comprised of debt and equity securities that together seek to provide investors a balance of both GROWTH and INCOME. Private equity has long been the domain of large institutional and high net worth investors that use the asset class to diversify their portfolios and create an avenue for potential out performance relative to their annual return targets. In 1980, Congress created the BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940 that allows average investors direct access to private equity through a professionally managed and regulated entity. Historically, BDCs invested almost exclusively in debt securities. Triton Pacific Investment Corporation seeks to offer investors an opportunity to invest in core private equity by carefully constructing a portfolio of private debt, equity, and structured securities that can reduce risk while retaining upside potential. 

Private companies are significant contributors to our country’s growth. However, many of these entrepreneurial companies lack access to capital.

 











OUR INVESTMENT TEAMSince 2001, the principals of Triton Pacific Capital Partners, LLC (“Triton Pacific”) have offered private equity investments to individual investors through independent financial advisors. Having successfully raised and deployed over 50 private equity limited partnerships, the principals of TPIC’s adviser have deep domain knowledge and expertise in private equity investing. As a public reporting fund (BDC), TPIC seeks to further Democratize Access to Private Equity SM for individual investors.Our adviser and its affiliates have made investments in private companies with an enterprise value in excess of $500 million at time investment. TPIC is externally managed by Triton Pacific Adviser who maintains a broad network of relationships and has deep expertise in originating, structuring, executing, and managing private equity investments. TPIC’s adviser and sub-adviser manage more than $5 billion of debt and private equity investments.











INVESTMENT STRATEGY










 







PRIVATE EQUITYTPIC takes a unique approach to Private Equity investing, with a strategy that includes Buyouts, Structured Equity/Debt, and Mezzanine Debt investments in private companies. With flexibility to invest in equity and debt securities, TPIC is able to better match the risk/return profile of each investment. The following represent the types of investments we may make as part of a diversified portfolio.BuyoutInvestments in the purchase of all or a portion of the equity of a private company. This may be done in conjunction with management, operating partners, or other middle market private equity firms.Structured Equity/DebtThis unique security is structured as preferred equity or debt to reduce risk while also participating in meaningful upside opportunity.Mezzanine DebtDebt investments that typically provide a high cash interest rate, accrued interest, and typically some equity participation through warrants or other equity-like features.

Applicants' Representations
1. The Company, a Maryland corporation, is organized as a closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under section 54(a) of the Act. [1] 
           The Company's Objectives and Strategies[2] 
           are to maximize total return by generating current income from debt investments and long term capital appreciation from equity investments. The Company invests primarily in debt and equity investments in small and mid-sized private U.S. companies. The board of directors of the Company (for any Regulated Fund, the “Board”) is comprised of five members, three of whom are not “interested persons” as defined in section 2(a)(19) of the Act (“Independent Directors”). Craig Faggen (the “Principal”) serves as a director on the Company's Board and as the Company's chief executive officer. The Principal controls TPG, TPCP, and the BDC Adviser.
2. The Existing Affiliated Private Funds are parallel funds. Fund IV is a Delaware limited partnership and Platinum IV is a Delaware limited liability company. Each Existing Affiliated Private Fund would be an investment company but for section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Act. The investment strategy of each Existing Affiliated Private Fund is to generate current income and capital appreciation by investing in small and mid-sized private U.S. companies. The Existing Affiliated Private Funds and the Company have similar investment strategies.
3. The BDC Adviser, a Delaware limited liability company, is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the “Advisers Act”). The BDC Adviser serves as investment adviser to the Company and the Existing Affiliated Private Funds.
4. The Fund Manager, a Delaware limited liability company, is the general partner of the Existing Affiliated Private Funds. TPCP, a California limited liability company, is the managing member of the Fund Manager. TPG, a California corporation, is the managing member of TPCP.
5. Applicants seek an order (“Order”) to permit one or more Regulated Funds[3] 
           and/or one or more Affiliated Private Funds[4] 
           to participate in the same investment opportunities through a proposed co-investment program (the “Co-Investment Program”) where such participation would otherwise be prohibited under section 57(a)(4) and rule 17d-1 by (a) co-investing with each other in securities issued by issuers in private placement transactions in which an Adviser negotiates terms in addition to price (“Co-Investment Program”);[5] 
           and (b) making additional investments in securities of such issuers, including through the exercise of warrants, conversion privileges, and other rights to purchase additional securities of the issuers (“Follow-On Investments”). “Co-Investment Transaction” means any transaction in which a Regulated Fund (or its Wholly-Owned Investment Sub, as defined below) participated together with one or more other Regulated Funds and/or one or more Affiliated Private Funds in reliance on the requested Order. “Potential Co-Investment Transaction” means any investment opportunity in which a Regulated Fund (or its Wholly-Owned Investment Sub) could not participate together with one or more other Regulated Funds and/or one or more Affiliated Private Funds without obtaining and relying on the Order.[6] 

6. Applicants state that a Regulated Fund may, from time to time, form one or more Wholly-Owned Investment Subs.[7] 
           Such a subsidiary would be prohibited from investing in a Co-Investment Transaction with any other Regulated Fund or Affiliated Private Fund because it would be a company controlled by its parent Regulated Fund for purposes of section 57(a)(4) and rule 17d-1. Applicants request that each Wholly-Owned Investment Sub be permitted to participate in Co-Investment Transactions in lieu of its parent Regulated Fund and that the Wholly-Owned Investment Sub's participation in any such transaction be treated, for purposes of the Order, as though the parent Regulated Fund were participating directly. Applicants represent that this treatment is justified because a Wholly-Owned Investment Sub would have no purpose other than serving as a holding vehicle for the Regulated Fund's investments and, therefore, no conflicts of interest could arise between the Regulated Fund and the Wholly-Owned Investment Sub. The Regulated Fund's Board would make all relevant determinations under the conditions with regard to a Wholly-Owned Investment Sub's participation in a Co-Investment Transaction, and the Regulated Fund's Board would be informed of, and take into consideration, any proposed use of a Wholly-Owned Investment Sub in the Regulated Fund's place. If the Regulated Fund proposes to participate in the same Co-Investment Transaction with any of its Wholly-Owned Investment Subs, the Board of the Regulated Fund will also be informed of, and take into consideration, the relative participation of the Regulated Fund and the Wholly-Owned Investment Sub.
7. When considering Potential Co-Investment Transactions for any Regulated Fund, the Adviser will consider only the Objectives and Strategies, investment policies, investment positions, capital available for investment (“Available Capital”), and other pertinent factors applicable to that Regulated Fund.[8] 
           The Adviser Start Printed Page 60728expects that any portfolio company that is an appropriate investment for a Regulated Fund should also be an appropriate investment for one or more other Regulated Funds and/or one or more Affiliated Private Funds, with certain exceptions based on Available Capital or diversification.[9] 

8. Other than pro rata dispositions and Follow-On Investments as provided in conditions 7 and 8, and after making the determinations required in conditions 1 and 2(a), the Adviser will present each Potential Co-Investment Transaction and the proposed allocation to the directors of the Board eligible to vote under section 57(o) of the Act (“Eligible Directors”), and the “required majority,” as defined in section 57(o) of the Act (“Required Majority”)[10] 
           will approve each Co-Investment Transaction prior to any investment by the participating Regulated Fund.
9. With respect to the pro rata dispositions and Follow-On Investments provided in conditions 7 and 8, a Regulated Fund may participate in a pro rata disposition or Follow-On Investment without obtaining prior approval of the Required Majority if, among other things: (i) The proposed participation of each Regulated Fund and Affiliated Private Fund in such disposition or Follow-On Investment is proportionate to its outstanding investments in the issuer immediately preceding the disposition or Follow-On Investment, as the case may be; and (ii) the Board of the Regulated Fund has approved that Regulated Fund's participation in pro rata dispositions and Follow-On Investments as being in the best interests of the Regulated Fund. If the Board does not so approve, any such disposition or Follow-On Investment will be submitted to the Regulated Fund's Eligible Directors. The Board of any Regulated Fund may at any time rescind, suspend or qualify its approval of pro rata dispositions and Follow-On Investments with the result that all dispositions and/or Follow-On Investments must be submitted to the Eligible Directors.
10. No Independent Director of a Regulated Fund will have a direct or indirect financial interest in any Co-Investment Transaction, other than through share ownership in one of the Regulated Funds, including any interest in securities of a company whose securities are acquired in the Co-Investment Transaction.
11. Under condition 14, if an Adviser, the Principal, any person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Adviser or the Principal, and the Affiliated Private Funds (collectively, the “Holders”) own in the aggregate more than 25% of the outstanding voting securities of the Company or another a Regulated Fund (“Shares”), then the Holders will vote such Shares as directed by an independent third party when voting on matters specified in the condition. Applicants believe that this condition will ensure that the Independent Directors will act independently in evaluating the Co-Investment Program, because the ability of an Adviser or the Principal to influence the Independent Directors by a suggestion, explicit or implied, that the Independent Directors can be removed will be limited significantly. Applicants represent that the Independent Directors will evaluate and approve any such voting trust or proxy adviser, taking into accounts its qualifications, reputation for independence, cost to the shareholders, and other factors that they deem relevant.
Applicants' Legal Analysis
1. Section 57(a)(4) of the Act prohibits certain affiliated persons of a BDC from participating in joint transactions with the BDC or a company controlled by a BDC in contravention of rules as prescribed by the Commission. Under section 57(b)(2) of the Act, any person who is directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with a BDC is subject to section 57(a)(4). Applicants submit that each of the Regulated Funds and Affiliated Private Funds could be deemed to be a person related to each Regulated Fund in a manner described by section 57(b) by virtue of being under common control. Section 57(i) of the Act provides that, until the Commission prescribes rules under section 57(a)(4), the Commission's rules under section 17(d) of the Act applicable to registered closed-end investment companies will be deemed to apply to transactions subject to section 57(a)(4). Because the Commission has not adopted any rules under section 57(a)(4), rule 17d-1 also applies to joint transactions with Regulated Funds that are BDCs. Section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act are applicable to Regulated Funds that are registered closed-end investment companies.
2. Section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act prohibit affiliated persons of a registered investment company from participating in joint transactions with the company unless the Commission has granted an order permitting such transactions. In passing upon applications under rule 17d-1, the Commission considers whether the company's participation in the joint transaction is consistent with the provisions, policies, and purposes of the Act and the extent to which such participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants.
3. Applicants state that in the absence of the requested relief, the Regulated Funds would be, in some circumstances, limited in their ability to participate in attractive and appropriate investment opportunities. Applicants believe that the proposed terms and conditions will ensure that the Co-Investment Transactions are consistent with the protection of each Regulated Fund's shareholders and with the purposes intended by the policies and provisions of the Act. Applicants state that the Regulated Funds' participation in the Co-Investment Transactions will be consistent with the provisions, policies, and purposes of the Act and on a basis that is not different from or less advantageous than that of other participants.
Applicants' Conditions
Applicants agree that any Order granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions:
1. Each time an Adviser considers a Potential Co-Investment Transaction for the Affiliated Private Funds or another Regulated Fund that falls within a Regulated Fund's then-current Objectives and Strategies, the Adviser will make an independent determination of the appropriateness of the investment for the Regulated Fund in light of the Regulated Fund's then-current circumstances.
2. (a) If the Adviser deems a Regulated Fund's participation in any Potential Co-Investment Transaction to be appropriate for the Regulated Fund, the Adviser will then determine an appropriate level of investment for the Regulated Fund.
(b) If the aggregate amount recommended by the applicable Adviser to be invested by the applicable Regulated Fund in the Potential Co-Investment Transaction, together with the amount proposed to be invested by Start Printed Page 60729the other participating Regulated Funds and Affiliated Private Funds, collectively in the same transaction, exceeds the amount of the investment opportunity, the investment opportunity will be allocated among them pro rata based on each participating party's Available Capital, up to the amount proposed to be invested by each. The applicable Adviser will provide the Eligible Directors of each participating Regulated Fund with information concerning each participating party's Available Capital to assist the Eligible Directors with their review of the Regulated Fund's investments for compliance with these allocation procedures.
(c) After making the determinations required in conditions 1 and 2(a), the applicable Adviser will distribute written information concerning the Potential Co-Investment Transaction (including the amount proposed to be invested by each participating Regulated Fund and the Affiliated Private Funds) to the Eligible Directors of each participating Regulated Fund for their consideration. A Regulated Fund will co-invest with one or more Regulated Funds and/or one or more Affiliated Private Funds only if, prior to the Regulated Fund's participation in the Potential Co-Investment Transaction, a Required Majority concludes that:
(i) the terms of the Potential Co-Investment Transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to the Regulated Fund and its shareholders and do not involve overreaching in respect of the Regulated Fund or its shareholders on the part of any person concerned;
(ii) the Potential Co-Investment Transaction is consistent with:
(A) the interests of the shareholders of the Regulated Fund; and
(B) the Regulated Fund's then-current Objectives and Strategies;
(iii) the investment by other Regulated Funds or the Affiliated Private Funds would not disadvantage the Regulated Fund, and participation by the Regulated Fund would not be on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other Regulated Funds or the Affiliated Private Funds; provided that, if any other Regulated Fund or the Affiliated Private Funds, but not the Regulated Fund itself, gains the right to nominate a director for election to a portfolio company's board of directors or the right to have a board observer or any similar right to participate in the governance or management of the portfolio company, such event will not be interpreted to prohibit the Required Majority from reaching the conclusions required by this condition (2)(c)(iii), if:
(A) the Eligible Directors will have the right to ratify the selection of such director or board observer, if any;
(B) the Adviser agrees to, and does, provide, periodic reports to the Regulated Fund's Board with respect to the actions of the director or the information received by the board observer or obtained through the exercise of any similar right to participate in the governance or management of the portfolio company; and
(C) any fees or other compensation that the Affiliated Private Funds or any Regulated Fund or any affiliated person of the Affiliated Private Funds or any Regulated Fund receives in connection with the right of the Affiliated Private Funds or the Regulated Fund to nominate a director or appoint a board observer or otherwise to participate in the governance or management of the portfolio company will be shared proportionately among the participating Affiliated Private Funds (who each may, in turn, share its portion with its affiliated persons) and the participating Regulated Funds in accordance with the amount of each party's investment; and
(iv) the proposed investment by the Regulated Fund will not benefit the Advisers, the Affiliated Private Funds or the other Regulated Funds or any affiliated person of any of them (other than the parties to the Co-Investment Transaction), except (A) to the extent permitted by condition 13, (B) to the extent permitted by section 17(e) or 57(k) of the Act, as applicable, (C) indirectly, as a result of an interest in the securities issued by one of the parties to the Co-Investment Transaction, or (D) in the case of fees or other compensation described in condition 2(c)(iii)(C).
3. Each Regulated Fund has the right to decline to participate in any Potential Co-Investment Transaction or to invest less than the amount proposed.
4. The applicable Adviser will present to each Regulated Fund's Board, on a quarterly basis, a record of all investments in Potential Co-Investment Transactions made by any of the other Regulated Funds or the Affiliated Private Funds during the preceding quarter that fell within the Regulated Fund's then-current Objectives and Strategies that were not made available to the Regulated Fund, and an explanation of why the investment opportunities were not offered to the Regulated Fund. All information presented to the Regulated Fund's Board pursuant to this condition will be kept for the life of the Regulated Fund and at least two years thereafter, and will be subject to examination by the Commission and its staff.
5. Except for Follow-On Investments made in accordance with condition 8,[11] 
           a Regulated Fund will not invest in reliance on the Order in any issuer in which another Regulated Fund or Affiliated Private Fund or any affiliated person of another Regulated Fund or Affiliated Private Fund is an existing investor.
6. A Regulated Fund will not participate in any Potential Co-Investment Transaction unless the terms, conditions, price, class of securities to be purchased, settlement date, and registration rights will be the same for each participating Regulated Fund and Affiliated Private Fund. The grant to any Affiliated Private Fund or another Regulated Fund, but not the Regulated Fund, of the right to nominate a director for election to a portfolio company's board of directors, the right to have an observer on the board of directors or similar rights to participate in the governance or management of the portfolio company will not be interpreted so as to violate this condition 6, if conditions 2(c)(iii)(A), (B) and (C) are met.
7. (a) If any Affiliated Private Fund or any Regulated Fund elects to sell, exchange or otherwise dispose of an interest in a security that was acquired in a Co-Investment Transaction, the applicable Advisers will:
(i) notify each Regulated Fund that participated in the Co-Investment Transaction of the proposed disposition at the earliest practical time; and
(ii) formulate a recommendation as to participation by each Regulated Fund in the disposition.
(b) Each Regulated Fund will have the right to participate in such disposition on a proportionate basis, at the same price and on the same terms and conditions as those applicable to the participating Affiliated Private Funds and Regulated Funds.
(c) A Regulated Fund may participate in such disposition without obtaining prior approval of the Required Majority if: (i) The proposed participation of each Regulated Fund and each Affiliated Private Fund in such disposition is proportionate to its outstanding investments in the issuer immediately preceding the disposition; (ii) the Regulated Fund's Board has approved as being in the best interests of the Regulated Fund the ability to participate in such dispositions on a pro rata basis Start Printed Page 60730(as described in greater detail in the application); and (iii) the Regulated Fund's Board is provided on a quarterly basis with a list of all dispositions made in accordance with this condition. In all other cases, the Adviser will provide its written recommendation as to the Regulated Fund's participation to the Eligible Directors, and the Regulated Fund will participate in such disposition solely to the extent that a Required Majority determines that it is in the Regulated Fund's best interests.
(d) Each Affiliated Private Fund and each Regulated Fund will bear their own expenses in connection with any such disposition.
8. (a) If any Affiliated Private Fund or any Regulated Fund desires to make a Follow-On Investment in a portfolio company whose securities were acquired in a Co-Investment Transaction, the applicable Advisers will:
(i) notify each Regulated Fund that participated in the Co-Investment Transaction of the proposed transaction at the earliest practical time; and
(ii) formulate a recommendation as to the proposed participation, including the amount of the proposed Follow-On Investment, by each Regulated Fund.
(b) A Regulated Fund may participate in such Follow-On Investment without obtaining prior approval of the Required Majority if: (i) The proposed participation of each Regulated Fund and each Affiliated Private Fund in such investment is proportionate to its outstanding investments in the issuer immediately preceding the Follow-On Investment; and (ii) the Regulated Fund's Board has approved as being in the best interests of the Regulated Fund the ability to participate in Follow-On Investments on a pro rata basis (as described in greater detail in the application). In all other cases, the Adviser will provide its written recommendation as to the Regulated Fund's participation to the Eligible Directors, and the Regulated Fund will participate in such Follow-On Investment solely to the extent that a Required Majority determines that it is in the Regulated Fund's best interests.
(c) If, with respect to any Follow-On Investment:
(i) the amount of the opportunity is not based on the Regulated Funds' and the Affiliated Private Funds' outstanding investments immediately preceding the Follow-On Investment; and
(ii) the aggregate amount recommended by the applicable Adviser to be invested by each Regulated Fund in the Follow-On Investment, together with the amount proposed to be invested by the participating Affiliated Private Funds in the same transaction, exceeds the amount of the opportunity, then the amount invested by each such party will be allocated among them pro rata based on each party's Available Capital, up to the amount proposed to be invested by each.
(d) The acquisition of Follow-On Investments as permitted by this condition will be considered a Co-Investment Transaction for all purposes and subject to the other conditions set forth in the application.
9. The Independent Directors of each Regulated Fund will be provided quarterly for review all information concerning Potential Co-Investment Transactions and Co-Investment Transactions, including investments made by other Regulated Funds or the Affiliated Private Funds that the Regulated Fund considered but declined to participate in, so that the Independent Directors may determine whether all investments made during the preceding quarter, including investments that the Regulated Fund considered but declined to participate in, comply with the conditions of the Order. In addition, the Independent Directors will consider at least annually the continued appropriateness for the Regulated Fund of participating in new and existing Co-Investment Transactions.
10. Each Regulated Fund will maintain the records required by section 57(f)(3) of the Act as if each of the Regulated Funds were a BDC and each of the investments permitted under these conditions were approved by the Required Majority under section 57(f).
11. No Independent Director of a Regulated Fund will also be a director, general partner, managing member or principal, or otherwise an “affiliated person” (as defined in the Act), of any of the Affiliated Private Funds.
12. The expenses, if any, associated with acquiring, holding or disposing of any securities acquired in a Co-Investment Transaction (including, without limitation, the expenses of the distribution of any such securities registered for sale under the Securities Act) will, to the extent not payable by the Advisers under their investment advisory agreements with the Regulated Funds and the Affiliated Private Funds, be shared by the Regulated Funds and the Affiliated Private Funds in proportion to the relative amounts of the securities held or be acquired or disposed of, as the case may be.
13. Any transaction fee (including break-up or commitment fees but excluding broker's fees contemplated by section 17(e) or 57(k) of the Act, as applicable) received in connection with a Co-Investment Transaction will be distributed to the participating Regulated Funds and the Affiliated Private Funds on a pro rata basis based on the amounts they invested or committed, as the case may be, in such Co-Investment Transaction. If any transaction fee is to be held by an Adviser pending consummation of the transaction, the fee will be deposited into an account maintained by the Adviser at a bank or banks having the qualifications prescribed in section 26(a)(1) of the Act, and the account will earn a competitive rate of interest that will also be divided pro rata among the participating Regulated Funds and the Affiliated Private Funds based on the amounts they invest in such Co-Investment Transaction. None of the Affiliated Private Funds, the Advisers, the other Regulated Funds, or any affiliated person of the Regulated Funds or the Affiliated Private Funds will receive additional compensation or remuneration of any kind as a result of or in connection with a Co-Investment Transaction (other than (a) in the case of the Regulated Funds and the Affiliated Private Funds, the pro rata transaction fees described above and fees or other compensation described in condition 2(c)(iii)(C) and (b) in the case of an Adviser, investment advisory fees paid in accordance with the respective agreements between the Adviser and the Regulated Funds or the Affiliated Private Funds).
14. If the Holders own in the aggregate more than 25% of the outstanding Shares of a Regulated Fund, then the Holders will vote such Shares as directed by an independent third party (such as the trustee of a voting trust or a proxy adviser) when voting on (1) the election of directors; (2) the removal of one or more directors; or (3) any matters requiring approval by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities, as defined in section 2(a)(42) of the Act.
