Albert & Margaret Alkek Foundation







































Albert 
                    B. Alkek created a living legacy in the wording of his last 
                    will and testament. In it, he laid out a road map that created 
                    the Albert and Margaret Alkek Foundation. Upon his death, 
                    in 1995, the Foundation took up the work to which Mr. Alkek 
                    and his family had devoted considerable thought, energy and 
                    wealth. The Foundation continues to provide support for charitable, 
                    religious, scientific (primarily medical), cultural and educational 
                    organizations and programs serving the people of the state 
                    of Texas. 
The 
                    majority of the Foundation’s grants reflect Mr. Alkek’s 
                    preferences for research 
                    and education-related projects that will pay lasting dividends 
                    in terms of new discoveries and improved quality of life. 
                    Additional grants reflect the Alkek family’s strong 
                    community involvement, both in Houston and throughout the 
                    state.

Background


Top of Page





                            Established in 1995 in TX - Founded by Albert B. and Margaret Alkek. Mr. Alkek spent 17 years working for Pierce Petroleum until it was bought by the Sinclair Oil Corporation in 1948. His new boss, Harry Sinclair, helped him form his own oil company, the Sinclair Alkek Company. Together, the two men built Texas's first petroleum products pipeline. Mr. Alkek created a living legacy in the wording of his last will and testament. In it, he laid out a road map that created the Albert and Margaret Alkek Foundation. Upon his death, in 1995, the foundation took up the work to which Mr. Alkek and his family had devoted considerable thought, energy and wealth. The foundation continues to provide support for charitable, religious, scientific (primarily medical), cultural and educational organizations and programs serving the people of the state of Texas. The majority of the foundation’s grants reflect Mr. Alkek’s preferences for research and education-related projects that will pay lasting dividends in terms of new discoveries and improved quality of life. Additional grants reflect the Alkek family’s strong community involvement, both in Houston and throughout the state.

Albert & Margaret Alkek Foundation - Grant Guidelines









 

 





















 




ALBERT AND MARGARET ALKEK FOUNDATION 
                    
                    GRANT APPLICATION GUIDELINES
The Albert and Margaret Alkek Foundation was established to provide support for charitable, religious, scientific, literary and educational organizations and programs serving the people of the State of Texas. 
Eligibility 


•
Grants are made only to nonprofit organizations  that are recognized as public charities by the Internal Revenue Service.


•
Grants are limited to organizations and projects  serving the State of Texas. 


•
The Foundation does not make grants to  individuals or loans of any type.


•
The Foundation does not make direct scholarships  to students. All scholarship programs are administered through educational  institutions.


•
The Foundation does not make grants intended to  influence legislation or to support candidates for political office.



                  Application Process
 
The funding available for unsolicited grants is very limited and to conserve an applicant�s time and resources, the Foundation asks that qualified applicants submit a brief letter of inquiry instead of a fully developed proposal or an application form.
 The one to two-page letter of inquiry should include brief descriptions of your organization and the project for which funds are being considered.  It should also state the amount of funding needed in total as well as the amount being requested from the Foundation. 
The applicant may include brochures or other materials available at hand, describing the organization or proposal in greater detail.  Please do not include tax returns, detailed budget packages or financial statements with your submission.
The Foundation will use your letter of inquiry to determine the possibility of support. If the Foundation is interested in learning more about your organization and its project, you will be contacted for additional information and documentation.
The Foundation accepts grant requests throughout the year and has no deadlines for submitted requests.
The Foundation prefers not to fund: 


•
Fund-raising events, advertising in programs, memorials  for individuals or other similar activities


•
Student organizations or charities operated by  service clubs


•
The purchase of uniforms, equipment, or trips  for school-related organizations or sports teams


As a rule, the Foundation will usually consider only one application from an organization within a twelve-month period. Subsequent proposals from organizations previously funded by the Foundation will not be considered until a full report of the previous grant has been submitted.
Inquiries should be sent (via the US Postal Service) to the address below. No facsimile or e-mail applications will be accepted.

Margaret M. Alkek, an acclaimed philanthropist and arts patron
whose generosity of spirit set the tone for charitable giving in
Houston and across the state, passed away peacefully in the
presence of family and friends on Thursday afternoon, the March 24,
2005.


The daughter of Charles and Letyr Knight McFarland, she was born
on Feb. 23, 1916, in Houston and graduated from San Jacinto High
School in 1933. She attended the University of Texas at Austin,
where dashing young oilman Albert B. Alkek of Victoria courted her
by swooping his airplane low over her dormitory, to the delight of
her classmates. By 1934, Margaret and Albert Alkek were
married.










From the earliest days of their 61-year marriage, Mrs. Alkek
worked side by side with her husband to build a successful
business. He made the deals and she kept the company's books and
inventory. The couple later diversified their business interests
and established residences in both Bandera and Houston.
Mrs. Alkek brought to her marriage a solid appreciation for
family life and public service. She was a member of a number of
genealogical lineage societies and keenly appreciated her own
family's history and that of her hometown and state. She also
enjoyed reading, dancing, and visiting with friends. Education was
important to Mrs. Alkek, who returned to college in the late 1940's
and graduated with honors from Victoria College in 1951.
Even as a young wife and mother in Victoria, she was active in
the League of Women Voters and a member of the "Pink Ladies," the
Hospital Auxiliary for Victoria's Citizens Memorial Hospital. She
began this work with her mother and continued volunteering with her
daughter, Margaret Alkek Williams.
This community service was complemented by generous
contributions. The Alkeks shared their financial success with the
philanthropic world, giving more than $50 million to programs that
advanced medicine and education. At Mr. Alkek's death in 1995, Mrs.
Alkek became chairman of the newly formed Albert and Margaret Alkek
Foundation.
Mrs. Alkek devoted her time and resources to many nonprofit
organizations that were close to her heart. The Houston Ballet
Foundation, Houston Grand Opera, the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston,
and the Moores School of Music at the University of Houston were
among the arts programs she favored. Educational and community
programs included Delta Delta Delta, the Kronkosky Library of
Bandera County, the University of Houston System, and St.
Christopher's Episcopal Church in Bandera. Mrs. Alkek established
scholarships at Texas State University-San Marcos, the University
of Houston-Victoria, Northwood University, and the Texas Military
Institute. She also was a tremendous advocate for medical programs
such as the Cancer League, the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of
America, the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston,
and the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, home of
the Albert B. and Margaret M. Alkek Hospital.
At Baylor College of Medicine, the Margaret M. and Albert B.
Alkek Building for the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, the
Alkek Tower, the Alkek Fountain, the Alkek Eye Center, the Margaret
M. and Albert B. Alkek Department of Medicine, and the Margaret M.
Alkek Distinguished Chair in Medicine honor Mrs. Alkek's
philanthropic vision.
As chairman of the board of the Albert and Margaret Alkek
Foundation, Mrs. Alkek personally oversaw the strategic investment
of more than $70 million in medical, educational, and cultural
programs, including a landmark $31.25 million to Baylor College of
Medicine in 1998. "It's thrilling to wake up and be able to do
something and be productive by helping in as many ways as you
possibly can," Mrs. Alkek said at the announcement of the Baylor
gift.
Over the years, Mrs. Alkek continued to be involved in her
community. Her friends admired her gracious enthusiasm for helping
others and her energetic support of their fundraising efforts as
well as her own. One of the greatest joys in her life was her
friends.
A long-standing member of the Episcopal Church, Mrs. Alkek
attended St. John The Divine in Houston and St. Christopher's in
Bandera.
Mrs. Alkek received many honors, including a 1996 Honorary
Doctor of Philosophy Degree from St. Mary's University. The
Huffington Center on Aging at Baylor College of Medicine recognized
her service on its board with the Spirit of Anne Morrow Lindbergh
Award in 1998. In 1999, Northwood University presented her its
Distinguished Women's Award. In 2000, she received the Maurice
Hirsch Award for Philanthropy from the National Society of Fund
Raising Executives. She received the first Women of Achievement
Award at the 2000 National Convention of Delta Delta Delta in
Washington, D.C.
Mrs. Alkek is survived by her daughter, Margaret Alkek Williams;
her grandson, Charles A. Williams, and his wife, Randa Duncan
Williams; and her great-grandson Harrison M. Williams; all of whom
will keep her name and kindness alive in perpetuity through the
family's commitment to help others.
Friends are cordially invited to a visitation with the family
from six until eight o'clock in the evening on Wednesday, March 30,
in the foyer and library of Geo. H. Lewis & Sons, 1010 Bering
Drive in Houston.
The funeral service will be conducted at two o'clock in the
afternoon on Thursday, March 31, in the Sanctuary of St. Luke's
United Methodist Church, 3471 Westheimer Road in Houston, with the
Rev. Laurens A. Hall of St. John The Divine Episcopal Church
officiating. Honored to serve as pallbearers include Dr. Bobby R.
Alford, James L. Daniel, Dan L. Duncan, Kenneth W. Hicks, Dr. Dan
B. Jones, Michael R. McDonald, Joseph H. Peck, Jr., and Scott B.
Seaman.
Immediately following the service, the family will attend a
private committal service at Memorial Oaks Cemetery in Houston.
For those who so desire, and because of the family's involvement
with a variety of organizations, memorials in Mrs. Alkek's name may
be directed to the charity of one's choice.
Arrangements in Houston are under the direction of Geo. H. Lewis
& Sons, 1010 Bering Drive, Houston, Texas, 77057,
713.789.3005.

Texas Medical Center Legacy Makers – The Alkek Foundation and Alkek Family


(L-R) Margaret Alkek Williams and Charles and Randa Williams were among the family honorees at the November 2013 Crystal Ball benefiting the Huffington Center on Aging at Baylor College of Medicine. photo by kim coffman
Forty years of support and funding to Baylor College of Medicine
When Albert B. Alkek passed away in 1995, The New York Times published an article describing him as an oilman and philanthropist whose $77 million donation helped expand the nation’s largest hospital complex. He was 85 years old. The family of “Mr. A”, as he was often called, continues this legacy of giving through the Albert and Margaret Alkek Foundation.
After four decades of charitable giving, the Alkek family continues to make an impact on the Texas Medical Center (TMC). Transformational gifts — beginning with Alkek’s donation of $25 million to Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) in 1988 and $30 million to MD Anderson in 1993 for the construction of the Albert B. and Margaret M. Alkek Hospital — have changed the face of philanthropy in the TMC and improved the lives of many.
In May of this year, Baylor College of Medicine recognized the Alkek Family’s 40 years of support and more than $100 million in grant funding. Funding by the Albert and Margaret Alkek Foundation has helped to establish BCM’s leading clinical programs in medicine and ophthalmology and to fund novel research centers focused on metagenomics and microbiome research and molecular discovery.
Yet BCM is only one of hundreds of institutions and nonprofits that have been blessed by the Alkek Foundation and family, and today, the next generations are carrying on the legacy.
Early Years 
Albert B. Alkek was born in Houston in 1909. Soon after his birth, the family moved to Victoria, where they were prominent in the ranching and grocery trades.
Alkek attended Victoria public schools and later transferred to Peacock Military Academy in San Antonio. He attended St. Mary’s University, but withdrew before completing his degree. Nevertheless, Alkek went on to have incredible success in the oil industry and in 1987, Forbes magazine estimated his net worth at $310 million.
During World War II, Alkek met his mentor, Harry F. Sinclair, founder and owner of Sinclair Oil Corp., and in 1942, he invited Sinclair to dinner. This gesture was the beginning of a partnership, which six years later led to the formation of the Sinclair-Alkek Oil Co. which built and operated the first products pipeline in Texas. In 1952, Sinclair sold his interest to Alkek, who continued to operate the company as the Alkek Oil Company.
At various points in his career, Alkek was the largest independent gasoline supplier in the state of Texas and the Southwest, and at one time was one of the most active individual traders on Wall Street, trading at an annual volume of $75 million in 1965.
Health and education were always important interests and, over time, Alkek began making large gifts to medical and educational institutions that reached out to him for support. In 1977, he became a trustee of BCM where he served 17 years. He served on the board of many other public and private companies and charitable institutions and received numerous awards and honors.
According to Scott Seaman, Executive Director of the Albert and Margaret Alkek Foundation, personal relationships were key to Alkek’s philanthropic philosophy. His friendship with the world-renowned Dr. Michael DeBakey led to his involvement with BCM and other institutions in the Texas Medical Center.
Noted Seaman, “Mr. Alkek was an astute businessman, and had an incredible memory; his mind was like an internal computer. He could run numbers in his head. Those fortunate enough to have met him, would remember his charismatic personality. I admired him for being a man of clear vision and determination. With decades of experience in personal philanthropy, he knew exactly how he wanted to establish his legacy.”
Margaret M. Alkek
Margaret M. Alkek, an acclaimed philanthropist and arts patron whose generosity of spirit set the tone for charitable giving in Houston, passed away March 24, 2005. “Mrs. Alkek was very gracious and thoughtful. She remembered personal details about people, and was incredibly kind,” Seaman said.
Mrs. Alkek was born Feb. 23, 1916, in Houston. She attended the University of Texas in Austin, where the dashing young oilman, Albert B. Alkek, courted her — to the delight of her classmates — by swooping his airplane low over her dormitory. By 1934, the couple was married.
From the earliest days of their 61-year marriage, Mrs. Alkek worked with her husband to build a successful business. He made the deals and she kept the books. The couple later diversified their business interests and established residences in both Bandera and Houston.
Mrs. Alkek had a solid appreciation for family life and public service. Even as a young wife and mother, she was active in numerous organizations and societies. Her community service was complemented by her generous contributions. With Alkek’s death in 1995, Mrs. Alkek became chairman of the newly formed Albert and Margaret Alkek Foundation.
Mrs. Alkek devoted her time and resources to many nonprofit organizations close to her heart, which included Houston’s arts community, libraries, churches, numerous educational institutions, and the medical community.
“My mother and I were always very close, but after my father passed away we grew even more connected. She lost my father, but never lost her drive to be of service to her community,” said her daughter, Margaret Alkek Williams.
 
Albert and Margaret Alkek Foundation
“The Foundation was started by my grandfather,” said Charles Williams, President of the Albert and Margaret Alkek Foundation. “It was created by his will and was a direct result of his life as a businessman. He was a wildcatter, a stock trader and an entrepreneur, but he started out with nothing.”
He continued, “In 1988, when he donated $25 million to BCM, it was the largest individual charitable donation that had ever been made to the Texas Medical Center. It was also the first time one of his donations had received media coverage. My grandfather saw the impact it had and this donation became a springboard with regard to his charitable giving. Up until that point, he had been very private.”
To implement his philanthropic vision, Alkek selected 11 executors of his will to serve as the Foundation’s original directors. “Mr. Alkek charged us with establishing the Albert and Margaret Alkek.
Dr. Paul Klotman, president of Baylor College of Medicine, honors Margaret Alkek Williams for her family’s support of BCM.
