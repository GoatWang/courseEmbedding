               Company: Ravinia Festival
Job Details
               In 1904, the A.C. Frost Company created Ravinia as an amusement park intended to lure riders to the fledgling Chicago & Milwaukee Electric Railroad. The amusement park boasted a baseball diamond, electric fountain and refectory or casino building with dining rooms and a dance floor. The prairie-style Martin Theatre (then called Ravinia Theatre) is the only building on the grounds that dates back to that original construction. Over 100 years later, Ravinia Festival is the oldest outdoor music festival in North America and is lauded for presenting world-class music. The festival attracts about 600,000 listeners to some 120 to 150 events that span all genres from classical music to jazz to music theater over each three-month summer season. Over the years, the festival has hosted such luminaries as Louis Armstrong, The Ballet Russe, Luciano Berio, Leonard Bernstein, Lucrezia Bori, Dave Brubeck, Pablo Casals, Van Cliburn, Aaron Copland, Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald, George Gershwin, José Greco, Jascha Heifetz, John Houseman, Janis Joplin, Yo-Yo Ma, Luciano Pavarotti, Itzhak Perlman, Oscar Peterson, Stephen Sondheim, Isaac Stern and Frank Zappa. In 1905, Walter Damrosch leads the New York Symphony Society. The first piece ever played at the park was "Bill Bailey, Won't You Please Come Home" on a steam calliope. Soon after, Walter Damrosch brought the New York Philharmonic to the open-air pavilion, which also saw dance productions by Ruth Page and Ted Shawn. This mix of popular diversions and music performances was not sufficient to keep the railroad afloat, and in 1910 the first incarnation of Ravinia Park came to an end, and the property went into receivership. A group of North Shore residents, convinced the high quality of presentations should continue, purchased the park and founded The Ravinia Company under the leadership of philanthropist Louis Eckstein, who served as impresario and personally subsidized the organization for 20 years. With a gala reopening in 1911, Ravinia became primarily a summer venue for classical music. Opera was added to the concert programs in 1912, and by the end of the decade, Ravinia earned a reputation as America's summer opera capital. During Ravinia's "Golden Age" of opera, 1919 to 1931, Ravinia audiences heard the greatest singers in the world, including such luminaries as Edward Johnson, Giovanni Martinelli, Claudia Muzio, Rosa Raisa and Tito Schipa. In May 1949, the original wooden Pavilion burned to the ground. With the onset of the Great Depression, that Golden Age ended, and the woods fell silent for five years. Again, local businessmen came to the rescue by forming the Ravinia Festival Association, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to presenting music of the highest quality for less than cost. In 1936, Ravinia became the summer residence of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, which remains the centerpiece of the music festival today. In 1944, Eckstein's widow donated the 36-acre park to the Festival Association. In May 1949, the original wooden Pavilion burned to the ground. Six weeks later, the festival opened on schedule without missing a single performance under the shelter of a 33-ton canvas cover, which was originally designed to hangar B-29 bombers. After the season, construction began on a new Pavilion that doubled the audience capacity.

 Additional Information










Last Known ActivityMay 20, 1967
Operation Hickory was directed at reducing the combat strength and supporting infrastructure of North Vietnamese Army operating in and south of the DMZ. 2nd Battalion 3rd Marines boarded CH-46A Sea Knight helicopters on the USS Princeton to be inserted in the northeastern corner of the Hickory operating area. A few minutes later the choppers began to circle and gradually dropped elevation. Hotel made the opposed air assault into LZ Parrot, 8 kilometers north northeast of Con Thien (Hill 158), the opposition was strong enough so the LZ was closed to further landings until Hotel and supporting arms had secured the area. Just as soon as the chopper landed, we received small arms fire and mortar rounds. Most of the day was spent ferrying the Battalion and supplies the hill top LZ. This was the Marines first incursion into the DMZ. Hotel 1st Platoon moved toward its initial objective, a village to the north-northwest. The village was fortified and defended by what appeared to be a reinforced NVA platoon, supported by mortars and artillery firing from within the DMZ. Because it was the DMZ, we were instructed not to fire on the enemy, unless they fired first. Another stupid rule from the politicians state side. 1st Squad had point and my fire team had point for the platoon. LCpl Mike Sevard was point man, I was number two and PFC Mark Landers was third, we were short a man for the fire team. The platoon moved down the trail, as we came to the clearing next to a rice paddy, we found our first dead Marine from the day before. We would retrieve the body when we left the area. We continued for about 100 yards across the clearing next to the rice paddy. All hell broke out, the platoon was in an L-shaped ambush, long leg was across the paddy from us was shooting along our line of march and a machine nest was on the short leg shooting down our length. I jumped behind a bush, about three high and three feet around. I began firing my M-16 at the enemy across the paddy. The calls for Corpsman was coming from everywhere behind me. I glanced forward to find LCpl Sevard, he was no where to be seen. Continuing firing I glanced behind me and saw PFC Mark Landers lying dead in the open area. He had been killed immediately by a sniper. I could hear our M60 machine gun start and then stop, this happened several times. We were having trouble gaining fire superiority. I learned later two machine gunners were killed by NVA snipers and two gunners wounded. Then I was knocked backward to the ground. I was hit, I crawled behind the bush and saw blood soaking the front of my shirt. I called for Corpsman, then realized that was not going to happen. I reach around to my back and found a hole and blood with my fingers. I pulled up the front of my shirt and found a round hole in my side about half way down. It was a bullet wound. I tied one battle dressing over the front bullet hole and the second over the back bullet hole. Only minutes had passed since being hit. I heard calls the platoon was falling back. I could envision F-4 fighters screaming in shortly, dropping napalm all over this area. I needed to get the hell out of here.
Later I found out we had 8 KIA and 17 WIA in the initial assault.
The 7 Marines and 1 Corpsman lost were;
