Louis G. Navellier, Chairman and Founder of Navellier & Associates, Inc., began publishing his quantitative analysis on growth stocks in 1980. In 1987 he started managing private accounts for high-net-worth individuals, and shortly thereafter for public plans, Taft-Hartley plans, corporate pension funds, endowments, and foundations.
Since that time, Navellier & Associates has guided thousands of investors and then later for institutions, such as public plans, Taft-Hartley plans, corporate pension funds, endowments, and foundations by applying its disciplined, quantitative investment process to a broad range of equity products. Every day, investors hire Navellier to manage their assets in a private account, mutual fund, or defensive portfolio.

Marketmail July 25

A weak U.S. dollar is good for multinational companies and exporters. Since the Presidential election, S&P 500 stocks with 50% or greater international sales rose 28.4%, while domestic stocks (with 90% or more of sales in the U.S.) were up just 12.8%. This trend will likely continue under President Trump. Read More

The above equity management portfolios are domiciled at brokerage firms or banks. Please contact your financial consultant for information.
We are excited to introduce you to Navellier's equity portfolios. Not only are these portfolios designed to outperform their respective stock market benchmarks, but we strive to achieve consistent returns without unnecessary volatility. Furthermore, when investors combine growth investing with value investing, they typically enjoy a significant decline in the volatility and risk associated with their overall stock portfolios. This is why we strongly encourage investors to "mix" our respective equity management portfolios with portfolios offered by other fine money managers.
Please seek the advice of a professional investment consultant who can evaluate your risk and return parameters and determine how to properly allocate your investment portfolio using these and other asset classes.
Investment in equity strategies involves substantial risk and has the potential for partial or complete loss of funds invested.
All of us at Navellier appreciate your interest in our firm and will strive to help you in any way with your equity investments.

Private Clients 







For more than 30 years, Louis Navellier has been helping individual investors like you achieve their financial goals. Navellier recently expanded its investing services to include innovative approaches to fixed income and balanced portfolio management through the Private Client Group.
The Private Client Group is an extension of Louis Navellier’s private family office where he honed his expertise in conservative fixed income and balanced portfolio management for his family for many years. We believe that we can offer an innovative approach to balanced portfolio management that is in great demand in the current market environment.
The objective of the Private Client Group is to better service qualified investors with (1) fixed income management, (2) covered call option writing to generate extra income, (3) innovative ETF management designed to protect portfolios as well as (4) Navellier’s traditional fundamental quantitative equity investment strategies. Navellier is an institutional manager that typically charges competitive fixed fees. The Private Client Group, which caters to qualified investors, also offers a popular fee alternative in the form of a 10% annual incentive fee (pursuant to SEC Rule 205-3) net of all brokerage/bank fees or commissions. In other words, qualified clients are only billed based on annual appreciation. With an incentive fee a new "high water" mark must be met every year, otherwise the client will not be charged any incentive fee.
Navellier will work with your financial adviser to create an asset allocation strategy designed to fit your specific investment goals.  

If you're already doing business with a full-service brokerage firm, contact your financial adviser and ask him/her to help you get started. Navellier does not take custody of assets. As a result, you must open an account with a brokerage firm. If you already have a brokerage account, chances are we can manage your account at that firm.
Navellier continues to offer managed account services (also known as private accounts and separately managed accounts) to high-net-worth individuals. Navellier’s Fundamental Growth portfolio, is available as a mutual fund through a sub-advisory relationship with Cavalier Funds.
In addition, we supply investors with a large selection of free tools and services. Our Marketmail e-newsletter keeps you informed about the stock market on a weekly basis, and our Stock Grader service instantly analyzes stocks for you - just type in a symbol, and get A, B, C, D, and F grades in a snap.You can also do this with ETFs using our ETF Grader. We are also excited about the recent launch of our free stock analysis tool, Dividend Grader.
And that's just the beginning. There's much more to see as Navellier & Associates continues to keep you abreast of the trends and timetables that affect your financial future. Take a look around!
For more information on our Private Client Group, and how we may be able to boost your interest and dividend income through our yield enhancement strategies, please contact Carol Whann at carolw@navellier.com or 775-785-2300.

Welcome to our Navellier Graders







Stock Grader
ETF Grader
Dividend Grader





What do the grades mean?
Our Stock Grader utilizes key fundamental metrics and weights them in an average to determine a grade of A to F.  "A" being our highest ranking persistence model which, as a group, tends to outperform the low persistence stocks, as well as the market in general. The final grade a stock receives ("Total Stock Grade") is based on its Navellier Proprietary Quantitative Grade and its Overall Fundamental Grade. Only those stocks that received both a top Quantitative Grade and a top Overall Fundamental Grade receive an "A".
Why Stocks?
Stocks can provide some of the safest earning potential in this volatile market.
How often is the data updated?
The stock data is updated weekly.
Navellier Stock Grader Growth of $100 Example
Net February 1, 1998 to June 30, 2017

The chart above reflects the theoretical historical total return of stocks assigned a letter rank of A, B, C, D and F using a combination of the proprietary Navellier Stock Grader Fundamental grade and Navellier Stock Grader Quantitative grade. Performance results presented herein do not necessarily indicate future performance. The net performance results portrayed include the reinvestment of all dividends and other earnings. Net results also include our estimation of investment advisory fees, administrative fees, transaction expenses, or other expenses that a client would have paid or actually paid. A 3.00% annualized advisory fee is built into the net return calculations although that fee is higher than any actual advisory fee currently clients are paying to Navellier & Associates, Inc. for investment advisory services. Investment in equity strategies involves substantial risk and has the potential for partial or complete loss of funds invested. Graphs are for illustrative and discussion purposes only. (Note, these are model results, no actual money was invested. Please see important disclosures below.)

Investment in equity strategies involves substantial risk and has the potential for partial or complete loss of funds invested. As a matter of normal and important disclosures to you, as a potential investor, please consider the following: The performance presented is not based on any actual securities trading, portfolio, or accounts, and the reported performance of the A, B, C, D, and F portfolios (collectively the “model portfolios”)  should be considered mere “paper” or pro forma performance results based on Navellier’s research.
Investors evaluating any of Navellier & Associates, Inc.’s, (or its affiliates’) Investment Products must not use any information presented here, including the performance figures of the model portfolios, in their evaluation of any Navellier Investment Products. Navellier Investment Products include the firm’s mutual funds and managed accounts. The model portfolios, charts and other information presented do not represent actual funded trades and are not actual funded portfolios. There are material differences between Navellier Investment Products’ portfolios and the model portfolios, research, and performance figures presented here. The model portfolios and the research results (1) may contain stocks or ETFs that are illiquid and difficult to trade; (2) may contain stock or ETF holdings materially different from actual funded Navellier Investment Product portfolios; (3) include the reinvestment of all dividends and other earnings, estimated trading costs, commissions, or management fees; and, (4) may not reflect prices obtained in an actual funded Navellier Investment Product portfolio. For these and other reasons, the reported performances of model portfolios do not reflect the performance results of Navellier’s actually funded and traded Investment Products. In most cases, Navellier’s Investment Products have materially lower performance results than the performances of the model portfolios presented.
As a matter of important disclosure regarding the model results presented for Stock Grader, ETF Grader, and Dividend Grader, the following factors must be considered when evaluating the long- and short-term performance figures presented:
(1) Historical or illustrated results presented herein do not necessarily indicate future performance; Investment in securities involves significant risk and has the potential for partial or complete loss of funds invested.
(2) The results presented were generated during a period of mixed (improving and deteriorating) economic conditions in the U.S. and positive and negative market performance. There can be no assurance that these favorable market conditions will occur again in the future. Navellier has no data regarding actual performance in different economic or market cycles or conditions.
(3) The back-tested performance was derived from the application of a model with the benefit of hindsight.
(4) The results portrayed reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other income.
(5) The net performance results portrayed include the reinvestment of all dividends and other earnings. Net results also include our estimation of investment advisory fees, administrative fees, transaction expenses, or other expenses that a client would have paid or actually paid. A 3.00% annualized advisory fee is built into the net return calculations although that fee is higher than any actual advisory fee currently clients are paying to Navellier & Associates, Inc. for investment advisory services.
(6) LIMITATIONS INHERENT IN MODEL RESULTS: The performance results presented are from a model portfolio, not an actually funded portfolio, and may not reflect the impact that material economic and market factors might have had on the adviser’s decision making if the adviser were actually managing clients’ money, and thus present returns which are greater than what a potential investor would have experienced for the time period. The results are presented for informational purposes only. No real money has been invested in this model portfolio. The model performance results should be considered mere ‘paper’ or pro forma performance results. The model results do not represent actual funded trades and may not reflect actual prices paid or received for actual funded trades.
(7) The model results may or may not relate, or only partially relate, to the type of advisory services currently offered by Navellier & Associates, Inc.
(8) In most cases, the adviser’s clients had investment results materially lower than the results portrayed in the model.



What do the grades mean?
The Navellier ETF grades are based on return/risk characteristics, of each individual ETF, ranked relative to its best fitting (highest R2) broad based Index.  Each week we compile and calculate statistics, Alpha, Beta, Standard Deviation, R-Squared for a list of over 1500 ETFs.  Using the respective 60 or 90 day cycle we calculate how an ETF has performed on a risk adjusted basis relative to its best fit broad market index.
The final grade for each ETF is based on its risk adjusted performance relative to the Russell 3000 index constituents.  An “A” Grade is assigned to ETFs that exhibit positive return/risk characteristics over the given cycle and an “F” Grade represents ETFs that have exhibited lesser/negative return/risk characteristics. These rankings can/will change weekly depending on market conditions and volatility.
Why ETFs?
Exchange traded funds are generally structured to hold a basket of securities and usually offer investors the ability to not only buy and hold an ETF position but also trade in and out of a position intra-day.
How often is the data updated?
The ETF data is updated weekly.

The chart above reflects the theoretical historical total return of stocks assigned a score of A, B, C, D, or F using key fundamental metrics.

Investment in equity strategies involves substantial risk and has the potential for partial or complete loss of funds invested. Graphs are for illustrative and discussion purposes only.

What do the grades mean?
Our NEW Dividend Grader utilizes key fundamental metrics and weights them in an average to determine a grade of A to F.  A being our highest ranking dividend persistence model which, as a group, tends to outperform the low persistence stocks, as well as the market in general. This grading system replaces the previous system where stocks were graded on a scale of 1 to 3.
Why Dividends?
Dividends can provide some of the safest earning potential in this volatile market.
How often is the data updated?
The dividend data is updated weekly.

Performance results presented herein do not necessarily indicate future performance. The net performance results portrayed include the reinvestment of all dividends and other earnings. Net results also include our estimation of investment advisory fees, administrative fees, transaction expenses, or other expenses that a client would have paid or actually paid. A 3.00% annualized advisory fee is built into the net return calculations although that fee is higher than any actual advisory fee currently clients are paying to Navellier & Associates, Inc. for investment advisory services. Investment in equity strategies involves substantial risk and has the potential for partial or complete loss of funds invested. Graphs are for illustrative and discussion purposes only. This graph is not to be construed as an offer to buy or sell any financial instrument and should not be relied upon as the sole factor in an investment making decision.  (Note, these are model results, no actual money was invested. Please see important disclosures below.)

Investment in equity strategies involves substantial risk and has the potential for partial or complete loss of funds invested. As a matter of normal and important disclosures to you, as a potential investor, please consider the following: The performance presented is not based on any actual securities trading, portfolio, or accounts, and the reported performance of the A, B, C, D, and F portfolios (collectively the “model portfolios”)  should be considered mere “paper” or pro forma performance results based on Navellier’s research.
Investors evaluating any of Navellier & Associates, Inc.’s, (or its affiliates’) Investment Products must not use any information presented here, including the performance figures of the model portfolios, in their evaluation of any Navellier Investment Products. Navellier Investment Products include the firm’s mutual funds and managed accounts. The model portfolios, charts and other information presented do not represent actual funded trades and are not actual funded portfolios. There are material differences between Navellier Investment Products’ portfolios and the model portfolios, research, and performance figures presented here. The model portfolios and the research results (1) may contain stocks or ETFs that are illiquid and difficult to trade; (2) may contain stock or ETF holdings materially different from actual funded Navellier Investment Product portfolios; (3) include the reinvestment of all dividends and other earnings, estimated trading costs, commissions, or management fees; and, (4) may not reflect prices obtained in an actual funded Navellier Investment Product portfolio. For these and other reasons, the reported performances of model portfolios do not reflect the performance results of Navellier’s actually funded and traded Investment Products. In most cases, Navellier’s Investment Products have materially lower performance results than the performances of the model portfolios presented.
As a matter of important disclosure regarding the model results presented for Stock Grader, ETF Grader, and Dividend Grader, the following factors must be considered when evaluating the long- and short-term performance figures presented:
(1) Historical or illustrated results presented herein do not necessarily indicate future performance; Investment in securities involves significant risk and has the potential for partial or complete loss of funds invested.
(2) The results presented were generated during a period of mixed (improving and deteriorating) economic conditions in the U.S. and positive and negative market performance. There can be no assurance that these favorable market conditions will occur again in the future. Navellier has no data regarding actual performance in different economic or market cycles or conditions.
(3) The back-tested performance was derived from the application of a model with the benefit of hindsight.
(4) The results portrayed reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other income.
(5) The net performance results portrayed include the reinvestment of all dividends and other earnings. Net results also include our estimation of investment advisory fees, administrative fees, transaction expenses, or other expenses that a client would have paid or actually paid. A 3.00% annualized advisory fee is built into the net return calculations although that fee is higher than any actual advisory fee currently clients are paying to Navellier & Associates, Inc. for investment advisory services.
(6) LIMITATIONS INHERENT IN MODEL RESULTS: The performance results presented are from a model portfolio, not an actually funded portfolio, and may not reflect the impact that material economic and market factors might have had on the adviser’s decision making if the adviser were actually managing clients’ money, and thus present returns which are greater than what a potential investor would have experienced for the time period. The results are presented for informational purposes only. No real money has been invested in this model portfolio. The model performance results should be considered mere ‘paper’ or pro forma performance results. The model results do not represent actual funded trades and may not reflect actual prices paid or received for actual funded trades.
(7) The model results may or may not relate, or only partially relate, to the type of advisory services currently offered by Navellier & Associates, Inc.
(8) In most cases, the adviser’s clients had investment results materially lower than the results portrayed in the model.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 09/14/2011
            

                BBB has determined that Navellier & Associates, Inc. meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.
