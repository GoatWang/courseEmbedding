The net proceeds from the sale of the shares of common stock offered by us will
be up to $485,000, afteran estimated $15,000 of expenses associated with the
cost of raising such funds which are already included in the General and
Admisitrative Expenses in footnotes below, based on a public offering price of
$0.25 per share.  All funds raised in the offering of our shares will
immediately be available to us.   In the event the Company raises less than 10%
or $50,000, the Management of the company has given a verbal commitment, to loan
the company up to $2,500 a month for six months.  Although the management has
made this commitment on a verbal basis there is currently no loan agreement nor
is there any enforcement mechanism to enforce the loan unto to the management of
the Company.  We must raise cash to implement our project and begin our
operations. If the maximum offering of $500,000 is complete, the Company
estimates the funds will last 12 months, however we will require additional
capital beyond the proceeds raised in this offering to reach growth objectives.

The following table below sets forth the uses of proceeds assuming the sale of
25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of the securities offered for sale in this offering by
the Company:

   such as vehicles ($50,000), routes ($25,000), and warehouse space/fixtures

   vehicles ($75,000), routes ($50,000), and warehouse space/fixtures ($75,000).

Any funds we raise from our offering of 2,000,000 shares of common stock will be
immediately available for our use and will not be returned to investors. We will
not maintain an escrow, trust, or similar account for the receipt of proceeds
from the sale of our shares. Accordingly, if we file for bankruptcy protection
or a petition for involuntary bankruptcy is filed by creditors against us, your
funds will become part of the bankruptcy estate and administered according to
the bankruptcy laws. If a creditor sues us and obtains a judgment against us,
the creditor could garnish the bank account and ta possession of the
subscriptions. If that happens, you will lose your investment and your funds
will be used to pay creditors.

HIDA is negotiating, but has not finalized terms yet, for assets such as
Established Delivery Routes, Vehicles, Sales Personnel, and Distribution
Agreements of other Packaged Food Brands which will increase its channels of
distribution after financing. HIDA has a Letter of Intent (LOI) to acquire
certain assets from a company called Pacific Pride Bakery Dist. in Van Nuys,
California. Pacific Pride is the “distribution” for third party bread brands
into retail and institutional accounts (i.e. schools and municipalities).

If necessary Fernando Oswaldo Leonzo, our Chairman & CEO has verbally agreed to
loan the company funds to cover the costs of our quarterly and annual reporting
and filing requirements, but we will require full funding to implement our 
complete plan of operation. Such loan would have no term, be payable upon 
demand and have no interest rate. In the event that our Offering fails Fernando
Oswaldo Leonzo, has agreed to continue providing us the use of our current 
office space, and access to telephone and internet service free charge. 
Additionally, if our Offering is unsuccessful, our CEO, Fernando Oswaldo Leonzo,
and our Treasurer, Robert Gunther, have verbally committed to continuing their 
roles as Officers without compensation until such time as the Company generates
sufficient revenues to warrant providing them with salaries.


As a distributor of Hispanic and Ethnic packaged food products the company
expects to have a portfolio of products that will not only include beverages.
The main competitors of the Company include Goya Foods, Marquez Brothers
International, Diaz Foods, La Fe Foods International, Grace Foods, as well as
other regional Ethnic Food Distributors. HIDA will focus on selecting brands of
All Natural packaged foods. Although some competitors are selling and
distributing similar products, they use different packaging options and in
particular foods that have high contents of artificial flavors, colors, and
sweeteners as well high sodium contents. For instance, our competitors import
the majority of the products they distribute which are made with lower price
point raw materials and quality.  The Company is currently working on adding
more products to distribute.  After signing a distribution Agreement with Gran
Nevada, HIDA is negotiating with Racor, LLC to distribute the Racor line of
products, including Tamal De Elote, Maranon, Horchata De Moro, and Cebada from
El Salvador in the United States.”  No distribution Agreement has been signed as
of this filing. The terms of such agreements will be disclosed once Distribution
Agreements are signed. Such products will be in other categories besides the
beverage space.  HIDA will focus on distributing products that focus on the all
natural nature of their ingredients as well as look to partner with brands that
can manufacture products closer to its U.S. market base.
