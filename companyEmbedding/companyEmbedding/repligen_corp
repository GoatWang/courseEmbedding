Business model[edit]
Prior to 2012, Repligen maintained dual capabilities in the development of pharmaceutical therapeutics (drug discovery and development) and the development of materials supporting biological drug manufacture (bioprocessing business).[5] A decision was made in 2012 to focus on the bioprocessing business and reduce research and development expenditures.[6] In the period of 2010 to 2013, the majority of sales by the company were concentrated in the single Protein A product line.[7]
Sales and revenue[edit]
Repligen employs a direct sales model to users of its products in the United States, with some sales through intermediaries in "certain foreign markets".[8] More than 80% of sales have been to customers in the United States and Sweden during the 2010-2013 period.[8] Long-term supply agreements have been established with major customers of the Protein A products, agreements which expire between 2016 and 2021 barring re-negotiation.[9]
As a result of royalty-generating out-licensing, royalty revenue from Bristol-Myers Squibb has been in the 27% to 37% range as a proportion of total revenue during the 2010-2013 period; in comparison to revenue from sales, the largest customer accounted for 35% to 45% of revenue during the same period.[4]
As a consequence of current operations, about one-third each of revenue and cost and expenses are denominated in Swedish krona currency, the remaining two-thirds denominated in United States dollars; this presents an element risk to the business based on unpredictable fluctuations in currency exchange rates.[10]
Intellectual property[edit]
The company's Protein A-related offerings are supported by proprietary technology, trade secrets and patent filings.[4] One patent was granted in April 2010 and has been extended so that it remains in effect until 2028.[4],[11] Patents are pending on elements of the OPUS chromatography product line,[4] and enabling technology has been licensed from BioFlash Partners.[7] Repligen retains an exclusive license to intellectual property owned by the University of Michigan in relation to the Orencia product divested to Bristol-Myers Squibb.[8],[12]
Facilities[edit]
Repligen's company headquarters are housed together with its manufacturing facility in Waltham, Massachusetts.[13]
Repligen maintains manufacturing facilities in Waltham, Massachusetts and Lund, Sweden.[2] Growth factor products and the native form of Protein A are manufactured in Sweden; recombinant forms of Protein A are manufactured in both the United States and Sweden; assembly of the OPUS chromatography product line is done in the United States.[9]
The lease on the main Waltham facility extends through 2023.[13] A second, smaller Waltham facility was leased through the end of 2012 and is now rented on a monthly basis.[14] In Lund, four buildings are under lease, three expiring in mid-2017 and the fourth extending to late 2019.[14]
Corporate history and governance[edit]
Alexander Rich was a co-founder of Repligen; in 2014 at the age of 87, Dr. Rich is "Chairman Emeritus".[15]of Repligen's Board of Directors. Dr. Rich had been a member of the Board since 1981.[16] Paul Schimmel is also a co-founder of Repligen; in 2014 at the age of 74, he is the Ernest and Jean Hahn Professor at The Skaggs Institute for Chemical Biology at The Scripps Research Institute. He used to be the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Professor of Biochemistry and Biophysics in the Department of Biology at MIT.
As of 2014[update], the company's President and Chief Executive Officer is Walter C. Herlihy.[15]
Acquisitions and in-licensing[edit]
In early 2010, Repligen licensed technology from BioFlash which it subsequently incorporated into the OPUS line of pre-packaged chromatography columns.[7]
In 2011, Repligen acquired bioproduction assets from Novozymes for $26.4 million, which doubled the company's bioprocessing capabilities.[5]
In December 2016 the company acquired TangenX for $39 million[17]
Divestments and out-licensing[edit]
In 2008, an agreement was struck to divest certain intellectual property rights to Bristol-Myers Squibb around the drug Orencia in exchange for ongoing royalty payments through the end of 2013.[5]
At the end of 2012, Repligen out-licensed its spinal muscular atrophy program, in particular the small molecule candidate drug RG3039, to Pfizer.[5] This divestment included licensing rights to two patents to Pfizer.[9],[18],[19]
At the start of 2014, the company out-licensed its Friedreich's ataxia program, including a library of histone deacetylase inhibitor compounds, to BioMarin Pharmaceutical for US$2,000,000 and future milestone and royalty payments.[2],[20]
Terminations and moth-balling[edit]
Development of an imaging agent, designated RG1068, based on a synthetic human hormone was halted in 2012 following a request by the USFDA for additional safety and efficacy data beyond that provided in a New Drug Application (NDA) submission; a Marketing Authorization Application had been submitted in parallel to the EMA.[2]

Products and services[edit]
Repligen is a major supplier of Protein A, both native and recombinant forms, to the pharmaceutical industry.[5] In 2010-2013, Protein A accounted for the majority of the company's product sales.[7] The company also provides growth factors to increase the productivity of cell-based bioproduction, multiple alternating tangential flow (ATF) systems, and a line (OPUS) of chromatography columns scaled to manufacture of product for testing in clinical trials.[5]
The OPUS product line contains a range of column sizes, the size and composition of which are dependent upon customer requirements, thus the full name of "Open Platform, User Specified".[6] The smaller sizes of columns depend upon proprietary technology licensed from BioFlash Partners, while the larger sizes are based on Repligen-developed proprietary technology.[7]

In 2011, Repligen acquired bioproduction assets from Novozymes for $26.4 million, which doubled the company's bioprocessing capabilities.[5]
In December 2016 the company acquired TangenX for $39 million[17]
Divestments and out-licensing[edit]
In 2008, an agreement was struck to divest certain intellectual property rights to Bristol-Myers Squibb around the drug Orencia in exchange for ongoing royalty payments through the end of 2013.[5]
At the end of 2012, Repligen out-licensed its spinal muscular atrophy program, in particular the small molecule candidate drug RG3039, to Pfizer.[5] This divestment included licensing rights to two patents to Pfizer.[9],[18],[19]
At the start of 2014, the company out-licensed its Friedreich's ataxia program, including a library of histone deacetylase inhibitor compounds, to BioMarin Pharmaceutical for US$2,000,000 and future milestone and royalty payments.[2],[20]
Terminations and moth-balling[edit]
Development of an imaging agent, designated RG1068, based on a synthetic human hormone was halted in 2012 following a request by the USFDA for additional safety and efficacy data beyond that provided in a New Drug Application (NDA) submission; a Marketing Authorization Application had been submitted in parallel to the EMA.[2]

Products and services[edit]
Repligen is a major supplier of Protein A, both native and recombinant forms, to the pharmaceutical industry.[5] In 2010-2013, Protein A accounted for the majority of the company's product sales.[7] The company also provides growth factors to increase the productivity of cell-based bioproduction, multiple alternating tangential flow (ATF) systems, and a line (OPUS) of chromatography columns scaled to manufacture of product for testing in clinical trials.[5]
The OPUS product line contains a range of column sizes, the size and composition of which are dependent upon customer requirements, thus the full name of "Open Platform, User Specified".[6] The smaller sizes of columns depend upon proprietary technology licensed from BioFlash Partners, while the larger sizes are based on Repligen-developed proprietary technology.[7]

					Full Description



Repligen Corporation, incorporated on May 29, 1981, is a bioprocessing company. The Company is focused on the development, manufacture and commercialization of products used to improve the interconnected phases of the biological drug manufacturing process. The Company's portfolio includes protein products, chromatography products, and filtration products. The Company's bioprocessing products are sold to life sciences companies, biopharmaceutical development companies and contract manufacturing organizations across the world. The Protein A ligands and growth factor products that the Company manufactures are components of chromatography resins and cell culture media, respectively.Protein ProductsThe Company is a provider of Protein A ligands, a component of Protein A chromatography resins (media) used in the purification of virtually all monoclonal antibody (mAb)-based drugs on the market or in development. The Company manufactures multiple forms of Protein A ligands. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had two manufacturing sites, one in Lund, Sweden and another in Waltham, Massachusetts.Chromatography ProductsThe Company's chromatography portfolio includes various products used in the downstream purification and quality control of biological drugs. Its other products include Protein A chromatography resins used in a small number of commercial drug processes and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test kits used by quality control departments to detect and measure the presence of leached Protein A and/or growth factor in the final product. Its OPUS pre-packed chromatography columns (PPCs) are used in the purification of clinical-stage biologics. Chromatography columns, packed with chromatography media, are used in biomanufacturing to purify the biological drugs once separated, typically using filtration technology, from the contents of a bioreactor.Filtration ProductsThe Company's filtration products include XCell Alternating Tangential Flow (ATF) Systems and Sius tangential flow filtration (TFF) cassettes. The XCell ATF System is a filtration device used in upstream processes to continuously remove cellular metabolic waste products during the course of a fermentation run, freeing healthy cells to continue producing the biologic drug of interest. XCell ATF Systems consist of either a stainless steel or plastic housing that contains a hollow-fiber filter, plus an associated pump and controller. Sius TFF cassettes are used to concentrate clinical and commercial-stage biologic drugs.

Business model[edit]
Prior to 2012, Repligen maintained dual capabilities in the development of pharmaceutical therapeutics (drug discovery and development) and the development of materials supporting biological drug manufacture (bioprocessing business).[5] A decision was made in 2012 to focus on the bioprocessing business and reduce research and development expenditures.[6] In the period of 2010 to 2013, the majority of sales by the company were concentrated in the single Protein A product line.[7]
Sales and revenue[edit]
Repligen employs a direct sales model to users of its products in the United States, with some sales through intermediaries in "certain foreign markets".[8] More than 80% of sales have been to customers in the United States and Sweden during the 2010-2013 period.[8] Long-term supply agreements have been established with major customers of the Protein A products, agreements which expire between 2016 and 2021 barring re-negotiation.[9]
As a result of royalty-generating out-licensing, royalty revenue from Bristol-Myers Squibb has been in the 27% to 37% range as a proportion of total revenue during the 2010-2013 period; in comparison to revenue from sales, the largest customer accounted for 35% to 45% of revenue during the same period.[4]
As a consequence of current operations, about one-third each of revenue and cost and expenses are denominated in Swedish krona currency, the remaining two-thirds denominated in United States dollars; this presents an element risk to the business based on unpredictable fluctuations in currency exchange rates.[10]
Intellectual property[edit]
The company's Protein A-related offerings are supported by proprietary technology, trade secrets and patent filings.[4] One patent was granted in April 2010 and has been extended so that it remains in effect until 2028.[4],[11] Patents are pending on elements of the OPUS chromatography product line,[4] and enabling technology has been licensed from BioFlash Partners.[7] Repligen retains an exclusive license to intellectual property owned by the University of Michigan in relation to the Orencia product divested to Bristol-Myers Squibb.[8],[12]
Facilities[edit]
Repligen's company headquarters are housed together with its manufacturing facility in Waltham, Massachusetts.[13]
Repligen maintains manufacturing facilities in Waltham, Massachusetts and Lund, Sweden.[2] Growth factor products and the native form of Protein A are manufactured in Sweden; recombinant forms of Protein A are manufactured in both the United States and Sweden; assembly of the OPUS chromatography product line is done in the United States.[9]
The lease on the main Waltham facility extends through 2023.[13] A second, smaller Waltham facility was leased through the end of 2012 and is now rented on a monthly basis.[14] In Lund, four buildings are under lease, three expiring in mid-2017 and the fourth extending to late 2019.[14]
Corporate history and governance[edit]
Alexander Rich was a co-founder of Repligen; in 2014 at the age of 87, Dr. Rich is "Chairman Emeritus".[15]of Repligen's Board of Directors. Dr. Rich had been a member of the Board since 1981.[16] Paul Schimmel is also a co-founder of Repligen; in 2014 at the age of 74, he is the Ernest and Jean Hahn Professor at The Skaggs Institute for Chemical Biology at The Scripps Research Institute. He used to be the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Professor of Biochemistry and Biophysics in the Department of Biology at MIT.
As of 2014[update], the company's President and Chief Executive Officer is Walter C. Herlihy.[15]
Acquisitions and in-licensing[edit]
In early 2010, Repligen licensed technology from BioFlash which it subsequently incorporated into the OPUS line of pre-packaged chromatography columns.[7]
In 2011, Repligen acquired bioproduction assets from Novozymes for $26.4 million, which doubled the company's bioprocessing capabilities.[5]
In December 2016 the company acquired TangenX for $39 million[17]
Divestments and out-licensing[edit]
In 2008, an agreement was struck to divest certain intellectual property rights to Bristol-Myers Squibb around the drug Orencia in exchange for ongoing royalty payments through the end of 2013.[5]
At the end of 2012, Repligen out-licensed its spinal muscular atrophy program, in particular the small molecule candidate drug RG3039, to Pfizer.[5] This divestment included licensing rights to two patents to Pfizer.[9],[18],[19]
At the start of 2014, the company out-licensed its Friedreich's ataxia program, including a library of histone deacetylase inhibitor compounds, to BioMarin Pharmaceutical for US$2,000,000 and future milestone and royalty payments.[2],[20]
Terminations and moth-balling[edit]
Development of an imaging agent, designated RG1068, based on a synthetic human hormone was halted in 2012 following a request by the USFDA for additional safety and efficacy data beyond that provided in a New Drug Application (NDA) submission; a Marketing Authorization Application had been submitted in parallel to the EMA.[2]

Products and services[edit]
Repligen is a major supplier of Protein A, both native and recombinant forms, to the pharmaceutical industry.[5] In 2010-2013, Protein A accounted for the majority of the company's product sales.[7] The company also provides growth factors to increase the productivity of cell-based bioproduction, multiple alternating tangential flow (ATF) systems, and a line (OPUS) of chromatography columns scaled to manufacture of product for testing in clinical trials.[5]
The OPUS product line contains a range of column sizes, the size and composition of which are dependent upon customer requirements, thus the full name of "Open Platform, User Specified".[6] The smaller sizes of columns depend upon proprietary technology licensed from BioFlash Partners, while the larger sizes are based on Repligen-developed proprietary technology.[7]

Repligen to buy filtration company Spectrum for $359 million in cash and stock
Repligen Corp.  announced Friday an agreement to buy privately-held filtration company Spectrum Inc. for about $359 million. Under terms of the deal, Repligen will pay $120 million in cash and 6.154 million shares of its stock, which represents about 18% of the shares outstanding. Repligen expects the deal to be completed during the third quarter of 2017, and add $17 million to $18 million to Repligen's 2017 revenue. The deal is expected to add to earnings in 2018. "This is a pivotal transaction for Repligen that meets all of our acquisition criteria and is a major step forward in building Repligen as a global leader in bioprocessing and achieving our long term financial goals," said Repligen Chief Executive Tony Hunt. The stock, which was still inactive in premarket trade, has rallied 30% year to date, while the S&P 500  has gained 8.7%.

Business model[edit]
Prior to 2012, Repligen maintained dual capabilities in the development of pharmaceutical therapeutics (drug discovery and development) and the development of materials supporting biological drug manufacture (bioprocessing business).[5] A decision was made in 2012 to focus on the bioprocessing business and reduce research and development expenditures.[6] In the period of 2010 to 2013, the majority of sales by the company were concentrated in the single Protein A product line.[7]
Sales and revenue[edit]
Repligen employs a direct sales model to users of its products in the United States, with some sales through intermediaries in "certain foreign markets".[8] More than 80% of sales have been to customers in the United States and Sweden during the 2010-2013 period.[8] Long-term supply agreements have been established with major customers of the Protein A products, agreements which expire between 2016 and 2021 barring re-negotiation.[9]
As a result of royalty-generating out-licensing, royalty revenue from Bristol-Myers Squibb has been in the 27% to 37% range as a proportion of total revenue during the 2010-2013 period; in comparison to revenue from sales, the largest customer accounted for 35% to 45% of revenue during the same period.[4]
As a consequence of current operations, about one-third each of revenue and cost and expenses are denominated in Swedish krona currency, the remaining two-thirds denominated in United States dollars; this presents an element risk to the business based on unpredictable fluctuations in currency exchange rates.[10]
Intellectual property[edit]
The company's Protein A-related offerings are supported by proprietary technology, trade secrets and patent filings.[4] One patent was granted in April 2010 and has been extended so that it remains in effect until 2028.[4],[11] Patents are pending on elements of the OPUS chromatography product line,[4] and enabling technology has been licensed from BioFlash Partners.[7] Repligen retains an exclusive license to intellectual property owned by the University of Michigan in relation to the Orencia product divested to Bristol-Myers Squibb.[8],[12]
Facilities[edit]
Repligen's company headquarters are housed together with its manufacturing facility in Waltham, Massachusetts.[13]
Repligen maintains manufacturing facilities in Waltham, Massachusetts and Lund, Sweden.[2] Growth factor products and the native form of Protein A are manufactured in Sweden; recombinant forms of Protein A are manufactured in both the United States and Sweden; assembly of the OPUS chromatography product line is done in the United States.[9]
The lease on the main Waltham facility extends through 2023.[13] A second, smaller Waltham facility was leased through the end of 2012 and is now rented on a monthly basis.[14] In Lund, four buildings are under lease, three expiring in mid-2017 and the fourth extending to late 2019.[14]
Corporate history and governance[edit]
Alexander Rich was a co-founder of Repligen; in 2014 at the age of 87, Dr. Rich is "Chairman Emeritus".[15]of Repligen's Board of Directors. Dr. Rich had been a member of the Board since 1981.[16] Paul Schimmel is also a co-founder of Repligen; in 2014 at the age of 74, he is the Ernest and Jean Hahn Professor at The Skaggs Institute for Chemical Biology at The Scripps Research Institute. He used to be the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Professor of Biochemistry and Biophysics in the Department of Biology at MIT.
As of 2014[update], the company's President and Chief Executive Officer is Walter C. Herlihy.[15]
Acquisitions and in-licensing[edit]
In early 2010, Repligen licensed technology from BioFlash which it subsequently incorporated into the OPUS line of pre-packaged chromatography columns.[7]
In 2011, Repligen acquired bioproduction assets from Novozymes for $26.4 million, which doubled the company's bioprocessing capabilities.[5]
In December 2016 the company acquired TangenX for $39 million[17]
Divestments and out-licensing[edit]
In 2008, an agreement was struck to divest certain intellectual property rights to Bristol-Myers Squibb around the drug Orencia in exchange for ongoing royalty payments through the end of 2013.[5]
At the end of 2012, Repligen out-licensed its spinal muscular atrophy program, in particular the small molecule candidate drug RG3039, to Pfizer.[5] This divestment included licensing rights to two patents to Pfizer.[9],[18],[19]
At the start of 2014, the company out-licensed its Friedreich's ataxia program, including a library of histone deacetylase inhibitor compounds, to BioMarin Pharmaceutical for US$2,000,000 and future milestone and royalty payments.[2],[20]
Terminations and moth-balling[edit]
Development of an imaging agent, designated RG1068, based on a synthetic human hormone was halted in 2012 following a request by the USFDA for additional safety and efficacy data beyond that provided in a New Drug Application (NDA) submission; a Marketing Authorization Application had been submitted in parallel to the EMA.[2]

Products and services[edit]
Repligen is a major supplier of Protein A, both native and recombinant forms, to the pharmaceutical industry.[5] In 2010-2013, Protein A accounted for the majority of the company's product sales.[7] The company also provides growth factors to increase the productivity of cell-based bioproduction, multiple alternating tangential flow (ATF) systems, and a line (OPUS) of chromatography columns scaled to manufacture of product for testing in clinical trials.[5]
The OPUS product line contains a range of column sizes, the size and composition of which are dependent upon customer requirements, thus the full name of "Open Platform, User Specified".[6] The smaller sizes of columns depend upon proprietary technology licensed from BioFlash Partners, while the larger sizes are based on Repligen-developed proprietary technology.[7]

Acquisitions and in-licensing[edit]
In early 2010, Repligen licensed technology from BioFlash which it subsequently incorporated into the OPUS line of pre-packaged chromatography columns.[7]
In 2011, Repligen acquired bioproduction assets from Novozymes for $26.4 million, which doubled the company's bioprocessing capabilities.[5]
In December 2016 the company acquired TangenX for $39 million[17]
Divestments and out-licensing[edit]
In 2008, an agreement was struck to divest certain intellectual property rights to Bristol-Myers Squibb around the drug Orencia in exchange for ongoing royalty payments through the end of 2013.[5]
At the end of 2012, Repligen out-licensed its spinal muscular atrophy program, in particular the small molecule candidate drug RG3039, to Pfizer.[5] This divestment included licensing rights to two patents to Pfizer.[9],[18],[19]
At the start of 2014, the company out-licensed its Friedreich's ataxia program, including a library of histone deacetylase inhibitor compounds, to BioMarin Pharmaceutical for US$2,000,000 and future milestone and royalty payments.[2],[20]
Terminations and moth-balling[edit]
Development of an imaging agent, designated RG1068, based on a synthetic human hormone was halted in 2012 following a request by the USFDA for additional safety and efficacy data beyond that provided in a New Drug Application (NDA) submission; a Marketing Authorization Application had been submitted in parallel to the EMA.[2]

Products and services[edit]
Repligen is a major supplier of Protein A, both native and recombinant forms, to the pharmaceutical industry.[5] In 2010-2013, Protein A accounted for the majority of the company's product sales.[7] The company also provides growth factors to increase the productivity of cell-based bioproduction, multiple alternating tangential flow (ATF) systems, and a line (OPUS) of chromatography columns scaled to manufacture of product for testing in clinical trials.[5]
The OPUS product line contains a range of column sizes, the size and composition of which are dependent upon customer requirements, thus the full name of "Open Platform, User Specified".[6] The smaller sizes of columns depend upon proprietary technology licensed from BioFlash Partners, while the larger sizes are based on Repligen-developed proprietary technology.[7]

Business model[edit]
Prior to 2012, Repligen maintained dual capabilities in the development of pharmaceutical therapeutics (drug discovery and development) and the development of materials supporting biological drug manufacture (bioprocessing business).[5] A decision was made in 2012 to focus on the bioprocessing business and reduce research and development expenditures.[6] In the period of 2010 to 2013, the majority of sales by the company were concentrated in the single Protein A product line.[7]
Sales and revenue[edit]
Repligen employs a direct sales model to users of its products in the United States, with some sales through intermediaries in "certain foreign markets".[8] More than 80% of sales have been to customers in the United States and Sweden during the 2010-2013 period.[8] Long-term supply agreements have been established with major customers of the Protein A products, agreements which expire between 2016 and 2021 barring re-negotiation.[9]
As a result of royalty-generating out-licensing, royalty revenue from Bristol-Myers Squibb has been in the 27% to 37% range as a proportion of total revenue during the 2010-2013 period; in comparison to revenue from sales, the largest customer accounted for 35% to 45% of revenue during the same period.[4]
As a consequence of current operations, about one-third each of revenue and cost and expenses are denominated in Swedish krona currency, the remaining two-thirds denominated in United States dollars; this presents an element risk to the business based on unpredictable fluctuations in currency exchange rates.[10]
Intellectual property[edit]
The company's Protein A-related offerings are supported by proprietary technology, trade secrets and patent filings.[4] One patent was granted in April 2010 and has been extended so that it remains in effect until 2028.[4],[11] Patents are pending on elements of the OPUS chromatography product line,[4] and enabling technology has been licensed from BioFlash Partners.[7] Repligen retains an exclusive license to intellectual property owned by the University of Michigan in relation to the Orencia product divested to Bristol-Myers Squibb.[8],[12]
Facilities[edit]
Repligen's company headquarters are housed together with its manufacturing facility in Waltham, Massachusetts.[13]
Repligen maintains manufacturing facilities in Waltham, Massachusetts and Lund, Sweden.[2] Growth factor products and the native form of Protein A are manufactured in Sweden; recombinant forms of Protein A are manufactured in both the United States and Sweden; assembly of the OPUS chromatography product line is done in the United States.[9]
The lease on the main Waltham facility extends through 2023.[13] A second, smaller Waltham facility was leased through the end of 2012 and is now rented on a monthly basis.[14] In Lund, four buildings are under lease, three expiring in mid-2017 and the fourth extending to late 2019.[14]
Corporate history and governance[edit]
Alexander Rich was a co-founder of Repligen; in 2014 at the age of 87, Dr. Rich is "Chairman Emeritus".[15]of Repligen's Board of Directors. Dr. Rich had been a member of the Board since 1981.[16] Paul Schimmel is also a co-founder of Repligen; in 2014 at the age of 74, he is the Ernest and Jean Hahn Professor at The Skaggs Institute for Chemical Biology at The Scripps Research Institute. He used to be the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Professor of Biochemistry and Biophysics in the Department of Biology at MIT.
As of 2014[update], the company's President and Chief Executive Officer is Walter C. Herlihy.[15]

Sales and revenue[edit]
Repligen employs a direct sales model to users of its products in the United States, with some sales through intermediaries in "certain foreign markets".[8] More than 80% of sales have been to customers in the United States and Sweden during the 2010-2013 period.[8] Long-term supply agreements have been established with major customers of the Protein A products, agreements which expire between 2016 and 2021 barring re-negotiation.[9]
As a result of royalty-generating out-licensing, royalty revenue from Bristol-Myers Squibb has been in the 27% to 37% range as a proportion of total revenue during the 2010-2013 period; in comparison to revenue from sales, the largest customer accounted for 35% to 45% of revenue during the same period.[4]
As a consequence of current operations, about one-third each of revenue and cost and expenses are denominated in Swedish krona currency, the remaining two-thirds denominated in United States dollars; this presents an element risk to the business based on unpredictable fluctuations in currency exchange rates.[10]
Intellectual property[edit]
The company's Protein A-related offerings are supported by proprietary technology, trade secrets and patent filings.[4] One patent was granted in April 2010 and has been extended so that it remains in effect until 2028.[4],[11] Patents are pending on elements of the OPUS chromatography product line,[4] and enabling technology has been licensed from BioFlash Partners.[7] Repligen retains an exclusive license to intellectual property owned by the University of Michigan in relation to the Orencia product divested to Bristol-Myers Squibb.[8],[12]
Facilities[edit]
Repligen's company headquarters are housed together with its manufacturing facility in Waltham, Massachusetts.[13]
Repligen maintains manufacturing facilities in Waltham, Massachusetts and Lund, Sweden.[2] Growth factor products and the native form of Protein A are manufactured in Sweden; recombinant forms of Protein A are manufactured in both the United States and Sweden; assembly of the OPUS chromatography product line is done in the United States.[9]
The lease on the main Waltham facility extends through 2023.[13] A second, smaller Waltham facility was leased through the end of 2012 and is now rented on a monthly basis.[14] In Lund, four buildings are under lease, three expiring in mid-2017 and the fourth extending to late 2019.[14]
Corporate history and governance[edit]
Alexander Rich was a co-founder of Repligen; in 2014 at the age of 87, Dr. Rich is "Chairman Emeritus".[15]of Repligen's Board of Directors. Dr. Rich had been a member of the Board since 1981.[16] Paul Schimmel is also a co-founder of Repligen; in 2014 at the age of 74, he is the Ernest and Jean Hahn Professor at The Skaggs Institute for Chemical Biology at The Scripps Research Institute. He used to be the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Professor of Biochemistry and Biophysics in the Department of Biology at MIT.
As of 2014[update], the company's President and Chief Executive Officer is Walter C. Herlihy.[15]
Acquisitions and in-licensing[edit]
In early 2010, Repligen licensed technology from BioFlash which it subsequently incorporated into the OPUS line of pre-packaged chromatography columns.[7]
In 2011, Repligen acquired bioproduction assets from Novozymes for $26.4 million, which doubled the company's bioprocessing capabilities.[5]
In December 2016 the company acquired TangenX for $39 million[17]
Divestments and out-licensing[edit]
In 2008, an agreement was struck to divest certain intellectual property rights to Bristol-Myers Squibb around the drug Orencia in exchange for ongoing royalty payments through the end of 2013.[5]
At the end of 2012, Repligen out-licensed its spinal muscular atrophy program, in particular the small molecule candidate drug RG3039, to Pfizer.[5] This divestment included licensing rights to two patents to Pfizer.[9],[18],[19]
At the start of 2014, the company out-licensed its Friedreich's ataxia program, including a library of histone deacetylase inhibitor compounds, to BioMarin Pharmaceutical for US$2,000,000 and future milestone and royalty payments.[2],[20]
Terminations and moth-balling[edit]
Development of an imaging agent, designated RG1068, based on a synthetic human hormone was halted in 2012 following a request by the USFDA for additional safety and efficacy data beyond that provided in a New Drug Application (NDA) submission; a Marketing Authorization Application had been submitted in parallel to the EMA.[2]

Products and services[edit]
Repligen is a major supplier of Protein A, both native and recombinant forms, to the pharmaceutical industry.[5] In 2010-2013, Protein A accounted for the majority of the company's product sales.[7] The company also provides growth factors to increase the productivity of cell-based bioproduction, multiple alternating tangential flow (ATF) systems, and a line (OPUS) of chromatography columns scaled to manufacture of product for testing in clinical trials.[5]
The OPUS product line contains a range of column sizes, the size and composition of which are dependent upon customer requirements, thus the full name of "Open Platform, User Specified".[6] The smaller sizes of columns depend upon proprietary technology licensed from BioFlash Partners, while the larger sizes are based on Repligen-developed proprietary technology.[7]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Repligen to buy filtration company Spectrum for $359 million in cash and stock
Repligen Corp.  announced Friday an agreement to buy privately-held filtration company Spectrum Inc. for about $359 million. Under terms of the deal, Repligen will pay $120 million in cash and 6.154 million shares of its stock, which represents about 18% of the shares outstanding. Repligen expects the deal to be completed during the third quarter of 2017, and add $17 million to $18 million to Repligen's 2017 revenue. The deal is expected to add to earnings in 2018. "This is a pivotal transaction for Repligen that meets all of our acquisition criteria and is a major step forward in building Repligen as a global leader in bioprocessing and achieving our long term financial goals," said Repligen Chief Executive Tony Hunt. The stock, which was still inactive in premarket trade, has rallied 30% year to date, while the S&P 500  has gained 8.7%.

- Adds to Repligen a leader in bioprocess filtration with expertise in hollow fiber technology- Strengthens flagship XCell™ ATF product line with an extensive filtration consumables portfolio- Diversifies markets beyond monoclonal antibody manufacturing into vaccine, recombinant protein and gene therapy production- Expands global commercial organization and adds direct sales in the US, Europe and Asia- Deal expected to be accretive to Repligen earnings per share in fiscal 2018 WALTHAM, Mass., June  23, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Repligen Corporation (NASDAQ:RGEN), a life sciences company focused on bioprocessing technology leadership, today announced that it has entered into a definitive merger agreement with privately-held Spectrum, Inc. (“Spectrum”) for approximately $359 million, comprised of $120 million in cash plus 6,154,000 shares of Repligen stock. Spectrum recorded revenue of $40.2 million in 2016, with greater than 90% coming from its filtration product portfolio. The addition of Spectrum is expected to accelerate the growth of Repligen’s filtration business, provide access to new customers, and greatly expand its commercial footprint, strengthening Repligen’s position as a leader in single-use and continuous manufacturing technologies for bioprocessing.   Spectrum is a diversified filtration company with a differentiated portfolio of hollow fiber cartridges, bench-top to commercial scale filtration and perfusion systems and an expansive portfolio of single-use solutions. Spectrum’s products are used for the filtration, isolation, purification and concentration of monoclonal antibodies, vaccines, recombinant proteins, diagnostic products and cell therapies where Spectrum offers both standard and customized solutions to its bioprocessing customers. With a strong commercial team and a reputation for R&D innovation, we believe Spectrum is well-positioned to expand Repligen’s global market presence in bioprocess filtration and continuous manufacturing. Tony J. Hunt, President and CEO of Repligen said, “This is a pivotal transaction for Repligen that meets all of our acquisition criteria and is a major step forward in building Repligen as a global leader in bioprocessing and achieving our long term financial goals. We look forward to joining forces with the Spectrum team, with whom we are closely aligned in our commitments to delivering innovative products and exceptional customer service.” Roy Eddleman, Chairman and CEO of Spectrum said, “Spectrum has developed world-class products delivered with first-class customer service. Repligen has a proven track record of unlocking additional value and accelerating growth in previous acquisitions. I am excited for the opportunities our combined businesses will bring to our customers, employees and other stakeholders.” Tony MacDonald, President of Spectrum said, “This is a great synergistic pairing, as both companies share a real drive and vision to bring flexible and customer tailored solutions to the rapidly growing bioprocessing industry. With Spectrum’s leadership in hollow fiber filtration, we see clear opportunities to accelerate our combined success and we look forward to joining the Repligen team.” Expected Strategic and Financial Benefits of the Transaction Adds a market leader in bioprocess filtration with expertise in hollow fiber technologySpectrum is a technology and market leader in bioprocess filtration with hollow fiber (HF) tangential flow filtration (TFF) products and associated systems and consumables. The Spectrum portfolio is expected to complement and strengthen Repligen’s position in the filtration market, where its existing filtration products are established in upstream and downstream monoclonal antibody production. Strengthens flagship XCell™ ATF product line with a filtration consumable portfolioThe addition of Spectrum hollow fiber TFF products and associated R&D expertise directly addresses the consumable gap in Repligen’s XCell™ ATF filtration portfolio and provides Repligen with a unique opportunity to develop new products that address customer needs in bioprocessing. Repligen currently purchases hollow fiber filters for use in its XCell™ ATF systems through OEM agreements, with Spectrum as its main supplier. The proposed acquisition significantly expands Repligen’s filtration product offering.   Diversifies markets beyond monoclonal antibody production into vaccine, recombinant protein and gene therapy productionSpectrum has diversified its customer base as hollow fiber technology is well established in vaccine, recombinant protein and gene therapy markets, as well as monoclonal antibody production. We believe that access to broader markets will provide opportunities for Repligen to cross-sell chromatography and filtration products into these areas. Extends our global commercial organization and adds a direct sales presence in AsiaThe proposed acquisition is expected to more than double Repligen’s sales force of 15 direct reps, adding Spectrum direct reps with deep experience in filtration and bioprocessing. Spectrum has invested significantly in building out their commercial team in the US, Europe and Asia, which we believe will help Repligen to accelerate its market penetration in these regions. Positive Projected Financial ImpactSpectrum recorded $40.2 million of revenue for 2016, including sales of Spectrum products to Repligen, and has grown its revenue at an annual CAGR of approximately 15% since 2014.  Spectrum is expected to add $17 to $18 million to Repligen revenue in 2017, based on assumed revenue for 5 months of Repligen ownership, and adjusting for intercompany sales of Spectrum filters to Repligen. For the full year 2018, Spectrum is expected to grow double-digit and contribute $47 to $50 million in incremental revenue (adjusted for intercompany sales), at gross margins that are above Repligen’s corporate average of 55.5% to 56.5% per Repligen’s most recent 2017 guidance. Repligen expects the deal to be breakeven to adjusted EPS in 2017 and accretive to both GAAP and adjusted EPS in 2018.  Three-year total synergies are expected to be in the range of $20 to $25 million, comprised of revenue synergies of $15 to $20 million at gross margins above Repligen’s corporate average and cost synergies of greater than $5 million. Approvals and FinancingThe transaction is expected to be completed during the third quarter of 2017, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976.  To fund the transaction, Repligen intends to use its cash on hand, which totaled approximately $142 million on March 31, 2017, and potentially a committed debt financing of $30 million that it has obtained from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.    Perella Weinberg Partners LP is acting as financial advisor to Repligen and Goodwin Procter LLP is serving as legal counsel to Repligen.  JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is serving as initial lender, lead arranger and the sole administrative agent under the committed debt financing and Simpson Thatcher serves as its legal advisor. Use of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresFor the purposes of addressing the financial impact of the proposed addition of the Spectrum business, this release and the slide deck that accompanies today’s webcast include discussions of expectations for non-GAAP adjusted earnings per diluted share (EPS).  Adjusted EPS excludes gains or losses that are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any regularity or predictability, including due to the impact of acquisitions, tax provisions/benefits related to the previous items, benefits from tax credit carryforwards, and the impact of tax audits or events. We exclude these items because they are outside of our normal operations and/or, in certain cases, are difficult to forecast accurately for future periods. We believe that the use of non-GAAP adjusted EPS helps investors to gain a better understanding of our core operating results and future prospects, consistent with how management measures and forecasts the company's performance, especially when comparing such results to previous periods or forecasts.  Conference Call and Webcast Repligen management will host a conference call and webcast at 8:30 am ET today to provide more information on this announcement.  The webcast and accompanying slides can be accessed in the Investor Events & Presentations section of Repligen’s website.  An audio archive of the call will be available for a limited period of time following the event.  Live event webcast with slides:URL:  http://edge.media-server.com/m/p/ccekwwd8 Live event dial-in:Domestic: (844) 835-7432International: (404) 537-3372Conference ID: 45284567 Archived event dial-in:Domestic: (855) 859-2056International: (404) 537-3406Conference ID: 45284567 About Repligen Corporation Repligen Corporation (NASDAQ:RGEN) is a bioprocessing company focused on the development, manufacture and commercialization of highly innovative products used to manufacture biologic drugs.

Forward-Looking StatementsThe following constitutes a “Safe Harbor” statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995: This press release contains forward-looking statements, which are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Investors are cautioned that statements in this press release which are not strictly historical statements, constitute forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, express or implied statements or guidance regarding the expected results of the acquisition on Repligen’s future financial performance, , including the accretive nature and the timing of the accretive nature of the Spectrum acquisition, expected synergies following the acquisition of Spectrum, customer adoption of Spectrum products, the expected expansion of Repligen’s product lines and growth into foreign markets, the anticipated funding for the acquisition, and the timing of the closing of the acquisition, and other statements identified by words like “believe,” “expect,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “seek,” “anticipate,” or “could” and similar expressions. Such forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated, including, without limitation, risks associated with: the risk that the proposed acquisition may not be completed in a timely manner, or at all; the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the acquisition; our ability to integrate Spectrum’s business and personnel and to achieve expected synergies; our ability to maintain or expand Spectrum’s historical sales; our ability to accurately forecast the acquisition, related restructuring costs and allocation of the purchase price, goodwill and other intangibles acquisition related and other asset adjustments; our ability to develop and commercialize products and the market acceptance of our products; reduced demand for single-use or disposable bioprocessing products that adversely impacts our future revenues, cash flows, results of operations and financial condition; our volatile stock price; and other risks detailed in Repligen’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the other reports that Repligen periodically files with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

History 











Founded in 1981 by two pioneering scientists, Repligen is a leader today in Protein A ligand manufacturing, and is focused on becoming a trusted solutions provider for bioprocessing.




Founders
Repligen was founded in 1981 by two distinguished scientists who pioneered breakthrough advances in science and technology.
Alexander Rich was co-Chair of the Repligen Board of Directors until 2014.  He was a Professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology since 1958.  Considered a founding father of the field of molecular biology, he received the National Medal of Science in 1995.  He passed away on April 27, 2015 at 90 years old.
 
 
Paul Schimmel is the Ernest and Jean Hahn Professor at The Skaggs Institute for Chemical Biology at The Scripps Research Institute. He formerly was the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Professor of Biochemistry and Biophysics in the Department of Biology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  His principal scientific contributions include the discovery of “The Second Genetic Code" and expansion of the functional genome.
 
  






Milestones
Since it’s founding in 1981, Repligen has been a leading expert in Protein A. Repligen scientists first cloned the gene for Protein A in 1982, and the Company introduced the world’s first recombinant form of the ligand in 1985. For many years, Protein A was sold as a source of non-dilutive revenue to support a number of drug development programs that the Company was pursuing.
In 2010, Repligen acquired disposable chromatography technology from BioFlash, commercializing the product as OPUS® Pre-packed Chromatography Columns, now the leader and expert in column packing technology.
In 2011, Repligen's transformative acquisition of Novozymes Biopharma AB in 2011 (which included additional Protein A ligands and growth factor products) became the basis of its portfolio of cell culture supplements which quickly doubled its bioprocessing product revenue.
The strategic decision was made in 2012 to divert Repligen’s dual business model to a singularly focused model, based on building its bioprocessing business and taking the opportunity to leverage the strength of the biologics market without being tied to the success or failure of any particular drug.
In 2014, Repligen acquired the assets of Refine Technology, through which it gained the XCell™ ATF System, now a leader in cell culture process intensification.
In April 2016, Repligen acquired Atoll GmBH of Weingarten, Germany to provide customers with the broadest selection of pre-packed chromatography columns from bench-scale to production-scale. These products are now OPUS® PD Pre-packed Columns for process development.
In December 2016,  Repligen acquired TangenX™ Technology Corporation, expanding Repligen's filtration and single-use portfolios, with applications in cell culture, harvest, purification and final fomulation.

Industry trends





 
The explosive growth in mAb-based biologics, the globalization of biomanufacturing, and the economic pressures to reduce capital investment, cost of development and cost of goods all point to changes in how biopharmaceutical manufacturing plants are designed, built and operated.  The benefits of continuous processing when applied to biologics production can be paradigm-changing.
When converting to continuous processing, the volumetric productivity of the process increases while the size and volume of equipment decreases.  A facility running a continuous process will be significantly smaller than a large-scale batch facility, thus reducing capital expenses.
Benefits of continuous processing include:

Reduced capital cost and time
Reduced equipment size
Deployment of single-use technology
Streamlined process flow
Low cycle times
Steady state operation
Consistent product quality
Increased productivity

Continuous Manufacturing: A Changing Processing Paradigm 

 






Upstream continuous processing





 

Perfusion
Perfusion, or upstream continuous processing, has been used since the 1980s. High cell density perfusion, or XCell™ ATF perfusion, delivers higher cell concentration and cell viability.


N-1 perfusion
N-1 perfusion refers to the intensification of cell growth in the step prior to the production bioreactor (N). This process intensification is done using perfusion in the N-1 bioreactor for high cell density seeding of the production bioreactor (N), or removal of the N-1 bioreactor if the N-2 bioreactor can provide enough cells for the production bioreactor (N).
High density (HD) cell banking
High density (HD) cell banking is a novel method for seed train optimization using perfusion to intensify cell density and reduce the number of early-stage expansion steps.

Downstream continuous processing





 
 
Multi-column chromatography
A continuous capture chromatography process is the next big challenge for modern bioproduction.  Multi-column chromatography operates in continuous mode, balancing downstream productivity with upstream titers.
multi-column chromatography 






Integrated continuous processing





 
Integrated upstream and downstream continuous bioprocesses have the potential to revolutionize bioprocessing, leading to significant improvements in process efficiencies, manufacturing footprint, productivity and cost of goods.

Hunt, President and CEO of Repligen said:"This is a pivotal transaction for Repligen that meets all of our acquisition criteria and is a major step forward in building Repligen as a global leader in bioprocessing and achieving our long-term financial goals. We look forward to joining forces with the Spectrum team, with whom we are closely aligned in our commitments to delivering innovative products and exceptional customer service."Roy Eddleman, Chairman and CEO of Spectrum added:"Spectrum has developed world-class products delivered with first-class customer service. Repligen has a proven track record of unlocking additional value and accelerating growth in previous acquisitions. I am excited for the opportunities our combined businesses will bring to our customers, employees, and other stakeholders."Details of the merger agreementRepligen's offer of $359 million to acquire Spectrum includes $120 million in cash and 6,154,000 Repligen's shares. The transaction is expected to be completed in Q3 2017 and is subject to expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, regulatory approvals, and other closing conditions.Repligen plans to finance the transaction with available cash on hand of approximately $142 million on March 31, 2017. The Company may acquire additional funds via debt from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.The Company has clarified that it has excluded certain items like gains or losses that are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any regularity or predictability, including due to the impact of acquisitions, tax provisions/benefits related to previous items, benefits from tax credit carry forwards, and the impact of tax audits or events would be excluded. The exclusion is aimed at addressing the financial impact of the acquisition and since they are outside the Company's normal operations, and in some cases, it is difficult to forecast accurately for the future.How Repligen Benefits from the merger?The acquisition holds great financial value for Repligen. The deal is expected to add approximately $17 million to $18 million to Repligen's revenue for FY17. For FY18, Repligen expects the deal to contribute approximately $47 million to $50 million in incremental revenue (adjusted for inter-company sales). The deal is expected to be accretive to the Company's earnings both GAAP and EPS in FY18. The deal is expected to result in total synergies of $20 million to $25 million within next three years. Out of this revenue, synergies would be approximately $15 million to $20 million and more than $5 million in cost synergies.Read MoreSpectrum's portfolio of bioprocess filtration with hollow fiber (HF) tangential flow filtration (TFF) products and associated systems and consumables will add to the existing Repligen's product range. This will enable Repligen to improve its market position and range of filtration products.Repligen's XCell™ ATF filtration portfolio requires hollow fiber filters on a consumable basis and is currently outsourced by the Company to OEMs. With this acquisition, Spectrum's hollow fiber TFF products and associated R&D expertise will automatically solve this problem and expands Repligen's ability to meet customers' needs at a single location.The acquisition allows Repligen to expand its reach to new areas beyond its current monoclonal antibody production into a vaccine, recombinant protein, and gene therapy production. It will be able to expand to Spectrum's markets which include vaccine, recombinant protein, and gene therapy markets where it can tap on cross selling opportunities for its chromatography and filtration products.Repligen will also be able to expand its global footprint in markets like the US, Europe, and Asia, where Spectrum has an established sales and distribution network.About Spectrum Inc.Rancho Dominguez, California based Spectrum was founded in 1970 and is a diversified filtration Company with a distinguished range of hollow fiber cartridges, bench-top to commercial scale filtration and perfusion systems, and an expansive portfolio of single-use solutions.
