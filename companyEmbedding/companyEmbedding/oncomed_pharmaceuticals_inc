Latest Science:
OncoMed researchers publish new findings on Wnt drug combinatorial anti-tumor
									activity in multiple tumor types including breast, pancreatic, lung and ovarian cancer.

Hyperactive Wnt signaling is a key oncogenic signal in many types of cancer, and recently has been associated with
				              resistance to cancer immunotherapeutics. OncoMed scientists have published a new manuscript in Science Advances on June 21 titled “WNT antagonists exhibit unique combinatorial anti-tumor activity
											with taxanes by potentiating mitotic cell death”. In this paper we describe a series of experiments in a large
											number of patient derived xenografts with two OncoMed developed compounds, vantictumab (anti-FZD) and ipafricept (FZD8-Fc).
				                These two biologics are the most advanced Wnt pathway antagonists in clinical development. We discovered that these
				                agents exhibit much better combination activity with taxanes than with other classes of chemotherapeutic agents,
				                such as gemcitabine or platinum compounds. This is a robust phenomenon and occurs in diverse tumor types including
				                breast, pancreatic, lung and ovarian cancers. Furthermore, we report that combination activity is enhanced by
				                administration of the Wnt antagonist prior to taxane treatment. The combination of Wnt blockade and taxane
				                treatment leads to a dramatic histological phenotype - mitotic cell death in tumor cells. Our hypothesis is that
				                the unique combination activity relies on the action of taxane chemotherapy and inhibition of beta-catenin at the
				                M phase of the cell cycle. This discovery has informed our clinical testing strategy and the mechanism of synergy
				                has implications in understanding the role of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in regulating the proliferation and
				                differentiation of cancer cells.

OncoMed






















Overview






 

 
Overview
OncoMed Pharmaceuticals is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing novel
          therapeutics that address the fundamental biology driving cancer's growth, resistance, recurrence and metastasis.
          To date, we have advanced nine novel anti-cancer product candidates into more than 14 IND's, initiated 27 clinical studies
          and have enrolled more than 1,300 subjects. We continue to pursue the discovery of additional novel anti-cancer therapeutics.
          All of our product candidates were discovered internally in our own research laboratories.
As our understanding of the biologic pathways driving tumor growth, metastases and recurrence has increased, new discoveries
          from our research team have identified novel immuno-oncology targets. Tumor cells have evolved ways of evading the body's
          immune system in order to grow. The therapeutic candidates in our pipeline act by blocking those evasive techniques, making
          tumor cells more visible to immune system attack and/or bolstering targeted immune cell activity. We are also deploying our
          expertise in the engineering of antibodies to create new bispecifics that contain two potential drugs in one antibody and are
          designed to increase anti-cancer activity and in some cases, mitigate known off-target effects. We believe each of our
          distinct therapeutic candidates has the potential to significantly impact cancer treatment and the clinical outcome of
          patients with cancer.
To support the advancement of our pipeline and our continued discovery efforts, OncoMed has assembled a proven management
          team with expertise in oncology research, drug discovery, clinical development, translational medicine, regulatory affairs,
          and commercial development. In addition, we have established an extensive patent portfolio protecting our novel product
          candidates, as well as our platform R&D technologies. We have formed strategic alliances with companies such as Celgene
          Corporation and Bayer Pharma AG. Since our founding in August 2004, we have raised more than $600 million, more than half of
          which has come from collaboration funding from our pharmaceutical partnerships, with the rest consisting of equity
          financings, including an Initial Public Offering in 2013.

OncoMed






















Overview






 

 
Overview
OncoMed Pharmaceuticals is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing novel
          therapeutics that address the fundamental biology driving cancer's growth, resistance, recurrence and metastasis.
          To date, we have advanced nine novel anti-cancer product candidates into more than 14 IND's, initiated 27 clinical studies
          and have enrolled more than 1,300 subjects. We continue to pursue the discovery of additional novel anti-cancer therapeutics.
          All of our product candidates were discovered internally in our own research laboratories.
As our understanding of the biologic pathways driving tumor growth, metastases and recurrence has increased, new discoveries
          from our research team have identified novel immuno-oncology targets. Tumor cells have evolved ways of evading the body's
          immune system in order to grow. The therapeutic candidates in our pipeline act by blocking those evasive techniques, making
          tumor cells more visible to immune system attack and/or bolstering targeted immune cell activity. We are also deploying our
          expertise in the engineering of antibodies to create new bispecifics that contain two potential drugs in one antibody and are
          designed to increase anti-cancer activity and in some cases, mitigate known off-target effects. We believe each of our
          distinct therapeutic candidates has the potential to significantly impact cancer treatment and the clinical outcome of
          patients with cancer.
To support the advancement of our pipeline and our continued discovery efforts, OncoMed has assembled a proven management
          team with expertise in oncology research, drug discovery, clinical development, translational medicine, regulatory affairs,
          and commercial development. In addition, we have established an extensive patent portfolio protecting our novel product
          candidates, as well as our platform R&D technologies. We have formed strategic alliances with companies such as Celgene
          Corporation and Bayer Pharma AG. Since our founding in August 2004, we have raised more than $600 million, more than half of
          which has come from collaboration funding from our pharmaceutical partnerships, with the rest consisting of equity
          financings, including an Initial Public Offering in 2013.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

We cannot take progress for granted

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Latest Science:
OncoMed researchers publish new findings on Wnt drug combinatorial anti-tumor
									activity in multiple tumor types including breast, pancreatic, lung and ovarian cancer.

Hyperactive Wnt signaling is a key oncogenic signal in many types of cancer, and recently has been associated with
				              resistance to cancer immunotherapeutics. OncoMed scientists have published a new manuscript in Science Advances on June 21 titled “WNT antagonists exhibit unique combinatorial anti-tumor activity
											with taxanes by potentiating mitotic cell death”. In this paper we describe a series of experiments in a large
											number of patient derived xenografts with two OncoMed developed compounds, vantictumab (anti-FZD) and ipafricept (FZD8-Fc).
				                These two biologics are the most advanced Wnt pathway antagonists in clinical development. We discovered that these
				                agents exhibit much better combination activity with taxanes than with other classes of chemotherapeutic agents,
				                such as gemcitabine or platinum compounds. This is a robust phenomenon and occurs in diverse tumor types including
				                breast, pancreatic, lung and ovarian cancers. Furthermore, we report that combination activity is enhanced by
				                administration of the Wnt antagonist prior to taxane treatment. The combination of Wnt blockade and taxane
				                treatment leads to a dramatic histological phenotype - mitotic cell death in tumor cells. Our hypothesis is that
				                the unique combination activity relies on the action of taxane chemotherapy and inhibition of beta-catenin at the
				                M phase of the cell cycle. This discovery has informed our clinical testing strategy and the mechanism of synergy
				                has implications in understanding the role of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in regulating the proliferation and
				                differentiation of cancer cells.
