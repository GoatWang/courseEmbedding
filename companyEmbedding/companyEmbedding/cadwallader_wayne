By Fitapelli Kurta






 


Former Ameriprise Financial broker, Ted Wayne Cadwallader (CRD# 3256070) of Getzville, New York, has been permanently barred from the financial industry.
According to the Letter of Acceptance, Waiver and Consent (AWC), in August 2014, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) began to investigate whether Ted Wayne Cadwallader had engaged in private securities transactions without disclosing it to Ameriprise Financial. Ted Wayne Cadwallader failed to respond to FINRA’s request that he appear for on-the-record testimony.
As a result, Ted Wayne Cadwallader was permanently barred from the securities industry.
Ted Wayne Cadwallader was terminated from Ameriprise Financial Services on October 13, 2014 for the above-mentioned misconduct.
Ted Wayne Cadwallader has three customer initiated complaints listed on his BrokerCheck Report, all of which were denied.
Ted Wayne Cadwallader worked for Ameriprise Financial Services in Getzville, New York from 1999 to 2014. Ted Wayne Cadwallader was also registered with IDS Life Insurance Co. in Minneapolis, Minnesota from 1999 to 2006.

Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time.

Academy Bank


                                            They cancelled my secured credit card without informing me.  Did not refund the money from secured card without me calling,. Guess they thought I might forget.  Will be closing all accounts with them today.  Worst customer service of any bank I've dealt with

                                            I have (had) been with Alfa for 23 years. Over the course of the last few years, my premiums kept going up. $20 here, $30 there - well, this last time it went up over $200 with the new renewal. I have a perfect driving record- no tickets, no wrecks- and yet my insurance jumps up...show more

                                            I've had a NetSpend prepaid debit card for approximately 3 years. Up until recently I've had no problem.

PenFed Credit Union


                                            HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! They do not work with you at all to satisfy the customer. Other credit unions help you ESPECIALLY if you have great credit. This CU doesn't tell you everything so verify everything with two other reps. Total Nightmare!

                                            After getting fed-up with SEFCU’s “nickel-and-dime” fee structure and lack of branches/ATMs in my area, I decided to close my account in April 2017. Fast forward to July 25, 2017 when I receive a collection notice for fees due ($175). Access to my online...show more

If the company isn't reporting the account correctly, you can submit a dispute to the credit bureaus asking them to correct it.

If you were a grad victim you don't need to fill out a fraud package. Google it. And send it to the credit bureaus.

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.… read more

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.
