PRESS RELEASE
New York, October 5, 2016 — MTS Health Investors, LLC (“MTS”), the healthcare-focused private equity fund, announced today the closing of its fourth fund, MTS Health Investors IV, L.P. (“Fund IV”) with $365 million in limited partner and general partner commitments. The fund was oversubscribed and closed at its fundraising cap.
Senior Managing Director, Curtis S. Lane, said, “We are grateful for the ongoing support of our existing investors and pleased to add a distinguished group of new investors to this fund. MTS recognizes the confidence our partners have placed in us and will continue to work diligently to execute our strategy.”
Fund IV will continue MTS’s focus on investing in businesses that operate in the services sectors of healthcare.

Moses, MTS’s Senior Managing Director, said, “MTS’s deep domain knowledge and extensive network of healthcare industry relationships equips us to identify attractive investment targets and to bring new growth opportunities to each of the companies with which we partner. We believe that this approach complements our strengths and will continue to deliver value.”
Kirkland & Ellis LLP served as legal counsel in the fund formation of Fund IV and Probitas Partners served as placement agent.

NEWS RELEASE - Commercial real estate venture gets funded for $250K from funded.com's funding provider. Comment: I was very pleased with the speed and professional attitude of the site. I will recommend this to anyone in the future.

"Funded.com has been great and my project is in the final stages of being funded by an investor I found on here. I was surprized at the quick process and how fast investors funded my project. Website was a big help!" 

Rick R 
Entreprenuer





Let me first start by saying I believe your site is THE BEST there is for connecting Entrepreneurs and Investors.  It is the site I've had most success with.  I had about 6 Investors either respond back or contact me because of your site with an interest in investing in my company. Thank you very much!  I love your site and will recommend it to any of my Colleagues.  I love the fact that we are able to contact the Investors directly (which many of the sites joining Entrepreneurs and Investors don't allow).  It looks like I'm about to go into contract with an Investor because of your site.  Thank you again. 

Faith D
Entreprenuer





I am grateful I had the opportunity to access your network of investors. I am reasonably confident that the current negotiations with one of your investors will go through for our film production. I will be back for my next production.
