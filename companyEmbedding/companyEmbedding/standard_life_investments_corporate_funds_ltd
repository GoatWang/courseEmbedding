            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.source> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11x1gf2m6>  .

<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.rate> 4.5 .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .


If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Multi-asset capabilities
Successfully managing a variety of multi-asset portfolios demands an exceptionally broad and skilled investment capability. At Standard Life Investments, we have extensive experience and diversity of talent across all global asset classes – including equities, fixed income, real estate, money markets and private equity.

Investment Expertise



Equities

Standard Life Investments manages a full range of equity strategies that span the risk/return spectrum. While distinct in their risk tolerances and return objectives, our equity portfolios share a common goal: to consistently add value through active management.





Fixed income

Standard Life Investments offers fixed income capabilities across a wide range of sub-sectors and geographies. Our commitment to the asset class is underlined by the extensive range of fixed income strategies we have developed to meet the needs of both existing and new clients.





Real estate

The benefits of investing in real estate are compelling. Over the long term, the returns from real estate have a low correlation with equities and bonds. This means that real estate can help to spread risk and create diversified investment portfolios. In addition, real estate offers relatively stable income in the form of rent paid by tenants.





Multi-asset

Standard Life Investments is at the forefront of multi-asset investing, developing innovative products that aim to deliver targeted returns within tight risk boundaries. As a result, increasing numbers of investors trust us with their investments.

History[edit]
The Standard Life Assurance Company was established in 1825 and was reincorporated as a mutual assurance company in 1925.[4] During the 19th century it opened offices in Canada, India, China and Uruguay.[4]
In 2006 demutualisation took place and the company was floated on the London Stock Exchange.[5] The company sold Standard Life Bank plc to Barclays plc in January 2010[6] and then acquired the remaining 75 per cent stake in Threesixty, a financial advisory support business, that it did not already own for an undisclosed sum in March 2010.[7] It sold its healthcare division to Discovery Holdings, a South African business, in May 2010[8] and went on to buy Focus Solutions Group, a financial software company, for £42m in December 2010.[9]

30 Lothian Road in Edinburgh


In February 2013, the company announced that it had acquired the private client division of Newton Management Limited, a UK wealth management unit of BNY Mellon, in a deal worth up to £83.5 million.[10] In March 2014, it was announced that Standard Life was in advanced talks to purchase rival Phoenix Group Holdings’ Ignis Asset Management for around £400 million.[11] Towards the end of the month, Standard Life completed the acquisition for a fee of £390 million.[12] In September 2014, Standard Life agreed to sell its Canadian operations to The Manufacturers Life Insurance Company, a subsidiary of Manulife Financial Corporation.[13] It completed this sale on 30 January 2015 for a cash consideration of C$4.0bn. The transaction included a Global Collaboration Agreement where Manulife will seek to distribute Standard Life Investments' funds in Canada, the US and Asia.[14] In a round-up of 2014 business, pre-tax profits rose by 19% to £604m, fee-based revenue during the year grew 14% to 1.43bn, and over 340,000 auto-enrolment customers were added. The pay and bonus of Chief Executive, David Nish, rose by 23% to almost £5.5m.[15]
In February 2015, Standard Life announced it was launching a wholly owned, UK-wide, financial advice business saying it was “responding to fundamental changes that were driving unprecedented demand for advice from customers”.[16] In doing so, it confirmed that it had entered into an agreement with Skipton Building Society to purchase Pearson Jones,[17] a firm of financial advisers and paraplanners, and this acquisition was completed in May 2015 when the name of its new financial advice business was announced as “1825” – a reference to the year Standard Life was founded.[18] In July 2016, a property investment fund managed by Standard Life Investments froze withdrawals after experiencing liquidity issues.[19][20]
In March 2017, Standard Life reached an agreement to merge with Aberdeen Asset Management, in an all-share merger, subject to shareholder approval.[21]
Operations[edit]
Standard Life is an investment company, headquartered in Edinburgh, with operations across the globe.[22] It employs around 6,300 people internationally[2] through businesses in the UK, Europe, North America, Asia and Australasia. It has around 4.5 million customers and clients across 45 countries and is responsible for the administration of over £360bn of their assets. The company has a further 25 million customers through its Indian and Chinese associate and joint venture businesses - HDFC Life in India and Heng An Standard Life in China.[22]
In the UK, Standard Life also owns three subsidiary businesses: Focus Solutions, a software and consultancy business, threesixty, a services provider and Vebnet, a software and services provider.[23]
Standard Life has a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange, and has around 1.2 million individual shareholders.[24] It is also listed in a number of the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI), including the DJSI World, which ranks the world's leading sustainability-driven publicly listed companies.[25]
Senior management[edit]
The company’s board of directors is made up of a Chairman, four Executive Directors and seven non-Executive Directors.[26] The board has nine men and three women. Details of the Chairman and Executive Directors include:

Sir Gerry Grimstone (Chairman) appointed in May 2007

Controversy[edit]
In January 2006, Standard Life were accused of smearing a policy-holder, Michael Hogan, who was not happy with the way the company was being run. An e-mail sent to Standard Life executives and advisors (which was disclosed under the Data Protection Act) revealed an attempt to discredit him.[27]
In January 2007, the head of Standard Life's life and pensions business, Trevor Matthews, used the racist phrase "nigger in the woodpile" while giving a presentation at one of the company's Edinburgh offices. After issuing an apology, Mr Matthews remained in his job and no disciplinary action was taken.[28]
In March 2007 the company announced it would cut 1,000 jobs in an attempt to save an additional £100 million per year in costs.[29] One month later it was highlighted in the company's annual report that three of Standard Life's top executives (Sandy Crombie, Keith Skeoch and Trevor Matthews) were awarded more than £5 million in pay.[30] A Standard Life spokesman defended the awards, citing the leadership's efforts in turning round the company's fortunes.[30]
In February 2014, Standard Life announced that it may move parts of their operations outside Scotland in the event of Scottish independence, if it was necessary to do so.[31]

History[edit]
The Standard Life Assurance Company was established in 1825 and was reincorporated as a mutual assurance company in 1925.[4] During the 19th century it opened offices in Canada, India, China and Uruguay.[4]
In 2006 demutualisation took place and the company was floated on the London Stock Exchange.[5] The company sold Standard Life Bank plc to Barclays plc in January 2010[6] and then acquired the remaining 75 per cent stake in Threesixty, a financial advisory support business, that it did not already own for an undisclosed sum in March 2010.[7] It sold its healthcare division to Discovery Holdings, a South African business, in May 2010[8] and went on to buy Focus Solutions Group, a financial software company, for £42m in December 2010.[9]

In February 2013, the company announced that it had acquired the private client division of Newton Management Limited, a UK wealth management unit of BNY Mellon, in a deal worth up to £83.5 million.[10] In March 2014, it was announced that Standard Life was in advanced talks to purchase rival Phoenix Group Holdings’ Ignis Asset Management for around £400 million.[11] Towards the end of the month, Standard Life completed the acquisition for a fee of £390 million.[12] In September 2014, Standard Life agreed to sell its Canadian operations to The Manufacturers Life Insurance Company, a subsidiary of Manulife Financial Corporation.[13] It completed this sale on 30 January 2015 for a cash consideration of C$4.0bn. The transaction included a Global Collaboration Agreement where Manulife will seek to distribute Standard Life Investments' funds in Canada, the US and Asia.[14] In a round-up of 2014 business, pre-tax profits rose by 19% to £604m, fee-based revenue during the year grew 14% to 1.43bn, and over 340,000 auto-enrolment customers were added. The pay and bonus of Chief Executive, David Nish, rose by 23% to almost £5.5m.[15]
In February 2015, Standard Life announced it was launching a wholly owned, UK-wide, financial advice business saying it was “responding to fundamental changes that were driving unprecedented demand for advice from customers”.[16] In doing so, it confirmed that it had entered into an agreement with Skipton Building Society to purchase Pearson Jones,[17] a firm of financial advisers and paraplanners, and this acquisition was completed in May 2015 when the name of its new financial advice business was announced as “1825” – a reference to the year Standard Life was founded.[18] In July 2016, a property investment fund managed by Standard Life Investments froze withdrawals after experiencing liquidity issues.[19][20]
In March 2017, Standard Life reached an agreement to merge with Aberdeen Asset Management, in an all-share merger, subject to shareholder approval.[21]
Operations[edit]
Standard Life is an investment company, headquartered in Edinburgh, with operations across the globe.[22] It employs around 6,300 people internationally[2] through businesses in the UK, Europe, North America, Asia and Australasia. It has around 4.5 million customers and clients across 45 countries and is responsible for the administration of over £360bn of their assets. The company has a further 25 million customers through its Indian and Chinese associate and joint venture businesses - HDFC Life in India and Heng An Standard Life in China.[22]
In the UK, Standard Life also owns three subsidiary businesses: Focus Solutions, a software and consultancy business, threesixty, a services provider and Vebnet, a software and services provider.[23]
Standard Life has a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange, and has around 1.2 million individual shareholders.[24] It is also listed in a number of the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI), including the DJSI World, which ranks the world's leading sustainability-driven publicly listed companies.[25]
Senior management[edit]
The company’s board of directors is made up of a Chairman, four Executive Directors and seven non-Executive Directors.[26] The board has nine men and three women. Details of the Chairman and Executive Directors include:

Sir Gerry Grimstone (Chairman) appointed in May 2007
Keith Skeoch (Chief Executive) appointed on 5 August 2015, replacing David Nish
Luke Savage (Chief Financial Officer) appointed in August 2014
Colin Clark (Director, Global Client Group) appointed in November 2015
Barry O'Dwyer (CEO, Pensions and Savings) appointed in March 2017

The non-executive directors are:

Pierre Danon, appointed in October 2011
Noel Harwerth, appointed in July 2012
Lynne Peacock, appointed in April 2012
Martin Pike, appointed in September 2013
Kevin Parry, appointed in October 2014
Melanie Gee, appointed in November 2015
John Devine, appointed in July 2016

Controversy[edit]
In January 2006, Standard Life were accused of smearing a policy-holder, Michael Hogan, who was not happy with the way the company was being run. An e-mail sent to Standard Life executives and advisors (which was disclosed under the Data Protection Act) revealed an attempt to discredit him.[27]
In January 2007, the head of Standard Life's life and pensions business, Trevor Matthews, used the racist phrase "nigger in the woodpile" while giving a presentation at one of the company's Edinburgh offices. After issuing an apology, Mr Matthews remained in his job and no disciplinary action was taken.[28]
In March 2007 the company announced it would cut 1,000 jobs in an attempt to save an additional £100 million per year in costs.[29] One month later it was highlighted in the company's annual report that three of Standard Life's top executives (Sandy Crombie, Keith Skeoch and Trevor Matthews) were awarded more than £5 million in pay.[30] A Standard Life spokesman defended the awards, citing the leadership's efforts in turning round the company's fortunes.[30]
In February 2014, Standard Life announced that it may move parts of their operations outside Scotland in the event of Scottish independence, if it was necessary to do so.[31]

Governance

Our team



Our team
As one of the largest institutional investors in the UK, it’s only fitting we should have dedicated governance and stewardship teams to focus on developing and implementing a professional approach to the field.
In fact, our teams have been around for a considerable time. Our governance and stewardship team was set up in 1992, and we’re seen as one of the leading UK institutions in this area.
A reputation  that opens doors
Our financial strength and professional reputation encourage companies’ management to consider our views, and take them into account where possible.
Our governance and stewardship team works closely with the companies we invest in, promoting compliance with UK and international codes of corporate governance. Companies are also required to demonstrate that they manage their social and environmental impacts effectively. By holding frequent one-to-one meetings with directors of companies and company secretaries, we’re able to raise any concerns with them directly. We also publicise our concerns where appropriate – you’ll find examples of this in the Letters, Statements & Articles section.

The UK Stewardship Code



The UK Stewardship Code - Compliance and Contacts
Standard Life Investments is a strong supporter of the principles of good stewardship that are set out in the Stewardship Code published by the Financial Reporting Council in July 2010, and updated in September 2012. We believe that it is mutually beneficial for companies and long-term investors such as Standard Life Investments to have a relationship based on accountability, engagement and trust. Such a relationship helps to ensure that each has a good understanding of the other's views and expectations and it enables us to exercise constructive influence as and when appropriate. We believe that this serves to enhance the long-term value of our clients' investments and to protect their interests when necessary.
Likewise, it is very important that we are accountable to our clients for our stewardship of their assets. Accordingly, we seek to have a transparent and open dialogue with them about how we engage with the companies in their portfolios. Their feedback helps to shape our views and approach.
We are signatories to the Stewardship Code. We comply fully with all the Code's principles in respect of our UK equity investments, as described in the links below. We shall continue to take steps to strengthen our stewardship capabilities in line with the Code in respect of our European equity investments. We shall also use our best endeavours to apply the spirit of the Code's principles in respect of our other global equity investments on a case-by-case basis.

Principle 1 – How we discharge our stewardship responsibilities
Principle 2 – Our policy for managing conflicts of interests
Principle 3 – How we monitor our investee companies
Principle 4 – Our guidelines for escalating engagement
Principle 5 – Our willingness to act collectively with other investors
Principle 6 – Our policy on voting and voting disclosure
Principle 7 – How we report on stewardship to our clients

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
