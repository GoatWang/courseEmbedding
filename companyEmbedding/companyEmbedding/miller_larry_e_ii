What else should I know before hiring Larry E Miller, Ii



Licensed contractors in Georgia are required to pass a criminal background check.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Georgia, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk.

BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

                                The Politics of Internal Auditing
                            



                                By: Patricia K. Miller, CIA, QIAL, CRMA, and Larry E. Rittenberg, PhD, CIA, CPA
                            


                                When an internal audit reflects poorly on someone, the potential for increased political pressure on chief audit executives (CAEs) is heightened. This publication shows you how to effectively navigate political challenges and add value to your organization.

Organizations are, by definition, political. They are comprised of people with: 

      Individual goals and objectives.
      Different approaches to accomplishing business objectives.
      Distinct value systems.
      Varied motivational reward systems.

This research report addresses political pressure on chief audit executives (CAEs) and their internal audit departments. Having surveyed nearly 500 CAEs from various business sectors around the world, researchers Patty Miller and Larry Rittenberg share: 

      How effective CAEs work to mitigate political pressure.
      Lessons learned that may help manage political pressure.

The nature of organizations – combined with the basic human nature to succeed and be respected – results in the likelihood that political pressure will always be a risk in any organization.
Research findings reveal: 

      Political pressure comes in many forms.
      Political pressure can be managed and partially mitigated, but it always exists.
      Professional competence is required, but is not sufficient.
      The pressure exists whether the CAE position is career-focused or rotational.

This research points out some steps CAEs can take to: 

      Strengthen organizational culture.
      Improve governance structure.
      Build support for internal auditing.

Generously sponsored by The IIA-Toronto Chapter
Authors Patricia Miller and Dr. Larry Rittenberg delve into the case studies and reveal real-world scenarios internal auditors are facing with politics. More case studies and discussions will be released in this four-part video series.
Item Number: 10.5060
