Important Information

 

* Volatility represented by annualized standard deviation. Compared to the MSCI World Index, an unmanaged free float-adjusted market capitalization index that is designed to measure the equity market performance of developed markets. The index consists of 23 developed countries, including the United States. It is not possible to invest directly in an unmanaged index.


Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses which may be obtained by visiting the iShares Fund and BlackRock Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.


The fund is actively managed and its characteristics will vary.  Stock values fluctuate in price so the value of your investment can go down depending on market conditions.  International investing involves special risks including, but not limited to currency fluctuations, illiquidity and volatility. These risks may be heightened for investments in emerging markets.  The issuers of unsponsored depositary receipts are not obligated to disclose information that is, in the United States, considered material.  Investing in long/short strategies presents the opportunity for significant losses, including the loss of your total investment. Such strategies have the potential for heightened volatility and in general, are not suitable for all investors.  The fund may use derivatives to hedge its investments or to seek to enhance returns. Derivatives entail risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and increase volatility.  The fund may engage in active and frequent trading, resulting in short-term capital gains or losses that could increase an investors tax liability.  Short-selling entails special risks. If the fund makes short sales in securities that increase in value, the fund will lose value. Any loss on short positions may or may not be offset by investing short-sale proceeds in other investments.  Investing in small- and mid-cap companies may entail greater risk than large-cap companies, due to shorter operating histories, less seasoned management or lower trading volumes.  Morningstar Analyst Rating™is not a credit or risk rating. It is a subjective evaluation performed by Morningstar’s manager research group, which consists of various Morningstar, Inc. subsidiaries (“Manager Research Group”). In the United States, that subsidiary is Morningstar Research Services LLC, which is registered with and governed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The Manager Research Group evaluates funds based on five key pillars, which are process, performance, people, parent, and price. The Manager Research Group uses this five pillar evaluation to determine how they believe funds are likely to perform relative to a benchmark, or in the case of exchange-traded funds and index mutual funds, a relevant peer group, over the long term on a risk-adjusted basis. They consider quantitative and qualitative factors in their research, and the weight of each pillar may vary. The Analyst Rating scale is Gold, Silver, Bronze, Neutral, and Negative. A Morningstar Analyst Rating of Gold, Silver, or Bronze reflects the Manager Research Group’s conviction in a fund’s prospects for outperformance. Analyst Ratings ultimately reflect the Manager Research Group’s overall assessment, are overseen by an Analyst Rating Committee, and are continuously monitored and reevaluated at least every 14 months. For more detailed information about Morningstar’s Analyst Rating, including its methodology, please go to global.morningstar.com/managerdisclosures/. The Morningstar Analyst Rating (i) should not be used as the sole basis in evaluating a fund, (ii) involves unknown risks and uncertainties which may cause Analyst expectations not to occur or to differ significantly from what they expected, and (iii) should not be considered an offer or solicitation to buy or sell the fund.


Performance results reflect past performance and are no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value of shares will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. All returns assume reinvestment of all dividends. Performance information shown without sales charge would have been lower if the applicable sales charge had been included. Performance during periods of exceptional market conditions should not be expected to be repeated in a normal market environment. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.Fund details, holdings and characteristics are as of the date noted and subject to change. Yields are based on income earned for the period cited and on the Fund's NAV at the end of the period. Some BlackRock funds make distributions of ordinary income and capital gains at calendar year end. Those distributions temporarily cause extraordinarily high yields. There is no assurance that a fund will repeat that yield in the future. Subsequent monthly distributions that do not include ordinary income or capital gains in the form of dividends will likely be lower.

FT is not responsible for any use of content by you outside its scope as stated in the FT Terms & Conditions.Morningstar Rating(TM) The Morningstar Rating(TM) for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar RiskAdjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36- 59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

The Long/Short Model Flexibility of Calamos Phineus Long/Short Fund

Flexible asset allocation allows for all investment styles, market caps and geographic regions depending on the market environment
Comprehensive Approach assesses stock, industry, style country and market factors
Knowledge-based industry concentration includes technology, communications, media, financials and health care

Portfolio Fit

                    The fund may be suitable for investors seeking to improve their risk-adjusted returns via an alternative solution that complements and diversifies their
                    global or U.S. equity portfolio.
                

An Alternative Manager with a Long-Term Record of Compelling Performance

                    As a pioneer in alternatives, Calamos Investments has more than 20 years of experience investing
                    outside of traditional asset classes and currently manages $4.5 billion in alternative assets (as of February 28, 2017). In 2015,
                    Calamos acquired Phineus Partners LP. Over the course of 14 years, Phineus has demonstrated its ability to deliver solid performance through an institutional-strength long/short strategy that combines the best of bottom-up equity investing with macro-analysis.
                
GROWTH OF $10K: OUTPERFORMANCE SINCE INCEPTION

                    The chart below shows how a hypothetical $10,000 investment in the fund outperformed the benchmark MSCI World Index since the
                    fund’s inception.
                



Click here to view complete performance data. Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be lower
                        or higher than the performance quoted. The principal value and return of an investment will fluctuate so that your shares, when
                        redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance reflected at NAV does not include the Fund’s maximum
                        front-end sales load of 4.75%. Had it been included, the Fund’s return would have been lower. For the most recent month end performance

                    The performance shown for periods prior to 4/5/16 is the performance of a predecessor investment vehicle (the “Predecessor Fund”). The Predecessor Fund was reorganized into the Fund on 4/5/16, the date upon which the Fund commenced operations. On 10/1/15 the parent company of Calamos Advisors, purchased Phineus Partners LP, the prior investment adviser to the Predecessor Fund (“Phineus”), and Calamos Advisors served as the Predecessor Fund’s investment adviser between 10/1/2015 until it was reorganized into the Fund. Phineus and Calamos Advisors managed the Predecessor Fund using investment policies, objectives, guidelines and
                    restrictions that were in all material respects equivalent to those of the Fund. Phineus and Calamos Advisors managed the Predecessor Fund in this manner either directly or indirectly by investing all of the Predecessor Fund’s assets in a master fund structure. The Predecessor Fund performance information has been adjusted to reflect Class A and I shares expenses. However, the Predecessor Fund was not a registered mutual fund and thus was not subject to the same investment and tax restrictions as
                    the Fund. If it had been, the Predecessor Fund’s performance may have been lower.
                    
Important Risk Information
                    Alternative investments may not be suitable for all investors. The fund takes long positions in companies that are expected to outperform the equity markets, while taking
                    short positions in companies that are expected to underperform the equity markets and for hedging purposes. The fund may lose
                    money should the securities the fund is long decline in value or if the securities the fund has shorted increase in value,
                    but the ultimate goal is to realize returns in both rising and falling equity markets while providing a degree of insulation
                    from increased market volatility.
                    
                    An investment in the Fund(s) is subject to risks, and you could lose money on your investment in the Fund(s). There can be no assurance that the Fund(s) will achieve its
                    investment objective. Your investment in the Fund(s) is not a deposit in a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or
                    any other government agency. The risks associated with an investment in the Fund(s) can increase during times of significant market volatility. The Fund(s) also has specific
                    principal risks, which are described below. More detailed information regarding these risks can be found in the Fund's prospectus.
                    The principal risks of investing in the Fund include: equity securities risk consisting of market prices declining in general, short sale risk consisting of potential for
                    unlimited losses, leverage risk, and foreign securities risk.
                    As a result of political or economic instability in foreign countries, there can be special risks associated with investing in foreign securities, including fluctuations
                    in currency exchange rates, increased price volatility and difficulty obtaining information. In addition, emerging markets may present additional risk due to potential for
                    greater economic and political instability in less developed countries.
                    
                    The MSCI World Index is a market capitalization weighted index composed of companies representative of the market structure of developed market countries
                    in North America, Europe and Asia/Pacific region.
                    
                    The S&P 500 Index is generally considered representative of the U.S. stock market.
                    
                    The HFRI Equity Hedge Index consists of funds where portfolio managers maintain long and short positions in primarily equity and derivative securities.
                    
                    The Morningstar Long/Short Equity Category funds take a net long stock position, meaning the total market risk from the long positions is not completely
                    offset by the market risk of the short positions. Total return, therefore, is a combination of the return from market exposure (beta) plus any value-added from stock
                    picking or market-timing (alpha).
                    

                        Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted.
                        The principal value and investment return of an investment will fluctuate so that your shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
                    

                    Unmanaged index returns assume reinvestment of any and all distributions and, unlike fund returns, do not reflect fees, expenses or sales charges. Investors cannot invest directly in an index.

RISK-ADJUSTED PERFORMANCE SINCE INCEPTION












                        Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. The principal value and return of an investment will fluctuate so that your shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance reflected at NAV does not include the Fund’s maximum front-end sales load of 4.75%. Had it been included, the Fund’s return would have been lower. For the most recent month end performance information click on the performance tab.
                    

                    The performance shown for periods prior to 4/5/16 is the performance of a predecessor investment vehicle (the “Predecessor Fund”). The Predecessor
                    Fund was reorganized into the Fund on 4/5/16, the date upon which the Fund commenced operations. On 10/1/15 the parent company of Calamos
                    Advisors, purchased Phineus Partners LP, the prior investment adviser to the Predecessor Fund (“Phineus”), and Calamos Advisors served as the Predecessor
                    Fund’s investment adviser between 10/1/2015 until it was reorganized into the Fund. Phineus and Calamos Advisors managed the Predecessor
                    Fund using investment policies, objectives, guidelines and restrictions that were in all material respects equivalent to those of the Fund. Phineus and
                    Calamos Advisors managed the Predecessor Fund in this manner either directly or indirectly by investing all of the Predecessor Fund’s assets in a master
                    fund structure. The Predecessor Fund performance information has been adjusted to reflect Class A and I shares expenses. However, the Predecessor
                    Fund was not a registered mutual fund and thus was not subject to the same investment and tax restrictions as the Fund. If it had been, the Predecessor
                    Fund’s performance may have been lower.
                    
Alpha is the measurement of performance on a risk adjusted basis. A positive alpha shows that performance of a portfolio was higher than expected given the risk. A negative alpha shows that the performance was less than expected given the risk.
                    
Sharpe ratio is a calculation that reflects the reward per each unit of risk in a portfolio. The higher the ratio, the better the portfolio’s risk-adjusted return is.
                    
Downside capture ratio measures manager’s performance in down markets as defined by the named index. A down-market is defined as those periods (months or quarters) in which named index return is less than 0. In essence, it tells you what percentage of the down-market was captures by the manager. For example, if the ratio is 110%, the manager has captured 110% of the down-market and therefore underperformed the market on the downside.
                    
Upside capture ratio measures a manager’s performance in up markets relative to the named index itself. It is calculated by taking the security’s upside capture return and dividing it by the benchmark’s upside capture return.
                    
The MSCI World Index is a market capitalization weighted index composed of companies representative of the market structure of developed market countries in North America, Europe and Asia/Pacific region.
                    
The S&P 500 Index is generally considered representative of the U.S. stock market.
                    
The HFRI Equity Hedge Index consists of funds where portfolio managers maintain long and short positions in primarily equity and derivative securities.
                    
The Morningstar Long/Short Equity Category funds take a net long stock position, meaning the total market risk from the long positions is not completely offset by the market risk of the short positions. Total return, therefore, is a combination of the return from market exposure (beta) plus any value-added from stock-picking or market-timing (alpha).
                    
                    Calendar year returns measure net investment income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments for each period specified. Average annual
                    total return measures net investment income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments as an annualized average. All performance shown
                    assumes assumes reinvestment of dividends and capital gains distributions. The Fund also offers Class C Shares, the performance of which may vary. In
                    calculating net investment income, all applicable fees and expenses are deducted from returns.
                    

                        The offering price for Class I shares is the NAV per share with no initial sales charge. There are no contingent deferred sales charges or distribution
                        or service fees with respect to Class I shares. The minimum initial investment required to purchase each Fund’s Class I shares is $1 million.
                        Class I shares are offered primarily for direct investment by investors through certain tax-exempt retirement plans (including 401(k) plans, 457 plans,
                        employer-sponsored 403(b) plans, profit sharing and money purchase pension plans, defined benefit plans and non qualified deferred compensation plans)
                        and by institutional clients, provided such plans or clients have assets of at least $1 million. Class I shares may also be offered to certain other
                        entities or programs, including, but not limited to, investment companies, under certain circumstances.
                    



                Unmanaged index returns assume reinvestment of any and all distributions and, unlike fund returns,
                do not reflect fees, expenses or sales charges. Investors cannot invest directly in an index.

                    There can be no assurance that the Fund(s) will achieve its investment objective. Your investment in the Fund(s) is not a deposit in a bank and is
                    not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or any other government agency. The risks associated with
                    an investment in the Fund(s) can increase during times of signifcant market volatility. The Fund(s) also has specific principal risks, which are
                    described below. More detailed information regarding these risks can be found in the Fund's prospectus.
                    
                    The principal risks of investing in the Calamos Phineus Long/Short Fund include: equity securities risk consisting of market prices declining in general,
                    short sale risk consisting of potential for unlimited losses, leverage risk, and foreign securities risk.

                    Class I shares are offered primarily for direct investment by investors through certain tax-exempt retirement plans (including 401(k) plans, 457 plans,

                    including, but not limited to, investment companies, under certain circumstances.
                

                The gross expense ratio is inclusive of the 1.25% management fee, short dividend and interest expenses (Class A: 0.98%, Class C: 0.93%, Class I: 1.01%); acquired fund fees, other expenses and 12b-1 fees (Class A: 2.06%, Class C: 2.89%); acquired fund fees and other expenses (Class I: 2.03%).
                
                The Fund’s investment advisor has contractually agreed to reimburse Fund expenses through 3/1/19, to the extent necessary so that Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses (excluding taxes, interest, short interest, short dividend expenses, brokerage commissions, acquired fund fees and expenses, and extraordinary or non-routine expenses, if any) of Class A, Class C and Class I are limited to 2.00%, 2.75% and 1.75% of average net assets, respectively.

Class B shares have a declining contingent deferred sales charge over six years, with a maximum of 5% in year one (3.50% for Total Return Bond Fund Class B shares). Class B shares automatically convert to A shares after eight years. There is a 1% contingent deferred sales charge for C shares on certain redemptions within the first year of purchase. Class B and C shares have been adjusted for the contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC). Class I shares are also available for institutional investors.

Important Fund Information 

Calamos Growth, Growth and Income, Opportunistic Value, Global Growth and Income, International Growth, Global Equity and Evolving World Growth Funds may invest in small and mid-size company securities, which generally present greater risk and higher volatility than investments in larger, more established companies. 
Calamos Growth, Growth and Income, Opportunistic Value, Focus Growth, Global Growth and Income, International Growth, Global Equity and Evolving World Growth Funds invest a substantial portion of their assets in equity securities, which are subject to greater fluctuations in market value than other asset classes as a result of such factors as a company's business performance, investor perceptions, stock market trends, and general economic conditions. 
Calamos Global Growth and Income, International Growth, Global Equity and Evolving World Growth Funds may invest up to 100% of assets in foreign securities. Total Return Bond Fund may invest up to 35% and all other Calamos funds up to 25% of assets in foreign securities. Investing outside the U.S. offers both risks and rewards. Increased volatility, changes in the value of foreign currencies, and difficulty in obtaining information are some of the risks involved. 
Global Growth and Income, International Growth, Global Equity, Evolving World Growth and Total Return Bond Funds may invest in securities issued by companies in emerging markets; these may present additional risk due to the potential for greater economic and political instability in less developed countries. 
Calamos High Income Fund invests and Total Return Bond Funds may invest in lower-rated fixed-income securities, often referred to as "junk bonds," which generally present greater risks than higher-quality securities, because of the greater likelihood that the company issuing the lower-rated securities will default on income and principal payments. 
Calamos Growth and Income, Convertible and Market Neutral Income Funds: There are certain risks associated with an investment in a convertible bond such as a default risk—the company issuing a convertible security may be unable to repay principal and interest—and interest rate risk—the convertible may decrease in value if interest rates increase. 
Calamos Market Neutral Income Fund engages in short sales. Short sales involve the risk that the Fund may incur a loss if the market value of a borrowed security increases between the date of the short sale and the date the Fund replaces the security. A short position in a security poses more risk than holding the same security long. Because a short position loses value as the security's price increases, the loss on a short sale is theoretically unlimited. It is possible that the market value of the securities the Fund holds in long positions will decline at the same time that the market value of the securities the Fund has sold short increases, thereby increasing the Fund's potential volatility. The Market Neutral Income Fund engages in short sales of convertible securities' underlying stock, which may increase volatility and portfolio turnover. 
Calamos Total Return Bond Fund may invest in derivative securities, including options, futures contracts and swap agreements. The use of derivatives presents risks different from, and possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in traditional securities. There is no assurance that any derivative strategy used by the Fund will succeed. 
In addition to market risk, there are certain risks associated with an investment in Calamos Total Return Bond Fund, such as default risk, the risk that the company issuing debt securities will be unable to repay principal and interest, and interest rate risk that the security may decrease in value if interest rates increase. 

NOT FDIC INSURED | NO BANK GUARANTEE | MAY LOSE VALUE 

Performance of the Growth Fund reflects the effects of an expense reimbursement that improved results and was in effect until March 31, 2000. 

Performance shown for the Convertible Fund and Global Growth and Income Fund includes the effects of an overpayment of dividends and/ or capital gains distribution to shareholders of certain classes of shares of the Fund (and a corresponding capital contribution by Calamos Advisors LLC), which increased certain return figures. 

1Net asset value is the $U.S. value of a single share excluding any sales charges. NAV Change shows the change in value from the prior business day: + = gain; - = loss; NC = no change. The net asset value of a fund will fluctuate. Please note that total return is considered one of the best measures of overall performance of most mutual fund investments. More complete information and long-term performance is available for each Fund by clicking on any Fund name. Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less than their original cost

Average annual total return measures net investment income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments as an annualized average. All performance shown assumes reinvestment of dividends and capital gains distributions. Performance shown reflects an expense reimbursement that improved results. Load-adjusted returns are adjusted for the maximum front-end sales load of 2.25%* for Class A shares in the following funds: Convertible Fund, Global Convertible Fund, Market Neutral Income Fund, High Income Opportunities Fund, and Total Return Bond Fund. The maximum front-end sales load for Class A shares of all other funds is 4.75%. Effective July 31, 2009, the Funds no longer accepted purchases of Class B shares from new or existing investors, except through qualifying transactions (as further described in the Funds’ prospectuses). Class B shares have a contingent deferred sales charge that declines over the years you own shares, and terminates completely after six years of ownership; and after eight years of ownership, Class B shares automatically convert to Class A shares. As such, it is anticipated that Class B shares will no longer exist within the Calamos Funds after August 2017. There is a 1% contingent deferred sales charge for C shares on certain redemptions within the first year of purchase. Class B and C shares have been adjusted for the contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC). There are no contingent deferred sales charges or distribution or service fees with respect to Class I shares. The minimum initial investment required to purchase each Fund's Class I shares is $1 million.

A private equity fund is a collective investment scheme used for making investments in various equity (and to a lesser extent debt) securities according to one of the investment strategies associated with private equity. Private equity funds are typically limited partnerships with a fixed term of 10 years (often with annual extensions). At inception, institutional investors make an unfunded commitment to the limited partnership, which is then drawn over the term of the fund. From the investors' point of view, funds can be traditional (where all the investors invest with equal terms) or asymmetric (where different investors have different terms).[1][2]
A private equity fund is raised and managed by investment professionals of a specific private equity firm (the general partner and investment advisor). Typically, a single private equity firm will manage a series of distinct private equity funds and will attempt to raise a new fund every 3 to 5 years as the previous fund is fully invested.[1]

Legal structure and terms[edit]




Diagram of the structure of a generic private equity fund


Most private equity funds are structured as limited partnerships and are governed by the terms set forth in the limited partnership agreement or LPA.[3] Such funds have a general partner (GP), which raises capital from cash-rich institutional investors, such as pension plans, universities, insurance companies, foundations, endowments, and high-net-worth individuals, which invest as limited partners (LPs) in the fund. Among the terms set forth in the limited partnership agreement are the following:[4][5]

Term of the partnership: The partnership is usually a fixed-life investment vehicle that is typically 10 years plus some number of extensions.
Management fees: An annual payment made by the investors in the fund to the fund's manager to pay for the private equity firm's investment operations (typically 1 to 2% of the committed capital of the fund.[6]
Distribution Waterfall : The process by which the returned capital will be distributed to the investor, and allocated between Limited and General Partner. This waterfall includes the preferred return : a minimum rate of return (e.g. 8%) which must be achieved before the General Partner can receive any carried interest, and the Carried interest, the share of the profits paid the General Partner above the preferred return (e.g. 20%).[6]
Transfer of an interest in the fund: Private equity funds are not intended to be transferred or traded; however, they can be transferred to another investor. Typically, such a transfer must receive the consent of and is at the discretion of the fund's manager.[7]
Restrictions on the General Partner: The fund's manager has significant discretion to make investments and control the affairs of the fund. However, the LPA does have certain restrictions and controls and is often limited in the type, size, or geographic focus of investments permitted, and how long the manager is permitted to make new investments.[8]

Investments and financing[edit]
A private equity fund typically makes investments in companies (known as portfolio companies). These portfolio company investments are funded with the capital raised from LPs, and may be partially or substantially financed by debt. Some private equity investment transactions can be highly leveraged with debt financing—hence the acronym LBO for "leveraged buy-out". The cash flow from the portfolio company usually provides the source for the repayment of such debt. While billion dollar private equity investments make the headlines, private equity funds also play a large role in middle market businesses.[9]
Such LBO financing most often comes from commercial banks, although other financial institutions, such as hedge funds and mezzanine funds, may also provide financing. Since mid-2007, debt financing has become much more difficult to obtain for private equity funds than in previous years.[10][11]
LBO funds commonly acquire most of the equity interests or assets of the portfolio company through a newly created special purpose acquisition subsidiary controlled by the fund, and sometimes as a consortium of several like-minded funds.[12][13]
Multiples and prices[edit]
The acquisition price of a portfolio company is usually based on a multiple of the company's historical income, most often based on the measure of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). Private equity multiples are highly dependent on the portfolio company's industry, the size of the company, and the availability of LBO financing.[14]
Portfolio company sales (exits)[edit]
A private equity fund's ultimate goal is to sell or exit its investments in portfolio companies for a return, known as internal rate of return (IRR) in excess of the price paid. These exit scenarios historically have been an IPO of the portfolio company or a sale of the company to a strategic acquirer through a merger or acquisition (M&A), also known as a trade sale.[15] A sale of the portfolio company to another private equity firm, also known as a secondary, has become common feature of developed private equity markets.[14]
In prior years, another exit strategy has been a preferred dividend by the portfolio company to the private equity fund to repay the capital investment, sometimes financed with additional debt.[16][17]
Investment features and considerations[edit]
Considerations for investing in private equity funds relative to other forms of investment include:

Substantial entry requirements: With most private equity funds requiring significant initial commitment (usually upwards of $1,000,000), which can be drawn at the manager's discretion over the first few years of the fund.[18]
Limited liquidity: Investments in limited partnership interests (the dominant legal form of private equity investments) are referred to as "illiquid" investments, which should earn a premium over traditional securities, such as stocks and bonds. Once invested, liquidity of invested funds may be very difficult to achieve before the manager realizes the investments in the portfolio because an investor's capital may be locked-up in long-term investments for as long as twelve years. Distributions may be made only as investments are converted to cash with limited partners typically having no right to demand that sales be made.[19]
Investment Control: Nearly all investors in private equity are passive and rely on the manager to make investments and generate liquidity from those investments. Typically, governance rights for limited partners in private equity funds are minimal. However, in some cases, Limited Partners with substantial investment enjoy special rights and terms of investment.[20]
Unfunded Commitments: An investor's commitment to a private equity fund is satisfied over time as the general partner makes capital calls on the investor. If a private equity firm cannot find suitable investment opportunities, it will not draw on an investor's commitment, and an investor may potentially invest less than expected or committed.[4][10]
Investment Risks: Given the risks associated with private equity investments, an investor can lose all of its investment. The risk of loss of capital is typically higher in venture capital funds, which invest in companies during the earliest phases of their development or in companies with high amounts of financial leverage. By their nature, investments in privately held companies tend to be riskier than investments in publicly traded companies.[21]
High returns: Consistent with the risks outlined above, private equity can provide high returns, with the best private equity managers significantly outperforming the public markets.[22]

For the above-mentioned reasons, private equity fund investment is for investors who can afford to have capital locked up for long periods and who can risk losing significant amounts of money. These disadvantages are offset by the potential benefits of annual returns, which may range up to 30% for successful funds.[23]
