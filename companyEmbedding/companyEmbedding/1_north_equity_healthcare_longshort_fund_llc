What is 'Long/Short Equity'
Long/short equity is an investing strategy of taking long positions in stocks that are expected to appreciate and short positions in stocks that are expected to decline. A long/short equity strategy seeks to minimize market exposure, while profiting from stock gains in the long positions and price declines in the short positions. Although this may not always be the case, the strategy would be profitable on a net basis as long as the long positions generate more profit than the short positions, or the other way around. The long/short equity strategy is popular with hedge funds, many of which employ a market-neutral strategy where the dollar amounts of the long and short positions are equal.

BREAKING DOWN 'Long/Short Equity'
While many hedge funds also employ a long/short equity strategy with a long bias (such as 130/30, where long exposure is 130% and short exposure is 30%), comparatively fewer hedge funds employ a short bias to their long/short strategy.
Long/short equity strategies can be differentiated in a number of ways – by market geography (advanced economies, emerging markets, Europe, etc.), sector (energy, technology, etc.), investment philosophy (value or growth) and so on. An example of a long/short equity strategy with a broad mandate would be a global equity growth fund; an example of a relatively narrow mandate would be an emerging markets healthcare fund.
A popular variation of the long/short model is that of the “pair trade," which involves offsetting a long position on a stock with a short position on another stock in the same sector. For example, an investor in the technology space may take a long position in Microsoft and offset that with a short position in Intel. If the investor buys 1,000 shares of Microsoft at $33 each, and Intel is trading at $22, the short leg of this paired trade would involve purchasing 1,500 Intel shares so that the dollar amounts of the long and short positions are equal.
The ideal situation for this long/short strategy would be for Microsoft to appreciate and for Intel to decline. If Microsoft rises to $35 and Intel falls to $21, the overall profit on this strategy would be $3,500. Even if Intel advances to $23 – since the same factors typically drive stocks up or down in a specific sector – the strategy would still be profitable at $500, although much less so.
To get around the fact that stocks within a sector generally tend to move up or down in unison, long/short strategies frequently tend to use different sectors for the long and short legs. For example, if interest rates are rising, a hedge fund may short interest-sensitive sectors such as utilities, and go long on defensive sectors such as health care.

 Hedge Fund Strategy - Equity Long-Short
An  equity long-short strategy is an investing strategy, used primarily by hedge  funds, that involves taking long positions in stocks that are expected to  increase in value and short positions in stocks that are expected to decrease  in value.
You  may know that taking a long position in a stock simply means buying it: If the  stock increases in value, you will make money. On the other hand, taking a  short position in a stock means borrowing a stock you don’t own (usually from  your broker), selling it, then hoping it declines in value, at which time you  can buy it back at a lower price than you paid for it and return the borrowed  shares.
Hedge  funds using equity long-short strategies simply do this on a grander scale. At  its most basic level, an equity long-short strategy consists of buying an  undervalued stock and shorting an overvalued stock. Ideally, the long position  will increase in value, and the short position will decline in value. If this  happens, and the positions are of equal size, the hedge fund will benefit. That  said, the strategy will work even if the long position declines in value, provided  that the long position outperforms the short position. Thus, the goal of any  equity long-short strategy is to minimize exposure to the market in general,  and profit from a change in the difference, or spread, between two stocks. 
That  may sound complicated, so let’s look at a hypothetical example. Let’s say a  hedge fund takes a $1 million long position in Pfizer and a $1 million short  position in Wyeth, both large pharmaceutical companies. With these positions,  any event that causes all pharmaceutical stocks to fall will lead to a loss on  the Pfizer position and a profit on the Wyeth position. Similarly, an event  that causes both stocks to rise will have little effect, since the positions  balance each other out. So, the market risk is minimal. Why, then, would a  portfolio manager take such a position? Because he or she thinks Pfizer will  perform better than Wyeth. 
Equity  long-short strategies such as the one described, which hold equal dollar  amounts of long and short positions, are called market neutral strategies. But  not all equity long-short strategies are market neutral. Some hedge fund  managers will maintain a long bias, as is the case with so-called “130/30”  strategies. With these strategies, hedge funds have 130% exposure to long  positions and 30% exposure to short positions. Other structures are also used,  such as 120% long and 20% short. (Few hedge funds have a long-term short bias,  since the equity markets tend to move up over time.) 
Equity  long-short managers can also be distinguished by the geographic market in which  they invest, the sector in which they invest (financial, health care or  technology, for example) or their investment style (value or quantitative, for  example). Buying and selling two related stocks—for example, two stocks in the  same region or industry—is called a “paired trade” model. It may limit risk to  a specific subset of the market instead of the market in general.
Equity  long-short strategies have been used by sophisticated investors, such as  institutions, for years. They became increasingly popular among individual  investors as traditional strategies struggled in the most recent bear market,  highlighting the need for investors to consider expanding their portfolios into  innovative financial solutions.
   
  Equity  long-short strategies are not without risks. These strategies have all the  generic hedge fund risks: For example, hedge funds are typically not as liquid  as mutual funds, meaning it is more difficult to sell shares; the strategies  they use could lead to significant losses; and they can have high fees.  Additionally, equity long-short strategies have some unique risks. The main one  is that the portfolio manager must correctly predict the relative performance  of two stocks, which can be difficult. Another risk results from what is  referred to in the industry as “beta mismatch.” While this is more complicated  that we can explain in detail here, essentially, it means that 
when  the stock market declines sharply, long positions could lose more than short  positions. 
In  summary, equity long-short strategies may help increase returns in difficult  market environments, but also involve some risk. As a result, investors  considering these strategies may want to ensure that their hedge funds follow  strict rules to evaluate market risks and find good investment opportunities.

Important Information

 

* Volatility represented by annualized standard deviation. Compared to the MSCI World Index, an unmanaged free float-adjusted market capitalization index that is designed to measure the equity market performance of developed markets. The index consists of 23 developed countries, including the United States. It is not possible to invest directly in an unmanaged index.


Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses which may be obtained by visiting the iShares Fund and BlackRock Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.


The fund is actively managed and its characteristics will vary.  Stock values fluctuate in price so the value of your investment can go down depending on market conditions.  International investing involves special risks including, but not limited to currency fluctuations, illiquidity and volatility. These risks may be heightened for investments in emerging markets.  The issuers of unsponsored depositary receipts are not obligated to disclose information that is, in the United States, considered material.  Investing in long/short strategies presents the opportunity for significant losses, including the loss of your total investment. Such strategies have the potential for heightened volatility and in general, are not suitable for all investors.  The fund may use derivatives to hedge its investments or to seek to enhance returns. Derivatives entail risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and increase volatility.  The fund may engage in active and frequent trading, resulting in short-term capital gains or losses that could increase an investors tax liability.  Short-selling entails special risks. If the fund makes short sales in securities that increase in value, the fund will lose value. Any loss on short positions may or may not be offset by investing short-sale proceeds in other investments.  Investing in small- and mid-cap companies may entail greater risk than large-cap companies, due to shorter operating histories, less seasoned management or lower trading volumes.  Morningstar Analyst Rating™is not a credit or risk rating. It is a subjective evaluation performed by Morningstar’s manager research group, which consists of various Morningstar, Inc. subsidiaries (“Manager Research Group”). In the United States, that subsidiary is Morningstar Research Services LLC, which is registered with and governed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The Manager Research Group evaluates funds based on five key pillars, which are process, performance, people, parent, and price. The Manager Research Group uses this five pillar evaluation to determine how they believe funds are likely to perform relative to a benchmark, or in the case of exchange-traded funds and index mutual funds, a relevant peer group, over the long term on a risk-adjusted basis. They consider quantitative and qualitative factors in their research, and the weight of each pillar may vary. The Analyst Rating scale is Gold, Silver, Bronze, Neutral, and Negative. A Morningstar Analyst Rating of Gold, Silver, or Bronze reflects the Manager Research Group’s conviction in a fund’s prospects for outperformance. Analyst Ratings ultimately reflect the Manager Research Group’s overall assessment, are overseen by an Analyst Rating Committee, and are continuously monitored and reevaluated at least every 14 months. For more detailed information about Morningstar’s Analyst Rating, including its methodology, please go to global.morningstar.com/managerdisclosures/. The Morningstar Analyst Rating (i) should not be used as the sole basis in evaluating a fund, (ii) involves unknown risks and uncertainties which may cause Analyst expectations not to occur or to differ significantly from what they expected, and (iii) should not be considered an offer or solicitation to buy or sell the fund.


Performance results reflect past performance and are no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value of shares will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. All returns assume reinvestment of all dividends. Performance information shown without sales charge would have been lower if the applicable sales charge had been included. Performance during periods of exceptional market conditions should not be expected to be repeated in a normal market environment. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.Fund details, holdings and characteristics are as of the date noted and subject to change. Yields are based on income earned for the period cited and on the Fund's NAV at the end of the period. Some BlackRock funds make distributions of ordinary income and capital gains at calendar year end. Those distributions temporarily cause extraordinarily high yields. There is no assurance that a fund will repeat that yield in the future. Subsequent monthly distributions that do not include ordinary income or capital gains in the form of dividends will likely be lower.

				*Performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance is not a guarantee of future
				results and current performance may be higher or lower than performance quoted. Investment returns

				their original cost. 
				

 
				After Tax Held returns represent return after taxes on distributions. Assumes shares have not been sold.
				After Tax Sold returns represent the return after taxes on distributions and the sale of fund shares. Returns
				do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Market Price returns are 
                based on the midpoint of the bid/ask spread on the stock exchange on which shares of the fund are listed for

        ETF Characteristics
    

		The fund lists and principally trades its shares on the NYSE Arca, Inc.	
	

		Investors buying or selling fund shares on the secondary market may incur customary brokerage commissions. 
		Market prices may differ to some degree from the net asset value of the shares. Investors who sell fund shares may receive less than the share's net 
		asset value. Shares may be sold throughout the day on the exchange through any brokerage account. However, unlike mutual funds, shares may only be 
		redeemed directly from the fund by authorized participants, in very large creation/redemption units. If the fund's authorized participants are unable 
        to proceed with creation/redemption orders and no other authorized participant is able to step forward to create or redeem, fund shares may trade at 
        a discount to the fund's net asset value and possibly face delisting.	
	





Risk Considerations


    The fund's shares will change in value, and you could lose money by investing in the fund. One of the principal risks of investing in the fund is market risk. Market risk is the risk that a particular security owned by the fund, fund shares or securities in general may fall in value. The fund is subject to management risk because it is an actively managed portfolio. In managing the fund's investment portfolio, the advisor will apply investment techniques and risk analyses that may not have the desired result. There can be no assurance that the fund's investment objective will be achieved.


    The fund may invest in small capitalization and mid capitalization companies. Such companies may experience greater price volatility than larger, more established companies. Equity securities prices fluctuate for several reasons, including changes in investors' perceptions of the financial condition of an issuer or the general condition of the stock market.



    An investment in a fund containing securities of non-U.S. issuers is subject to additional risks, including currency fluctuations, political risks, withholding, the lack of adequate financial information, and exchange control restrictions impacting non-U.S. issuers. The fund may invest in depositary receipts which may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market.



    Alternative investments may employ complex strategies, have unique investment and risk characteristics and may not be suitable for all investors.



    Shorting may result in greater gains or greater losses. Short selling creates special risks which could result in increased volatility of returns. Because losses on short sales arise from increases in the value of the security sold short, such losses are theoretically unlimited.



    The fund may effect a portion of creations and redemptions for cash rather than in-kind securities. As a result, the fund may be less tax-efficient.



    The fund currently has fewer assets than larger funds, and like other relatively new funds, large inflows and outflows may impact the fund's market exposure for limited periods of time.



    The fund may invest in the shares of other ETFs, and therefore, the fund's investment performance and risks may be related to the investment performance and risks of the underlying ETFs. In general, as a shareholder in other ETFs, the fund bears its ratable share of the underlying ETF's expenses, and would be subject to duplicative expenses to the extent the fund invests in other ETFs.



    The use of futures and other derivatives can lead to losses because of adverse movements in the price or value of the underlying asset, index or rate, which may be magnified by certain features of the derivatives. These risks are heightened when the fund's portfolio managers use derivatives to enhance the fund's return or as a substitute for a position or security, rather than solely to hedge (or offset) the risk of a position or security held by the fund.



    The fund is classified as "non-diversified" and may invest a relatively high percentage of its assets in a limited number of issuers. As a result, the fund may be more susceptible to a single adverse economic or regulatory occurrence affecting one or more of these issuers, experience increased volatility and be highly concentrated in certain issuers.



    First Trust Advisors L.P. is the adviser to the fund. First Trust Advisors L.P. is an affiliate of First Trust Portfolios L.P., the fund's distributor.
