The Original Light Beer
 
Miller Lite is the original light beer. Frederick Miller had an idea that a beer could be light but didn't have to sacrifice on taste, and we've held true to that idea since 1975. 











LEGAL

















 
 
 
See, Smell & Taste the Difference 
 
Miller Lite delivers more golden color, hops, aroma and satisfying taste than anyone would expect in a light beer.











LEGAL









 
 






 

COLOR
Beers can use specialty malts that will impact color, and in this style of beer it could mean a more golden color.
Miller Lite has a deep, radiant, golden quality and brilliant hue











 

AROMA
Aroma is about 80% of what we percieve as flavor. The main aroma in this style of beer comes from the malt and hops used. 
Miller Lite delivers a medium malt and hop aroma, with low fruit and ester notes. 











 

TASTE
When tasting a beer, focus on the initial flavors as well as how the beer tastes and feels after you swallow. 
Miller Lite has a hop forward flavor and solid malt character with soft bitterness. It's smooth with a light to medium body, and has a crispy, clean, dry finish. 
























LEGAL














MOST GOLD MEDAL AWARDED LIGHT BEER
Miller Lite is the most gold medal-awarded light beer* and won the 2016 Gold Award in the World Beer Cup for the light lager category. It's also won numerous other awards throughout it's history. 
*Great American Beer Festival

                                Regular rolled oats (sometimes called old fashioned oats) are made from kilned, whole groats processed by steaming and flaking. These oat flakes are mostly served as a popular, hot breakfast meal. In addition, they are a primary ingredient in a number of applications such as cookies, breads and granola. The thickness and absorbency can be adjusted to fit your needs.

                                Thick rolled oats are made from kilned, whole groats processed by steaming and flaking. These oat flakes provide a textural difference (a more solid "bite" than regular rolled oats) while still maintaining the high nutritional value common in all oat products. Thick rolled oats are frequently used in breads, energy bars and granola. The thickness and absorbency can be adjusted to fit your needs.

                                Quick rolled oats (sometimes called instant oats) are made from kilned, steel-cut oats processed by steaming and flaking. These oat flakes are commonly found in pouches with seasonings and sweeteners for a quick and nutritious breakfast. Quick oats are also used in breads, bars, and granola.

                                Baby rolled oats are made from kilned, fine steel-cut groats processed by steaming and flaking. These oat flakes are frequently used as toppings to garnish and add nutrition to baked goods. Baby oat flakes are useful in applications where a high water absorption is needed, i.e. flavored instant oatmeal.

                                Our coarse Oat Bran is produced by grinding sound and pre-selected, kilned oat groats. The resulting oat meal is separated into a starchy fraction (refined oat flour) and the oat bran to achieve a functional and attractive particle size. It has an ideal ratio of soluble (primarily beta-glucans) to insoluble dietary fibers, high proteins, vitamins and minerals. Its particle size distribution makes it most suitable in the formulation of variety breads, muffins, cereal products and other food systems where the presence and "nutty" flavor of oat bran is desired.

                                Micro-ground oat bran (sometimes called oat bran powder) is a specialty product made from standard oat bran that has been milled down to flour. It works well in extruded products such as breakfast cereals. Particle size can be customized to meet a particular application.

                                Scottish oats are produced from kilned groats. The groats have been carefully sized and dehulled with the objective of producing the highest possible number of whole groats. The whole groats are then cut, classified, toasted, steamed and ground to produce a product with uniform absorption characteristics. The product lends itself well as a porridge, and as an ingredient for cookies and biscuits where texture and hydration are a concern.

                                Our low bran oat flour (debranned, or extracted flour) is produced by removing most of the bran layers from the groats through a systematic grinding and sifting process. As it is typically of lighter color and lower protein, this flour is often found in ready-to-eat (RTE) cereals and other extruded products.

                        Watch Trailer
                        
                        
                    


No matter whom we are, no matter where we live, we're all bound by borders. Many of us are content to live within these borders--others are simply forced to exist within them. But some of us need to break out, burst through, even if what is on the other side is both frightening and unknown. From this comes the tale of one young man's dilemma as he navigates his way through his colliding worlds. Set against Detroit's hip-hop scene in 1995, the story centers on Jimmy Smith Jr., a young white rapper, who struggles to find his voice. The people of Detroit know '8 Mile' as the city limit or a border. It is also a psychological dividing line that separates Jimmy from where and who he wants to be, as he struggles to find the strength and courage to transcend his boundaries.

Great performance by Marshall Mathers, while the relevance of the music and 'lyrics' is brought into clear focus.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsThe Film was excellent, if you're an Eminem fanByRoxy37on 6 June 2017Format: DVD|Verified PurchaseThe Film was excellent, if you're an Eminem fan, still an excellent film if you are not. You have to admire the guy, he got himself out of the gutter, and worked damned hard while doing it.  I would watch it again, but i am his biggest fan, thankfully though I am not Stan ;)  I had a second hand one, and this has never happened with any of the second hand dvd's that I have bought, but this one froze twice, so that was disappointing.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse4.0 out of 5 starsGlad to live in SurreyByThe Coachon 7 June 2017Format: Amazon Video|Verified PurchaseGood movie but not a good advert for American society.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsGrear filmin terms of the stotyline , the characters.

TIG (GTAW)



TIG (tungsten inert gas) welding is used to make precise, critical welds when joining metals such as mild steel, aluminum, or stainless steel.  TIG welding is a two handed process (one hand holds the torch while the other feeds filler metal) and commonly involves a foot pedal or fingertip remote to control the arc voltage while welding.  Like MIG welding, a shielding gas (typically argon) is required.

The Original Light Beer
 
Miller Lite is the original light beer. Frederick Miller had an idea that a beer could be light but didn't have to sacrifice on taste, and we've held true to that idea since 1975. 











LEGAL

















 
 
 
See, Smell & Taste the Difference 
 
Miller Lite delivers more golden color, hops, aroma and satisfying taste than anyone would expect in a light beer.











LEGAL









 
 






 

COLOR
Beers can use specialty malts that will impact color, and in this style of beer it could mean a more golden color.
Miller Lite has a deep, radiant, golden quality and brilliant hue











 

AROMA
Aroma is about 80% of what we percieve as flavor. The main aroma in this style of beer comes from the malt and hops used. 
Miller Lite delivers a medium malt and hop aroma, with low fruit and ester notes. 











 

TASTE
When tasting a beer, focus on the initial flavors as well as how the beer tastes and feels after you swallow. 
Miller Lite has a hop forward flavor and solid malt character with soft bitterness. It's smooth with a light to medium body, and has a crispy, clean, dry finish. 
























LEGAL














MOST GOLD MEDAL AWARDED LIGHT BEER
Miller Lite is the most gold medal-awarded light beer* and won the 2016 Gold Award in the World Beer Cup for the light lager category. It's also won numerous other awards throughout it's history. 
*Great American Beer Festival

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
