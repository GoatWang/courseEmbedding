Titan Equity Partners








About

Business Built Through Partnerships
Titan Equity Partners recognizes that each transaction is as unique as the company and the people behind it.  We are an experienced team of investors who bring both a financial and operating perspective to every investment we make.




Individualized Approach
Since 1990, our flexible approach has allowed us to tailor each structure to meet the individualized objectives of the companies we invest in.  Titan seeks to create a partnership with each management team to facilitate growth and create future value.  While management tackles the day-to-day operations, Titan is most helpful in non-routine problem solving and raising management's sights to set and accomplish strategic objectives.


Successful History
Titan Equity Partners currently has six principal investments in which it plays a key role in the strategic thrust of the company.  Those companies are industrial and consumer product manufacturers, software developers and a specialty service provider.  With three active partners, Titan has the experience, capability, and capacity to successfully complete its next acquisition and to support and guide that company's future development.


Core Values
Titan’s highest priority is helping our companies grow and thrive. As a team, we believe this is best achieved through:

A transparent and straightforward approach
An environment of respect and trust
Hard work and an enjoyment of the process
A genuine appreciation for the contributions of our operating partners

Am nearly out of ink so I am reordering and really like the fact that this order is costing less than my first order due to a % off and free shipping. Your prices are much lower than the big box stores. I am on Social Security and this discount  really helps.Thank You!
