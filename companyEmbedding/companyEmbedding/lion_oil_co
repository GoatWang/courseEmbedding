History
Since its creation in 1922, the El Dorado refinery has been an extremely reliable supplier of petroleum products. Acquired by Lion Oil Company (an affiliate of Delek US Holdings, Inc.) in 1985, the refinery has been expanded and enhanced by hundreds of millions of dollars in capital expenditures to deliver increased production capacity, superior performance, and adherence to new environmental standards. With a throughput capacity of approximately 75,000 barrels of sour crude oil and feedstocks per day, it has become the largest independent refiner of high-sulfur crude oil in its primary market areas of Arkansas, Tennessee, Missouri, Mississippi, and northern Louisiana. Lion Oil continues to develop the facility's production capabilities, and plans to expand capacity to 100,000 barrels per day.
Lion Oil's process units contain special metallurgy that allows  higher sulfur crude oils to be utilized. Under Delek's management, Lion Oil processes a combination of crude oils, including foreign high-sulfur crude from the Saudi Arabian Oil Company, domestic offshore crudes from the Gulf of Mexico, and local onshore domestic crudes. Additional diverse crude oils are obtained through the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port (LOOP) and related salt dome storage.
To support expansion of the refinery's crude capacity and to offset declines in production from local Arkansas producers, Saudi crude and the expanded slate of other foreign and offshore domestic crudes have been utilized. Due to the designed flexibility of the refinery, additional crudes are accessed from numerous sources, including Poseidon, Mesa, Mars, Southern Green Canyon, Eugene Island and the new Thunderhorse field. Iraq, Mexico, Kuwait, and other sources have also been utilized. Lion Oil's subsidiary, Lion Oil Trading and Transportation, Inc., (LOTT) handles crude oil purchases.     Lion Oil's crude supplies are shipped to the refinery through several pipelines, including ExxonMobil, LOOP, Lion Oil subsidiaries Paline Pipeline Company (Paline) and Magnolia Pipeline Company (Magnolia Pipeline), and Lion Oil's domestic gathering system. The connection with LOOP improves supply logistics and increases Lion Oil's access to crude supply. The capacity of the Magnolia Pipeline has been upgraded to supply up to 100% of the refinery's crude supply.
LOTT's extensive local gathering system in Arkansas and Louisiana saves in transportation costs compared to truck options. With a local gathering system of nearly 1,000 miles of pipeline, LOTT delivers domestic crudes to the refinery from southern Arkansas and northern Louisiana mostly from the prolific Smackover field near El Dorado, Arkansas. Lion Oil subsidiary pipelines are operated and maintained by a sophisticated, highly integrated control system located at the El Dorado facility, which features leak detection and total automatic shutdown in the event of damage.
Lion Oil maintains its own proprietary marketing network, supplemented with a diverse exchange partner program throughout the mid-continent. As the Northernmost refinery on the Enterprise Products Partners LP pipeline, Lion Oil benefits from a response time and transportation cost advantage over Gulf Coast refineries when supplying fuels to its primary market area of the central Midwest and Mississippi River corridor.

Lion Oil Company was established in 1922. Thomas Harry (Colonel) Barton was instrumental in the development of the company.[1]




Lion Oil and Ford dealer, Somerville, Tennessee. Circa 1930-1945


In 1955, Lion Oil was sold to the Monsanto Company along with what is now El Dorado Chemical Company. Lion Oil is the only oil refinery Monsanto has owned.[citation needed] Lion Oil was later sold by Monsanto to Tosco.[citation needed]
In 1985, Lion was struggling and on the verge of shutting down and was sold by Tosco to a partnership of Ergon Refining of Jackson, Mississippi, and a group of local investors. This is how it acquired the oil refinery in El Dorado, Arkansas.[2]
In March 2011, Delek US Holdings, Inc. of Brentwood, Tennessee acquired Ergon’s 53.7% majority equity interest; total equity ownership by Delek increased to 88.3%; on April 29, 2011 Delek US became the new operator of Lion Oil.[3]
In October 2011, Delek US Holdings, Inc. acquired the remaining 11.7% interest to increase its equity interest in Lion Oil to 100%.[4]
Lion Oil continues as a petroleum supplier with its headquarters in Brentwood.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
