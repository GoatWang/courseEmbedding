Will cotton or bamboo be better for my needs?

Question
May 3, 2017

I have heard nothing but positive feedback from people who have your cotton sheets.  I must have a perfectly made beds–crisp clean, unwrinkled.  I believe I can get that with the cotton sheets, however, the color selection is limited so I would like to know the difference between the cotton and bamboo sheets.  I dread the great big creases that come standard with any store bought sheet (no matter how high the cost).  What will be better for me?
 


Thomas LeeAnswerAnswerDear Dell,
The main differences between our cotton and bamboo bed linens are:

#1 While both are made from natural fibers, our bamboo sheets have more drape, meaning that if you put a bamboo sheet over a chair the fabric will pretty much conform to the shape of the chair

#2 Both fabrics are very smooth and strong, however our bamboo fabric is somewhat softer in texture while many people consider our cotton fabric to be crisp feeling.

#3. We do not use any chemical additives on our cotton sheets including harsh resins required to make a 100% cotton fabric no iron, which means our 100% Pima cotton bed sheets are not wrinkle free.Our Bamboo fabric is somewhat naturally wrinkle free.

Which one is best for you is a matter of personal preference.

If a crisp texture is most important then I recommend our 100% Pima cotton bed linens
If a naturally wrinkle free bed sheet is most important then I recommend our bamboo bed linens.

Dear Thomas Lee. We have a serious problem with our new sheets. They are so comfortable that we can’t get out of bed!  After years of looking for sheets that are worth the cost plus some, we have found them. You have two new customers for life.
