Focus Ventures, a Canadian-listed exploration company, is developing the Bayovar12 sedimentary phosphate project in northern Peru. The project is located close to existing port facilities and power, within one of the fastest growing fertilizer markets in the world.

Phosphate is a vital nutrient and a key input in modern farming. Management's vision is to build Focus into a world leader in the production of direct application phosphate rock, serving high-demand markets throughout the world and contributing to the improvement of farm yields and sustainable agriculture. 

In May 2016 Focus published a restated Pre-feasibility Study for production of 1MT per year of phosphate rock concentrate grading 24 - 28% P205. The Study anticipates the open pit operation would generate a NPV of $458 million (7.5% discount rate) and a 26.3% IRR, with a payback of 3.9 years. 

Natural, direct application phosphate rock contains no added chemicals and is absorbed into the earth more efficiently and safely than processed fertilizers, saving farmers money, providing better yields and helping to minimize environmental impacts.

VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA--(Marketwired - Jul 27, 2017) -  Focus Ventures Ltd. (TSX VENTURE:FCV) is pleased to announce that it has signed a Memorandum of Understanding ("MOU") with established fertilizer trading company, Indagro S.A., for the off-take of phosphate rock from the Company's Bayovar 12 phosphate project in northern Peru.
Highlights of the MOU are:
Bayovar 12 rock phosphate product to be purchased by well-established international fertilizer merchant.
Volume is up to 1,000,000 tons per annum of the planned annual production.
Initial 5 year term.
Product destined for the direct application agricultural plantation business and phosphate fertilizer producer markets.
Under the MOU, Indagro will purchase, on an FOB Incoterms basis, up to 1,000,000 metric tons per annum of rock phosphate from future production from the Bayovar 12 project. Product will be delivered by Indagro for direct application use by plantations markets and downstream phosphate fertilizer producers. 
Focus President, Gordon Tainton, commented: "Securing our second off-take MOU, this time with Indagro, provides expanded market access for rock phosphate product from Bayovar 12's planned production. 
We look forward to beginning the work with two international fertilizer trading companies to develop customized off-shore marketing strategies which can be implemented within future commercial purchase contracts."
About Indagro S.A.
Indagro is a privately held merchant of fertilizers, intermediates and raw materials founded in 1981. It has four main trade support divisions which are; Technical & Agronomic Advisory, Shipping & Logistics, Trade Finance and Marketing & Distribution.

About Focus
Focus is developing the Bayovar 12 phosphate deposit located 40 km from the coast in the Sechura District of northern Peru. Bayovar 12 hosts a large resource of highly-reactive sedimentary phosphate rock - a key raw material input for phosphate fertilizers and vital to world food production. Reactive phosphate rock from Sechura is a natural, slow-release source of phosphorus that can be applied directly to crops. Once of Focus's objectives is to supply direct application phosphate rock to the agricultural regions of Central and South and Southeast Asia.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Dollar turns lower for the week following GDP report
              
              The U.S. dollar fell on Friday, erasing its gains for the week after a read on economic growth came in below expectations, though analysts said the beleaguered currency was potentially nearing a bottom.

Dollar rises from 13-month low

Focus Ventures Ltd has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with established fertilizer trading company, Keytrade A.G., for the off-take of phosphate rock from the company's Bayovar 12 phosphate project in northern Peru.
Highlights of the MoU are:Bayovar 12 rock phosphate product to be purchased by well-established international fertilizer merchant.

Volume is up to 1 000 000 tpy of the planned annual production.

Initial 5 year term.

Product destined for the direct application agricultural plantation business and phosphate fertilizer producer markets.This MOU marks a significant milestone for the Company since it released the findings of its Pre-Feasibility Study on the Bayovar 12 project in May 2016. Under the MOU, Keytrade will purchase, on an FOB Incoterms basis, up to 1 000 000 metric tons per annum of rock phosphate from future production from the Bayovar 12 project. Product will be delivered by Keytrade for direct application use by plantations markets and downstream phosphate fertilizer producers.Securing this MoU demonstrates that there is demand for Bayovar 12 rock phosphate product, and begins the process for the Company to develop an off-shore marketing strategy with Keytrade that can provide the platform to finalize off-take arrangements.Focus President, Gordon Tainton, commented: "We are very pleased to have secured our first export off-take MoU for rock phosphate from the Bayovar 12 project and we are looking forward to converting this MoU into a commercial purchase contract in the future. This first MoU covers a relatively large share of our planned future production which underpins the development of our project."
