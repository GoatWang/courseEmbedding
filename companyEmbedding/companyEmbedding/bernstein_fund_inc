History[edit]
Origins[edit]
AB traces its origins back to the founding of Sanford C. Bernstein in 1967 as an investment-management firm for private clients. Sanford C. Bernstein & Company was originally co-founded by Zalman Bernstein, Paul P. Bernstein, Shepard D. Osherow, Roger Hertog and Lewis Sanders.[3]
Alliance Capital was founded in 1971 when the investment-management department of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, Inc., merged with the investment-advisory business of Moody's Investor Services, Inc.
2000–2015[edit]
In October 2000, Alliance Capital acquired Sanford C. Bernstein.[4] Alliance Capital's growth equity and corporate fixed-income investing, and its family of retail mutual funds, accompanied Bernstein's value equity and tax-exempt fixed-income management, and its private-client business.
It had about US$800 billion assets under management as of the end of 2007.[5]
2015 onwards[edit]
On January 20, 2015, AllianceBernstein announced a new brand name, "AB" and logo.[6]

Retail Distribution[edit]
The retail part of AB provides financial professionals and individual investors with the investment solutions, research, insights and tools that cover mutual funds, Managed Accounts, College Saving, Retirement Saving, and Insurance Services.[8]
Sell-side Research[edit]
Sell-side research and brokerage services are provided by wholly owned subsidiary Sanford C. Bernstein. It is also well known as Bernstein Research.[9]
Private Wealth Management[edit]
Bernstein Wealth Management, part of AB, provides investment and wealth-planning services for high-net-worth clients in the Americas[10]
529 Savings Plan[edit]
Rhode Island’s 529 savings plan, CollegeBoundfund®, was managed by AB and featured AB mutual funds until 2016.[11] It is now administered by Ascensus College Savings.[12]
Headquarters and locations[edit]

History[edit]
Origins[edit]
AB traces its origins back to the founding of Sanford C. Bernstein in 1967 as an investment-management firm for private clients. Sanford C. Bernstein & Company was originally co-founded by Zalman Bernstein, Paul P. Bernstein, Shepard D. Osherow, Roger Hertog and Lewis Sanders.[3]
Alliance Capital was founded in 1971 when the investment-management department of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, Inc., merged with the investment-advisory business of Moody's Investor Services, Inc.
2000–2015[edit]
In October 2000, Alliance Capital acquired Sanford C. Bernstein.[4] Alliance Capital's growth equity and corporate fixed-income investing, and its family of retail mutual funds, accompanied Bernstein's value equity and tax-exempt fixed-income management, and its private-client business.
It had about US$800 billion assets under management as of the end of 2007.[5]
2015 onwards[edit]
On January 20, 2015, AllianceBernstein announced a new brand name, "AB" and logo.[6]
Organization[edit]
Institutional Investment Management[edit]
AB provides investment services and solutions for institutions across the globe. Typical clients include Defined benefit pension plans and Defined contribution plans. As of December 31, 2014 Institutional Assets under management were US$237 Billion.[7]
Retail Distribution[edit]
The retail part of AB provides financial professionals and individual investors with the investment solutions, research, insights and tools that cover mutual funds, Managed Accounts, College Saving, Retirement Saving, and Insurance Services.[8]
Sell-side Research[edit]
Sell-side research and brokerage services are provided by wholly owned subsidiary Sanford C. Bernstein. It is also well known as Bernstein Research.[9]
Private Wealth Management[edit]
Bernstein Wealth Management, part of AB, provides investment and wealth-planning services for high-net-worth clients in the Americas[10]
529 Savings Plan[edit]
Rhode Island’s 529 savings plan, CollegeBoundfund®, was managed by AB and featured AB mutual funds until 2016.[11] It is now administered by Ascensus College Savings.[12]
