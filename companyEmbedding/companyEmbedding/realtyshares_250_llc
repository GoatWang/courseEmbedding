We have purchased over 1,700 properties in the last 10 years, but raising capital has always been one of the hardest, most time-intensive things we had to do. RealtyShares has made raising capital basically an afterthought – it is simple, streamlined, and FAST.Alex SifakisPresident, JWB Real Estate CapitalCommon QuestionsWhy should I raise money through RealtyShares?
RealtyShares makes raising capital for your investment much easier. Submitting your investment
        opportunity, receiving approval, listing and funding can all be completed in a fraction of the time
        required to deal with banks or institutional funding channels.
We’ll present your opportunity to investors across the country; investors for whom we make real estate
        investing easy. We’ll be providing you with access to a broader capital pool made up of investors that
        want to participate in projects like yours. We’ll come to you as a single investor, in a manner that is
        legally compliant. We’ll take over all the investor communications chores for our investor pool, while at
        the same time your corporate brand is being elevated through its access to this much broader group. And
        our experience will give you the comfort you want that the funding process is going to be smooth and
        efficient.
RealtyShares can become your company’s capital-raising partner. Please contact us at raise@realtyshares.com to discuss your particular project.
What kind of real estate investments can be listed on RealtyShares?
RealtyShares lists investment opportunities involving a variety of real estate property types, including
        multi-family residential, office, industrial, self-storage, retail, and hospitality facilities.
        Single-family residences being used for investment purposes (not owner-occupied) are also the subject of
        many investment opportunities. We generally prefer to finance properties in or near a significant
        metropolitan area, but it all depends on the particular situation.
RealtyShares also offers several different types of financing options. We can do secured real estate
        loans (both first- or second-lien positions); equity financing, usually for properties involving in-place
        cash flow that provide an income component to the investment; and/or “preferred equity” investments
        involving a preferential position in the equity capital structure but with only limited potential upside
        (so that sponsors retain most of the appreciation). If there is a specific property or financing type you
        might be interested in, let us know
        here.
What criteria does RealtyShares have for debt financing?
RealtyShares, through its lending subsidiary RS Lending, Inc., provides business-purposes loans (i.e., no
        owner-occupied properties) secured by both conventional residential properties (such as single-family
        residences) as well as commercial properties (e.g., larger apartment buildings, retail centers, office
        buildings, etc.). We can provide both short-term (usually, 36 months or less) 1st-lien and 2nd-lien debt
        financing on residential properties. We can also provide both bridge or permanent debt financing on
        commercial properties.
RealtyShares looks at a number of criteria in underwriting potential loan opportunities. Generally, we
        look for certain minimum loan-to-cost (LTC) or loan-to-after-repair-value (ARV) criteria. We also like to
        understand the operating plan for the project, and we verify borrower credit and background history.
Each of these criteria vary slightly by situation and loan product; please contact us here to discuss your particular project.
How do you keep my personal information secure?
We go to great lengths to ensure the security of all of our members and our data and use Secure Sockets
        Layer. SSL is the standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a web server and
        a browser. We use 128-bit encryption, which is the same level of encryption used by top national banks. We
        are also regularly audited by third party security firms to ensure compliance with the most rigorous
        security standards.
For added protection, we never store your banking information on our servers and we automatically log you
        out of your account after 30 minutes of inactivity.
How do you choose which real estate companies can raise money through RealtyShares?
We’re looking for companies with a knowledgeable team and a proven strategy and track record. Among other
        diligence inquiries, we will run background and credit checks on the principals of your company, and will
        perform a more thorough review of each project that is initially thought to be a suitable fit for our
        platform. Once we are comfortable with your team and the investment, we can proceed to the details of
        getting your project listed on our platform.
Currently, we list only a relatively small percentage of all of the prospective projects that are
        brought to us.

PRESS RELEASE
San Francisco, Calif., Apr. 7, 2015—RealtyShares, a leading online marketplace for real estate investing, today announced it has raised a $10 million Series A led by Menlo Ventures with participation from General Catalyst Partners. Menlo Ventures’ Managing Director John Jarve, who also sits on the board of Betterment, will be joining the RealtyShares board.
RealtyShares, which is disrupting the real estate investment market, previously raised $1.9 million in seed funding from General Catalyst and 500Startups. The company will use the new funds to build and grow the RealtyShares’ team, expand its product and technology, and forge important partnerships as it continues to scale its investment platform.
“We’re receiving close to 1,000 applications a month from borrowers looking to raise capital through RealtyShares,” said Founder and CEO Nav Athwal. Our priority is to continue to develop our proprietary underwriting engine to efficiently vet and qualify these applications.”
RealtyShares enables accredited investors (which can include individuals, family offices, and hedge funds) to invest alongside professional real estate developers and borrowers in order to participate in the $500B annual real estate investment market. For investors that want to diversify their portfolios by investing in residential and commercial real estate across the U.S., RealtyShares enables them to purchase shares in these properties for as little as $5,000. And for developers and borrowers looking to raise capital for high-quality real estate projects, RealtyShares provides an efficient alternative to banks providing capital on average within four days. 





Since inception, the company has seen impressive growth. In a little over 15 months, RealtyShares has already helped thousands of investors from across the country invest in hundreds of residential and commercial properties worth more than $300 million. These properties span 17 states, 60 cities and offer investors average returns ranging from 8 – 20%. For developers, RealtyShares, which is currently focused on single family, multifamily and retail properties, can fund anywhere from $50,000 to a few million dollars of debt and equity capital for specific properties across the U.S.
“As traditional banks continue to deal with greater regulation as a result of Dodd Frank and other regulations stemming from the great recession, marketplace lending platforms like RealtyShares will continue disintermediating these traditional players through better execution and greater speed,” said Athwal. “Demand from investors and borrowers has been tremendous, which isn’t surprising given the success of platforms like LendingClub and OnDeck. With the additional funding, we will expand our team and technology to scale more quickly while continuing to offer the same superior customer service.”
“RealtyShares’ unique value proposition levels the playing field for investors who want a broad range of investment opportunities,” said John Jarve, general partner at Menlo Ventures. “The company’s excellent leadership team is wholly focused on delivering a seamless, technology-enabled service that promises to truly disrupt the real estate finance industry and we’re excited to help RealtyShares build that vision.”

Real Estate Crowdfunding Platform RealtyShares Hits $100M Milestone
 Tweet Share Share226 +14 Reddit Pin EmailShares 230

December 21, 2015 @ 4:26 pm By Samantha Hurst 


On Monday, accredited crowdfunding platform RealtyShares announced it has reached more than $100 million invested to date.
Each investment was made on the platform from accredited and institutional investors who have invested in over 270 transactions involving over 1,500 different properties.
CEO of RealtyShares, Nav Athwal, stated:
“Crossing the $100 million mark, which actually occurred a while ago while we weren’t looking, is a major milestone in the short history of our company. We’ve always been a leading real estate crowdfunding company – or online marketplace, as some refer to the space — and reaching this benchmark further cements our status as a trusted provider in the industry.”
Javier Benson, RealtyShares’ Director of Investments, noted:
“We’re continuing to see strong investor demand across our several product types. We’ve offered opportunities across several different property types, but more importantly our various hybrid products like mezzanine debt and preferred equity have met with strong demand from investors.”
Athwal then noted:
“We have now provided capital to fund approximately 250 investment opportunities across over 1,600 properties across the country.”
Earlier this month, Athwal shared details about the various properties the crowdfunding platform has funded:
“Sponsors have found our platform to be a viable new source of capital.  Borrowers have been able to get their loans funded quickly and efficiently. Investors now enjoyed access to diversified deal flow across many different product types and geographic locations.  We’re excited to see our business model being proven on an ever-increasing scale.”
Benson also added that both debt and equity investments were popular with the platforms investors:
“We’re continuing to see strong investor demand across many property and product types. Apartment properties and single-family residential loans have always been of interest to our investor base, but recently we’ve also had solid success with retail properties and other asset classes.  We have enjoyed particular success recently with our hybrid products like mezzanine debt and preferred equity, each of which have met with strong demand from investors.  Our product offerings are among the broadest in the industry, and we plan to continue to expand our deal flow to fulfill increased investor demand across all product types.”

Good post ! With regards to witch , if anybody is looking for a service to merge PDF files , my friend stumbled across text here https://goo.gl/lg0ciE

I would caution that 2016 and beyond will be interesting for the crowd funding area. We had one deal that went south on realtyshares so far in 10+ investments I have made. On midnight pass rd after 15 months of our funds being debited, the principle has been returned but no returns as sponsor was not making progress on project. Realtyshares claims that they have spent money for legal costs and have managed to get the sponsor to refinance and give back principal. To make investors trust that they have done their best they should be transparent about how much real money did they spent on legal costs (don’t -“double or single” count time spent by your existing staff in chasing with the sponsor).
The pace of property prices will start slowing down and will be good to watch how the sponsors can continue to project high returns in stabilizing markets

Hi Sunny
I have seen your posts where one of your deals returned principal only. I review all debt deals and they claim that they have return investors money with interest for all debt deals so far.
Can we connect to discuss this more. I am investor in RS also.






Sunny



Mine was not  a debt deal. It is an equity one.






Paul Ryan



is there a forum out there where I can connect with other investor who invest real estate crowdfunding?
