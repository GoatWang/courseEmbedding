In addition, other subsidiaries of RJF provide investment management services for retail and institutional clients, corporate and retail banking, and trust services.Private Client GroupAs of September 30, 2016, the Company's Private Client Group segment provided financial planning and securities transaction services to over three million client accounts through the branch office systems of RJ&A, RJFS, RJFSA, RJ Ltd. and in the United Kingdom through Raymond James Investment Services Limited (RJIS). As of September 30, 2016, the Company's two affiliation options for financial advisors are the employee option and the independent contractor option. Employee financial advisors provide services to individual clients. Its independent contractor financial advisor option is designed to allow its advisors build their businesses with as much or as little of its support as they determine they need. With specific approval, they are permitted to conduct, on a limited basis, certain other approved business activities, such as offering insurance products, independent registered investment advisory services, and accounting and tax services. Irrespective of the affiliation choice, its financial advisors offer a range of investments and services, including both third party and proprietary products, and a variety of financial planning services.The Company's Private Client Group segment provides investment services and investment advisory services. Its United States financial advisors provide insurance and annuity products through its general insurance agency, Raymond James Insurance Group, Inc. The United States financial advisors offer a number of professionally managed load and no-load mutual funds. The Company provides margin loans to clients that are collateralized by the securities purchased or by other securities owned by the client. The Company provides custodial, trading, research and other back office support and services, (including access to clients' account information and the services of the Asset Management segment) to the independent contractor registered investment advisors with whom it is affiliated. It conducts securities lending activities through RJ&A, in which it borrows and lends securities from and to broker-dealers, financial institutions, and other counterparties. Through its Alternative Investments Group, it provides diversification strategies and products to qualified clients of its affiliated financial advisors.Capital MarketsThe Company's Capital Markets segment activities include institutional sales, securities trading, equity research, investment banking, syndicate and the syndication of investments. The Company offers various services under the Capital Markets segment, which include equity capital markets activities, fixed income activities and tax credit fund activities.

In addition to lead and co-managed offerings, this department coordinates its participation in transactions managed by other investment banking firms. Its domestic research department supports its institutional and retail sales efforts and publishes research on various companies. This research primarily focuses on the United States and Canadian companies in specific industries, including agricultural, consumer, energy, clean energy, energy services, financial services, healthcare, industrial, mining and natural resources, forest products, real estate, technology, and communication and transportation.The Company earns institutional sales commissions from institutional clients who purchase both taxable and tax-exempt fixed income products, primarily municipal, corporate, government agency and mortgage-backed bonds. The Company carries inventories of taxable and tax-exempt securities to facilitate institutional sales activities. Its taxable and tax-exempt fixed income traders purchase and sell corporate, municipal, government, government agency, and mortgage-backed bonds, asset-backed securities, preferred stock, and certificates of deposit from and to its clients or other dealers. Its fixed income investment banking services include public finance and debt underwriting activities where it serves as a financial advisor, placement agent or underwriter to various issuers, including state and local government agencies (and their political subdivisions), housing agencies, and non-profit entities, including healthcare and higher education institutions.The Company in order to facilitate client transactions, hedges a portion of its fixed income securities inventories, or to a limited extent for its own account, the Company enters into interest rate swaps and futures contracts. In addition, it conducts a matched book derivatives business where it may enter into derivative transactions, including interest rate swaps, options, and combinations of those instruments, primarily with government entities and not-for-profit counterparties. In this matched book business, for every derivative transaction it enters into with a client, it enters into an offsetting derivative transaction with a credit support provider that is a third party financial institution. The Company through its fixed income public finance operations, enters into forward commitments to purchase Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) or Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Such MBS securities are issued on behalf of various state and local housing finance agencies (HFA) clients and consist of the mortgages originated through their lending programs. In its syndication of tax credit investments, its subsidiaries acts as the general partner or managing member in partnerships and limited liability companies that invest in real estate project entities. The Company earns fees for the origination and sale of these investment products, as well as for the oversight and management of the investments over the statutory tax credit compliance period.Asset ManagementThe Company's Asset Management segment provides investment advisory and asset management services to individual and institutional investment portfolios, and sponsors mutual funds under the name Eagle (Eagle Funds).

About Raymond James

 


Our "about us"
is really about you.

We have always been a different kind of financial services firm, embracing long-term planning, valuing methodical decision-making and remaining focused on what matters most: You.













About Us 


When Bob James founded Raymond James, he did so based on a belief that clients deserved more than help with investment decisions, they needed advice that considered their entire financial picture.
Today, that client-focused approach has extended to serve more than 3 million client accounts through 7,200 financial advisors in the United States, Canada and overseas. Further, the company has expanded through the years to serve corporations, institutions and municipalities through significant capital markets, banking and asset management services.


No matter the business, we believe if we do what’s right for clients,
we’ll help them achieve success while also realizing our own.
It’s that simple.

About Raymond James
Our deliberate nature and thoughtful approach to financial planning have led to a history of strength and steady, stable growth. Our company’s conservative approach began in 1962 when Robert James put the word “Investments” after his name. And since then, Raymond James advisors have been crafting meticulously tailored, holistic financial plans to help ensure their clients can retire and realize their individual financial goals.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Raymond James

 


The right advice
starts with a trusted relationship. 


We believe financial advice is about more than just having a plan. It’s about having the right plan for you. And that only happens with a true understanding of your whole life, beyond just your finances. Because as your needs become more complex, sophisticated advice and a relationship built for the long term become even more important.

History[edit]
Raymond James was founded in 1962 when St. Petersburg broker Robert James formed Robert A. James Investments. In 1964, it merged with Raymond & Associates, founded by Edward Raymond in 1963, to form Raymond James & Associates.[2] Robert James' son, Tom James, joined his father's company in 1966 and assumed leadership of the firm in 1970. The firm initially planned to go public in 1969, but market conditions delayed its plan until 1983.[3] Tom turned over the CEO's post to Paul Reilly in 2010,[4] and transitioned his title as Chairman of the Board to Paul Reilly in 2016.[5] Tom still remains on the leadership team as Chairman Emeritus.
In 2012, the firm purchased the Canadian assets of Allied Irish Bank.[3] In April 2012, Raymond James merged with Morgan Keegan & Company. The merger created one of the country's largest full-service wealth management and investment banking firms not headquartered in New York.[6]
In January 2013, the firm reported 100 consecutive quarters of profitability.[7]
In June 2016, it was announced that Raymond James had joined the Fortune 500 for the first time.[8]
In September 2016, Raymond James announced its acquisition of Deutsche Bank Wealth Management's US private client services unit, Alex. Brown.[9]
As of April 2017, Raymond James has 7,100 financial advisors serving approximately 3 million client accounts in more than 2,900 locations throughout the United States, Canada and overseas. Total client assets under management are approximately $643 billion.[10] Raymond James corporate headquarters is located in St. Petersburg, Florida.
Activities[edit]
Raymond James Financial has three wholly owned broker-dealers, Raymond James & Associates (RJ&A), Raymond James Financial Services (RJFS) and Raymond James Limited (RJL); and Raymond James Investment Services Limited (RJIS), a majority-owned independent contractor subsidiary in the United Kingdom.[11] Through Eagle Asset Management, the firm manages $56 billion in assets mostly for institutions, as of October 2013.[3]
Controversies[edit]
Auction rate securities[edit]
On June 29, 2011, Raymond James announced an agreement to repurchase at par auction rate securities (ARS) sold to clients through its domestic broker/dealer subsidiaries prior to February 13, 2008. The agreement—reached with the Securities and Exchange Commission and with state securities regulators led by Florida and Texas—resolved more than three years of investigation related to activity in the ARS market. Without admitting or denying the allegations, the firm also agreed to pay a fine totaling $1.75 million to the state regulators, but was not fined by the SEC.
As a result of this agreement, a pre-tax charge of $45 million was recorded in the quarter ending June 30, 2011. This charge was a result of an estimate of the current fair value of the securities to be repurchased by the company being less than their par value. It is expected that the ultimate realized loss will be substantially less as issuers refinance or redeem these securities, interest rates rise and/or collateral values improve.
Raymond James sold $2.3 billion worth of ARS, underwrote $1.2 billion, and was the auction dealer for over $725 million. Since the $330 billion market for ARS crashed in 2008, at least 19 underwriters and broker-dealers were sued in class action suits.[12][13]
Excessive commissions[edit]
In September 2011, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ordered Raymond James & Associates, Inc. (RJA) and Raymond James Financial Services, Inc. (RJFS) to pay restitution of $1.69 million to 15,500 clients for charging excessive commissions on more than 27,000 securities transactions. The trades were made in client accounts between 2006 and 2010. FINRA also fined RJA $225,000 and RJFS $200,000.[14]

Style Scores:



C Value | F Growth | C Momentum | F VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The right advice
starts with a trusted relationship. 


We believe financial advice is about more than just having a plan. It’s about having the right plan for you. And that only happens with a true understanding of your whole life, beyond just your finances. Because as your needs become more complex, sophisticated advice and a relationship built for the long term become even more important.

Working with a Raymond James Advisor
It starts by being personal.
Your relationship with a Raymond James advisor begins with a meaningful conversation – about you. Your goals, your wants, your needs, your concerns, your family, your passion, your vision for the future. It’s about working together to understand the strategies and services that will give you the optimal chance to fulfill your objectives – to live the life you want.
Next, you and your advisor will develop a comprehensive plan.
 Just like you, your plan is unique. It will be customized to help you reach major milestones – the ones you know are coming, and perhaps a few you haven’t considered yet. With comprehensive, institutional-quality resources, your advisor can provide a wide array of wealth management services, from investment strategies backed by award-winning research to estate planning vehicles that ensure your wishes are carried out exactly as you intend.
In implementing the plan, your advisor will work in collaboration with other professionals, such as attorneys and accountants, to assure your financial plan is holistic – all aspects working together. Through Investor Access, you will have online access to up-to-date account information, all while your accounts and information are protected by cybersecurity technology that goes well beyond the industry standard.
Through the years, your plan will evolve with you.
 The relationship with your advisor will grow deeper as you monitor the progress of your investments and review your strategy. Life events might require adjustments. Whatever the need, whatever phase of life you are in, your advisor will see you through.

Working with a Raymond James advisor means you have more than a financial planner. 
You have a trusted financial partner – for life.

Raymond James

 


The right advice
starts with a trusted relationship. 


We believe financial advice is about more than just having a plan. It’s about having the right plan for you. And that only happens with a true understanding of your whole life, beyond just your finances. Because as your needs become more complex, sophisticated advice and a relationship built for the long term become even more important.

The right advice
starts with a trusted relationship. 


We believe financial advice is about more than just having a plan. It’s about having the right plan for you. And that only happens with a true understanding of your whole life, beyond just your finances. Because as your needs become more complex, sophisticated advice and a relationship built for the long term become even more important.
