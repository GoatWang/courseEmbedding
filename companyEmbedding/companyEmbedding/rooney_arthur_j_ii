Early life[edit]
Rooney graduated from the University of Pittsburgh in 1978 with a B.A. in Political Science.[2] He then attended Duquesne University’s School of Law, where he earned his law degree in 1982.[3][2]
Career[edit]
The eldest of nine children of longtime Steelers chairman Dan Rooney,[4] he is the grandson of Steelers' founder “The Chief”, Art Rooney, Sr. He was named team president in May 2003.[5] Prior to that, he served as vice president and general counsel of the Steelers, and has served on the board of directors of the Steelers since 1989. He currently serves as chairman of the NFL’s Stadium Committee, and serves on numerous NFL boards, including the Legislative Committee, the Management Council Executive Committee, the International Committee and the Digital Media Committee.[6] Prior to his father's 2017 death, Rooney II held a 30% stake in the Steelers franchise[4] and was in line to inherit most of the 30% share Dan Rooney held, which would make Rooney II the majority owner of the team. He is one of only two third-generation owners in the league, the other being John Mara, to whom he is related by marriage (Mara's brother is married to Rooney's sister, and both owners count actresses Rooney Mara and Kate Mara as nieces.)
He currently holds an Of Counsel position with the law firm Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney. He is active in the Pittsburgh community, devoting a substantial amount of his time to various organizations. He currently serves on the boards of the Pittsburgh Public Theater,[7] Saint Vincent College,[8] Senator John Heinz Western PA History center[9] and the United Way of America.[10]

Early life[edit]
Rooney graduated from the University of Pittsburgh in 1978 with a B.A. in Political Science.[2] He then attended Duquesne University’s School of Law, where he earned his law degree in 1982.[3][2]
Career[edit]
The eldest of nine children of longtime Steelers chairman Dan Rooney,[4] he is the grandson of Steelers' founder “The Chief”, Art Rooney, Sr. He was named team president in May 2003.[5] Prior to that, he served as vice president and general counsel of the Steelers, and has served on the board of directors of the Steelers since 1989. He currently serves as chairman of the NFL’s Stadium Committee, and serves on numerous NFL boards, including the Legislative Committee, the Management Council Executive Committee, the International Committee and the Digital Media Committee.[6] Prior to his father's 2017 death, Rooney II held a 30% stake in the Steelers franchise[4] and was in line to inherit most of the 30% share Dan Rooney held, which would make Rooney II the majority owner of the team. He is one of only two third-generation owners in the league, the other being John Mara, to whom he is related by marriage (Mara's brother is married to Rooney's sister, and both owners count actresses Rooney Mara and Kate Mara as nieces.)
He currently holds an Of Counsel position with the law firm Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney. He is active in the Pittsburgh community, devoting a substantial amount of his time to various organizations. He currently serves on the boards of the Pittsburgh Public Theater,[7] Saint Vincent College,[8] Senator John Heinz Western PA History center[9] and the United Way of America.[10]
Personal life[edit]
Rooney is married to Greta, and they have four children.[2]

Family history[edit]
Rooney's great-grandparents, James and Mary Rooney, were Irish Catholics who emigrated from Newry in County Down, Ireland to Canada during the Irish potato famine in the 1840s. While living in Montreal, the Rooneys had a son, Arthur (who would become Art Rooney's grandfather). James and Mary later moved to Ebbw Vale, Wales, where the iron industry was flourishing, taking their son Arthur, then 21, with them. This Arthur Rooney married Catherine Regan (who was also Irish Catholic), in Wales, and they had a son, Dan. Two years after Dan Rooney was born, the family moved back to Canada and eventually ended up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1884. Along the way the family grew to include nine children of which Dan was the second.[1]
Dan Rooney remained in the Pittsburgh area, and eventually opened a saloon in the Monongahela Valley coal town of Coulter, Pennsylvania (or Coultersville). This is where Dan Rooney met and wed Margaret "Maggie" Murray, who was the daughter of a coal miner, and where the couple's first son, Arthur Joseph Rooney, was born. Dan and Maggie would eventually settle their family in Pittsburgh's North Side in 1913, where they bought a three story building at the corner of Corey Street and General Robinson Street. Dan operated a cafe and saloon out of the first floor with the family living above. The building was located just a block from Exposition Park, which had been home to the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team until 1909.[1]
Education and athletics[edit]
Rooney attended St. Peter's Catholic School in Pittsburgh, Duquesne University Prep School, then several semesters at Indiana Normal School before completing a final year at Temple University on an athletic scholarship.[2] After graduation, he dedicated himself to sports, winning the AAU welterweight belt in 1918 and tried out for the 1920 Olympic Team,[3] he played minor league baseball for both the Flint, Michigan "Vehicles" and the Wheeling, West Virginia "Stogies".[4] In 1925 he served as Wheeling's player-manager and led the Middle Atlantic League in games, hits, runs, stolen bases and finished 2nd in batting average as his brother Dan Rooney (Wheelings catcher that year) finished 3rd in BA. Art also played halfback for the semi-pro Pittsburgh "Hope Harvey" and "Majestic Radio" clubs which he later took over and renamed the J.P. Rooneys before purchasing an NFL franchise for $2,500 in 1933.[2]

Art Rooney on the good ole days

The biggest thrill wasn't in winning on Sunday but in meeting the payroll on Monday.
“
”

1983 Steelers yearbook [5]
Rooney's affiliation with the National Football League (NFL) began in 1933 when he paid a $2,500 franchise fee to found a club based in the city of Pittsburgh. He had named his new team the "Pirates" which was also the name of the city's long-established Major League Baseball club of which Rooney was a fan since a childhood spent in the shadow of the team's stadium.
Since the league's inception in 1920, the NFL had wanted a team in Pittsburgh due to the city's already-long history with football as well as the popularity of the Pittsburgh Panthers football team, an NCAA national championship contender during this period. The league was finally able to take advantage of Pennsylvania relaxing their blue laws that prior to 1933 prohibited sporting events from taking place on Sundays, when most NFL games take place.
In 1936, Rooney won a parlay at Saratoga Race Course, which netted him about $160,000. He used the winnings to hire a coach, Joe Bach, give contracts to his players and almost win a championship. The winnings funded the team until 1941 when he sold the franchise to NY playboy Alex Thompson. Thompson wanted to move the franchise to Boston so he could be within a five-hour train ride of his club. At the same time, the Philadelphia Eagles ran into financial problems. Rooney used the funds from the sale of franchise to get a 70% interest in the Eagles, the other 30% held by Rooney friend and future NFL commissioner, Bert Bell. Bell and Rooney agreed to trade places with Thompson. Bell took the role of President of the Steelers that he relinquished to Rooney in 1946 when Bell became Commissioner. Rooney got his good friend and his sister's father in law, Barney McGinley, to buy Bell's shares. Barney's son Jack, Art's brother in law, retained the McGinley interest that passed to his heirs when he died in 2006.[6]

Howard Cosell on the Rooneys

The Rooneys are the finest people, the people I most respect in American sports ownership. I've always felt that way. And there's no reason to change. They are people of integrity and character. The way they put the Steelers together, to hire a man like Chuck Noll, to emphasize the team concept. I have a whole transcendental feeling for the Steelers and the Rooneys and Pittsburgh.
“
”

— Howard Cosell, October 1982[7]
Rooney sent shock waves through the NFL by signing Byron "Whizzer" White to a record-breaking $15,000 contract in 1938. This move, however, did not bring the Pirates a winning season, and White left the team for the Detroit Lions the following year. The club did not have a season above .500 until 1942, the year after they were renamed the Pittsburgh Steelers.
During World War II, the Steelers had some financial difficulties and were merged with the Philadelphia Eagles in 1943 and the Chicago Cardinals in 1944.
After the war, Rooney became team president. He longed to bring an NFL title to Pittsburgh but was never able to beat the powerhouse teams, like the Cleveland Browns and Green Bay Packers. The Steelers also struggled with playing in a city and era where baseball was king and were treated as something of a joke compared to the Pirates. The team also made some questionable personnel calls at the time such as cutting a then-unknown Johnny Unitas in training camp (Unitas would go on to a Hall of Fame career with the Baltimore Colts) and trading their first round pick in the 1965 draft to the Chicago Bears (who would draft Dick Butkus with the pick), among others.
Nevertheless, Rooney was popular with owners as a mediator, which would carry over to his son Dan Rooney. He was the only owner to vote against moving the rights of the New York Yanks to Dallas, Texas after the 1951 season due to concerns of racism in the South at the time.[8] (Ultimately, the Dallas Texans failed after one year, and the rights were moved to Baltimore, where the team became the Baltimore Colts. The team now plays in Indianapolis.) In 1963, along with Bears owner George Halas, Rooney was one of two owners to vote for the 1925 NFL Championship to be reinstated to the long-defunct Pottsville Maroons.
Pittsburgh Penguins[edit]
As a pillar of the community in many aspects, Rooney was asked to lend his considerable influence in the city's bid to reclaim a NHL franchise during the league's expansion in 1967. Although Pittsburgh enjoyed championship hockey with the professional but "minor league" Pittsburgh Hornets since its NHL franchise (the Pirates hockey team) disbanded in 1930 from the effects of the Great Depression, many city leaders were pushing for the region to become more "major league" suggesting that Mr. Rooney use his influence in the sports industry to have the league award Pittsburgh a franchise. Rooney proved his worth and from 1967 until the early 1970s was a part owner of the Pittsburgh Penguins.[9][10]
Homestead Grays[edit]
In a 1981 interview by the Pittsburgh Press Rooney related that "from time to time he had helped financially support the Negro League team, the Homestead Grays, and . . . was a better baseball fan than football fan."[11]
Track sports[edit]
Rooney also acquired the Yonkers Raceway in 1972, the Palm Beach Kennel Club, Green Mountain Kennel Club in Vermont, Shamrock Stables in Maryland and owned the Liberty Bell Park Racetrack outside Philadelphia.[12]
Later life[edit]
Following the AFL–NFL merger in 1970, the Steelers agreed to leave the NFL Eastern Conference and joined the AFC Central Division.


Everyone knew Mr. Rooney was our number one citizen...he did more for this city than R.K. Mellon did for the business community and David Lawrence and any of the mayors who followed him, including Richard Caliguiri, did politically.
“
”

Tom Foerster[13]
Through expert scouting, the Steelers became a power. In 1972, they began a remarkable 8–year run of playoff appearances, and thirteen straight years of winning seasons, including three additional playoff berths. In Rooney's 41st season as owner, the club won the Super Bowl. They followed up with Super Bowl victories following the 1975, 1978 and 1979 seasons. They have also won the 2005 and 2008 Super Bowls. Making the Steelers the first team following the AFL–NFL merger, to win six Super Bowls.


I'll never forget the way he introduced me, 'This is Ralph Giampaolo, a member of our organization.' Not a member of our ground crew. Not some rinky-dink bum. But a member of 'our organization'. As far as [Curt] Gowdy knew, I was vice president of the team. Mr. Rooney made me feel 10 feet tall.
“
”

Inviting a groundskeeper up to the owner's box for dinner.[13]
Following the Steelers' victory in Super Bowl IX, Rooney stepped down from day-to-day management of the team, but remained the ultimate source of authority until his death. Dan, his son, took over as team president. Rooney died from complications of a stroke on August 25, 1988. An August 1987 Pittsburgh Press story stated that Rooney never missed a Hall of Fame induction ceremony in all 25 years, and that he was asked to present his third inductee, John Henry Johnson that month.[14] In memory of "The Chief", Steelers wore a patch on the left shoulder of their uniforms with Rooney's initials AJR for the entire season. The team ended up finishing 5-11, their worst record since a 1–13 showing in 1969. He is buried at the North Side Catholic Cemetery in Pittsburgh.[15]
Legacy[edit]




A stature of Art Rooney Heinz Field


In 1964, he was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Duquesne University named their football field in his honor in 1993. In 1999 Rooney ranked 81st on the Sporting News' "100 Most Powerful Sports Figures of the 20th Century" list. A statue of his likeness graces the entrance to the home of the Pittsburgh Steelers, Heinz Field. The street that runs adjacent to Heinz Field on Pittsburgh's North Side is named "Art Rooney Avenue" in his honor.[16][17] In 2000, he was inducted as a "pioneer" into the American Football Association's Semi-Pro Football Hall of Fame.[18]
During Rooney's life, the Steelers would often use a late-round draft pick on a player from a local college like Pitt, West Virginia or Penn State. Though these players rarely made the team, this practice was intended to appeal to local fans and players. The team has occasionally employed this practice after Rooney's death, however, they now focus more on talent than geography throughout the entire draft. Rooney also supposedly liked players from Notre Dame due to his Irish Catholic background, which some say explains why he allegedly had the team keep Notre Dame alumnus and wounded Vietnam veteran Rocky Bleier.[citation needed] Bleier would go on to become one of the key members of the team's success in the 1970s.[citation needed]

Art Rooney is the subject of, and the only character in, the one-man play The Chief, written by Gene Collier and Rob Zellers. The play debuted at the Pittsburgh Public Theater in 2003, and has been revived on three occasions since then. All productions have starred Tom Atkins as Rooney.[citation needed]
At Steeler games, there is a sign that shows a picture of Rooney with his characteristic cigar and under the photo, the word "Believe."[citation needed]

Art Rooney's North Side Golden Rule

My father always used to tell us boys, "Treat everybody the way you'd like to be treated. Give them the benefit of the doubt. But never let anyone mistake kindness for weakness." He took the Golden Rule and put a little bit of the North Side in it.

— Art Rooney Jr. on his father[21]
Art J. Rooney was for 51 years, until her 1982 death, married to Kathleen Rooney née McNulty (1904–1982). Kathleen was the mother of Art's five sons, who are Dan Rooney, the chairman of the board of directors of the Pittsburgh Steelers and a former United States Ambassador to Ireland, Art Rooney Jr., Timothy Rooney, Patrick Rooney, and John Rooney (all also directors of the Pittsburgh Steelers). She is also grandmother of the couple's 32 grandchildren, including current Steelers president Art Rooney II and U.S. Representative Thomas J. Rooney (R, FL-16). The couple also has about 75 great grandchildren, including actress sisters Kate Mara and Rooney Mara.[22][23][24][25][26][27]

Family history[edit]
Rooney's great-grandparents, James and Mary Rooney, were Irish Catholics who emigrated from Newry in County Down, Ireland to Canada during the Irish potato famine in the 1840s. While living in Montreal, the Rooneys had a son, Arthur (who would become Art Rooney's grandfather). James and Mary later moved to Ebbw Vale, Wales, where the iron industry was flourishing, taking their son Arthur, then 21, with them. This Arthur Rooney married Catherine Regan (who was also Irish Catholic), in Wales, and they had a son, Dan. Two years after Dan Rooney was born, the family moved back to Canada and eventually ended up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1884. Along the way the family grew to include nine children of which Dan was the second.[1]
Dan Rooney remained in the Pittsburgh area, and eventually opened a saloon in the Monongahela Valley coal town of Coulter, Pennsylvania (or Coultersville). This is where Dan Rooney met and wed Margaret "Maggie" Murray, who was the daughter of a coal miner, and where the couple's first son, Arthur Joseph Rooney, was born. Dan and Maggie would eventually settle their family in Pittsburgh's North Side in 1913, where they bought a three story building at the corner of Corey Street and General Robinson Street. Dan operated a cafe and saloon out of the first floor with the family living above. The building was located just a block from Exposition Park, which had been home to the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team until 1909.[1]
Education and athletics[edit]
Rooney attended St. Peter's Catholic School in Pittsburgh, Duquesne University Prep School, then several semesters at Indiana Normal School before completing a final year at Temple University on an athletic scholarship.[2] After graduation, he dedicated himself to sports, winning the AAU welterweight belt in 1918 and tried out for the 1920 Olympic Team,[3] he played minor league baseball for both the Flint, Michigan "Vehicles" and the Wheeling, West Virginia "Stogies".[4] In 1925 he served as Wheeling's player-manager and led the Middle Atlantic League in games, hits, runs, stolen bases and finished 2nd in batting average as his brother Dan Rooney (Wheelings catcher that year) finished 3rd in BA. Art also played halfback for the semi-pro Pittsburgh "Hope Harvey" and "Majestic Radio" clubs which he later took over and renamed the J.P. Rooneys before purchasing an NFL franchise for $2,500 in 1933.[2]
Pittsburgh Steelers[edit]

Art Rooney on the good ole days

The biggest thrill wasn't in winning on Sunday but in meeting the payroll on Monday.
“
”

1983 Steelers yearbook [5]
Rooney's affiliation with the National Football League (NFL) began in 1933 when he paid a $2,500 franchise fee to found a club based in the city of Pittsburgh. He had named his new team the "Pirates" which was also the name of the city's long-established Major League Baseball club of which Rooney was a fan since a childhood spent in the shadow of the team's stadium.
Since the league's inception in 1920, the NFL had wanted a team in Pittsburgh due to the city's already-long history with football as well as the popularity of the Pittsburgh Panthers football team, an NCAA national championship contender during this period. The league was finally able to take advantage of Pennsylvania relaxing their blue laws that prior to 1933 prohibited sporting events from taking place on Sundays, when most NFL games take place.
In 1936, Rooney won a parlay at Saratoga Race Course, which netted him about $160,000. He used the winnings to hire a coach, Joe Bach, give contracts to his players and almost win a championship. The winnings funded the team until 1941 when he sold the franchise to NY playboy Alex Thompson. Thompson wanted to move the franchise to Boston so he could be within a five-hour train ride of his club. At the same time, the Philadelphia Eagles ran into financial problems. Rooney used the funds from the sale of franchise to get a 70% interest in the Eagles, the other 30% held by Rooney friend and future NFL commissioner, Bert Bell. Bell and Rooney agreed to trade places with Thompson. Bell took the role of President of the Steelers that he relinquished to Rooney in 1946 when Bell became Commissioner. Rooney got his good friend and his sister's father in law, Barney McGinley, to buy Bell's shares. Barney's son Jack, Art's brother in law, retained the McGinley interest that passed to his heirs when he died in 2006.[6]

Howard Cosell on the Rooneys

The Rooneys are the finest people, the people I most respect in American sports ownership. I've always felt that way. And there's no reason to change. They are people of integrity and character. The way they put the Steelers together, to hire a man like Chuck Noll, to emphasize the team concept. I have a whole transcendental feeling for the Steelers and the Rooneys and Pittsburgh.
“
”

— Howard Cosell, October 1982[7]
Rooney sent shock waves through the NFL by signing Byron "Whizzer" White to a record-breaking $15,000 contract in 1938. This move, however, did not bring the Pirates a winning season, and White left the team for the Detroit Lions the following year. The club did not have a season above .500 until 1942, the year after they were renamed the Pittsburgh Steelers.
During World War II, the Steelers had some financial difficulties and were merged with the Philadelphia Eagles in 1943 and the Chicago Cardinals in 1944.
After the war, Rooney became team president. He longed to bring an NFL title to Pittsburgh but was never able to beat the powerhouse teams, like the Cleveland Browns and Green Bay Packers. The Steelers also struggled with playing in a city and era where baseball was king and were treated as something of a joke compared to the Pirates. The team also made some questionable personnel calls at the time such as cutting a then-unknown Johnny Unitas in training camp (Unitas would go on to a Hall of Fame career with the Baltimore Colts) and trading their first round pick in the 1965 draft to the Chicago Bears (who would draft Dick Butkus with the pick), among others.
Nevertheless, Rooney was popular with owners as a mediator, which would carry over to his son Dan Rooney. He was the only owner to vote against moving the rights of the New York Yanks to Dallas, Texas after the 1951 season due to concerns of racism in the South at the time.[8] (Ultimately, the Dallas Texans failed after one year, and the rights were moved to Baltimore, where the team became the Baltimore Colts. The team now plays in Indianapolis.) In 1963, along with Bears owner George Halas, Rooney was one of two owners to vote for the 1925 NFL Championship to be reinstated to the long-defunct Pottsville Maroons.
Pittsburgh Penguins[edit]
As a pillar of the community in many aspects, Rooney was asked to lend his considerable influence in the city's bid to reclaim a NHL franchise during the league's expansion in 1967. Although Pittsburgh enjoyed championship hockey with the professional but "minor league" Pittsburgh Hornets since its NHL franchise (the Pirates hockey team) disbanded in 1930 from the effects of the Great Depression, many city leaders were pushing for the region to become more "major league" suggesting that Mr. Rooney use his influence in the sports industry to have the league award Pittsburgh a franchise. Rooney proved his worth and from 1967 until the early 1970s was a part owner of the Pittsburgh Penguins.[9][10]
Homestead Grays[edit]
In a 1981 interview by the Pittsburgh Press Rooney related that "from time to time he had helped financially support the Negro League team, the Homestead Grays, and . . . was a better baseball fan than football fan."[11]
Track sports[edit]
Rooney also acquired the Yonkers Raceway in 1972, the Palm Beach Kennel Club, Green Mountain Kennel Club in Vermont, Shamrock Stables in Maryland and owned the Liberty Bell Park Racetrack outside Philadelphia.[12]
Later life[edit]
Following the AFL–NFL merger in 1970, the Steelers agreed to leave the NFL Eastern Conference and joined the AFC Central Division.


Everyone knew Mr. Rooney was our number one citizen...he did more for this city than R.K. Mellon did for the business community and David Lawrence and any of the mayors who followed him, including Richard Caliguiri, did politically.
“
”

Tom Foerster[13]
Through expert scouting, the Steelers became a power. In 1972, they began a remarkable 8–year run of playoff appearances, and thirteen straight years of winning seasons, including three additional playoff berths. In Rooney's 41st season as owner, the club won the Super Bowl. They followed up with Super Bowl victories following the 1975, 1978 and 1979 seasons. They have also won the 2005 and 2008 Super Bowls. Making the Steelers the first team following the AFL–NFL merger, to win six Super Bowls.


I'll never forget the way he introduced me, 'This is Ralph Giampaolo, a member of our organization.' Not a member of our ground crew. Not some rinky-dink bum. But a member of 'our organization'. As far as [Curt] Gowdy knew, I was vice president of the team. Mr. Rooney made me feel 10 feet tall.
“
”

Inviting a groundskeeper up to the owner's box for dinner.[13]
Following the Steelers' victory in Super Bowl IX, Rooney stepped down from day-to-day management of the team, but remained the ultimate source of authority until his death. Dan, his son, took over as team president. Rooney died from complications of a stroke on August 25, 1988. An August 1987 Pittsburgh Press story stated that Rooney never missed a Hall of Fame induction ceremony in all 25 years, and that he was asked to present his third inductee, John Henry Johnson that month.[14] In memory of "The Chief", Steelers wore a patch on the left shoulder of their uniforms with Rooney's initials AJR for the entire season. The team ended up finishing 5-11, their worst record since a 1–13 showing in 1969. He is buried at the North Side Catholic Cemetery in Pittsburgh.[15]
Legacy[edit]




A stature of Art Rooney Heinz Field


In 1964, he was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Duquesne University named their football field in his honor in 1993. In 1999 Rooney ranked 81st on the Sporting News' "100 Most Powerful Sports Figures of the 20th Century" list. A statue of his likeness graces the entrance to the home of the Pittsburgh Steelers, Heinz Field. The street that runs adjacent to Heinz Field on Pittsburgh's North Side is named "Art Rooney Avenue" in his honor.[16][17] In 2000, he was inducted as a "pioneer" into the American Football Association's Semi-Pro Football Hall of Fame.[18]
During Rooney's life, the Steelers would often use a late-round draft pick on a player from a local college like Pitt, West Virginia or Penn State. Though these players rarely made the team, this practice was intended to appeal to local fans and players. The team has occasionally employed this practice after Rooney's death, however, they now focus more on talent than geography throughout the entire draft. Rooney also supposedly liked players from Notre Dame due to his Irish Catholic background, which some say explains why he allegedly had the team keep Notre Dame alumnus and wounded Vietnam veteran Rocky Bleier.[citation needed] Bleier would go on to become one of the key members of the team's success in the 1970s.[citation needed]

Art Rooney is the subject of, and the only character in, the one-man play The Chief, written by Gene Collier and Rob Zellers. The play debuted at the Pittsburgh Public Theater in 2003, and has been revived on three occasions since then. All productions have starred Tom Atkins as Rooney.[citation needed]
At Steeler games, there is a sign that shows a picture of Rooney with his characteristic cigar and under the photo, the word "Believe."[citation needed]

Art Rooney's North Side Golden Rule

My father always used to tell us boys, "Treat everybody the way you'd like to be treated. Give them the benefit of the doubt. But never let anyone mistake kindness for weakness." He took the Golden Rule and put a little bit of the North Side in it.

— Art Rooney Jr. on his father[21]
Art J. Rooney was for 51 years, until her 1982 death, married to Kathleen Rooney née McNulty (1904–1982). Kathleen was the mother of Art's five sons, who are Dan Rooney, the chairman of the board of directors of the Pittsburgh Steelers and a former United States Ambassador to Ireland, Art Rooney Jr., Timothy Rooney, Patrick Rooney, and John Rooney (all also directors of the Pittsburgh Steelers). She is also grandmother of the couple's 32 grandchildren, including current Steelers president Art Rooney II and U.S. Representative Thomas J. Rooney (R, FL-16). The couple also has about 75 great grandchildren, including actress sisters Kate Mara and Rooney Mara.[22][23][24][25][26][27]

Family history[edit]
Rooney's great-grandparents, James and Mary Rooney, were Irish Catholics who emigrated from Newry in County Down, Ireland to Canada during the Irish potato famine in the 1840s. While living in Montreal, the Rooneys had a son, Arthur (who would become Art Rooney's grandfather). James and Mary later moved to Ebbw Vale, Wales, where the iron industry was flourishing, taking their son Arthur, then 21, with them. This Arthur Rooney married Catherine Regan (who was also Irish Catholic), in Wales, and they had a son, Dan. Two years after Dan Rooney was born, the family moved back to Canada and eventually ended up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1884. Along the way the family grew to include nine children of which Dan was the second.[1]
Dan Rooney remained in the Pittsburgh area, and eventually opened a saloon in the Monongahela Valley coal town of Coulter, Pennsylvania (or Coultersville). This is where Dan Rooney met and wed Margaret "Maggie" Murray, who was the daughter of a coal miner, and where the couple's first son, Arthur Joseph Rooney, was born. Dan and Maggie would eventually settle their family in Pittsburgh's North Side in 1913, where they bought a three story building at the corner of Corey Street and General Robinson Street. Dan operated a cafe and saloon out of the first floor with the family living above. The building was located just a block from Exposition Park, which had been home to the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team until 1909.[1]
Education and athletics[edit]
Rooney attended St. Peter's Catholic School in Pittsburgh, Duquesne University Prep School, then several semesters at Indiana Normal School before completing a final year at Temple University on an athletic scholarship.[2] After graduation, he dedicated himself to sports, winning the AAU welterweight belt in 1918 and tried out for the 1920 Olympic Team,[3] he played minor league baseball for both the Flint, Michigan "Vehicles" and the Wheeling, West Virginia "Stogies".[4] In 1925 he served as Wheeling's player-manager and led the Middle Atlantic League in games, hits, runs, stolen bases and finished 2nd in batting average as his brother Dan Rooney (Wheelings catcher that year) finished 3rd in BA. Art also played halfback for the semi-pro Pittsburgh "Hope Harvey" and "Majestic Radio" clubs which he later took over and renamed the J.P. Rooneys before purchasing an NFL franchise for $2,500 in 1933.[2]
Pittsburgh Steelers[edit]

Art Rooney on the good ole days

The biggest thrill wasn't in winning on Sunday but in meeting the payroll on Monday.
“
”

1983 Steelers yearbook [5]
Rooney's affiliation with the National Football League (NFL) began in 1933 when he paid a $2,500 franchise fee to found a club based in the city of Pittsburgh. He had named his new team the "Pirates" which was also the name of the city's long-established Major League Baseball club of which Rooney was a fan since a childhood spent in the shadow of the team's stadium.
Since the league's inception in 1920, the NFL had wanted a team in Pittsburgh due to the city's already-long history with football as well as the popularity of the Pittsburgh Panthers football team, an NCAA national championship contender during this period. The league was finally able to take advantage of Pennsylvania relaxing their blue laws that prior to 1933 prohibited sporting events from taking place on Sundays, when most NFL games take place.
In 1936, Rooney won a parlay at Saratoga Race Course, which netted him about $160,000. He used the winnings to hire a coach, Joe Bach, give contracts to his players and almost win a championship. The winnings funded the team until 1941 when he sold the franchise to NY playboy Alex Thompson. Thompson wanted to move the franchise to Boston so he could be within a five-hour train ride of his club. At the same time, the Philadelphia Eagles ran into financial problems. Rooney used the funds from the sale of franchise to get a 70% interest in the Eagles, the other 30% held by Rooney friend and future NFL commissioner, Bert Bell. Bell and Rooney agreed to trade places with Thompson. Bell took the role of President of the Steelers that he relinquished to Rooney in 1946 when Bell became Commissioner. Rooney got his good friend and his sister's father in law, Barney McGinley, to buy Bell's shares. Barney's son Jack, Art's brother in law, retained the McGinley interest that passed to his heirs when he died in 2006.[6]

Howard Cosell on the Rooneys

The Rooneys are the finest people, the people I most respect in American sports ownership. I've always felt that way. And there's no reason to change. They are people of integrity and character. The way they put the Steelers together, to hire a man like Chuck Noll, to emphasize the team concept. I have a whole transcendental feeling for the Steelers and the Rooneys and Pittsburgh.
“
”

— Howard Cosell, October 1982[7]
Rooney sent shock waves through the NFL by signing Byron "Whizzer" White to a record-breaking $15,000 contract in 1938. This move, however, did not bring the Pirates a winning season, and White left the team for the Detroit Lions the following year. The club did not have a season above .500 until 1942, the year after they were renamed the Pittsburgh Steelers.
During World War II, the Steelers had some financial difficulties and were merged with the Philadelphia Eagles in 1943 and the Chicago Cardinals in 1944.
After the war, Rooney became team president. He longed to bring an NFL title to Pittsburgh but was never able to beat the powerhouse teams, like the Cleveland Browns and Green Bay Packers. The Steelers also struggled with playing in a city and era where baseball was king and were treated as something of a joke compared to the Pirates. The team also made some questionable personnel calls at the time such as cutting a then-unknown Johnny Unitas in training camp (Unitas would go on to a Hall of Fame career with the Baltimore Colts) and trading their first round pick in the 1965 draft to the Chicago Bears (who would draft Dick Butkus with the pick), among others.
Nevertheless, Rooney was popular with owners as a mediator, which would carry over to his son Dan Rooney. He was the only owner to vote against moving the rights of the New York Yanks to Dallas, Texas after the 1951 season due to concerns of racism in the South at the time.[8] (Ultimately, the Dallas Texans failed after one year, and the rights were moved to Baltimore, where the team became the Baltimore Colts. The team now plays in Indianapolis.) In 1963, along with Bears owner George Halas, Rooney was one of two owners to vote for the 1925 NFL Championship to be reinstated to the long-defunct Pottsville Maroons.
Pittsburgh Penguins[edit]
As a pillar of the community in many aspects, Rooney was asked to lend his considerable influence in the city's bid to reclaim a NHL franchise during the league's expansion in 1967. Although Pittsburgh enjoyed championship hockey with the professional but "minor league" Pittsburgh Hornets since its NHL franchise (the Pirates hockey team) disbanded in 1930 from the effects of the Great Depression, many city leaders were pushing for the region to become more "major league" suggesting that Mr. Rooney use his influence in the sports industry to have the league award Pittsburgh a franchise. Rooney proved his worth and from 1967 until the early 1970s was a part owner of the Pittsburgh Penguins.[9][10]
Homestead Grays[edit]
In a 1981 interview by the Pittsburgh Press Rooney related that "from time to time he had helped financially support the Negro League team, the Homestead Grays, and . . . was a better baseball fan than football fan."[11]
Track sports[edit]
Rooney also acquired the Yonkers Raceway in 1972, the Palm Beach Kennel Club, Green Mountain Kennel Club in Vermont, Shamrock Stables in Maryland and owned the Liberty Bell Park Racetrack outside Philadelphia.[12]
Later life[edit]
Following the AFL–NFL merger in 1970, the Steelers agreed to leave the NFL Eastern Conference and joined the AFC Central Division.


Everyone knew Mr. Rooney was our number one citizen...he did more for this city than R.K. Mellon did for the business community and David Lawrence and any of the mayors who followed him, including Richard Caliguiri, did politically.
“
”

Tom Foerster[13]
Through expert scouting, the Steelers became a power. In 1972, they began a remarkable 8–year run of playoff appearances, and thirteen straight years of winning seasons, including three additional playoff berths. In Rooney's 41st season as owner, the club won the Super Bowl. They followed up with Super Bowl victories following the 1975, 1978 and 1979 seasons. They have also won the 2005 and 2008 Super Bowls. Making the Steelers the first team following the AFL–NFL merger, to win six Super Bowls.


I'll never forget the way he introduced me, 'This is Ralph Giampaolo, a member of our organization.' Not a member of our ground crew. Not some rinky-dink bum. But a member of 'our organization'. As far as [Curt] Gowdy knew, I was vice president of the team. Mr. Rooney made me feel 10 feet tall.
“
”

Inviting a groundskeeper up to the owner's box for dinner.[13]
Following the Steelers' victory in Super Bowl IX, Rooney stepped down from day-to-day management of the team, but remained the ultimate source of authority until his death. Dan, his son, took over as team president. Rooney died from complications of a stroke on August 25, 1988. An August 1987 Pittsburgh Press story stated that Rooney never missed a Hall of Fame induction ceremony in all 25 years, and that he was asked to present his third inductee, John Henry Johnson that month.[14] In memory of "The Chief", Steelers wore a patch on the left shoulder of their uniforms with Rooney's initials AJR for the entire season. The team ended up finishing 5-11, their worst record since a 1–13 showing in 1969. He is buried at the North Side Catholic Cemetery in Pittsburgh.[15]
Legacy[edit]




A stature of Art Rooney Heinz Field


In 1964, he was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Duquesne University named their football field in his honor in 1993. In 1999 Rooney ranked 81st on the Sporting News' "100 Most Powerful Sports Figures of the 20th Century" list. A statue of his likeness graces the entrance to the home of the Pittsburgh Steelers, Heinz Field. The street that runs adjacent to Heinz Field on Pittsburgh's North Side is named "Art Rooney Avenue" in his honor.[16][17] In 2000, he was inducted as a "pioneer" into the American Football Association's Semi-Pro Football Hall of Fame.[18]
During Rooney's life, the Steelers would often use a late-round draft pick on a player from a local college like Pitt, West Virginia or Penn State. Though these players rarely made the team, this practice was intended to appeal to local fans and players. The team has occasionally employed this practice after Rooney's death, however, they now focus more on talent than geography throughout the entire draft. Rooney also supposedly liked players from Notre Dame due to his Irish Catholic background, which some say explains why he allegedly had the team keep Notre Dame alumnus and wounded Vietnam veteran Rocky Bleier.[citation needed] Bleier would go on to become one of the key members of the team's success in the 1970s.[citation needed]

Art Rooney is the subject of, and the only character in, the one-man play The Chief, written by Gene Collier and Rob Zellers. The play debuted at the Pittsburgh Public Theater in 2003, and has been revived on three occasions since then. All productions have starred Tom Atkins as Rooney.[citation needed]
At Steeler games, there is a sign that shows a picture of Rooney with his characteristic cigar and under the photo, the word "Believe."[citation needed]

Art Rooney's North Side Golden Rule

My father always used to tell us boys, "Treat everybody the way you'd like to be treated. Give them the benefit of the doubt. But never let anyone mistake kindness for weakness." He took the Golden Rule and put a little bit of the North Side in it.

— Art Rooney Jr. on his father[21]
Art J. Rooney was for 51 years, until her 1982 death, married to Kathleen Rooney née McNulty (1904–1982). Kathleen was the mother of Art's five sons, who are Dan Rooney, the chairman of the board of directors of the Pittsburgh Steelers and a former United States Ambassador to Ireland, Art Rooney Jr., Timothy Rooney, Patrick Rooney, and John Rooney (all also directors of the Pittsburgh Steelers). She is also grandmother of the couple's 32 grandchildren, including current Steelers president Art Rooney II and U.S. Representative Thomas J. Rooney (R, FL-16). The couple also has about 75 great grandchildren, including actress sisters Kate Mara and Rooney Mara.[22][23][24][25][26][27]

Family history[edit]
Rooney's great-grandparents, James and Mary Rooney, were Irish Catholics who emigrated from Newry in County Down, Ireland to Canada during the Irish potato famine in the 1840s. While living in Montreal, the Rooneys had a son, Arthur (who would become Art Rooney's grandfather). James and Mary later moved to Ebbw Vale, Wales, where the iron industry was flourishing, taking their son Arthur, then 21, with them. This Arthur Rooney married Catherine Regan (who was also Irish Catholic), in Wales, and they had a son, Dan. Two years after Dan Rooney was born, the family moved back to Canada and eventually ended up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1884. Along the way the family grew to include nine children of which Dan was the second.[1]
Dan Rooney remained in the Pittsburgh area, and eventually opened a saloon in the Monongahela Valley coal town of Coulter, Pennsylvania (or Coultersville). This is where Dan Rooney met and wed Margaret "Maggie" Murray, who was the daughter of a coal miner, and where the couple's first son, Arthur Joseph Rooney, was born. Dan and Maggie would eventually settle their family in Pittsburgh's North Side in 1913, where they bought a three story building at the corner of Corey Street and General Robinson Street. Dan operated a cafe and saloon out of the first floor with the family living above. The building was located just a block from Exposition Park, which had been home to the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team until 1909.[1]
Education and athletics[edit]
Rooney attended St. Peter's Catholic School in Pittsburgh, Duquesne University Prep School, then several semesters at Indiana Normal School before completing a final year at Temple University on an athletic scholarship.[2] After graduation, he dedicated himself to sports, winning the AAU welterweight belt in 1918 and tried out for the 1920 Olympic Team,[3] he played minor league baseball for both the Flint, Michigan "Vehicles" and the Wheeling, West Virginia "Stogies".[4] In 1925 he served as Wheeling's player-manager and led the Middle Atlantic League in games, hits, runs, stolen bases and finished 2nd in batting average as his brother Dan Rooney (Wheelings catcher that year) finished 3rd in BA. Art also played halfback for the semi-pro Pittsburgh "Hope Harvey" and "Majestic Radio" clubs which he later took over and renamed the J.P. Rooneys before purchasing an NFL franchise for $2,500 in 1933.[2]
Pittsburgh Steelers[edit]

Art Rooney on the good ole days

The biggest thrill wasn't in winning on Sunday but in meeting the payroll on Monday.
“
”

1983 Steelers yearbook [5]
Rooney's affiliation with the National Football League (NFL) began in 1933 when he paid a $2,500 franchise fee to found a club based in the city of Pittsburgh. He had named his new team the "Pirates" which was also the name of the city's long-established Major League Baseball club of which Rooney was a fan since a childhood spent in the shadow of the team's stadium.
Since the league's inception in 1920, the NFL had wanted a team in Pittsburgh due to the city's already-long history with football as well as the popularity of the Pittsburgh Panthers football team, an NCAA national championship contender during this period. The league was finally able to take advantage of Pennsylvania relaxing their blue laws that prior to 1933 prohibited sporting events from taking place on Sundays, when most NFL games take place.
In 1936, Rooney won a parlay at Saratoga Race Course, which netted him about $160,000. He used the winnings to hire a coach, Joe Bach, give contracts to his players and almost win a championship. The winnings funded the team until 1941 when he sold the franchise to NY playboy Alex Thompson. Thompson wanted to move the franchise to Boston so he could be within a five-hour train ride of his club. At the same time, the Philadelphia Eagles ran into financial problems. Rooney used the funds from the sale of franchise to get a 70% interest in the Eagles, the other 30% held by Rooney friend and future NFL commissioner, Bert Bell. Bell and Rooney agreed to trade places with Thompson. Bell took the role of President of the Steelers that he relinquished to Rooney in 1946 when Bell became Commissioner. Rooney got his good friend and his sister's father in law, Barney McGinley, to buy Bell's shares. Barney's son Jack, Art's brother in law, retained the McGinley interest that passed to his heirs when he died in 2006.[6]

Howard Cosell on the Rooneys

The Rooneys are the finest people, the people I most respect in American sports ownership. I've always felt that way. And there's no reason to change. They are people of integrity and character. The way they put the Steelers together, to hire a man like Chuck Noll, to emphasize the team concept. I have a whole transcendental feeling for the Steelers and the Rooneys and Pittsburgh.
“
”

— Howard Cosell, October 1982[7]
Rooney sent shock waves through the NFL by signing Byron "Whizzer" White to a record-breaking $15,000 contract in 1938. This move, however, did not bring the Pirates a winning season, and White left the team for the Detroit Lions the following year. The club did not have a season above .500 until 1942, the year after they were renamed the Pittsburgh Steelers.
During World War II, the Steelers had some financial difficulties and were merged with the Philadelphia Eagles in 1943 and the Chicago Cardinals in 1944.
After the war, Rooney became team president. He longed to bring an NFL title to Pittsburgh but was never able to beat the powerhouse teams, like the Cleveland Browns and Green Bay Packers. The Steelers also struggled with playing in a city and era where baseball was king and were treated as something of a joke compared to the Pirates. The team also made some questionable personnel calls at the time such as cutting a then-unknown Johnny Unitas in training camp (Unitas would go on to a Hall of Fame career with the Baltimore Colts) and trading their first round pick in the 1965 draft to the Chicago Bears (who would draft Dick Butkus with the pick), among others.
Nevertheless, Rooney was popular with owners as a mediator, which would carry over to his son Dan Rooney. He was the only owner to vote against moving the rights of the New York Yanks to Dallas, Texas after the 1951 season due to concerns of racism in the South at the time.[8] (Ultimately, the Dallas Texans failed after one year, and the rights were moved to Baltimore, where the team became the Baltimore Colts. The team now plays in Indianapolis.) In 1963, along with Bears owner George Halas, Rooney was one of two owners to vote for the 1925 NFL Championship to be reinstated to the long-defunct Pottsville Maroons.
Pittsburgh Penguins[edit]
As a pillar of the community in many aspects, Rooney was asked to lend his considerable influence in the city's bid to reclaim a NHL franchise during the league's expansion in 1967. Although Pittsburgh enjoyed championship hockey with the professional but "minor league" Pittsburgh Hornets since its NHL franchise (the Pirates hockey team) disbanded in 1930 from the effects of the Great Depression, many city leaders were pushing for the region to become more "major league" suggesting that Mr. Rooney use his influence in the sports industry to have the league award Pittsburgh a franchise. Rooney proved his worth and from 1967 until the early 1970s was a part owner of the Pittsburgh Penguins.[9][10]
Homestead Grays[edit]
In a 1981 interview by the Pittsburgh Press Rooney related that "from time to time he had helped financially support the Negro League team, the Homestead Grays, and . . . was a better baseball fan than football fan."[11]
Track sports[edit]
Rooney also acquired the Yonkers Raceway in 1972, the Palm Beach Kennel Club, Green Mountain Kennel Club in Vermont, Shamrock Stables in Maryland and owned the Liberty Bell Park Racetrack outside Philadelphia.[12]
Later life[edit]
Following the AFL–NFL merger in 1970, the Steelers agreed to leave the NFL Eastern Conference and joined the AFC Central Division.


Everyone knew Mr. Rooney was our number one citizen...he did more for this city than R.K. Mellon did for the business community and David Lawrence and any of the mayors who followed him, including Richard Caliguiri, did politically.
“
”

Tom Foerster[13]
Through expert scouting, the Steelers became a power. In 1972, they began a remarkable 8–year run of playoff appearances, and thirteen straight years of winning seasons, including three additional playoff berths. In Rooney's 41st season as owner, the club won the Super Bowl. They followed up with Super Bowl victories following the 1975, 1978 and 1979 seasons. They have also won the 2005 and 2008 Super Bowls. Making the Steelers the first team following the AFL–NFL merger, to win six Super Bowls.


I'll never forget the way he introduced me, 'This is Ralph Giampaolo, a member of our organization.' Not a member of our ground crew. Not some rinky-dink bum. But a member of 'our organization'. As far as [Curt] Gowdy knew, I was vice president of the team. Mr. Rooney made me feel 10 feet tall.
“
”

Inviting a groundskeeper up to the owner's box for dinner.[13]
Following the Steelers' victory in Super Bowl IX, Rooney stepped down from day-to-day management of the team, but remained the ultimate source of authority until his death. Dan, his son, took over as team president. Rooney died from complications of a stroke on August 25, 1988. An August 1987 Pittsburgh Press story stated that Rooney never missed a Hall of Fame induction ceremony in all 25 years, and that he was asked to present his third inductee, John Henry Johnson that month.[14] In memory of "The Chief", Steelers wore a patch on the left shoulder of their uniforms with Rooney's initials AJR for the entire season. The team ended up finishing 5-11, their worst record since a 1–13 showing in 1969. He is buried at the North Side Catholic Cemetery in Pittsburgh.[15]
Legacy[edit]




A stature of Art Rooney Heinz Field


In 1964, he was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Duquesne University named their football field in his honor in 1993. In 1999 Rooney ranked 81st on the Sporting News' "100 Most Powerful Sports Figures of the 20th Century" list. A statue of his likeness graces the entrance to the home of the Pittsburgh Steelers, Heinz Field. The street that runs adjacent to Heinz Field on Pittsburgh's North Side is named "Art Rooney Avenue" in his honor.[16][17] In 2000, he was inducted as a "pioneer" into the American Football Association's Semi-Pro Football Hall of Fame.[18]
During Rooney's life, the Steelers would often use a late-round draft pick on a player from a local college like Pitt, West Virginia or Penn State. Though these players rarely made the team, this practice was intended to appeal to local fans and players. The team has occasionally employed this practice after Rooney's death, however, they now focus more on talent than geography throughout the entire draft. Rooney also supposedly liked players from Notre Dame due to his Irish Catholic background, which some say explains why he allegedly had the team keep Notre Dame alumnus and wounded Vietnam veteran Rocky Bleier.[citation needed] Bleier would go on to become one of the key members of the team's success in the 1970s.[citation needed]

Art Rooney is the subject of, and the only character in, the one-man play The Chief, written by Gene Collier and Rob Zellers. The play debuted at the Pittsburgh Public Theater in 2003, and has been revived on three occasions since then. All productions have starred Tom Atkins as Rooney.[citation needed]
At Steeler games, there is a sign that shows a picture of Rooney with his characteristic cigar and under the photo, the word "Believe."[citation needed]

Art Rooney's North Side Golden Rule

My father always used to tell us boys, "Treat everybody the way you'd like to be treated. Give them the benefit of the doubt. But never let anyone mistake kindness for weakness." He took the Golden Rule and put a little bit of the North Side in it.

— Art Rooney Jr. on his father[21]
Art J. Rooney was for 51 years, until her 1982 death, married to Kathleen Rooney née McNulty (1904–1982). Kathleen was the mother of Art's five sons, who are Dan Rooney, the chairman of the board of directors of the Pittsburgh Steelers and a former United States Ambassador to Ireland, Art Rooney Jr., Timothy Rooney, Patrick Rooney, and John Rooney (all also directors of the Pittsburgh Steelers). She is also grandmother of the couple's 32 grandchildren, including current Steelers president Art Rooney II and U.S. Representative Thomas J. Rooney (R, FL-16). The couple also has about 75 great grandchildren, including actress sisters Kate Mara and Rooney Mara.[22][23][24][25][26][27]

ARTHUR 
          J. ROONEY
          in 1983
Moments 
          after the conclusion of Super Bowl IX, on a chilly January day in New 
          Orleans eight years ago, captain Andy Russell held up a football in 
          the Pittsburgh Steelers' locker room at old Tulane Stadium and handed 
          it to an old man. 
"This 
          one's for the Chief," Russell said. "It's been a long time coming. " 
          The Chief, Art Rooney, pulled out the old National Football League ledger 
          books he keeps carefully wrapped in a cellophane bag in the desk drawer 
          of his offices at Three Rivers Stadium. The books are 30 years old now, 
          but they're still in remarkedly good condition. 
They 
          tell the story, in Rooney's own neat handwriting, of the birth of a 
          franchise the humble origins of a team celebrating its Golden Anniversary 
          season in 1982. 
The 
          81-year-old Rooney opens the pages of the first ledger. It suggests 
          football's equivalent of John Hancock's pulling the Declaration of Independence 
          out of his desk drawer to show where he signed it. "I found these when 
          we moved here. I don't think anybody around here is interested in them," 
          Rooney says almost apologetically. "But they bring back a lot of memories 
          for me." 
He 
          remembers Byron (Whizzer) White, Johnny Blood (McNally), and Bill Dudley 
          as vividly as Terry Bradshaw, Franco Harris, and Lynn Swann. He remembers 
          the bad old days as well as the good old days. He remembers he founded 
          the team the year FDR became president, and didn't get his first championship 
          trophy until Gerald Ford held the office. 
He 
          enjoyed all the years, even the frustrating ones when I had to walk 
          in the alleys instead of on the main drag; but the most satisfying ones 
          were when we finally won," he says. 
The 
          ledger books show it all started on September 20, 1933 - the Wednesday 
          the Steelers played their first game at Forbes Field against, the New 
          York Giants. There were 13,483 fans, who paid a total of $12,270.03. 
          The Steelers lost 23-2, but Rooney noted: "Crowd was very enthusiastic." 
          That was the modest beginning. 
A whole 
          generation of fans has grown up thinking the Steelers always were the 
          modern, successful organisation that Rooney's two eldest sons, Dan and 
          Art, Jr., and coach Chuck Noll built when they became the "Team of the 
          Seventies." 
But 
          the game's pioneers never dreamed of instant relays and Super Sundays 
          back in the days when they ran their franchises with a handshake. Rooney 
          still remembers the time in the 1930s when George Halas of Chicago offered 
          to give him $500 more than the guarantee for shifting a game date. 
The 
          guarantee was 40 percent of the gate or a minimum of $2,500. When it 
          came time to divide the money, Rooney s 40 percent amounted to $3,200. 
          After Rooney reminded Halas about the extra $500, Halas argued he already 
          was getting $700 more than the $2,500 guarantee. 
The 
          two men argued their points back and forth until Halas got up from behind 
          his desk and said, "I'll fight you for it, " Rooney laughed and said 
          he didn't want to fight, but finally he won his argument and walked 
          off with a check for $3,7 00.
 As 
          Rooney got to the door, he turned to Halas and said, "George, you know 
          if we'd had that fight, you were no sure thing. 
" It 
          was just a hop, skip, I and a jump from semi-pro ball in those days, 
          maybe just a hop," Rooney says between chomps on his familiar cigar. 
          'The biggest thrill wasn't in winning on Sunday but in meeting the payroll 
          on Monday." 
An 
          athlete, a promoter, and a noted horse player, Rooney had been operating 
          a semi-pro team for years. He was able to bring that team into the National 
          Football League after paying a $2,300 NFL franchise fee in 1933 simply 
          because the Pennsylvania Blue Laws banning Sunday play were repealed 
          that year. 
One 
          of the most enduring legends is that he founded the team after scoring 
          heavily at the racetrack. He did make a memorable two-day killing at 
          old Empire City and Saratoga, but that came in 1936, after the franchise 
          had been founded. The early days of the Steelers are rich in legend 
          and lore. 
Rooney's 
          ledger entry after a 1934 game - "Pittsburgh looked bad, crowd hostile" 
          - could have summed up a lot of games over the years. With a twinkle 
          in his Irish eyes, Rooney, who seems to have stepped out of the pages 
          of the Last Hurrah, tells stories about those days. 
"I 
          was at the track most of the time and, unfortunately, some of my coaches 
          were with me," he says. Rooney's quick wit and easy- going manner have 
          given him the image of being a loveable loser. He pleads innocent of 
          the charge. "I take it terribly," he says. "Nobody feels any worse than 
          I do about losing." 
The 
          Steelers didn't always lose. At times, they played better than legend 
          now has it. Three different times - in 1936, 1947, and 1963 - the Steelers 
          needed to win their last game to clinch the division title. On all three 
          of those occasions they were playing a team they had beaten during the 
          regular season. All three times, they lost. 
That 
          was the story of the franchise. Rooney often was operating on a shoestring 
          budget because Forbes 
          Field was a small stadium, and he was a good natured guy 
          who never liked to make the tough decisions that go with a winning football 
          team. 
"My 
          father was a little bit of a rogue and he had some flaws, but they were 
          great flaws," his son Art, Jr., says. "He carried loyalty and friendship 
          to the extreme." On top of everything else, the Steelers always seemed 
          to be unlucky. 
There 
          were no Immaculate Receptions in those days. Instead, there were plays 
          such as Frank Gifford's diving one-handed catch that helped the New 
          York Giants beat the Steelers 33-17 in the 1963 finale for the division 
          title. 
The 
          Steelers' coach in that game, Buddy Parker, once groaned, "When this 
          team gets lucky, it'll be lucky for ten years." He didn't know he was 
          looking ahead to the 1970s when Franco Harris made the Immaculate Reception 
          and the Steelers won coin flips for the rights to draft Terry Bradshaw 
          and Lynn Swann. 
The 
          team got new uniforms in 1941 and changed its name from Pirates to Steelers. 
          When Art Rooney stopped at his team's Hershey, Pennsylvania, training 
          camp to watch practice, a newsman asked what he thought of the team.
 "They 
          look like the same old Steelers," Rooney cracked. 
The 
          name stuck. For years and years, when anything went wrong, the fans 
          derided them as the Same Old Steelers. Rooney's main project until the 
          end of World War II simply was keeping the team alive. 
The 
          Steelers had only one winning season in their first 10 years. Even signing 
          Whizzer White in 1938 for the then incredible sum of $13,800 didn't 
          help. The team went 2-9 with the future U.S. Supreme Court Justice in 
          the backfield. 
In 
          1941, Rooney even sold the team to Alexis Thompson and bought half of 
          the Philadelphia franchise owned by his friend Bert Bell. He quickly 
          had second thoughts and convinced Thompson to swap teams. 
So 
          Rooney and Bell shared the Pittsburgh franchise during World War II. 
          Bell retained his interest until 1946, when he became commissioner, 
          and sold his share to Rooney and Barney McGinley, whose son Jack still 
          owns 30 percent of the team. 
After 
          World War II, pro football took its first step towards big-time status. 
          Rooney figured it was the beginning of a new era when he signed Dr. 
          Jock Sutherland, who had won national collegiate championships at the 
          University of Pittsburgh in the 1930s, as coach in 1946. 
A tough 
          disciplinarian, Sutherland had the Steelers in a playoff for the division 
          title with Philadelphia in 1947. The Steelers lost 21-0, but Sutherland 
          seemed to be building a winner. The franchise then was hit by tragedy. 
          Sutherland died of a brain tumor in the spring of 1948. 
The 
          team floundered coaches John Michelosen, Joe Bach, and Walt Kiesling 
          (who spent 21 years with the team and was called in to coach three different 
          times). 
Bach, 
          who had coached the club in 1933-36 before leaving for various assistant 
          and head coaching jobs at the collegiate level, modernised the team 
          in 1952 when the Steelers became the last pro club to abandon the Single 
          Wing. But Bach had to resign in 1934 because of illness. 
It 
          was an era noted for per- sonnel mistakes. The Steelers cut Johnny Unitas, 
          a ninth round draft pick, in 1933. They made obscure defensive back 
          Gary Click the number one pick in the 1936 draft. In 1937, they passed 
          up Jim Brown for Len Dawson. 
The 
          Steelers had a sprinkling of good players, including Elbie Nickel, Ernie 
          Stautner, Jim Finks, Lynn Chandnois, Jack Butler, Fran Rogel, and Pat 
          Brady - but they really were the Same Old Steelers. 
The 
          only time Art Rooney ever interfered with a coach in his half century 
          with the club came during the Kiesling regime. A conservative coach, 
          Keisling sent Rogel up the middle on the first play of every game. The 
          fans even chanted "Hi-Diddle-Diddle! Rogel Up the Middle. " 
So 
          Rooney finally ordered Kiesling to call a pass play on the first play 
          of a game in 1956. It was such a surprise that Jack Scarhath threw an 
          80-yard touchdown pass to Jack (Goose) McClairen. But the play was called 
          back because of an offside penalty, and on the next play, first and 
          15, Rogel went up the middle. Years 
          later, Kiesling confessed to having told a player to intentionally beat 
          the snap. 
Buddy 
          Parker's arrival in 1957 signaled the start an upswing in Steeler fortunes. 
          The new coach brought in veterans such as Bobby Layne (his old Detroit 
          quarterback), John Henry Johnson, and Eugene (Big Daddy) Lipscomb, and 
          made the team a contender. But Parker was noted for his rash moves and 
          impulsive trades - most notably the 1964 trade of wide receiver Buddy 
          Dial to Dallas for the rights to defensive tackle Scott Appleton of 
          Texas, whom the Steelers couldn't sign. It became known as the Buddy 
          Dial- for-Nothing trade, another chapter of the Same Old Steelers. 
After 
          the Dial trade, there was a changing of the guard. Art Rooney told Buddy 
          Parker to get approval for future trades from his eldest son, Dan. Born 
          the year the team was founded, Dan was 31 and taking administrative 
          control of the team. 
Rooney's 
          second son, Art, Jr., two years younger than Dan, was moving into the 
          scouting department. A younger generation of Rooneys was coming of age. 
          Art, Jr., known as Artie, says, "A friend of mine told me it wasn't 
          for us. It was more like a quest in the days of the Knights, King Arthur 
          and all that stuff. It was exciting to work in that climate. The family 
          name was at stake."
