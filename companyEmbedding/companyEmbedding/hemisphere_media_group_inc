              Investor Relations
          









Hemisphere Media Group, Inc. is the only publicly traded pure-play U.S. Hispanic TV /cable networks and content platform. Headquartered in Miami, Florida, Hemisphere’s networks consist of:


The leading Spanish-language movie channel with over 20 million subscribers across the U.S., Latin America and Canada, including 4.6 million subscribers in the U.S. and 16 million subscribers in Latin America, featuring the largest selection of contemporary Spanish-language blockbusters and critically-acclaimed titles from Mexico, Latin América, Spain and the Caribbean.

 


The leading cable network targeting Puerto Ricans and other Caribbean Hispanics living in the U.S., featuring the highly-rated news and entertainment programming produced by WAPA . WAPA América is distributed in the U.S. to 5.3 million subscribers.

 


Puerto Rico’s leading broadcast television network with the highest primetime and full day ratings in Puerto Rico. Founded in 1954, WAPA produces more than 70 hours per week of top-rated news and entertainment programming.

 


A leading network dedicated to showcasing the most popular telenovelas and drama series. Pasiones has 4.6 million subscribers in the U.S. and 13.5 million subscribers in Latin America.

 


The leading network targeting Central Americans living in the U.S., the third-largest U.S. Hispanic group, featuring the most popular news, entertainment and soccer programming from Central America. Centroamérica TV is distributed in the U.S. to 4.1 million subscribers.

 


The leading network targeting Dominicans living in the U.S., featuring the most popular news, and entertainment programming from the Dominican Republic. Televisión Dominicana is distributed in the U.S. to 3.3 million subscribers.

 


Canal Uno, a partnership with leading Colombian content producers, is one of only three national broadcast television licenses in Colombia. The partnership was awarded a 10-year renewable broadcast TV concession for Canal Uno in Colombia in 2016. The concession provides the partnership with a rare opportunity to access one of Latin America’s most robust and stable economies with an attractive television advertising market. It also provides Hemisphere the opportunity to produce high quality content which can be repurposed on HMTV ’s channels and syndicated internationally. The partnership began operating the network on May 1, 2017.

 


OTT Platform, a cross-platform Spanish-language digital subscription service that is well positioned to be the dominant player in the Spanish-language Digital/ OTT space. The service will allow audiences to access many of the best and most current Spanish-language films and is expected to launch in 2017. It will include content from Hemisphere’s movie library, Pantelion’s U.S. theatrical titles, Lionsgate’s movie library, and Televisa’s theatrical releases in Mexico. The service will utilize STARZ ’s technology platform and leverage Univision’s marketing and distribution.

              Investor Relations
          









Hemisphere Media Group, Inc. is the only publicly traded pure-play U.S. Hispanic TV /cable networks and content platform. Headquartered in Miami, Florida, Hemisphere’s networks consist of:


The leading Spanish-language movie channel with over 20 million subscribers across the U.S., Latin America and Canada, including 4.6 million subscribers in the U.S. and 16 million subscribers in Latin America, featuring the largest selection of contemporary Spanish-language blockbusters and critically-acclaimed titles from Mexico, Latin América, Spain and the Caribbean.

 


The leading cable network targeting Puerto Ricans and other Caribbean Hispanics living in the U.S., featuring the highly-rated news and entertainment programming produced by WAPA . WAPA América is distributed in the U.S. to 5.3 million subscribers.

 


Puerto Rico’s leading broadcast television network with the highest primetime and full day ratings in Puerto Rico. Founded in 1954, WAPA produces more than 70 hours per week of top-rated news and entertainment programming.

 


A leading network dedicated to showcasing the most popular telenovelas and drama series. Pasiones has 4.6 million subscribers in the U.S. and 13.5 million subscribers in Latin America.

 


The leading network targeting Central Americans living in the U.S., the third-largest U.S. Hispanic group, featuring the most popular news, entertainment and soccer programming from Central America. Centroamérica TV is distributed in the U.S. to 4.1 million subscribers.

 


The leading network targeting Dominicans living in the U.S., featuring the most popular news, and entertainment programming from the Dominican Republic. Televisión Dominicana is distributed in the U.S. to 3.3 million subscribers.

 


Canal Uno, a partnership with leading Colombian content producers, is one of only three national broadcast television licenses in Colombia. The partnership was awarded a 10-year renewable broadcast TV concession for Canal Uno in Colombia in 2016. The concession provides the partnership with a rare opportunity to access one of Latin America’s most robust and stable economies with an attractive television advertising market. It also provides Hemisphere the opportunity to produce high quality content which can be repurposed on HMTV ’s channels and syndicated internationally. The partnership began operating the network on May 1, 2017.

 


OTT Platform, a cross-platform Spanish-language digital subscription service that is well positioned to be the dominant player in the Spanish-language Digital/ OTT space. The service will allow audiences to access many of the best and most current Spanish-language films and is expected to launch in 2017. It will include content from Hemisphere’s movie library, Pantelion’s U.S. theatrical titles, Lionsgate’s movie library, and Televisa’s theatrical releases in Mexico. The service will utilize STARZ ’s technology platform and leverage Univision’s marketing and distribution.
