NUTRIBAND
INC. AND SUBSIDIARY 

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

AS OF AND
FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2016

  




1.



DESCRIPTION
OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES




 

The
consolidated balance sheet as of July 31, 2016 and the consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders' deficiency and cash flows
for the periods presented have been prepared by Nutriband, Inc. and
Subsidiary (the "Company" or "Nutriband") and are unaudited. The
consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with
the requirements for unaudited interim periods, and consequently,
do not include all disclosures required to be made in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. In the opinion of management, all adjustments
(consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments) necessary to
present fairly the financial position, results of operations,
changes in stockholders' deficiency and cash flows for all periods
presented have been made. The information for the consolidated
balance sheet as of January 31, 2016 was derived from audited
financial statements of the Company.

 

Organization

 

Nutriband
Inc. (the “Company” or “Nutriband”) was
incorporated in the State of Nevada in January 2016. In January
2016, the Company acquired Nutriband Ltd. (“Nutriband
Ltd”), a company registered in Dublin, Ireland, to enter the
health supplement market with new applications of transdermal
patches for delivery of supplements. Nutriband Ltd. moved
manufacturing and operations to the United States during 2016. The
product line consists of three products: an Energy Patchline,
Weight Management Patchline, and a Multivitamin
Patchline.

 

Going
Concern

 

The
consolidated financial statements for the six months ended July 31,
2016 have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates
the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and
commitments in the normal course of business.  The
Company has a past history of recurring losses from
operations.  The Company will require additional funding
to execute its future strategic business
plan.  Successful business operations and its transition
to attaining profitability are dependent upon obtaining additional
financing and achieving a level of revenue to support its cost
structure.  These factors raise substantial doubt about
the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.

 

Management
acquired Nutriband Ltd. in 2016 to enter the health supplement
market. The Company is also exploring some acquisition
opportunities which would expand the Company’s operations
into the pharmaceutical field, although no agreements have been
consummated at this time.

 

Management
believes these acquisitions will be profitable and the cash flows
from these operations will enable the Company to fund the
operations of the consolidated group over the next twelve months.
Therefore, the annual financial statements continue to be prepared
on a going concern basis.

 

Significant
Accounting Policies

 

The
Company’s significant accounting policies are summarized in
Note 1 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10 for the
period January 4, 2016 (Date of Formation) through January 31,
2016. There were no significant changes to these accounting
policies during the six months ended July 31, 2016 and the Company
does not expect that the adoption of other recent accounting
pronouncements will have a material effect on its financial
statements.

is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business,
less applicable variable selling expenses. The cost of finished
goods and work in progress is comprised of material costs, direct
labor costs and other direct costs and related production overheads
(based on normal operating capacity).

purchase 500,000 shares of common of the Company at an exercise
price of $0.70 per share not sooner than one year from the
execution of the transaction and not later than three years from
the closing of the transaction.

On June 28, 2017, The Company presented Nutriband's line of products to category buyers at Walmart's Global HQ in Bentonville, Arkansas.  The invite to present Nutriband was part of Walmart's initiative to purchase 250 BN of American made products and promote the creation of American jobs.
Gareth Sheridan, CEO of Nutriband Inc. commented 'it is great to be a part of this American Jobs initiative and to be invited to the world's largest retailer to promote Nutriband.  We are excited to explore this opportunity further'.

From what started in only Supplements, Nutriband has now also developed an impressive platform to develop drugs and diagnostics that treat diseases in many areas of medicine.
