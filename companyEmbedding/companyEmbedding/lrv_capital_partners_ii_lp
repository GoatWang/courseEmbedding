										LRV Capital 
										


Funded by Stride in April 2012
















LRV focuses on under-followed non-U.S. mid-cap equities, building a long-short portfolio of names not commonly found in other U.S., global, or regional funds.
International mid-caps have less coverage, most global funds are heavily invested in the US and regional funds lack the flexibility to invest across geographies.
LRV directs its research at mid-cap companies outside the U.S.  They have geographic flexibility across both developed and emerging markets, which enables LRV to hunt where the most lucrative opportunities can be found, providing diversifying non-U.S. exposures that many capital allocators lack.  The team’s deep experience navigating local market tendencies and biases allows them to be early in names when other market participants have a differing view.
LRV was founded by a team of three senior professionals: Craig Lottner, Mark Rooney, and Erik van der Sande, who worked together at $2 billion peak Millgate Capital (a Tiger cub with Silchester heritage) starting in 2002.
