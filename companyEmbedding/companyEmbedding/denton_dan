            Pistol Drill From the Ground
          






Working on a 12″ plate at 20 yards here.
Just working to place good hits from the ground and to keep my gun in the fight when it runs empty. The mechanics are somewhat modified from the same things standing.
This video shows about the 48th or 50th rep I did on this drill. It was 97F so I was getting pretty fatigued by this point. Fun times!
