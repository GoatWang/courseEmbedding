We love to help!Should I form my business as an LLC?Despite being a relatively new option, the limited liability company (LLC) is now one of the most popular business structures among smaller organizations. While allowing business owners to remain free from a great deal of the regulations imposed on other types of companies, it still provides limited liability protection for its owners (members). This means that the personal assets of an LLC's ownership cannot be collected to fulfill the debts of the business. What is involved in forming an LLC?All states require potential LLC owners to file a substantial set of documents, typically called the Articles of Organization, in order to establish their business. We can take care of this process for you, saving you time, effort, and allowing you to focus on developing your business – not filing paperwork. How should I name my LLC?The name you choose for your LLC is an important decision, as it will be how you represent yourself to potential associates and clients. With that in mind, it is advisable that you take some time to craft a name that you will be proud to have representing you and your business.Your name must be unique, and not deceptively similar, to any other trademarked name or business. It is also required that your name not be used to intentionally misrepresent the products or services you offer. For LLCs, nearly all states will also require you to add a signifier of your limited liability status, such as "LLC" or "L.L.C." to the end of your company's name. You may be able to operate under a name other than your formal LLC name by applying for and using a dba. Are there a required number of individuals needed to form an LLC?There is no minimum requirement as to the number of owners (also referred to as members) that an LLC must have. At the federal level, single-member LLCs qualify for pass-through taxation, however this is not always true at the state level.

      Pro Women's Soccer Returns To North Carolina

  /  WUNC





Professional women’s soccer will return to North Carolina. Steve Malik, owner of the Cary-based men’s soccer club North Carolina F.C., announced Monday that he acquired a team to play in the National Women’s Soccer League. The team is branded as North Carolina Courage, an homage to the Carolina Courage, which competed in the now-defunct Women’s United Soccer Association in the early 2000s. Since acquiring the men’s team – then called the Carolina RailHawks − a little more than a year ago, Malik has made big moves. In December he announced plans to compete for an expansion spot in Major League Soccer, the top domestic professional soccer league, and promised to build a new 24,000-seat stadium somewhere in the Triangle. Now he brought women’s professional soccer back to the Triangle. During the press conference to unveil N.C. Courage, Dean Linke, the voice of North Carolina F.C., called Malik a “godsend to soccer in the Triangle.” Gov. Roy Cooper also attended the unveiling, noting that it was his first economic development announcement since taking office. Malik did not receive any state incentives, and officials did not disclose any of the deal's financial details. Read: Pro Soccer In Triangle Rebrands, Announces Push For MLS Malik had intended to enter the National Women’s Soccer League, which has 10 teams, through expansion, something that would have had to wait until the 2018 season. However, through negotiations that lasted just a few weeks, Malik acquired the Western New York Flash, the league's reigning champions. The league's average game attendance runs about 5,000, though some of the top teams, like the Portland Thorns, regularly draw five digits, according to National Women’s Soccer League Commissioner Jeff Plush, who attended the press conference to unveil the Courage. The Flash had averaged closer to 3,000 attendees per game and were looking to move. Read: Triangle MLS Bid Faces Tough Competition That's where Malik saw the opportunity. "We started our conversation with Jeff ... to pursue an expansion franchise," said Malik, the only North American Soccer League team owner to also own a National Women's Soccer League team. "But I did say, having had some experience with leagues, is there a franchise where we could step in and acquire?" As it turned out there was, and this process allows the Courage to now play in the 2017 season, instead of having to wait for an expansion franchise in 2018. "This is certainly a faster, better process, and we are going to get a great product for the fans," Malik said. The Triangle offers a strong scene for professional soccer There is reason to believe a women's professional team could find success in the Triangle. Area universities have historically strong soccer programs, including the UNC women’s program which has won 21 Atlantic Coast Conference championships since 1987 and 22 NCAA national championships since 1981. The College Cup – soccer's version of the Final Four – has regularly played both men's and women's championships at WakeMed Soccer Park, and Capital Area Soccer Club (CASL) in Raleigh is one of the largest and most competitive youth soccer clubs in the nation for both boys and girls.          The N.C. Courage logo combines themes from the former Carolina Courage with those of North Carolina F.C. Credit Jason deBruyn / WUNC    With an eye on history, the Courage mascot will be a lion, which is similar to the previous courage, though with one important distinction. The previous Courage logo was of lion with a mane, clearly a male lion. The new logo is clearly a lioness, which makes more sense given that the Courage are a women's team. Malik said he wanted to keep aspects of the previous logo in the new one, "but it's also way cooler," he said. "This is not a male lion, if you aren’t familiar with how manes work." That line drew a chuckle from the roughly 100 who attended the unveiling. The logo and color scheme also looks similar to that of North Carolina F.C. The Courage will play at WakeMed Soccer Park, which is also the home to men's team. In the immediate future, the club's front office has some long nights of film study ahead. The women's soccer league draft is Jan. 12 and the Courage have the second, seventh, and 18th picks. Even with winning the championship this past year, the Flash front office had stockpiled draft picks in previous trades, setting the club up for potential future success. The Flash finished the regular season in fourth place, though rallied in the playoffs to win the championship. The team relies heavily on offense, and their style of play is high tempo. The team scored 40 goals in the regular season, five more than second-highest and 10 more than third-highest scoring teams. However, it also conceded 26 goals, the most of any team to finish in the top six in the regular season rankings. Tags: SoccerTweetShareGoogle+EmailView the discussion thread.

The newly renamed North Carolina F.C. will face stiff competition to join Major League Soccer. Owner Steve Malik bought the team a little more than a year ago, when it was still named the Carolina RailHawks. He quickly set his sights on making a bid to move from the North American Soccer League, a minor league soccer league, to the MLS, the highest professional soccer level in the United States.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
