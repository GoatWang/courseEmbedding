Waste to Energy / BioCRUDE Technologies






























































































Waste to Energy / BioCRUDE Technologies

















It is both a serious and a stirring time for the environment and green technology. The serious side of the equation is the fragile ecology that surrounds us. We have reached the line between maintaining our environment and destroying it. Ignoring that situation would be disastrous.
It is inspiring because we need to tap into all our talents and scientific resources to conceive of new and effective ways to deal with the massive ecological problems that face the world today. Those of us involved in green technology will know how high the stakes are; how important it is for our creativeness and intelligence to come together to create innovative and life-saving solutions.
BioCRUDE Technologies is a company that grew out of uncertain times and a massive need for invention. These are times when many companies fail to rise to the task, and new, young ideas carry other companies to the top.
We have assessed the main issues that we must address and we HAVE risen to the challenge.
There are four vital issues that affect the future of our planet: renewable energy sources, disposal of waste products, pollution control, and global warming. No project dealing with energy resources can ignore any one of these factors.
While there are many "green" solutions in various stages of development, testing, and production, there are some very important advantages in the BioCrude process over these systems. One major benefit is reduced composting time. Most processes involve lengthly resident time to break down the waste. We have shortened that time to as little as 4 weeks. The value in waste stock reduction and the increase in product yield achieved by condensing the process from months to weeks cannot be underestimated. "Quick Composting" means an abundance of clean renewable energy, a solution for the serious problem of rapidly accumulating garbage, and large financial gains for the client.
BioCrude Technology Inc. has developed many efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly products and systems for the reformation of waste material, waste management and the creation of renewable energy.
The versatility and potential of the BioCRUDE Technology have been demonstrated by the many uses that our R & D department has already tested and verified. The avenues they have explored include sustainable and cost efficient methods that will enlarge composting yield and rates of decomposition while increasing output and providing a higher quality of end product. Their focus is on waste treatment protocols for cellulose, all organic waste, and all manure types; improved functioning of septic tanks; renewable energy sources such as biogas and biodiesel; waste water treatment, and multiple other applications.
Environmental issues have taken the forefront globally, creating solid expectations for investments in green technology. The company will pursue licensing agreements and Joint Ventures and revenue sharing agreements for the use, fabrication, and sale of the independent products and processes.

Since July 2007, BioCRUDE Technologies, Inc. has taken the initiative to market and promote its intellectual property and specialized technical expertise throughout the Marketplace, both nationally and globally (we have introduced our technology to Governments and Major Conglomerates in the Waste to Energy sector) in UAE, Italy, Greece, India, Lebanon, Qatar, Canada, USA, Dominican Republic and China; specializing in waste to energy technology milieu, BioCRUDE has successfully opened up dialogue with respectable corporations for near future contractual negations.
Jaipuria Advanced Technologies, Inc. (www.jaipuria-group.com and www.smvjaipuria.com) of India, and BioCRUDE Technologies Inc, announce the formation of a new division dedicated to Waste Reformation and Energy Procurement for the purpose of pursuing contracts in India (we will be opening an office in New Delhi, India in the near future, with the Jaipuria Group) . In many areas of the country, waste management and energy shortages are a serious problem. With Jaipuria’s construction and large project experience, and with the use of the intellectual property supplied by BioCRUDE in terms of waste management and production of renewable energy, we have, in January, 2008, submitted a bid, in response to a Tender for a Waste to Energy plant (2000 MT per Day) in Okhla and Tempura, India (we did not win), and Indore, India (Collection and Treatment of municipal waste; 600 MT per Day; we did not win), and are in final negotiations with Pepsi Co India to build a plant model (50 MT per Day in Panipat, India). This is a very important step for the company, one that will help establish a solid presence for them in the Waste to the Energy sector and demonstrate the effectiveness of their technologies and processes. Pepsi’s participation and financial support are a solid endorsement for the success of this new business amalgamation.
BioCRUDE Technologies, Inc. is presently dealing with 3 Municipalities in Romania (Bucharest, Focsani, and Brasov) alongside with the Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Energy and Ministry of Finance for the implementation of 3 Waste to the Energy plants (we have just opened up a divisional office in Bucharest, Romania).
BioCRUDE Technologies, Inc. has presented proposals to major International Corporate Conglomerates for potential corporate works. Companies entertained include the following:

PepsiCo India, India
Englobe, Quebec, Canada
Jindal Water Infrastructure, India
ETA, Dubai, UAE
Punj Lloyd Ltd, India
Leahy Orchards, Inc, Quebec, Canada

BioCRUDE Technologies, Inc. is presently entertaining the Municipalities of New Delhi, India, Abu Dhabi & Dubai, UAE, Beirut, Lebanon and Chittagong, Bangladesh for Presentation/proposal of solutions in handling their present day needs of waste management and its inherent biofuels and marketable by-product procurement.

BIOCRUDE TECHNOLOGIES, INC.138 Anderson Avenue, unit 10 Markham, Ontario L7L 6B2
PRESS RELEASE 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEFebruary 02, 2009Montreal, Quebec
BIOCRUDE TECHNOLOGIES, INC. CONTINUED PURSUIT OF WASTE TO ENERGY PROJECTS THROUGHOUT ROMANIA, THE UAE, INDIA & BANGLADESH
MONTREAL, Canada – BioCrude Technologies, Inc. has continued discussions, through its representative agents, with the Municipality of Bucharest, and with the Ministry of Environment, Romania. Feedback for the land requisitions and vocation concessions which were submitted in July 2008 is still pending.
The current world financial situation and its specific impact on the UAE (namely Dubai) have delayed the progress of on-going discussions with the interested parties.
BioCrude continues to seek opportunities to market its intellectual property and expertise. It has submitted additional proposals for corporate requests from conglomerates such as Punj Lloyd, India as well as other municipal/governmental requests. BioCrude has aroused the interest of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) and the Municipality of Chittagong, Bangladesh, and has submitted proposals regarding their Municipal Solid Waste Management issues.
In summary, currently we are awaiting feedback from the following municipalities and/or government agencies:

Dubai, UAE
Abu Dhabi, UAE
Bucharest, Romania
Focsani, Romania
Chittagong, Bangladesh

Serving the global community in the fight for reducing environmental abuse is a moral decision resulting in both environmental as well as financial benefits. The importance and growth of green technology ensure us of a healthy planet, and in recent years this fact has created stability in the environmental corporate future and has also created an interesting opportunity for investors. Banks and other large market managers have seen the potential in green technology companies, and consequently, their portfolios now include investments in these areas.
 
The Jaipuria Group’s business acumen and leadership have established an industrial empire with diverse interests in food & beverages, textiles, education, real estate, waste management & energy procurement, ayurvedic products, and manganese mining. Today Jaipuria’s portfolio boasts of association with majors like PepsiCo as bottlers. Leveraging on the trust of its associates, clients, and employees, the group is surging ahead towards a bright future.
For more information, please refer to Jaipuria Group’s website, www.smvjaipuria.comOr contact Vaibhav Jaipuria, Phone: (91) 11 2660 2051/52 Fax: (91) 11 2660 2049 e-mail: This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it.
 
BioCrude Technologies, Inc. has developed innovative, efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly products and systems for waste management, for the reformation of waste material, and for the creation of renewable energy. The versatility and potential of the BioCrude technology have been demonstrated by the many uses that our R & D department has already tested and verified. The company utilizes expertise from established specialists and Institutions/Universities in order to develop new technologies and to refine those processes already in advanced stages of design.
The avenues that have been explored include sustainable and cost efficient methods that will increase both composting and bio-methanation yields and as well as decomposition rates, thus providing a higher quality of end products. BioCrude’s application focus includes waste treatment protocols for Municipal Solid Waste (MSW), for cellulose, and for all organic waste; improved the functioning of septic tanks; renewable energy sources (biogas, ethanol, and biodiesel); and waste water treatment.
Utilizing its intrinsic intellectual property and expertise in Integrated Waste to Energy Processing Complexes, BioCrude Technologies also specializes in is the reformation of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW). Understanding the non-homogenous nature and characteristics of the waste, distinct processes can be defined in order to handle its varied categories (MSW can be classified into organics, fuels, recyclables, inserts and others), once the waste has been efficiently segregated.
For more information, please refer to BioCrude Technologies Inc.’s website www.biocrudetech.comOr contact John Moukas, Phone: (514) 962-0070 Fax: (877) 778-1568 e-mail: This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it.

With respect to up to 20,000,000 shares of common stock to be sold by the
Company, unless we provide otherwise in a supplement to this prospectus, we
intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of our securities for general
corporate purposes, which may include one or more of the following:

· Working Capital;

· Set up (Fixed Asset purchases) and marketing/lobbying activities to locate and
  define/establish new prospects for Concession engagements;

· Capital expenditures for prospect Concession(s) acquisition and execution

· Investments in subsidiaries and/or joint ventures.

It is anticipated that the proceeds from this offering will fund the Company’s
operations for approximately 12 months while executing projected acquired
Concession engagements.

Our management will have broad discretion in the allocation of the net proceeds
of any offering; however, the following table outlines management’s current
anticipated use of proceeds given that the offering is being completed on a
best-efforts basis and may not result in the Company receiving the entire
offering amount. In the event that 100% of the funds are not raised, management
has outlined how they perceive the funds will be allocated, at various funding
levels. The offering scenarios are presented for illustrative purposes only and
the actual amount of proceeds, if any, may differ. We estimated a 10% of
offering expenses for this prospectus and it is included under General Operating
Expenses. The table is set out in the perceived order of priority of such
purposes, provided however; management may reallocate such proceeds among
purposes as the situation dictates. Pending such uses, we intend to place such
funds in an FDIC insured bank account.

these Complexes                         $ 13,896,764     $ 12,121,765     $  21,446,766     $  23,271,766

* Offering Expenses are estimated to be $0.175/share of gross proceeds.

As part of BioCrude’s forecasts, a contingency estimate of 10% of the provisions
for commissions has been allotted as incentives for the intervention of third
parties (brokers/underwriters) for the realization of the objectives of the
offering as well.

BioCrude’s management has not yet engaged any services of brokers and/or
underwriters and has been reliant on its acquaintances and/or angel investors.
BioCrude will continue to utilize its existing resources, acquaintances and
angel investors, at no cost to the Company. In this case, the savings of the
offering expenses (commissions) will be kept in treasury and be utilized as part
of the Company’s working capital.

** The Company’s projected proceeds will be appropriated to the following:

A) the development of the Company with regards to infrastructure (construction,
   fixed assets and equipment procurement), human resource staffing and working
   capital. It is estimated that $8 million is required for annual operational
   activities (salaries inclusive) of the Company.

B) the infusion of capital required to realize every projected subsidiary
   (within the Company’s business plan) as a self-standing entity
   (develop (EPC), operation (staffing inclusive)), same being 100% owned and
   controlled by the Company; the balance of the funding required for each
   subsidiary will be via long term debt mechanisms. The first Complex
   (BioCrude Comoros) will be that contracted for by the Governmental
   Authorities of the Autonomous Island of Grande Comore, Union of the Comoros,
   as a part of our agreement, dated January 11, 2016.

*** The amount of capital raised will determine the amount of projected acquired
    Concession engagements that can be executed and/or realized.

Nota Bene:

The basis upon which the Company operates is to treat each complex within a
country as a standalone entity, the Company being either a 100% owner of the
subsidiary or a 50% owner, in a joint venture with the local government entity
being the other 50% owner (the joint venture partner will be responsible for its
prorated share of equity infusion as well as apply in joint with the Company for
the debt funding for the complex). BioCrude will be responsible for the
management of the complex as well as the Engineering, Procurement (materials and
equipment) and Construction (“EPC”) details of each complex, and remunerated
according to the stipulations of the proposed Joint Venture Engagement. The
Procurement of Assets (materials and equipment) and Construction (civil works,
mechanical, electrical, etc.…) for the proposed facility will be awarded to
suppliers via direct solicitation or tender.

The primary use of the proceeds from the offering is for investments in
subsidiaries and joint ventures. The balance of the funds required to finance
the development and construction of a Complex are planned to originate from
financial institutions, mostly from within a country. This financing will be
secured by the developed complex and the subrogation of rights to the contracts
with regards to the Governmental Sovereign Guarantees offered by the same for
the de facto execution of all of the Governments obligations, with payment
stipulations for services to be received inclusive, amongst other contractual
stipulations. The company entity will make a forecasted equity investment equal
to 10% of the capital expenditures attributed to each Complex, whereby relying
on 90% debt funding.

In certain circumstances, the Company will enter into a joint venture agreement
with the local government (on a 50% ownership basis for each party), as part of
being in compliance to certain government’s regulations insistent on a
Public-Private partnership (“PPP”) for certain industries or as a financial
inducement with regards to their costs for waste management, whereby their
profits from equity participation of the operation of the Waste to Energy
complex can be viewed as reducing their actual costs from their present
practices by same, in a benign, environmentally friendly manner, without
deferred future costs of remedy procured from existing practices (over exhausted
landfills, contaminated soils and water tables, etc.…), as well as obtaining the
required Sovereign Guaranties. In exchange for the reduced participation in the
profits for the complex, the Company charges a licensing fee, payable within 3
months of signing of the contracts.

Additional revenue at the corporate level is derived by charging the complex for
the design of the Complex, procurement and installation of the requisite
equipment, and physical construction of the Complex (“EPC”).

Capital asset purchases at the corporate level are expected to be $992,000 in
the first year, comprised of office furniture ($280,000), computer hardware and
software ($317,000), and leasehold improvements ($395,000).


The market for Waste-to-Energy is dominated manly by Germen, French, American
and British companies. Ex.: AE&E Group GmbH, Axpo Kompogas AG, Babcock & Wilcox
Volund A/S, Bedminster International Ltd., BiogenGreenfinch, BTA International
GmbH, Community Power Corporation, CNIM, Covanta Holding Corporation, EcoCorp
Inc., Keppel Integrated Engineering Ltd., North American Power Group Ltd.,
Organic Waste Systems NV, STRABAG Umweltanlagen GmbH, Veolia Environmental
Services, Waste Management Inc., and Wheelabrator Technologies Inc., among
others.

During the past 4 years BioCrude has developed a reputation in waste management,
a result of R&D of Environmental Technologies (both process and product based)
whereby it has enhanced and optimized conventional technologies, augmented by
its fungal technology that increases the rate of decomposition of organics. This
lead to the development of efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally
friendly products, processes and systems for the reformation of waste material
and the creation of renewable energy and marketable by-products.

As part of BioCrude’s marketing strategy, BioCrude invests time, effort and
resources in order to prepare tailor made prefeasibility studies, presentations
& educational literature for municipalities worldwide, and sends corporate
delegations to these places for presentation of same, at no expense to these
governmental institutions. This attribute of BioCrude’s direct marketing
campaign has proven to be very successful. Governments worldwide were not only
receptive, but appreciative of BioCrude’s formal and professional address. These
efforts have given BioCrude a profound understanding of the challenges faced by
governments at all levels in their dealings with waste management issues.

The Company, through its commercialization efforts, has established good
relationships with governments and ministries in more than 30 countries in North
America, Latin America, Asia, Africa and Europe and received a positive
reception when presented with its waste to energy solution for their waste
management dilemmas. This produced dozens of Letters of Interest, submitted to
BioCrude, by different divisions of Governments (federal/municipal) from
different countries, worldwide.

BioCrude, with confidence, aims to be a leader in waste management, having set
as its objective, the profitability inherent within the realms of the activities
issued of this sector, while building business relationships and social
implications within the collectivity’s/communities that BioCrude is called upon
to serve, beyond the environmental and social implications, and beyond the
business imperatives.

BioCrude has adopted directive, as part of its corporate governance, to
routinely undertake innovative strategic planning initiatives in order to design
and implement integrated solid waste systems that are responsive to dynamic
demographic and industrial growth needs of municipalities. Strategic planning
starts with the formulation of long-term goals based on the local urban needs,
followed by a medium and short-term action plan to meet these goals. The
strategy and action plans should identify a clear set of integrated actions,
responsible parties and needed human, physical and financial resources as part
of the waste management solution.

BioCrude has not only demonstrated its proven ability to open up dialogue and
develop relationships with the various divisions of Governments worldwide
(Administrative and Technical) but has also developed confidence in same for
potential and eventual engagement. BioCrude’s Public Relations and Business
Development divisions have demonstrated their lobbying abilities as highly
effective, efficient and productive in yielding results and establishing
goodwill for BioCrude.

At present, the provisioning for waste treatment and “green” reformation of
these products into renewable energy sources is regionalized and within a given
geographic region of operations, can be competitive. However, we believe that
there are no other entities that provide turnkey solutions targeted to all types
and sizes of users. However, there are waste treatment providers that may elect
to enter into this designated market if our model is successful. We compete on
the basis of engineering uniqueness, quality, cost-effectiveness and the
increasingly comprehensive and specialized nature of our services, along with
the expertise, technology and professional support we offer. While we believe
that we will have a competitive cutting edge advantage by being the most
specialized in the market, there can be no assurance that our assumptions
regarding our competitive position will be proven correct.


Company Description
The Company was formed on August 4, 2015 in the State of Nevada. The Company is
a startup company.

The Company is a resource management expertise and services provider, catering
to commercial, municipal, and industrial customers, primarily in the areas of
solid waste management and recycling


 services.

BioCrude Technologies, Inc. has developed efficient, cost-effective, and
environmentally friendly products, processes and systems for the reformation of
waste material, waste management and creation of renewable energy.

The versatility and potential of the BioCrude Technologies, Inc. has been
demonstrated by the many uses that our R&D department has already tested and
verified. The avenues they have explored include sustainable and cost efficient
methods that will enlarge composting and biomethanation yields and rates of
decomposition while increasing output and providing a higher quality of end
product. Their focus is on waste treatment protocols for Municipal Solid Waste
(MSW), cellulose, all organic waste and all manure types; renewable energy
sources such as biogas, ethanol and biodiesel; waste water treatment, and
multiple other applications.

One very important area that BioCrude Technologies, Inc. excels in is the
reformation of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) into renewable energy and marketable
end-by-products, using its intrinsic intellectual property and know how in its
“Integrated Municipal Solid Waste to Energy Proposed Complexes” for municipal
applications. Understanding the non-homogenous nature and characteristics of the
waste, we can define distinct processes to optimally handle the procurement of
the varied categories of waste (MSW can be classified into organics, fuels,
recyclables, inerts and others), once segregated with an efficient separation
process and materials recovery facility (MRF). There is no intellectual property
protection as of yet. BioCrude will be filing for certain Intellectual property
and know how protection via a patent for “Integrated Municipal Solid Waste to
Energy Systems” while developing the Union of Comoros project. In addition to
patent applications, the Company will apply for trademark protection where
appropriate.

The long-term vision of the organization is to build a highly sustainable and
profitable company by transforming traditional solid waste streams into
renewable resources and marketable by-products. Global competition for limited
resources is, the Company believes, creating significant business opportunities
for companies that can sustain and extract value in the form of energy and raw
materials from resources previously considered an irretrievable waste stream.
BioCrude’s business strategy has been firmly tied to creating a sustainable
resource management model and the Company continues to be rooted in these same
tenets today. Each day the Company strives to create long-term value for all
stakeholders: customers, employees, communities, and shareholders, by helping
customers and communities manage their resources in a sustainable and
financially sound manner.

Environmental issues have taken the forefront globally, creating solid
expectations for investments in green technology. The Company will pursue
Licensing agreements, Joint Ventures and Revenue sharing agreements for the use,
fabrication and sale of the independent products and processes.

The Company intends to achieve successful market penetration in numerous
segments of the industry, generating escalating positive cash flows on an annual
basis so that the Company becomes a competitive leading participant in the
industry. Management will look to have its Integrated Municipal Solid Waste to
Energy Complexes widely implemented across Africa, Asia, the Balkans and North
America with a view to expanding to other international markets (Latin America),
while continuing to pursue Concession Agreements under private license/joint
ventures and other conventional arrangements.

  The Company is a resource management expertise and services provider, catering to commercial, municipal, and industrial customers, primarily in the areas of solid waste management and recycling services.  BioCrude Technologies USA, Inc. has developed efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally  friendly products, processes and systems for the reformation of waste material, waste management and creation of renewable energy.  The versatility and potential of the BioCrude Technologies USA, Inc. has been demonstrated by the many uses that our R&D; department has already tested and verified. The avenues they have explored include sustainable and cost efficient methods that will enlarge composting and biomethanation yields and rates of decomposition while increasing output and providing a higher quality of end product. Their focus is on waste treatment protocols for Municipal Solid Waste (“MSW”), cellulose, all organic waste and all manure types; renewable energy sources such as biogas, ethanol and biodiesel; waste water treatment, and multiple other applications.  One very important area that BioCrude Technologies USA, Inc. excels in is the reformation of MSW into renewable energy and marketable end-by-products, using its intrinsic intellectual property and know how in its “Integrated Municipal Solid Waste to Energy Proposed Complexes” for municipal applications. Understanding the non-homogenous nature and characteristics of the waste, we can define distinct processes to optimally handle the procurement of the varied categories of waste (MSW can be classified into organics, fuels, recyclables, inerts and others), once segregated with an efficient separation process and materials recovery facility (“MRF”). There is no intellectual property protection as of yet. BioCrude will be filing for certain Intellectual property and know how protection via a patent for “Integrated Municipal Solid Waste to Energy Systems” while developing the Union of Comoros project. In addition to patent applications, the Company will apply for trademark protection where appropriate.  The long-term vision of the organization is to build a highly sustainable and profitable company by transforming traditional solid waste streams into renewable resources and marketable by-products. Global competition for limited resources is, the Company believes, creating significant business opportunities for companies that can sustain and extract value in the form of energy and raw materials from resources previously considered an irretrievable waste stream. BioCrude’s business strategy has been firmly tied to creating a sustainable resource management model and the Company continues to be rooted in these same tenets today. Each day the Company strives to create long-term value for all stakeholders: customers, employees, communities, and shareholders, by helping customers and communities manage their resources in a sustainable and financially sound manner.  Environmental issues have taken the forefront globally, creating solid expectations for investments in green technology. The Company will pursue Licensing agreements, Joint Ventures and Revenue sharing agreements for the use, fabrication and sale of the independent products and processes.  The Company intends to achieve successful market penetration in numerous segments of the industry, generating escalating positive cash flows on an annual basis so that the Company becomes a competitive leading participant in the industry. Management will look to have its Integrated Municipal Solid Waste to Energy Complexes widely implemented across Africa, Asia, the Balkans and North America with a view to expanding to other international markets (Latin America), while continuing to pursue Concession Agreements under private license/joint ventures and other conventional arrangements. ---  The Company was formed on August 4, 2015 in the State of Nevada under the name of “BioCrude Technologies, Inc.” On November 8, 2016, the Company received its “Certificate of Amendment to Articles of Incorporation” pursuant to NRS 78.385 and 78.390 to its request for a name change from “BioCrude Technologies, Inc.” to “BioCrude Technologies USA, Inc.”, while still doing business as “BioCrude Technologies, Inc.”, as well. ---  The executive offices are located at1255 Phillips Square, Suite 605, Montreal, Quebec, CA H3B 3G5. Our telephone number is (877) 778-1268. Our website: www.biocrudetech.com.




Compititor Information
 The market for Waste-to-Energy is dominated manly by Germen, French, American and British companies. Ex.: AE&E; Group GmbH, Axpo Kompogas AG, Babcock & Wilcox Volund A/S, Bedminster International Ltd., BiogenGreenfinch, BTA International GmbH, Community Power Corporation, CNIM, Covanta Holding Corporation, EcoCorp Inc., Keppel Integrated Engineering Ltd., North American Power Group Ltd., Organic Waste Systems NV, STRABAG Umweltanlagen GmbH, Veolia Environmental Services, Waste Management Inc., and Wheelabrator Technologies Inc., among others.  During the past 4 years BioCrude has developed a reputation in waste management, a result of R&D; of Environmental Technologies (both process and product based) whereby it has enhanced and optimized conventional technologies, augmented by its fungal technology that increases the rate of decomposition of organics. This lead to the development of efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly products, processes and systems for the reformation of waste material and the creation of renewable energy and marketable by-products.  As part of BioCrude’s marketing strategy, BioCrude invests time, effort and resources in order to prepare tailor made prefeasibility studies, presentations & educational literature for municipalities worldwide, and sends corporate delegations to these places for presentation of same, at no expense to these governmental institutions. This attribute of BioCrude’s direct marketing campaign has proven to be very successful. Governments worldwide were not only receptive, but appreciative of BioCrude’s formal and professional address. These efforts have given BioCrude a profound understanding of the challenges faced by governments at all levels in their dealings with waste management issues.  The Company, through its commercialization efforts, has established good relationships with governments and ministries in more than 30 countries in North America, Latin America, Asia, Africa and Europe and received a positive reception when presented with its waste to energy solution for their waste management dilemmas. This produced dozens of Letters of Interest, submitted to BioCrude, by different divisions of Governments (federal/municipal) from different countries, worldwide.  BioCrude, with confidence, aims to be a leader in waste management, having set as its objective, the profitability inherent within the realms of the activities issued of this sector, while building business relationships and social implications within the collectivity’s/communities that BioCrude is called upon to serve, beyond the environmental and social implications, and beyond the business imperatives.  BioCrude has adopted a directive, as part of its corporate governance, to routinely undertake innovative strategic planning initiatives in order to design and implement integrated solid waste systems that are responsive to dynamic demographic and industrial growth needs of municipalities. Strategic planning starts with the formulation of long-term goals based on the local urban needs, followed by a medium and short-term action plan to meet these goals. The strategy and action plans should identify a clear set of integrated actions, responsible parties and needed human, physical and financial resources as part of the waste management solution.  BioCrude has not only demonstrated its proven ability to open up dialogue and develop relationships with the various divisions of Governments worldwide (Administrative and Technical) but has also developed confidence in same for potential and eventual engagement. BioCrude’s Public Relations and Business Development divisions have demonstrated their lobbying abilities as highly effective, efficient and productive in yielding results and establishing goodwill for BioCrude.  At present, the provisioning for waste treatment and “green” reformation of these products into renewable energy sources is regionalized and within a given geographic region of operations, can be competitive. However, we believe that there are no other entities that provide turnkey solutions targeted to all types and sizes of users. However, there are waste treatment providers that may elect to enter into this designated market if our model is successful. We compete on the basis of engineering uniqueness, quality, cost-effectiveness and the increasingly comprehensive and specialized nature of our services, along with the expertise, technology and professional support we offer.

Company IntroServicesKey ContactsAbout CompanyCorporate OverviewIt is both a serious and a stirring time for the environment and green technology. The serious side of the equation is the fragile ecology that surrounds us. We have reached the line between maintaining our environment and destroying it. Ignoring that situation would be disastrous.It is inspiring because we need to tap into all our talents and scientific resources to conceive of new and effective ways to deal with the massive ecological problems that face the world today. Those of us involved in green technology will know how high the stakes are; how important it is for our creativeness and intelligence to come together to create innovative and life saving solutions.Mission StatementHow extraordinary would it be to start your work day with the thought that your mission is to save the world?Not invent a new automotive do-dad that can hold a drink or play DVD's for your kids. Not develop a new "system" for washing dishes, cleaning house, or hanging your wash out. Not designing a new shoot-'em-up-kill-everyone console game. Not sitting at a sewing machine putting together this minute's indispensable fashion accessory.Saving the world. Imagine.How amazing would it be to know your work contributes to finding solutions for pollution, green house gas emissions, eliminating landfills and incinerators, generating clean, non-fossil fuel renewable energy, and controlling disease?Everyone involved in BioCRUDE Technologies knows exactly it feels like. Saving the world is our business, and it feels great!The mission, or vision, of the creators of BioCRUDE Technologies, is to develop viable methods for conversion of waste products into inexpensive and environmentally friendly energy solutions.The market for green, eco-friendly production of renewable resources and efficient method of waste reduction is growing at a massive rate as people become more aware of the fragile state of the planet. BioCrude technologies, processes, and systems address the majority of these concerns, satisfying the needs of the current green energy market.The technology deals with the issue of waste disposal, renewable fuel sources, pollution control, and global warming as impacted by the generation of energy resources. This opens up whole new markets for production financially valuable by-products.Having a reliable source for renewable energy, as well as dealing with serious waste disposal problems, make the issue of reformation of waste products a vital and urgent concern. In addition, independence and a secondary revenue stream are important for keeping the smaller agricultural enterprises, industries. and municipalities financially healthy and in aiding in the development of emerging markets globally.Markets for reasonably priced fuel, and solving the four main environmental issues affecting the planet, DEMAND a system such as BioCRUDE.Company NameBioCRUDE Technologies IncBusiness CategoryWaste recyclingAddress138 Anderson Ave, Unit 10MarkhamOntarioCanadaPresidentNAYear EstablishedNAEmployeesNAMembershipsNAHours of OperationNACompany ServicesBiocrude's ServicesBiocrude's ProductsBiocrude's ProcessesIntegrated Msw-energy Processing ComplexSubmit A ProjectLicensing & Joint Ventures
