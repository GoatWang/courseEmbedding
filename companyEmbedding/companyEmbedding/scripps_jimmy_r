Southeastern Asset Management, Inc.

                                    Southeastern Asset Management is a value-oriented, bottom-up manager. The firm seeks to achieve superior long-term performance by acquiring equity securities of financially strong, well-managed companies run by capable management teams, at market prices significantly below their assessment of their business value. Southeastern sells stocks when they approach their appraisal. The firm considers companies of all sizes, although most of their assets are invested in mid-size and larger companies. Southeastern Asset Management is an activist firm and is included in the SharkWatch50 as one the 50 most prominent activist investors.The firm focuses on securities of companies believed to have unrecognized intrinsic value and the potential to grow. Corporate intrinsic value is determined through securities analysis and the use of established disciplines consistently applied over long periods of time. Southeastern requires at least a 40% market value discount from their appraisal of an issuer's intrinsic value before purchasing the security.To determine intrinsic value, current publicly available financial statements are carefully reviewed and two primary methods of appraisal are applied. The first assesses what Hawkins believes to be the real economic value of the issuers net assets; the second examines the issuer's ability to generate free cash flow after required or maintenance capital expenditures. After free cash flow is determined, conservative projections about the rate of future growth are made. The present value of that stream of cash flow plus its terminal value is then calculated using a discount rate based on expected interest rates. In a concluding analysis, the asset value determination and/or the discounted free cash flow value are compared with business transactions of comparable corporations. Other considerations used in selecting potential investments include the following: indications of shareholder-oriented management; evidence of financial strength; and potential earnings improvement.

(CAM) is a growth manager that offers diversified portfolios of investments in equities and fixed-income securities to meet each client's objectives. CAM's equity investment approach is based on the belief that earnings growth is the long-term determinant of a stock's price Their equity-focused strategies employ a team managed approach, investing in companies that are industry leaders, display consistent earnings growth, have manageable debt levels, generate high free cash flow, and are led by experienced, shareholder-conscious management teams. CAM believes that diversification beyond a limited number of holdings may yield only a marginal performance benefit. CAM's equity strategies include: Large Cap Growth, Mid-Cap Growth, Small Cap Growth, Dividend Growth, All Cap Opportunity, and Multi-Cap Growth.

NewSouth Capital Management, Inc.

                                    NewSouth Capital Management seeks superior, risk-adjusted investment returns on both an absolute and relative basis. The firm manages four equity strategies: Small-Cap Value, Small/Mid Cap Value, Mid Cap Value and Value Opportunity, (an all-cap strategy). Market cap size distinctions are the only difference between these four strategies. Each one follows the same philosophy, and decisions are made by the same investment team. NewSouth ordinarily holds 25 to 35 companies in their portfolios.  They believe that this level of concentration provides an adequate level of diversification and increases long-term opportunities for superior returns. NewSouth believes that most successful equity investments are made with a longer time horizon in mind. They focus on investments in businesses that offer above average returns over a 2 to 3 year period rather than focusing on short-term trading strategies.

Gardner Russo & Gardner LLC

                                    Gardner Russo & Gardner (GRG) employs a long-term, global-value investment strategy. Investment decisions are made using primary, fundamental research directed towards a limited number of global industries with little input from Wall Street. They conduct research by analyzing a company's financial reports, attending annual, industry, and analyst meetings, and engaging its management in appropriate venues. GRG assess free-cash-flow generation, sustainability of franchise, earnings and pricing power, and quality of management; and match their judgments of these against the price of the company's stock. The firm buys at reasonable prices, and retains, meaningful positions of common stocks in concentrated industry groups, in competitively advantaged, global businesses that are run by able and honest managers.

Ardevora Asset Management LLP

                                    Ardevora is an active, research-based specialist manager of Global and UK Equity portfolios which aims to generate significant long-term outperformance while maintaining a relentless focus on risk. Through their cognitive psychology-based investment process they observe the behavior of company management, analysts and investors in equity markets and attempt to exploit the biases which result from their behavior. The firm believes that company management are prone to excessive risk taking and utilizes the company balance sheet and the cash flow statement as a starting point to exclude any stocks where management behavior looks excessively risky. They think that investors are prone to over-reaction and seek to identify stocks with unusually high levels of anxiety attached to them, which they feel gives their portfolios a value element. Ardevora believes that analysts tend to under-react and study past pattern of forecast errors for signs of a systematic upward skew. Identifying analyst bias in this way gives their portfolios a growth element. They construct portfolios by rejecting stocks, not picking them, rejecting stocks that look too risky or don''t appear to be subject to bias. They assemble those left at the end of this process into an equally weighted portfolio.

What are analysts saying about Scripps Networks Interactive stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Scripps Networks Interactive stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Scripps Networks' top line in the second quarter is expected to be driven by strong growth in advertising revenues in its U.S. Networks division. The company's efforts to exapnd its operations are also impressive. The company recently announced plans to acquire Spoon University. We are also impressed by its efforts to reward shareholders. In Feb 2017, the company hiked its quarterly dividend by 20% to $0.30 per share. However, the company's high debt levels bother us. We also remain mindful of other headwinds like mounting programming costs, advertising and marketing expenses. The headwinds are likely to hurt the company's bottom line in the second quarter of 2017. Detailed results should be out on Aug 9. On the conference call, we expect an update on rumors regarding its merger with Discovery or Viacom. Shares of Scripps Networks have underperformed its industry over the past one year. " (7/25/2017)
2. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "SNI reported 1Q EPS and EBITDA of $1.53 / $369M vs. JEFe $1.21 / $338M, once again beating ests on lower Op Ex at the U.S. nets – likely largely on a timing shift. Dom adv of 5.1% vs. our 6.0% est, offset by stronger affil. growth. Given weakness in the space yesterday, we believe the stock will trade higher today. Guidance Unchanged: Despite beating estimates, mgmt left the FY guidance unchanged. While we assume that the timing of expenses will push Op Ex higher in 2Q/3Q vs. 1Q/2Q, this was the same narrative in F16 (which ultimately resulted in the FY coming in stronger than expected)." (5/5/2017)
3. Stifel Nicolaus analysts commented, "We are raising our target price on Scripps to $90 following better than expected 4Q results and raising our 2017 estimates accordingly. With ratings growth across its platform, the company continues to be able to monetize on the strong scatter market to the degree that peers are less able to do so, while the focus/more limited number of channels continues to position the company well in a world of more slimmed down bundles through traditional or OTT delivery' While our operating income estimates are unchanged, as the company will spend an additional $40mn in technology spend (excluding that spend our estimates would have been increased), our EPS guidance is increased on lower D&A. We continue to see upside to estimates for 2017 given the strong ad trends in 4Q and the pacings QTD. We remain Buy rated." (2/22/2017)
4. Guggenheim analysts commented, "We have updated our outlook to reflect 4Q16 results and management guidance (summary table within). Of note, the company anticipates 6% total company revenue growth in 2017 (we now estimate 6.2% versus our prior 4.0%), including positive domestic distribution revenue growth (we estimate 5.0%). We now forecast another year of strong domestic ad growth (+7.2%) and more modest international revenue growth (+4.3%). Our 1Q and 2017 EPS forecasts now stand at $1.16 and $5.40 from $1.18 and $5.24 prior, respectively. Note that we no longer adjust acquisition amortization out of our EPS estimate. Management is confident 2017 outlook is underpinned by continued strong audience trends, as all six of the company's networks recorded total-day C3 ratings growth in 2016 and ad demand has remained strong." (2/22/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Scripps Networks Interactive (NASDAQ:SNI) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 2 Sell Ratings, 7 Hold Ratings, 5 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.21)Consensus Price Target: $76.92 (10.98% downside)
