Case 15-12427-BLS Doc 2 Filed 12/03/15 Page 7 of 24

MOTION OF DEBTORS FOR 

ENTRY OF ORDER DIRECTING JOINT ADMINISTRATION 

OF CHAPTER 11 CASES PURSUANT TO BANKRUPTCY RULE 1015(b) 

Offshore Group Investment Limited and its affiliated debtors in the above-

captioned chapter 11 cases, as debtors and debtors in possession (collectively, the “Debtors”) 

respectfully represent as follows in support of this motion (this “Motion”): 

Relief Requested 

1. 

Pursuant to Rule 1015(b) of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure 

(the “Bankruptcy Rules”) and Rule 1015–1 of the Local Rules of Bankruptcy Practice and 

Procedure of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the “Local 

Rules”), the Debtors request entry of an order directing consolidation of their chapter 11 cases 

for procedural purposes only. 

2. 

A proposed form of order granting the relief requested herein is annexed 

hereto as Exhibit A (the “Proposed Order”). 

Jurisdiction 

3. 

This Court has jurisdiction to consider this matter pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 

§§ 157 and 1334, and the Amended Standing Order of Reference from the United States District 

Court for the District of Delaware dated February 29, 2012. This is a core proceeding pursuant 

to 28 U.S.C. § 157(b) and, pursuant to Local Rule 9013–1(f), the Debtors consent to the entry of 

a final order by the Court in connection with this Motion to the extent that it is later determined 

that the Court, absent consent of the parties, cannot enter final orders or judgments consistent 

with Article III of the United States Constitution. Venue is proper before this Court pursuant to 

28 U.S.C. §§ 1408 and 1409. 

RLF1 13477411V.1 

7 



Case 15-12427-BLS Doc 2 Filed 12/03/15 Page 8 of 24

Background 

4. 

On the date hereof (the “Petition Date”), each of the Debtors commenced 

with this Court a voluntary case under chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code 

(the “Bankruptcy Code”). The Debtors continue to operate their businesses and manage their 

properties as debtors in possession pursuant to sections 1107(a) and 1108 of the Bankruptcy 

Code. No trustee, examiner, or statutory committee of creditors has been appointed in these 

chapter 11 cases. 

5. 

Prior to the Petition Date, the Debtors began the solicitation of votes on 

their Joint Prepackaged Chapter 11 Plan of Offshore Group Investment Limited and Its 

Affiliated Debtors (the “Prepackaged Plan”), through their Disclosure Statement for Joint 

Chapter 11 Plan of Offshore Group Investment Limited and Its Affiliated Debtors pursuant to 

sections 1125 and 1126(b) of the Bankruptcy Code. The Debtors expect that the Prepackaged 

Plan will be accepted by all classes entitled to vote in excess of the statutory thresholds specified 

in section 1126(c) of the Bankruptcy Code. 

6. 

Additional information regarding the circumstances leading to the 

commencement of these chapter 11 cases and information regarding the Debtors’ business and 

capital structure is set forth in the Declaration of Christopher G. DeClaire in Support of the 

Debtors’ Chapter 11 Petitions and Related Requests for Relief (the “DeClaire Declaration”), 

which has been filed contemporaneously herewith. 

Basis for Relief Requested 

7. 

Bankruptcy Rule 1015(b) provides, in relevant part, that “[i]f . . . two or 

more petitions are pending in the same court by or against . . . a debtor and an affiliate, the court 

may order a joint administration of the estates.” Fed. R. Bankr. P. 1015(b). Section 101(2) of 

the Bankruptcy Code defines the term “affiliate” to mean:

power to vote such securities; or 

(ii) solely to secure a debt, if such entity has not in fact exercised 
such power to vote . . . . 

11 U.S.C. § 102(2). The Debtors are affiliates of one another because Vantage Drilling 

Company, a non-Debtor, owns or controls, either directly or indirectly, 100% of the outstanding 

voting securities of each of the Debtors, except PT. Vantage Drilling Company Indonesia, of 

which Vantage Drilling Company indirectly owns 95% of the outstanding voting securities. 

Accordingly, this Court is authorized to jointly administer these cases for procedural purposes. 

8. 

In addition, Local Rule 1015–1 provides, in relevant part, as follows: 

An order of joint administration may be entered, without notice and an 
opportunity for hearing, upon 
joint 
administration . . . supported by an affidavit, declaration or verification, 
which establishes that the joint administration of two or more cases 
pending in this Court under title 11 is warranted and will ease the 
administrative burden for the Court and the parties. 

the filing of a motion for 

Pursuant to Local Rule 1015–1, the Debtors have filed the DeClaire Declaration 

contemporaneously herewith. The DeClaire Declaration establishes that the joint administration 

RLF1 13477411V.1 

9 



Case 15-12427-BLS Doc 2 Filed 12/03/15 Page 10 of 24

of the Debtors’ respective estates is warranted and will ease the administrative burden for the 

Court and parties in interest. 

9. 

Joint administration of these cases will save the Debtors and their estates 

substantial time and expense because it will remove the need to prepare, replicate, file, and serve 

duplicative notices, applications, and orders. Further, joint administration will relieve the Court 

of entering duplicative orders and maintaining duplicative files and dockets. The United States 

Trustee for the District of Delaware (the “U.S. Trustee”) and other parties in interest will 

similarly benefit from joint administration of these chapter 11 cases, sparing them the time and 

effort of reviewing duplicative pleadings and papers. 

10. 

Joint administration will not adversely affect creditors’ rights because this 

Motion requests only the administrative consolidation of the estates, and does not seek 

substantive consolidation. As such, each creditor will continue to hold its claim against a 

particular Debtor’s estate after this Motion is approved. 

11. 

As is demonstrated by the corporate structure chart attached to the 

DeClaire Declaration as Exhibit 1 thereto, most of the Debtors are direct or indirect subsidiaries 

of Debtor Offshore Group Investment Limited (“OGIL”), and the Debtors that are not currently 

subsidiaries of OGIL are expected to become subsidiaries of OGIL on the effective date of the 

Prepackaged Plan. Accordingly, the Debtors respectfully request that each of the Debtors’ 

chapter 11 cases be administered under a consolidated caption, in the following form:
