Hacker Floor UnderlaymentsProduct Benefits: Sound Attenuating
 


The silence is golden when the gypsum concrete is a Hacker Floor Underlayment.
The challenges of achieving sound reduction in the lightweight structures of today are many. Meeting them is imperative to deliver a high level of acoustic control for interior privacy, not just for residential structures, but any light-weight construction where airborne (IIC) or structural noise transmission (STC) can be an issue.


Hacker Industries' helped write the first sound code in the United States. With three sound attenuating solutions: High-Performance, Low Profile and Green, Hacker Industries, Inc. is committed to working with innovative companies to develop products that achieve code compliant noise control, while helping the environment as well. 

Please view Hacker Industries, Inc.'s Acoustical Design Guidelines.

                        "I was concerned about my homes safety when my home suffered a small but significant amount of damage during the 2013 Westwood quake, as my home was built in the early 50s. After Built Strong retrofitted my home I felt at ease knowing my home, possessions and family were protected."
                    
Vivian | Beverly Hills, CA



                        "I started looking for foundation repair companies and found that Built Strong was well ranked on my online searches.  I called and they scheduled an inspection within a day.  They recommended Waterproofing as a fix to the leaking.  And I have yet to see any more leaking or puddles in my crawl space. Built Strong was easy to work with and they performed quality work."
                    
Paul | Marina Del Rey, CA



                        "I hired Built Strong when I noticed my floor was starting to slope at the corners of my home.  At first I couldn’t identify the problem or what was causing it, but after talking with Built Strong I clearly understood the issue and cause.  Built strong had a great and friendly crew complete a project to install Helical Piers to support my sinking foundation."
                    
Diane | East Hollywood, CA



                        "Built Strong Construction completely beat our expectations. The work was superb. Simon, our main contact there, was super-responsive and friendly. They quickly pulled a city permit, finished our foundation work in 2 days."

Hacker Floor UnderlaymentsProduct Benefits: Sound Attenuating
 


The silence is golden when the gypsum concrete is a Hacker Floor Underlayment.
The challenges of achieving sound reduction in the lightweight structures of today are many. Meeting them is imperative to deliver a high level of acoustic control for interior privacy, not just for residential structures, but any light-weight construction where airborne (IIC) or structural noise transmission (STC) can be an issue.


Hacker Industries' helped write the first sound code in the United States. With three sound attenuating solutions: High-Performance, Low Profile and Green, Hacker Industries, Inc. is committed to working with innovative companies to develop products that achieve code compliant noise control, while helping the environment as well. 

Please view Hacker Industries, Inc.'s Acoustical Design Guidelines.

Scaffolding




Safe & Secure Scaffolding for vertical access
 This unique system offers the strength and durability of galvanized steel with the productivity associated with light alloy systems. The system was designed with the user in mind for general industrial, commercial and residential construction, as well as for bridges and other steel structure applications. It offers solutions for all types of scaffolding requirements, from light to heavy duty access, and various falsework applications – outdoors or indoors. The only tools required for assembly are a hammer and level! 




Safespan’s Scaffolding offers 8 Great Advantages




HIGH PRODUCTIVITY
 Undoubtedly the fastest steel scaffold system available with production output recorded as the Official World Record*. 


PATENTED COUPLING
 A fully hot-dipped galvanized system offering all the well-recognized benefits of this treatment method. 


GALVANIZING
 Undoubtedly the fastest steel scaffold system available with production output recorded as the Official World Record*. 



STORAGE AND HANDLING
 Significant reductions in total required components, resulting in savings in storage, handling and transportation. 


SAFETY
 Our Scaffolding has several unique safety features that benefit the system’s erectors, users and project inspectors. 


FLEXIBILITY
 With eight completely variable component node points and the largest available bay sizes, Our Scaffolding offers the most flexible system. 



SIMPLICITY
 Only five main components are required for basic use and the only erection tools required are a hammer and level. 


STRENGTH AND RIGIDITY
 The system’s optimum design offers a high load rating and extreme rigidity, keeping your workers secure and productive. 






Available for full rental of full-service erection
 Used on bridges and similar steel structures, the Modular Scaffolding System complements the Safespan® Multi-Span Bridge Platform System that Safespan originated and manufactures. It can provide easy access to vertical surfaces for painting and rehabilitation. And, like Safespan’s platform product, it installs, deploys and is removable quickly and easily. This extraordinary scaffolding product is available for lease from Safespan, with installation by either by your crew or by ours on a turnkey basis.

Bridge Platforms

Why contractors Are switching to the Safespan Bridge Platforms System
 Safespan essentially brings bridge projects to the ground, allowing numerous spans to be accessed simultaneously. This feature permits multiple trade crews to work concurrently, resulting in significant labor and cost savings. 
 Our system designs are flexible. We use various methods to connect the platform to the structure, depending on the bridge’s configuration, that allow you to adjust the platform’s height for your desired working clearance. Our experience enables us to employ innovative methods to solve the limited traffic under-clearance constraints unique to your project. 



 We employ reusable components, custom designed by Safespan’s experienced in-house structural engineering staff to meet individual project requirements. Everything you need is included in the project package. Platform installation, redeployment and removal proceed quickly with minimal traffic disruption. 
 Safespan’s patented cable-suspended platform provides a stable working surface. The bridge platform is supported on cables fastened in equal intervals to the bridge’s structural members. Then, steel decking specially configured for your project’s scope and weight requirements is attached to the cables, using Safespan’s custom-fabricated fasteners. The result is the most stable working area known in the industry. 
 Safespan’s decking provides secure shielding, supporting loads up to 200 psf (976.4kg/m2). It completely shields the area under your project from demolition debris and other hazards. 




 Side tarps & Side walls create a full enclosure. This arrangement not only contains dust and debris to meet environmental regulations, but also protects your crews and equipment from inclement weather, allowing work to continue in otherwise adverse conditions. It enables maximum air flow for ventilation, heating and cooling.

"Built Strong Construction completely beat our expectations. The work was superb. Simon, our main contact there, was super-responsive and friendly. They quickly pulled a city permit, finished our foundation work in 2 days, not to say it was a huge job, and they got the city inspector out. We passed with flying colors. We initially had bids from other companies that were outrageous and frightened us. Simon gave us an amazing deal, especially considering the quality and scope of work. We would recommend them again and again. We are beyond pleased!”

"I decided to have Built Strong Construction bolt down our house onto its foundation. Simon, the sales analyst, was very prompt. He showed up on time and was very professional. He did an excellent job explaining what will be needed to complete the job. He is very knowledgeable of all the foundation requirements and guidelines. All the workers listened to my concerns  and cleaned up after the job was done. I am very pleased with the work done. Thank you to Simon, Anthony, and the technical staff. A very good job, indeed!

Provides 2017 Shareholders Update and Corporate Mission StatementMarketwiredMay 22, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareCANTON, OH--(Marketwired - May 22, 2017) - Concrete Leveling Systems, Inc. (  OTC PINK :  CLEV )Corporate Mission Statement: Jericho Associates, Inc ("Jericho") is a Nevada corporation formed as a special purpose company. On March 24, 2017, Jericho completed an Equity Purchase transaction whereby it sold all of its outstanding shares for a controlling interest of publicly traded Concrete Leveling Systems, Inc. (  OTC PINK :  CLEV ).CLEV's founding and current management are excited to bring Jericho into what we believe will make CLEV a successful company in the casino gaming, hospitality and leisure industries. Management is also excited to have Jericho on board to allow for the missing financial support to fund and grow our concrete leveling division. With our Jericho partnership, Ed Barth will remain an employee of the Company and will be in charge of operations to manufacture and sell the Company's stainless steel Concrete Leveling Service Unit Equipment Packages. Due to the acquisition of Jericho, we will be able to begin direct mailing and National Account Advertising that has been a missing part of our concrete leveling business in getting our products to the market and allowing our concrete leveling division to generate significant revenue and profits. The Company is currently reviewing trade shows and equipment expos to take our product to the U.S. and Canadian market place in 2017-2018. CLEV's continued operations in the business of manufacturing and sales of our concrete leveling equipment as a division of the Company as a whole is an opportunity to grow sales and revenues that we believe will allow our concrete leveling division to become a profitable operation. In addition to our concrete leveling division, the Company plans to access opportunities within the casino gaming, hospitality, entertainment, and leisure time industries. We plan to do this using relationships that we have developed with commercial gaming companies, Native American tribes, financial institutions, attorneys, developers, senior business executives, and a general market awareness of activity within these chosen industries.To accomplish this mission, the company has retained the services of Mr. Ronald J Tassinari to act as company CEO. Mr. Tassinari had been the CEO of a publicly traded company in the casino gaming and entertainment industry for over 30 years. That company developed, and for over a decade operated one of California's largest and most successful tribal casinos. It also provided casino consulting services to many of the other tribal California Casinos. Prior to that, Mr. Tassinari was with the Wall Street firm of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith for 10+ years.Mr. Tassinari's initial responsibility was to assemble a team of experienced and skilled gaming, hospitality, and entertainment professionals to assist him in the pursuit of opportunities, to analyze those opportunities, and to operate acquired assets in a manner to maximize profitability and enhance enterprise value.Mr. Tassinari has retained the business development and consulting services of Mr. Robert F. Gross and Mr. Rudy Prieto. Robert F. Gross has over 40 years experience in all phases of the commercial and tribal gaming & hospitality industry. He is an effective "turnaround" specialist with a broad working knowledge of every aspect of casino operations. He has held President, CEO, and senior level positions with Sahara Gaming, Caesars World, Bally's, and The Dunes Hotel & Casino. He has also provided extensive consulting, and executive advisory development, management, and operational services to several large U.S. tribal gaming properties: Nez Perce, Santa Ana Star, and Table Mountain Casino.Rudy Prieto brings over 37 years of corporate and tribal gaming experience to the team. He manages with a balanced focus on gaming operations, marketing, player retention, guest service, and employee relations. He focuses on strategic planning, transparent communications, customer service, right product mix, strong branding, and overall quality of amenities and entertainment. He has served as the President of Trump Taj Mahal, Senior Vic President of Boyd Gaming, CEO of The Las Vegas Hilton, and General Manager of Pechanga Resort & Casino. In 2015, Pechanga was named "Best U.S. Casino" by U.S.A. Today.Read MoreThe three member Jericho team has a combined 100+ years of experience in the commercial and tribal gaming industry as well as the related, hospitality, entertainment, and leisure time complementary activities.The U. S. Casino Gaming Industry: (data as of 2016)The United States gaming industry is comprised of approximately 1600 casinos, 116.9 billion U.S. customers, generating over $71 BIL in revenues and 95% of the industry comes from two major segments:Tribal Gaming ($30.4 BIL revenue = 42.8% of the industry), 240 Tribes in 28 states operate 459 casinos in the United States. This segment has had a compounded annual growth rate of 1.8% since 2007. Commercial Gaming ($40.6 BIL revenue = 57.2% of the industry), traditional brick and mortar casinos, racings, riverboat, dockside, and slot parlors regulated by state gaming boards or state gaming authorities. Revenues include amounts generated from gaming machines, table games, poker, and sport book.Jericho intends to pursue opportunities in the tribal gaming segment, specifically in the California market which generated approximately 25% of the $30.4 BIL gaming revenue. These opportunities create cash flow by providing services to tribes. Those services could include: providing or arranging financing, development of hotel, casino, or other related assets, and other complementary services such as casino management or vendor related services. Because there can be no private ownership of tribal assets, fees can be earned by providing needed services such as development, management, consulting, or vendor related services.Commercial Gaming is another area of pursuit by Jericho -- specifically the Nevada market. In 2016 Nevada gaming revenue generated $11.3 BIL (28%) of the $40.6 BIL commercial gaming revenue. In 2016 Las Vegas established a new visitation record of 42.9 million visitors and Las Vegas strip hotels had occupancy rates of 90.5%.Las Vegas is poised for continued organic growth as well as from other factors. One such factor is the expansion of its convention center which includes 600,000 sq ft of exhibit space and 150,000 sq ft of meeting rooms. The $1.4 BIL project is expected to bring an annual 610,000 incremental visitors, and add $810 MIL to the Las Vegas economy -- while creating 22,000 temporary and permanent jobs.Another factor is the Resorts World $4 BIL hotel, casino project. Currently in early development stage, it is expected to add 3000 rooms, including 175,000 sq ft casino, and full amenities including: retail, dining, convention facilities, aquarium, movie theater(s), bowling, indoor water park, and ice skating rink.Other Las Vegas news to benefit future growth includes the new NHL ice hockey team, The Las Vegas Golden Knights, that begin play in the MGM T Mobile Arena for the 2017-2118 ice hockey season. Lastly, 2016 welcomed the announcement that the NFL Oakland Raiders will be relocating to Las Vegas into a new, to be constructed, $1.9 BIL 65,000 seat domed stadium that is expected to host 40 + "off football season" events that could add an additional 450,000 incremental annual visitors to Las Vegas.A final area of interest is in new types of casino gaming and gaming technology. Jericho is seeking opportunities to partner, joint venture, or acquire companies developing games that combine the money making potential of traditional casino games, the challenge of video games, and the playability of social games; games that pit the player's skill against the other player(s) skill as opposed to against "a machine" or the house. These areas include but are not limited to: fantasy sports, social casino gaming, Esports, and skill based gaming. The next generation of gamers, millennials and beyond, will be a large component of the future of casino gaming.In conclusion, the Jericho's leadership team's experience and expertise is in both the Commercial and Tribal segments of the U.S. Casino Gaming industry. Note that these two segments, "Nevada" Commercial gaming and Tribal gaming account for 48% of all U.S. Commercial Gaming revenue. Based on the steady growth of the Tribal Gaming segment and the outlook for the Las Vegas, Nevada market, Jericho believes that it has set its sights in the right direction.Notes: UNLV Center for Gaming Research (2017) Data is from the 2016 edition of Rubin Brown's Gaming Statistics.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
