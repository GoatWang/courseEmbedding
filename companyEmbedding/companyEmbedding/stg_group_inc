      As a wholesale supplier of petroleum products, lubricants, and industrial supplies we at STG Group take whatever measures possible to ensure that our customers receive quality products and services,  as well as an outstanding experience.  




 


 
 
 


 
Offering a truly diverse product line, as well as solid industry  experience, we have the products and services tailored to our customers needs no matter the size and/or complexity. Providing the actual product to our customers is only part of what we provide. By utilizing our experience, as well as expertise we are able to provide total fluids management services, eliminating the need for costly personnel as well as equipment; overall allowing our customers to focus on their core business. 

                            No matter if our customers want to maintain a 'keep full', tolerance set, minimum state our mission is to ensure that our customer's needs are not only met but exceeded, in every facet of fuel management. Our consultants provide insightful and cost effective alternatives to ensure customer's fuel inventories are managed to their full potential. Utilizing consumption, purchasing, and market trends we as well as our customers are able to economize current usage as well as predict future needs. Overall streamlining purchase and consumption habits to ensure our products are working for our customers instead of our customers working for the products.

                            In addition to traditional methods of monitoring fluid levels by phone, fax, or automated tank monitoring, we also give our customers access to our web interface. Utilizing our fully customizable web management we, as well as our customers are able to track, monitor, and report on a single site or multiple sites, eliminating the need for costly industry specific hardware and software. Throughout the day the management team at STG actively monitors the volatile fuel prices and apprises our customers of the market trends, so that they are able to make the most cost effective purchasing decisions.

                            STG is dedicated to being our customer's single source for their petroleum, lubricants, and industrial supply needs.

Accounting


 Small businesses are the critical growth engines in the US economy as well as proven wealth creators. Some statistics estimate that 75% of the wealthiest Americans are business owners. To succeed in business you must be armed with the necessary tools and support mechanisms.                   
                             The US Department of Commerce estimates that approximately 1 Million new businesses are created in the US each year; of those 40% fail in the first year and 80% fail within five years. 
                           
                             Our duty at STG Group is to work with both start-up and on-going businesses to deliver the crucial support services necessary for efficient operation and profitability. Experience in modern times has also shown that by outsourcing non-core business operations such as: operational planning, information technology, payroll, accounting and tax reporting, an organization can properly focus on its key objectives and achieve better results. more...
