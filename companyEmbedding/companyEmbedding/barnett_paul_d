BEST Crucial Interventions: An Illustrated Treatise on the Principles & Practice of Nineteenth-Century Surgery D.O.C
A beautifully illustrated look at the evolution of surgery, as revealed through rare technical illustrations, sketches, and oil paintings The nineteenth century saw major advances in the practice of surgery. In 1750, the anatomist John Hunter described it as “a humiliating spectacle of the futility of science”; yet, over the next 150 years the feared, practical men of medicine benefited from a revolution in scientific progress and the increased availability of instructional textbooks. Anesthesia and antisepsis were introduced. Newly established medical schools improved surgeons’ understanding of the human body. For the first time, surgical techniques were refined, illustrated in color, and disseminated on the printed page.Crucial Interventions follows this evolution, drawing from magnificent examples of rare surgical textbooks from the mid-nineteenth century. Graphic and sometimes unnerving yet beautifully rendered, these fascinating illustrations, acquired from the Wellcome Collection’s extensive archives, include step-by-step surgical techniques paired with depictions of medical instruments and depictions of operations in progress. Arranged for the layman (from head to toe) Crucial Interventions is a captivating look at the early history of one of the world’s most mysterious and macabre professions. Illustrated in color and black-and-white throughout

Review

“The most striking feature of this impressive book is the very large number of images reproduced from the historical collections of the Wellcome Library. Every page is filled with vivid illustrations of surgical instruments and every conceivable surgical procedure, including many that readers may find difficult to imagine. Barnett provides an informative and engaging account of the emergence of the surgery that is recognized today. Highly recommended.” - Choice

This book is full of beautifully drawn illustrations of surgical procedures with a running thread ...

By T. Fontenot
This book is full of beautifully drawn illustrations of surgical procedures with a running thread of "chapters" retelling the history of the specialty. I appreciated the detailed art, but this is definitely not for the faint of heart.

the location of tendons and the great vessels. Every single page

By DianeM
I am thrilled to own this book. I am writing a Regency-era novel in which the protagonist is a surgeon. I have read numerous books on surgery published in the early 1800's, few of which provide illustrations of surgical procedures. Richard Barnett's book is a goldmine. It allows me to confirm many aspects related to 19th-century surgery: hand positions, the types of instruments used for various procedures, the positioning of limbs or the tongue or the eye, the location of tendons and the great vessels. Every single page, excepting the back matter and pages 18 and 19 of the Introduction, contains at least one illustration; most contain two or three, and a few, fifteen or more. Barnett's text addresses many of the topics I am most interested in: antiseptics, pain management in the era before truly safe anesthesia, and the history of surgical practice. There is something new to see on every page. When I first flipped to the section on the abdomen, I found a large, magnificent illustration of the mesentery and the transverse colon, both mentioned in my novel. I was delighted! This is a remarkable book and will interest anyone interested in 19th-century surgery.

It is beautifully bound and illustrated for the price

Received this about a week ago.  It is beautifully bound and illustrated for the price.  I'm giving it as a gift so I can't say much about the content, but I feel proud to present it.
