PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER
Gather your retirement savings into one place.





Rollovers 


Info

When you rollover funds, you receive the funds through a distribution from your IRA. You then have 60 days from receipt of those funds to roll them into another IRA or qualified retirement plan to avoid tax consequences. IRA owners are limited to only one IRA-to-IRA rollover in any 12 month period. Rollovers are not counted toward your annual IRA contribution limits. You may want to contact a financial advisor or tax professional for further information.

Consolidate investments to make life easier







Transfers


Info

When you transfer an IRA, the funds are moved directly from one financial institution to another. The transfer check is made payable to your financial institution for your benefit. Because you don't handle the funds directly, the transaction is not considered a distribution. There is no limit to the number of transfers you can make.

Opening an Account




How do I decide which IRA CD is the best choice for me?




When choosing which type of IRA to open, you should consider factors such as your taxable income, age, and Tax Filing Status. You may want to consult a financial advisor or tax professional to help you determine which type of IRA is best suited to your needs. You can also call our IRA Specialists at  1-800-347-7000 to discuss available products.






What is the difference between a Traditional IRA and a Roth IRA?




Some contributions to Traditional IRAs are tax deductible and most distributions are taxable. A Roth IRA is a retirement plan for contributions made with after tax dollars. Contributions are nondeductible and all qualified distributions are tax free.






Can a Traditional IRA be converted into a Roth IRA?




Yes. However, a conversion from a Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA may have tax consequences. Consult a financial adviser or tax professional for guidance. For assistance in completing a conversion, please contact an IRA specialist at 1-800-347-7000.
A Traditional IRA may be converted to a Roth IRA as a direct or indirect conversion. In a direct conversion you never have access to your money. It is sent bank to bank and directly placed into a Roth IRA on your behalf. An indirect conversion is similar to a Rollover. You will receive a check made payable to you that can be deposited into your new Roth IRA account.
Consult a financial advisor or tax professional for guidance. For assistance in completing a conversion, contact an IRA Specialist at 1-800-347-7000 for additional information.






What is the difference between a transfer and a rollover?




When you transfer an IRA, the funds are moved directly from one financial institution to another. The transfer check is made payable to your financial institution for your benefit. Because you don't handle the funds directly, the transaction is not considered a distribution. There is also no limit to the number of transfers you can make.
When you rollover funds, you receive the funds through a distribution from your IRA, and then you have 60 days to deposit the funds into another IRA or other retirement plan in order to avoid tax consequences. IRA owners are limited to only one IRA-to-IRA rollover in any 12 month period.
For both transfers and rollovers, funds need to be moved between the same type of IRA account. For example if you have a Traditional IRA you can only transfer or rollover funds from another Traditional IRA.
Rollovers and transfers are not counted toward your annual IRA contribution limits.






Is there a limit to how often I can rollover funds?




IRA owners are limited to only one IRA-to-IRA rollover in any 12 month period and you can rollover as much money as you want.






Can I have more than one IRA?




Yes, you can have both Traditional and Roth IRA accounts at Discover Bank. Your Traditional IRA accounts will be grouped into and administered under a single Traditional IRA plan, and Roth IRA accounts will be grouped into and administered under a single Roth IRA plan. Additionally, if you maintain Inherited IRA accounts, they will also be in separate plans because they need to be titled separately.
You may not contribute more than the annual allowable maximum across all of your Traditional and Roth IRA accounts at all of your financial institutions.






Can I contribute to both a Roth IRA and a Traditional IRA?




Yes, you can contribute to both plan types. Your annual contribution can be divided between both types as long as you meet the eligibility requirements for each IRA type. For advice on the best way to contribute, you may want to consult a financial advisor or tax professional. For general questions and information regarding your IRA Accounts, you can call our IRA Specialists at 1-800-347-7000.






Can I designate a beneficiary for my IRA CD?




Yes. We encourage all of our IRA account holders to designate at least one beneficiary by completing a beneficiary form.PDF Document We also suggest updating your beneficiary information on a regular basis. If a beneficiary is not designated, any beneficiary payment will generally go to the IRA owner's estate, which is subject to any applicable community property state law requirements.

For new IRA plans, you will have 60 days starting with your IRA application date to return the completed IRA application/Plan Agreement. You will then have an additional 60 days from the date we receive the completed Plan Agreement to return the IRA contribution forms and fund your IRA CD.  If you are opening an IRA CD under an existing plan, you will have 60 days from the application date to return the contribution form(s) and fund your IRA CD.
If you are providing ACH funding instructions or internal transfer funding instructions during the application process, the instructions will be executed once the correctly and fully executed Plan Agreement, Contribution Form, and Signature Card are received. If we receive contributions via ACH or wire before receiving the correctly and fully executed Plan Agreement, those contributions will be returned. However, if a check is received prior to the receipt of the Plan Agreement, we will hold it for up to 30 days. If the correctly and fully executed Plan Agreement, Contribution Form, and Signature Card are not received within those 30 days, the check will be returned.

You may want to consult a financial advisor or tax professional.

Can I transfer funds from my employer's retirement plan into an IRA CD?




Yes. Funds may be moved into an IRA CD from any qualified retirement account. This transaction is done via a Direct or Indirect Rollover. You may want to consult a financial advisor or tax professional. You may also call our IRA Specialists at 1-800-347-7000 for more information.






What happens when my IRA CD matures?




We will send a notification 30 days before your IRA CD matures. When your IRA CD matures, you may make a deposit or withdrawal and change the term of your IRA CD during the grace period. The grace period lasts for 9 days immediately following the maturity date. Your IRA CD will automatically renew if you don't take any action during the grace period. Any term change, deposit, or withdrawal of principal during the grace period will end the grace period. Interest withdrawals will not affect the grace period.
In the event you want to add prior or current year funds to your IRA CD during the grace period, you will need to submit the appropriate contribution form designating the tax year for your deposit. If you are moving IRA funds at other financial institutions to your Discover IRA CD during the grace period, you will need to timely submit the appropriate correctly completed rollover or transfer form. If you decide to close your IRA CD account or take a partial distribution during the grace period, you will need to submit the appropriate correctly completed distribution form.  






Will I receive a confirmation when my IRA CD automatically renews?




Yes. You will receive a confirmation letter when your IRA CD automatically renews.






Will I receive a certificate for my IRA CD?




You will not receive a paper certificate for your IRA CD; however, you will receive a welcome kit when you open your IRA CD. You can access your IRA CD information anytime via the Account Center.






When will I receive my IRA CD statement?




IRA CD statements are sent annually in January. We encourage you to register for access to the Account Center so that you can view your account between statements.






How much of my IRA CD contribution is tax deductible?




Consult a financial advisor or a tax professional to help you determine exactly how much of your IRA contribution is tax deductible.






What are the rules regarding distribution of assets to my beneficiaries after death?




Traditional and Roth IRA plans offer multiple options for beneficiary distribution. There are several rules concerning required minimum distributions (RMDs) to beneficiaries. The rules apply considerations such as the age at time of death.  Please note that RMD rules in the event of account owner death are different from RMD rules when the account owner turns 701/2. For example, the beneficiary may be required to satisfy the IRA CD owner's RMD prior to making the RMD for the chosen beneficiary option. Consult a financial advisor or tax professional to help you determine the rules concerning distributions to beneficiaries.






How are my IRA CD transactions reported to the IRS?




Any contributions made during the tax year will be reported on form 5498. Additionally, any Rollovers, Conversions, Recharacterizations and the fair market value are also reported on form 5498. We will send Form 5498 to you and the IRS by May 31. Any distributions made from your IRA during a tax year will be reported on form 1099-R.We will send Form 1099-R to you by January 31.

Info


For new IRA plans, you will have 60 days starting with your IRA application date to return the completed IRA application/Plan Agreement. You will then have an additional 60 days from the date we receive the completed Plan Agreement to return the IRA contribution forms and fund your IRA CD.  If you are opening an IRA CD under an existing plan, you will have 60 days from the application date to return the contribution form(s) and fund your IRA CD.
If you are providing ACH funding instructions or internal transfer funding instructions during the application process, the instructions will be executed once the correctly and fully executed Plan Agreement, Contribution Form, and Signature Card are received. If we receive contributions via ACH or wire before receiving the correctly and fully executed Plan Agreement, those contributions will be returned. However, if a check is received prior to the receipt of the Plan Agreement, we will hold it for up to 30 days. If the correctly and fully executed Plan Agreement, Contribution Form, and Signature Card are not received within those 30 days, the check will be returned. Please note that IRA funding checks will not be deposited and no interest will be paid until the IRA CD is opened.

*Please note that Traveler Checks will not be accepted for deposit.






Can I make additional deposits to my IRA CD?




Additional deposits cannot be made during the term of any IRA CD. However, once your IRA CD matures, you can deposit additional funds once during the grace period. In the event you want to add prior or current year funds to your IRA CD at the time of maturity, you will need to submit the appropriate correctly completed contribution form in a timely manner designating the tax year for your deposit. If you are combining other IRA CDs and contributing them to your Discover IRA CD at the time of maturity, you will need to submit the appropriate rollover or transfer form. If you decide to close your account or take a partial distribution at the time of maturity, you will need to submit the appropriate correctly completed distribution form in a timely manner.




Interest/APY




When will I start earning interest on new deposits?




You will start to earn interest on the business day your deposit is received. However, if we receive a check deposit before your account is opened, interest will begin to accrue on the deposit on the business day your account is opened. Please note that an IRA account is not considered open until we receive all required plan documentation.






How is interest on my IRA CD calculated?




Interest is compounded daily, credited to your account monthly, and calculated on a 365-day basis.




Required Minimum Distribution (RMD)




Do I have to submit a form to request my RMD?




Yes. We require that all distributions be requested using the distribution formPDF Document or 70½ election formPDF Document. You should submit your requests for RMDs by December 15 to ensure adequate time for processing by the December 31 deadline.






Where do I find the form for my RMD?

How do I submit my RMD form?




You can submit the completed form to us by mail, fax, or through our Secure Document Upload when you are logged into the Account Center. Please remember you should mail all forms by December 15 to guarantee processing by the December 31 deadline.Discover Bank PO Box 30418 Salt Lake City, UT 84130Fax: 1-801-996-2683






When should I expect to receive my RMD?




We will process your RMD request upon receipt and you should expect to receive your distribution within 10 business days.






What is the deadline for submitting my RMD request?




The deadline to submit a correct and complete distribution form for RMD is December 15. We cannot guarantee forms received after December 15 will be processed by the December 31 deadline.






Do I have to take my RMD from my Discover IRA CD or can I take it from an IRA I have at another financial institution?




You can fulfill your RMD requirements from a Traditional IRA or combination of Traditional IRAs at any financial institution(s).






How do I find out how much I'm required to take from my IRA CD?




Financial institutions typically send notices early in the year to advise IRA customers of their RMD requirements, including withdrawal amount required. Discover Bank notifies IRA owners of RMD requirements on the IRA annual statement and on form 5498. You can access and view form 5498 as well as your account statement online when you log into the Account Center. 
If you did not receive these forms from us or have misplaced them, please call us at 1-800-347-7000.
                                        






Will Federal and/or State withholding be applied to my RMD?




Federal and State withholding will be applied where required by federal and/or state laws. In some cases, you will be able to indicate that you prefer no withholding or more withholding than is required. You will always be responsible for the income tax obligations of distributions from your IRA accounts. You may want to consult a financial advisor or tax professional to make sure your withholding elections are right for you. If you fail to waive or designate withholding elections on the distribution form, we will process the minimum required for Federal and State according to the IRS guidelines.






Are there tax consequences if I fail to take an RMD by the December 31st deadline?




If you are required to take an RMD, failing to do so may result in tax consequences from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). For more specifics regarding the consequences, you may want to consult a financial advisor or tax professional. For general questions and information regarding your IRA, please call our IRA Specialists at 1-800-347-7000.

Debit Card with Chip Technology




What is chip technology? 




Also known as EMV or smart chip technology, it provides added security at chip-enabled store terminals and ATMs. Many countries have already adopted chip technology. And now, U.S. merchants and card issuers are starting to adopt it, too.






How do I use a chip card? 




You can use chip cards in one of two ways. If you are at a merchant location that does not have chip-enabled terminals, you can swipe using the magnetic stripe on the back of your card as usual.
At merchant locations that already accept chip cards, you'll be prompted to insert your card into the chip-enabled terminal. Be sure to leave the card in the terminal until the transaction is completed.






When do I swipe? When do I insert?




When in doubt, swipe your chip debit card. If the terminal is chip enabled, it will recognize that your debit card has a chip and will prompt you to insert it instead.






Where can I use my Discover debit card with chip technology?




Your Discover debit card is accepted everywhere you use it today. When retailers update their terminals to accept chips, just insert your card instead of swiping the magnetic stripe.






Do chip payments require signatures? Or PINs?




Your new Discover debit card with chip technology can be used with a signature or PIN depending on the terminal. At chip-enabled terminals, you will be prompted to provide your signature or PIN. In some situations, you may not need to provide either one.






I currently have a regular Discover debit card. When will I receive a chip card?




You will receive a chip debit card when your current debit card expires, if your card is lost or stolen, or if you experience fraud on your account.






If we have a joint account, will we both get new chip cards?




Each owner who has a debit card will receive a new chip debit card when their current card expires. If your debit card is lost or stolen, only the person with the lost or stolen card will receive a new chip debit card. If you request a new chip card early, only the requester will receive a new card.






If I am a new customer and just signed up for an account, will I get both types of cards? 




No. New customers will only receive a chip debit card.






If I request a chip card, will my debit card information change?




Yes. Your debit card number, security code, expiration date and PIN will change. Because of this, we recommend updating all places where you have previously linked your debit card, including any automatic bill payments. 
Please note, that if you have a joint account and only one person on the account requests a chip card, then only that person will receive a new chip debit card.






How does the chip work?




When you insert your chip debit card at a chip-enabled terminal, the embedded microchip generates unique, dynamic data for each transaction. This makes it difficult for fraudsters to duplicate your account information, which in turn, can reduce the risk of fraudulent transactions on your account.






What are the benefits?




Chip technology provides an additional layer of card security. Chip cards make it difficult for hackers to copy and use your debit card information when used at chip-enabled terminals. Other benefits include:

Ease of Use: It's still a debit card, so just use it like before. Once merchants adopt this technology, the terminals will prompt you to insert your card. 
Added Security: The chip helps protect against fraud because it creates unique transaction data when the card is used at chip-enabled terminals in stores and at ATMs
Fraud Protection: As always, you're never responsible for unauthorized transactions on your Discover debit card.







Are chip payments contactless or a type of Near Field Communication (NFC) payment?




No. Your Discover debit card with chip technology requires contact with the terminal's chip reader. Waving your card in front of the terminal will not work.






Can I keep my old card and have a chip card, too?




No. Your Discover debit card with chip technology replaces your other card. Once you activate your chip card, which also has a magnetic stripe, your old debit card will be deactivated.




Debit Card Overview




Are all ATMs accessible 24/7? 




No, ATM accessibility varies by location.  Not all ATMs are available 24/7 and some may have restricted access.

You may earn Cashback Bonus in the following ways on payments or purchases, up to 100 each month:

$0.10 for purchases made using your Discover Debit Card
$0.10 for bills paid using our Online Bill Payment service

Where can I see the Cashback Bonus I have earned with my checking account?




You may view Cashback Bonus earned from your Discover Cashback Checking® Account in the Rewards Detail section in your online Cashback Checking account summary, and in your Cashback Checking statement.
Checking Cashback Bonus rewards transferred to a Discover Credit Card Cashback Bonus Account may be viewed in the "Rewards Details" in the Cashback Bonus Balance section in the online Discover Credit Card account summary and on your monthly Credit Card statement.






What do I do if I see that my rewards have not posted correctly?




If your rewards have not posted correctly, please call us at

If my Discover Card is lost or stolen, will my Checking Cashback Bonus be transferred to my new account?




Yes, we automatically transfer your Checking Cashback Bonus balance to the Checking Cashback Bonus bank linked to your new Discover Cashback Checking® Account.






Can I earn more rewards by splitting up my normal bill payments or debit card transactions?




Your bill payments, debit card transactions and checks are rewarded for normal everyday transactions. As noted in the Deposit Account Agreement, we reserve the right to adjust the amount of your rewards or close your account due to irregular, unauthorized or fraudulent activity in your Checking Account.
For example, splitting up one standard monthly bill payment into several payments to receive $0.10 per payment is deemed as irregular activity as it's not standard bill payment practice. The same holds true for debit card transactions. Asking a merchant to swipe your debit card repeatedly for each item at checkout instead of using your debit card to make a complete purchase of items at one time is recognized as manufacturing transactions and not normal everyday debit card behavior.

We will send you a notification 30 days before your CD matures. When your CD matures, you may make a deposit or withdrawal and change the term of your CD during the grace period.

Your CD will automatically renew if you don't take any action during the grace period and interest withdrawn on the account will not affect the grace period. Any term change, deposit, or withdrawal of principal during the grace period will end the grace period. In some cases, the Early Withdrawal Fee may reduce the principal in the CD.






Will I receive a certificate for my CD?

Note:  Federal law limits the number of certain types of withdrawals and transfers from a Money Market Account to a combined total of six per calendar month per account.

Yes. The Discover ATM withdrawal limit is $510 per day. Some ATMs may have lower withdrawal limits, but you may complete multiple transactions until you meet the Discover withdrawal limit of $510 per day.




Debit Card with Chip Technology




What is chip technology? 




Also known as EMV or smart chip technology, it provides added security at chip-enabled store terminals and ATMs. Many countries have already adopted chip technology. And now, U.S. merchants and card issuers are starting to adopt it, too.






How do I use a chip card? 




You can use chip cards in one of two ways. If you are at a merchant location that does not have chip-enabled terminals, you can swipe using the magnetic stripe on the back of your card as usual.
At merchant locations that already accept chip cards, you'll be prompted to insert your card into the chip-enabled terminal. Be sure to leave the card in the terminal until the transaction is completed.






When do I swipe? When do I insert?




When in doubt, swipe your chip debit card. If the terminal is chip enabled, it will recognize that your debit card has a chip and will prompt you to insert it instead.






Where can I use my Discover debit card with chip technology?




Your Discover debit card is accepted everywhere you use it today. When retailers update their terminals to accept chips, just insert your card instead of swiping the magnetic stripe.






Do chip payments require signatures? Or PINs?




Your new Discover debit card with chip technology can be used with a signature or PIN depending on the terminal. At chip-enabled terminals, you will be prompted to provide your signature or PIN. In some situations, you may not need to provide either one.






I currently have a regular Discover debit card. When will I receive a chip card?




You will receive a chip debit card when your current debit card expires, if your card is lost or stolen, or if you experience fraud on your account.






If we have a joint account, will we both get new chip cards?




Each owner who has a debit card will receive a new chip debit card when their current card expires. If your debit card is lost or stolen, only the person with the lost or stolen card will receive a new chip debit card. If you request a new chip card early, only the requester will receive a new card.






If I am a new customer and just signed up for an account, will I get both types of cards? 




No. New customers will only receive a chip debit card.






If I request a chip card, will my debit card information change?




Yes. Your debit card number, security code, expiration date and PIN will change. Because of this, we recommend updating all places where you have previously linked your debit card, including any automatic bill payments. 
Please note, that if you have a joint account and only one person on the account requests a chip card, then only that person will receive a new chip debit card.






How does the chip work?




When you insert your chip debit card at a chip-enabled terminal, the embedded microchip generates unique, dynamic data for each transaction. This makes it difficult for fraudsters to duplicate your account information, which in turn, can reduce the risk of fraudulent transactions on your account.






What are the benefits?




Chip technology provides an additional layer of card security. Chip cards make it difficult for hackers to copy and use your debit card information when used at chip-enabled terminals. Other benefits include:

Ease of Use: It's still a debit card, so just use it like before. Once merchants adopt this technology, the terminals will prompt you to insert your card. 
Added Security: The chip helps protect against fraud because it creates unique transaction data when the card is used at chip-enabled terminals in stores and at ATMs
Fraud Protection: As always, you're never responsible for unauthorized transactions on your Discover debit card.







Are chip payments contactless or a type of Near Field Communication (NFC) payment?




No. Your Discover debit card with chip technology requires contact with the terminal's chip reader. Waving your card in front of the terminal will not work.






Can I keep my old card and have a chip card, too?




No. Your Discover debit card with chip technology replaces your other card. Once you activate your chip card, which also has a magnetic stripe, your old debit card will be deactivated.

Discover checking


 

4.5 / 5.0
Free checking is hard to come by and rewards checking even more so. Discover’s Cashback Checking is both. Add in an extensive ATM network and this account almost earns a perfect 5 stars.
But there are two caveats. To apply for Discover checking, you need to have another Discover account, such as a credit card or savings account. And getting the maximum cash back of $10 per month might be difficult if you’re not a frequent spender. The 10 cents per debit card swipe, bill pay or check means you’d need to make 100 transactions. That’s more than three qualifying transactions every day. If you want an easier way to earn cash back, credit cards may be a better option.
As is standard among online banks, Discover doesn’t let you deposit cash; the one exception is at its single branch location, in Delaware.

5.0 / 5.0
Discover’s savings account has a competitive annual percentage yield, and no fees and no minimum opening deposit requirement make it a simple and stress-free account to use. Plus, you can earn a bonus.




ProsCons




1.10% APYNo monthly fee, balance requirement or minimum opening depositSavings bonus available$15 fee charged if you exceed six monthly withdrawals

Certificates of deposit


 

5.0 / 5.0
Discover’s CD rates are highly competitive, but they require a higher opening deposit than some other banks. Term lengths vary from three months to 10 years, and you stand to earn more money on longer terms.




ProsCons




2-year CD: 1.50% APY. 3-year CD: 1.60% APY5-year CD: 2.25% APY$2,500 minimum opening deposit

Discover customer experience


 

4.0 / 5.0
The bank’s website shows rates and fees clearly, and the mobile app on iOS and Android phones receives high ratings. If you need help, you can reach a representative by mail, or 24 hours a day by phone, email or Twitter.
Discover’s main downside is standard among online banks: There’s no network of physical locations.
Discover overdraft fees


 

3.5 / 5.0
Discover Bank charges a nonsufficient funds $30 fee if you try to make a transaction without enough funds in your account. But only one fee is charged per day, regardless of the number of transactions. At other institutions, an overdraft fee might be charged multiple times in a single day, potentially adding up to hundreds of dollars.
You can avoid a fee altogether with free automatic transfers from a linked savings or money market account. However, if you can’t cover the overdraft with the linked account either, you’ll still be charged the $30 fee. These transfers don’t apply to ATM withdrawals or debit card purchases, which would be declined without a fee charged.
Money in your pocket
Discover Bank’s free ATMs and fee-free services mean you keep more money in your pocket. And the $10 monthly cash-back rewards are a rare perk.
Discover’s a good option, but if checking account rewards are what you’re after, shop around to ensure that you’re getting the best deal based on your spending habits.

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Order Discover to Pay $200 Million Consumer Refund for Deceptive Marketing

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) announced a joint public enforcement action with an order requiring Discover Bank to refund approximately $200 million to more than 3.5 million consumers and pay a $14 million civil money penalty. This action results from an investigation started by the FDIC which the CFPB joined last year. The joint investigation concerned deceptive telemarketing and sales tactics used by Discover to mislead consumers into paying for various credit card “add-on products” – payment protection, credit score tracking, identity theft protection, and wallet protection.
The agencies jointly determined that Discover engaged in deceptive telemarketing tactics to sell the company’s credit card add-on products. Payment Protection was marketed as a product that allows consumers to put their payments on hold for up to two years in the event of unemployment, hospitalization, or other qualifying life events. Discover also sold its Credit Score Tracker, designed to allow a customer unlimited access to his or her credit reports and credit score. The third product was Identity Theft Protection, which was marketed as providing daily credit monitoring. Lastly, Discover’s Wallet Protection product was sold as a service to help a consumer cancel credit cards in the event that his or her wallet is stolen.
Discover’s telemarketing scripts contained misleading language likely to deceive consumers about whether they were actually purchasing a product. Discover’s telemarketers also often downplayed key terms and spoke quickly during the part of the call in which the prices and terms of the add-on products were disclosed. Because of the misleading language in the scripts and the actions of Discover’s telemarketers, consumers were:

Misled about the fact that there was a charge for the products: Discover’s telemarketing scripts often used language implying that the products were additional free “benefits,” rather than products for which a fee would be applied to their accounts.
Misled about whether they had purchased the products: The telemarketing scripts frequently suggested that consumers would not be charged for the products until after having a chance to review printed materials from Discover. Discover, however, did not provide consumers with the information until after Discover had already initiated the consumer’s purchase of a product.
Enrolled without their consent: Discover representatives processed the add-on product purchases without some consumers’ consent. These consumers were then charged for the product on their Discover card.
Withheld material information about eligibility requirements for certain benefits: Discover’s telemarketers typically did not disclose critical eligibility requirements for certain payment protection benefits, such as exclusions for pre-existing medical conditions and certain limitations concerning employment.

Enforcement Action
Under the order, Discover has agreed to:

Stop deceptive marketing: Discover is required to institute certain changes to its telemarketing of these products that are designed to ensure that these unlawful acts do not occur again. Discover has also agreed to submit a compliance plan to the CFPB and the FDIC for approval, and to take specific corrective actions related to the products.
Pay restitution to consumers who purchased the products: Discover will pay approximately $200 million in restitution to more than 3.5 million consumers who were charged for one or more of the products between December 1, 2007 and August 31, 2011. All consumers affected by Discover’s deceptive practices regarding these products, except those who affirmatively made use of Payment Protection, will receive restitution with amounts varying depending on when they purchased, and how long they held, the add-on products. All consumers will receive at least 90 days’ worth of fees paid (minus any refunds they have already received), with approximately 2 million consumers receiving full restitution of all of the fees they paid.
Provide refunds or credits without any further action by consumers: Consumers are not required to take any action to receive their credit or check. If an affected consumer is still a Discover customer, he or she will receive a credit to his or her account. If an affected consumer is no longer a Discover credit card holder, the consumer will receive a check in the mail or have any outstanding balance reduced by the amount of the refund.
Submit to an independent audit: Compliance with the restitution terms of the order will be assured through the work of an independent auditor, who will report to the CFPB and FDIC on Discover’s compliance with the joint CFPB-FDIC Consent Order.
Pay a $14 million penalty: The CFPB and the FDIC imposed civil money penalties of $14 million. Discover will pay $7 million of that penalty to the U.S. Treasury and $7 million to the CFPB’s Civil Penalty Fund.

Discover Bank Product Helps Americans Preserve Retirement Funds


April 02, 2009

IRA CD Accounts Offer Security and Guaranteed Return with Tax Advantages
NEW CASTLE, Del., Apr 02, 2009 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Americans nearing retirement who want more peace of mind than their 
      equities-based individual retirement accounts can provide have at least 
      one surefire option to get a guaranteed return: IRA CDs.
"If you've worked hard to build a nest egg and you're seeing it slip 
      away in this economy, you don't need more uncertainty from the markets," 
      said Christina Favilla, president of Discover Bank. "A Discover IRA CD 
      provides a fixed rate of return and a variety of terms to meet your 
      future retirement needs."

Discover Bank offers both traditional and Roth IRA CDs, and the 
      convenience of online account opening with the ability to fund your 
      account through an automated transfer of funds. IRA CDs work much like 
      traditional CDs, in which principal is protected and interest is fixed 
      during the term. Discover Bank pays competitive rates that consistently 
      exceed the national average of the top 50 U.S. banks, according to 
      Informa Research Services.

Other benefits:



        Transfer funds from a traditional IRA or rollover funds from a 401K to 
        an IRA CD.
      

        Enjoy contribution limits of up to $5,000 for people under 50, and 
        $6,000 for those over 50.
      

        Choose flexible terms from 3 months to 10 years.
      

        Rest easy with FDIC protection for up to $250,000 per account.
      

        Calculate your savings growth with online tools.
      

        Select between a Roth or Traditional IRA CD.
      


"IRA CDs have been in the market for some time, but perhaps the growing 
      uncertainty in the economy makes them more essential these days to 
      people nearing retirement," Favilla said. "People want to stop seeing 
      their retirement investments disappear and in return are looking for 
      security, peace of mind and a guaranteed return."
