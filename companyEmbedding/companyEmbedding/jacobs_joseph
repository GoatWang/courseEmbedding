                Who Was Dr. Joseph Jacobs?

In my 19 years in the Coca-Cola Archives, I must have said the line: “Coca-Cola was first served on May 8, 1886 at Jacobs’ Pharmacy” thousands of times as I have discussed the history of the drink. 
With the constant repetition, Jacobs’s Pharmacy had become a “thing” rather than a place or store run by a family. This year, for our 130th birthday, I wanted to go a little deeper and introduce you to Dr. Joseph Jacobs, the man who founded Jacobs’ Pharmacy.

A native of Jefferson, Ga., Jacobs studied under Dr. Crawford W. Long, the Jefferson doctor who discovered the use of ether as an anesthetic. Long was instrumental in ensuring Jacobs' acceptance to the University of Georgia. After graduation, Jacobs continued his education at the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science before returning to Athens, Ga. to open the Athens Pharmaceutical Company. The growth of Atlanta lured Jacobs to the city, and he moved there in January 1884 and purchased Taylor Pharmacy at Five Points in downtown Atlanta.  
In 1929, Dr. Jacobs wrote an article for Drug Topics, an industry magazine for the pharmacy trade, called “How I Won and Lost an Interest in Coca-Cola.” In this article, Jacobs described the soda fountain in his building.
“On the right-hand side of the entrance was a soda fountain conducted by Willis Venable, who was assisted by his brother, John Venable, and his son Edward Venable, (now one of the leading restaurant keepers in Atlanta.) The fountain enjoyed a wonderful reputation and did a large business. It averaged fully $150.00 a day from the various drinks.” As was the custom of the day, the fountains were often set up on space that was rented from the pharmacy owners. This is the case with Venable and Jacobs.
It's important to keep in mind what pharmacies were like in 1886. They were more like general stores that also dispensed medicine. Open to men and woman, pharmacies were often gathering spaces for people to get the news of the day, pick up their items and enjoy a moment at the fountain. Jacobs’ Pharmacy was one of the leading pharmacies in Atlanta.
Part of the reason for its popularity was Dr. Jacobs’ innovative business practices. Jacobs was one of the first Atlanta retailers to discount his goods. In an interesting story, the smallest currency used in Atlanta after the Civil War was the nickel. Jacobs saw an opportunity and purchased $300 worth of pennies from the mint in Washington and began to discount items from $1 to .98 cents so he could provide change. The discounts attracted customers but angered competitors to the point that he became the target of threats and lawsuits. Jacobs stuck to his strategy and, as the anger simmered, the penny had come to stay in Atlanta.
As Jacobs’ wrote in his 1929 article, he was once a co-owner of The Coca-Cola Company for a short time. Willis Venable had purchased a share of ownership from Dr. John Pemberton, the inventor of Coca-Cola. With that purchase, Pemberton retained a share but also received a royalty per gallon from Venable. Venable became strapped for cash because he was building a home in Atlanta’s West End. To raise funds, Venable sold his portion of the formula to Jacobs in return for a cash advance. 
At this point, Asa Candler enters the story. Jacobs and Candler were well acquainted as two of Atlanta’s leading pharmacists. Asa even arranged for his son, Charles Howard Candler to work in Jacobs’ Pharmacy so he could learn the trade. Candler expressed an interest in getting out of the pharmacy business, and Jacobs has told him he knew little of Coca-Cola and wished to dispose of his interest in the product. The two struck a deal where Candler gave Jacobs an interest in a glass factory in exchange for his share of Coca-Cola. Candler, in turn, purchased Pemberton’s portion and soon took total control of the company.



Jacobs Drug Store at the junction of Peachtree Street and Roswell Road in the heart of Buckhead, circa 1944. 





"Ater disposing of my Coca-Cola stock to Mr. Candler, I never owned any more of it, which evidences my poor judgement," Jacobs wrote. But that does not due full justice to his success as a business leader. From his single store at Five Points, Jacobs continued to expand his business and became the leading drug store owner in the city. At the time of his death in September 1929, Jacobs owned eight stores in Atlanta. His son, Sinclair Jacobs, also a pharmacist, continued to grow the chain until there were 21 stores in the South. Sinclair sold the chain to Revco Drugs after World War II.
Joseph Jacobs was a member of The Temple and well respected in the community. His son Sinclair was president of The Temple during the 1940s. The family owned a 40-acre estate on Roswell Road north of Buckhead. Sinclair died in 1977 and was survived by his son, Tory, who moved to Miami until his death in 2011.
While the original Jacobs’ Pharmacy location at Five Points is long gone, you can still get a sense of the family by visiting Historic Oakland Cemetery in Atlanta to see the Jacobs’ Mausoleum, one of the first and finest in the city.
So the next time you read or hear the phrase, “Coca-Cola was first served on May 8th at Jacobs’ Pharmacy,” I hope you have a fuller sense of the man.

Biography[edit]
Jacobs was born in Australia. He was the sixth surviving son of John Jacobs, a publican who had emigrated from London around 1837, and his wife Sarah, née Myers.[2] Jacobs was educated at Sydney Grammar School and at the University of Sydney, where he won a scholarship for classics, mathematics and chemistry. He did not complete his studies in Sydney, but left for England at the age of 18 and entered St John's College, Cambridge.[3] He graduated with a B.A. in 1876, and in 1877, studied at the University of Berlin.
Jacobs married Georgina Horne and fathered two sons and a daughter. In 1900, when he became revising editor of the Jewish Encyclopedia, based in New York, he settled permanently in the United States.
He died on 30 January 1916 at his home in Yonkers, New York.[2]
Career[edit]




1919 edition of The Book of Wonder Voyages (1896)


Jacobs was secretary of the Society of Hebrew Literature from 1878 to 1884, and in 1882, came into prominence as the writer of a series of articles in The Times on the persecution of Jews in Russia. This led to the formation of the mansion house fund and committee, of which Jacobs was secretary from 1882 to 1900.
He was a student of anthropology at the Statistical Laboratory at University College London in the 1880s under Francis Galton. His Studies in Jewish Statistics: Social, Vital and Anthropometric (1891) made his reputation as the first proponent of Jewish race science.[4]
In 1888, he prepared with Lucien Wolf the Bibliotheca Anglo-Judaica: A Bibliographical Guide to Anglo-Jewish History, and in 1890, he edited English Fairy Tales, the first of his series of books of fairy tales published during the next 10 years. He wrote many literary articles for the Athenaeum, which published in 1891 the collection, George Eliot, Matthew Arnold, Browning, Newman, Essays and Reviews from the Athenaeum. In the same year appeared his Studies in Jewish Statistics, in 1892, Tennyson and "In Memoriam", and in 1893, his important book on The Jews of Angevin England. In 1894, were published his Studies in Biblical archaeology, and An Inquiry into the Sources of the History of the Jews in Spain, in connection with which he was made a corresponding member of the Royal Academy of History of Madrid. His historical novel dealing with the life of Jesus, As Others Saw Him: A Retrospective A.D. 54, was published anonymously in 1895, in the following year his Jewish Ideals and other Essays came out. In this year, he was invited to the United States of America to give a course of lectures on the "Philosophy of Jewish History". The Story of Geographical Discovery was published towards the end of 1898 and ran into several editions. He had been compiling and editing the Jewish Year Book since 1896, and was president of the Jewish Historical Society of England in 1898-99.
In 1900, he accepted an invitation to become revising editor of the Jewish Encyclopedia, which was then being prepared at New York. He settled permanently in the United States, where he wrote many articles for the Jewish Encyclopedia, and was generally responsible for the style of the whole publication. It was completed in 1906.
He then became registrar and professor of English at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in New York.
In 1908, he was appointed a member of the board of seven, which made a new English translation of the Bible for the Jewish Publication Society of America.
In 1913, he resigned his positions at the seminary to become editor of the American Hebrew.
In 1920, Book I of his Jewish Contributions to Civilization, which was practically finished at the time of his death, was published at Philadelphia.
In addition to the books already mentioned, Jacobs edited The Fables of Aesop as First Printed by Caxton (1889), Painter's Palace of Pleasure (1890), Baltaser Gracian's Art of Worldly Wisdom (1892), Howell's Letters (1892), Barlaam and Josaphat (1896), The Thousand and One Nights (6 vols, 1896), and others. Jacobs was also a contributor to the Encyclopædia Britannica, and James Hastings' Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics.
Folklore[edit]




Illustration of "A Legend of Knockmany" by John D. Batten for Celtic Fairy Tales (1892)


Jacobs edited the journal Folklore from 1899 to 1900 and from 1890 to 1916 he edited multiple collections of fairy tales that were published with distinguished illustrations by John Dickson Batten: English Fairy Tales, Celtic Fairy Tales, Indian Fairy Tales, More English Fairy Tales, More Celtic Fairy Tales (all 1890 to 1895) and Europa's Fairy Book (also issued as European Folk and Fairy Tales) in 1916.[5] He was inspired in this by the Brothers Grimm and the romantic nationalism common in folklorists of his age; he wished English children to have access to English fairy tales, whereas they were chiefly reading French and German tales;[6] in his own words, "What Perrault began, the Grimms completed."
Although he collected many tales under the name of fairy tales, many of them are unusual sorts of tales. Binnorie (in English Fairy Tales)[7] and Tamlane (in More English Fairy Tales)[8] are prose versions of ballads, The Old Woman and Her Pig (in English Fairy Tales) is a nursery rhyme, Henny-Penny (in English Fairy Tales) is a fable, and The Buried Moon (in More English Fairy Tales) has mythic overtones to an extent unusual in fairy tales. According to his own analysis of English Fairy Tales, "Of the eighty-seven tales contained in my two volumes, thirty-eight are Märchen proper, ten sagas or legends, nineteen drolls, four cumulative stories, six beast tales, and ten nonsense stories."[9]

Biography[edit]
Jacobs was born in Australia. He was the sixth surviving son of John Jacobs, a publican who had emigrated from London around 1837, and his wife Sarah, née Myers.[2] Jacobs was educated at Sydney Grammar School and at the University of Sydney, where he won a scholarship for classics, mathematics and chemistry. He did not complete his studies in Sydney, but left for England at the age of 18 and entered St John's College, Cambridge.[3] He graduated with a B.A. in 1876, and in 1877, studied at the University of Berlin.
Jacobs married Georgina Horne and fathered two sons and a daughter. In 1900, when he became revising editor of the Jewish Encyclopedia, based in New York, he settled permanently in the United States.
He died on 30 January 1916 at his home in Yonkers, New York.[2]
Career[edit]




1919 edition of The Book of Wonder Voyages (1896)


Jacobs was secretary of the Society of Hebrew Literature from 1878 to 1884, and in 1882, came into prominence as the writer of a series of articles in The Times on the persecution of Jews in Russia. This led to the formation of the mansion house fund and committee, of which Jacobs was secretary from 1882 to 1900.
He was a student of anthropology at the Statistical Laboratory at University College London in the 1880s under Francis Galton. His Studies in Jewish Statistics: Social, Vital and Anthropometric (1891) made his reputation as the first proponent of Jewish race science.[4]
In 1888, he prepared with Lucien Wolf the Bibliotheca Anglo-Judaica: A Bibliographical Guide to Anglo-Jewish History, and in 1890, he edited English Fairy Tales, the first of his series of books of fairy tales published during the next 10 years. He wrote many literary articles for the Athenaeum, which published in 1891 the collection, George Eliot, Matthew Arnold, Browning, Newman, Essays and Reviews from the Athenaeum. In the same year appeared his Studies in Jewish Statistics, in 1892, Tennyson and "In Memoriam", and in 1893, his important book on The Jews of Angevin England. In 1894, were published his Studies in Biblical archaeology, and An Inquiry into the Sources of the History of the Jews in Spain, in connection with which he was made a corresponding member of the Royal Academy of History of Madrid. His historical novel dealing with the life of Jesus, As Others Saw Him: A Retrospective A.D. 54, was published anonymously in 1895, in the following year his Jewish Ideals and other Essays came out. In this year, he was invited to the United States of America to give a course of lectures on the "Philosophy of Jewish History". The Story of Geographical Discovery was published towards the end of 1898 and ran into several editions. He had been compiling and editing the Jewish Year Book since 1896, and was president of the Jewish Historical Society of England in 1898-99.
In 1900, he accepted an invitation to become revising editor of the Jewish Encyclopedia, which was then being prepared at New York. He settled permanently in the United States, where he wrote many articles for the Jewish Encyclopedia, and was generally responsible for the style of the whole publication. It was completed in 1906.
He then became registrar and professor of English at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in New York.
In 1908, he was appointed a member of the board of seven, which made a new English translation of the Bible for the Jewish Publication Society of America.
In 1913, he resigned his positions at the seminary to become editor of the American Hebrew.
In 1920, Book I of his Jewish Contributions to Civilization, which was practically finished at the time of his death, was published at Philadelphia.
In addition to the books already mentioned, Jacobs edited The Fables of Aesop as First Printed by Caxton (1889), Painter's Palace of Pleasure (1890), Baltaser Gracian's Art of Worldly Wisdom (1892), Howell's Letters (1892), Barlaam and Josaphat (1896), The Thousand and One Nights (6 vols, 1896), and others. Jacobs was also a contributor to the Encyclopædia Britannica, and James Hastings' Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics.
Folklore[edit]




Illustration of "A Legend of Knockmany" by John D. Batten for Celtic Fairy Tales (1892)


Jacobs edited the journal Folklore from 1899 to 1900 and from 1890 to 1916 he edited multiple collections of fairy tales that were published with distinguished illustrations by John Dickson Batten: English Fairy Tales, Celtic Fairy Tales, Indian Fairy Tales, More English Fairy Tales, More Celtic Fairy Tales (all 1890 to 1895) and Europa's Fairy Book (also issued as European Folk and Fairy Tales) in 1916.[5] He was inspired in this by the Brothers Grimm and the romantic nationalism common in folklorists of his age; he wished English children to have access to English fairy tales, whereas they were chiefly reading French and German tales;[6] in his own words, "What Perrault began, the Grimms completed."
Although he collected many tales under the name of fairy tales, many of them are unusual sorts of tales. Binnorie (in English Fairy Tales)[7] and Tamlane (in More English Fairy Tales)[8] are prose versions of ballads, The Old Woman and Her Pig (in English Fairy Tales) is a nursery rhyme, Henny-Penny (in English Fairy Tales) is a fable, and The Buried Moon (in More English Fairy Tales) has mythic overtones to an extent unusual in fairy tales. According to his own analysis of English Fairy Tales, "Of the eighty-seven tales contained in my two volumes, thirty-eight are Märchen proper, ten sagas or legends, nineteen drolls, four cumulative stories, six beast tales, and ten nonsense stories."[9]

Biography[edit]
Jacobs was born in Australia. He was the sixth surviving son of John Jacobs, a publican who had emigrated from London around 1837, and his wife Sarah, née Myers.[2] Jacobs was educated at Sydney Grammar School and at the University of Sydney, where he won a scholarship for classics, mathematics and chemistry. He did not complete his studies in Sydney, but left for England at the age of 18 and entered St John's College, Cambridge.[3] He graduated with a B.A. in 1876, and in 1877, studied at the University of Berlin.
Jacobs married Georgina Horne and fathered two sons and a daughter. In 1900, when he became revising editor of the Jewish Encyclopedia, based in New York, he settled permanently in the United States.
He died on 30 January 1916 at his home in Yonkers, New York.[2]
Career[edit]




1919 edition of The Book of Wonder Voyages (1896)


Jacobs was secretary of the Society of Hebrew Literature from 1878 to 1884, and in 1882, came into prominence as the writer of a series of articles in The Times on the persecution of Jews in Russia. This led to the formation of the mansion house fund and committee, of which Jacobs was secretary from 1882 to 1900.
He was a student of anthropology at the Statistical Laboratory at University College London in the 1880s under Francis Galton. His Studies in Jewish Statistics: Social, Vital and Anthropometric (1891) made his reputation as the first proponent of Jewish race science.[4]
In 1888, he prepared with Lucien Wolf the Bibliotheca Anglo-Judaica: A Bibliographical Guide to Anglo-Jewish History, and in 1890, he edited English Fairy Tales, the first of his series of books of fairy tales published during the next 10 years. He wrote many literary articles for the Athenaeum, which published in 1891 the collection, George Eliot, Matthew Arnold, Browning, Newman, Essays and Reviews from the Athenaeum. In the same year appeared his Studies in Jewish Statistics, in 1892, Tennyson and "In Memoriam", and in 1893, his important book on The Jews of Angevin England. In 1894, were published his Studies in Biblical archaeology, and An Inquiry into the Sources of the History of the Jews in Spain, in connection with which he was made a corresponding member of the Royal Academy of History of Madrid. His historical novel dealing with the life of Jesus, As Others Saw Him: A Retrospective A.D. 54, was published anonymously in 1895, in the following year his Jewish Ideals and other Essays came out. In this year, he was invited to the United States of America to give a course of lectures on the "Philosophy of Jewish History". The Story of Geographical Discovery was published towards the end of 1898 and ran into several editions. He had been compiling and editing the Jewish Year Book since 1896, and was president of the Jewish Historical Society of England in 1898-99.
In 1900, he accepted an invitation to become revising editor of the Jewish Encyclopedia, which was then being prepared at New York. He settled permanently in the United States, where he wrote many articles for the Jewish Encyclopedia, and was generally responsible for the style of the whole publication. It was completed in 1906.
He then became registrar and professor of English at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in New York.
In 1908, he was appointed a member of the board of seven, which made a new English translation of the Bible for the Jewish Publication Society of America.
In 1913, he resigned his positions at the seminary to become editor of the American Hebrew.
In 1920, Book I of his Jewish Contributions to Civilization, which was practically finished at the time of his death, was published at Philadelphia.
In addition to the books already mentioned, Jacobs edited The Fables of Aesop as First Printed by Caxton (1889), Painter's Palace of Pleasure (1890), Baltaser Gracian's Art of Worldly Wisdom (1892), Howell's Letters (1892), Barlaam and Josaphat (1896), The Thousand and One Nights (6 vols, 1896), and others. Jacobs was also a contributor to the Encyclopædia Britannica, and James Hastings' Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics.
Folklore[edit]




Illustration of "A Legend of Knockmany" by John D. Batten for Celtic Fairy Tales (1892)


Jacobs edited the journal Folklore from 1899 to 1900 and from 1890 to 1916 he edited multiple collections of fairy tales that were published with distinguished illustrations by John Dickson Batten: English Fairy Tales, Celtic Fairy Tales, Indian Fairy Tales, More English Fairy Tales, More Celtic Fairy Tales (all 1890 to 1895) and Europa's Fairy Book (also issued as European Folk and Fairy Tales) in 1916.[5] He was inspired in this by the Brothers Grimm and the romantic nationalism common in folklorists of his age; he wished English children to have access to English fairy tales, whereas they were chiefly reading French and German tales;[6] in his own words, "What Perrault began, the Grimms completed."
Although he collected many tales under the name of fairy tales, many of them are unusual sorts of tales. Binnorie (in English Fairy Tales)[7] and Tamlane (in More English Fairy Tales)[8] are prose versions of ballads, The Old Woman and Her Pig (in English Fairy Tales) is a nursery rhyme, Henny-Penny (in English Fairy Tales) is a fable, and The Buried Moon (in More English Fairy Tales) has mythic overtones to an extent unusual in fairy tales. According to his own analysis of English Fairy Tales, "Of the eighty-seven tales contained in my two volumes, thirty-eight are Märchen proper, ten sagas or legends, nineteen drolls, four cumulative stories, six beast tales, and ten nonsense stories."[9]

He was the sixth surviving son of John Jacobs, a publican who had emigrated from London around 1837, and his wife Sarah, née Myers.[2] Jacobs was educated at Sydney Grammar School and at the University of Sydney, where he won a scholarship for classics, mathematics and chemistry. He did not complete his studies in Sydney, but left for England at the age of 18 and entered St John's College, Cambridge.[3] He graduated with a B.A. in 1876, and in 1877, studied at the University of Berlin.
Jacobs married Georgina Horne and fathered two sons and a daughter. In 1900, when he became revising editor of the Jewish Encyclopedia, based in New York, he settled permanently in the United States.
He died on 30 January 1916 at his home in Yonkers, New York.[2]
Career[edit]




1919 edition of The Book of Wonder Voyages (1896)


Jacobs was secretary of the Society of Hebrew Literature from 1878 to 1884, and in 1882, came into prominence as the writer of a series of articles in The Times on the persecution of Jews in Russia. This led to the formation of the mansion house fund and committee, of which Jacobs was secretary from 1882 to 1900.
He was a student of anthropology at the Statistical Laboratory at University College London in the 1880s under Francis Galton. His Studies in Jewish Statistics: Social, Vital and Anthropometric (1891) made his reputation as the first proponent of Jewish race science.[4]
In 1888, he prepared with Lucien Wolf the Bibliotheca Anglo-Judaica: A Bibliographical Guide to Anglo-Jewish History, and in 1890, he edited English Fairy Tales, the first of his series of books of fairy tales published during the next 10 years. He wrote many literary articles for the Athenaeum, which published in 1891 the collection, George Eliot, Matthew Arnold, Browning, Newman, Essays and Reviews from the Athenaeum. In the same year appeared his Studies in Jewish Statistics, in 1892, Tennyson and "In Memoriam", and in 1893, his important book on The Jews of Angevin England. In 1894, were published his Studies in Biblical archaeology, and An Inquiry into the Sources of the History of the Jews in Spain, in connection with which he was made a corresponding member of the Royal Academy of History of Madrid. His historical novel dealing with the life of Jesus, As Others Saw Him: A Retrospective A.D. 54, was published anonymously in 1895, in the following year his Jewish Ideals and other Essays came out. In this year, he was invited to the United States of America to give a course of lectures on the "Philosophy of Jewish History". The Story of Geographical Discovery was published towards the end of 1898 and ran into several editions. He had been compiling and editing the Jewish Year Book since 1896, and was president of the Jewish Historical Society of England in 1898-99.
In 1900, he accepted an invitation to become revising editor of the Jewish Encyclopedia, which was then being prepared at New York. He settled permanently in the United States, where he wrote many articles for the Jewish Encyclopedia, and was generally responsible for the style of the whole publication. It was completed in 1906.
He then became registrar and professor of English at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in New York.
In 1908, he was appointed a member of the board of seven, which made a new English translation of the Bible for the Jewish Publication Society of America.
In 1913, he resigned his positions at the seminary to become editor of the American Hebrew.
In 1920, Book I of his Jewish Contributions to Civilization, which was practically finished at the time of his death, was published at Philadelphia.
In addition to the books already mentioned, Jacobs edited The Fables of Aesop as First Printed by Caxton (1889), Painter's Palace of Pleasure (1890), Baltaser Gracian's Art of Worldly Wisdom (1892), Howell's Letters (1892), Barlaam and Josaphat (1896), The Thousand and One Nights (6 vols, 1896), and others. Jacobs was also a contributor to the Encyclopædia Britannica, and James Hastings' Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics.
Folklore[edit]




Illustration of "A Legend of Knockmany" by John D. Batten for Celtic Fairy Tales (1892)


Jacobs edited the journal Folklore from 1899 to 1900 and from 1890 to 1916 he edited multiple collections of fairy tales that were published with distinguished illustrations by John Dickson Batten: English Fairy Tales, Celtic Fairy Tales, Indian Fairy Tales, More English Fairy Tales, More Celtic Fairy Tales (all 1890 to 1895) and Europa's Fairy Book (also issued as European Folk and Fairy Tales) in 1916.[5] He was inspired in this by the Brothers Grimm and the romantic nationalism common in folklorists of his age; he wished English children to have access to English fairy tales, whereas they were chiefly reading French and German tales;[6] in his own words, "What Perrault began, the Grimms completed."
Although he collected many tales under the name of fairy tales, many of them are unusual sorts of tales. Binnorie (in English Fairy Tales)[7] and Tamlane (in More English Fairy Tales)[8] are prose versions of ballads, The Old Woman and Her Pig (in English Fairy Tales) is a nursery rhyme, Henny-Penny (in English Fairy Tales) is a fable, and The Buried Moon (in More English Fairy Tales) has mythic overtones to an extent unusual in fairy tales. According to his own analysis of English Fairy Tales, "Of the eighty-seven tales contained in my two volumes, thirty-eight are Märchen proper, ten sagas or legends, nineteen drolls, four cumulative stories, six beast tales, and ten nonsense stories."[9]

Sure tap dances around questions and issues. She sounds like Tweetybird talking to preschoolers. Spicer, who couldn’t seem nicer, back peddling answers. Then there’s Steve Banban, formerly of Blightbarf Noose. He’s the rump in Trump.  And Trump has been grating America for years. I think he initially ran to save his businesses.Woody Guthrie, who lived in Queens, N.Y. wrote a song about his terrible landlord, Fred Trump. I heard that from Arlo at an interview.  “Those who cannot remember History are condemned to repeat it.” Santayna“History repeats itself.” A Proverb“History is bunk.” Henry Ford“Just the facts, ma’am, just the facts.” Joe FridayWe know that the worst economic crashes in the last hundred and fifty years happened during Republican administrations of Hoover and George W. Bush. We know that we have a boom/bust economy. So I was curious to look back and read who was in charge during other busts.  My sources were a 2009 World Almanac and "The People's Chronology ", by James Trager. Republican Pres. U.S.Grant…1869 Wall Street “Black Friday” ruins small investors and gold speculation destroys half of the banks and businesses in New York.1873…”Congressional investigating committee states that the country is becoming filled with gigantic corporations commanding great influence and power in state legislatures and the Nation. (Lincoln warned the same during his time in office.) September, another “Black Friday”, causes 5,000 businesses to fail, millions of workers depend on soup kitchens, tens of thousands close to starvation. 10,500 businesses fail by 1878.Republican Pres. Rutherford B. Hayes…1879…Economist Henry George states that while the Country is getting richer and richer, most Americans are getting poorer and poorer.Republican. Pres. Benjamin Harrison.…1890…Wall Street Panic. 1892 Economic depression starts, leading to Market collapse. 600 banks close, 15,000 businesses fail… It lasts 4 years.Republican. Pres. Teddy Roosevelt…1901…Wall Street Panic…1907 Economic Crisis. 1908…Banks close as depression continues.Republican. Pres.Warren Harding…1921…20,000 businesses fail. 3.5 million out of work. Republican. Pres. Calvin Coolidge…1923… business improves until 1929…So far the only good economy under a Republican.Republican. Pres Herbert Hoover…1929… Depression starts, banks close, unemployment increases and it gets worse year by year, 15 million by the time Dem. Pres. F.D.R. comes into office and comes to the aid of the working class with safeguards that have served the American people for decades. Safeguards Republicans would like to do away with for decades.Republican. Pres. D.D.Eisenhower…1958…Economic recession, great unemployment, 20% of Americans below the poverty line.Democratic. Pres. Lyndon Johnson…1968…U.S. Economy and mergers boom and continue until 1971 when Rep. Pres. Nixon begins various bad economic policies.Republican. Pres. Richard M. Nixon… Reckless Savings&Loan deals cost tax payers $150 Billion. 1984…Continental Illinois Bank avoids failure with a $4.5 billion federal loan guarantee. Biggest run on bank since 1929 threatens a chain reaction of bank closings. Public confidence in banks declines. Collapse of oil prices affects Texas and Oklahoma banks and savings institutions, Ohio bank fails causing run on other banks. 70 Thrifts are closed in panic. Federal regulators take over a Beverly Hills Savings&Loan due to deregulation signed by Reagan and budget cuts that reduced regulators. 1985…U.S. debt tops 2 trillion, up I trillion since 1981, weakening dollar. National debt triples by 1988 under Reagan. High trade deficit and budget deficit. 1988 S&L losses $13.44 billion.Republican. Pres. George H.W.Bush…1989 Bails out S&Ls at tax payers expense. Commercial banks are jeopardized. Dow Jones Industrials drops 190.58 in October. 1990. “Read my lips, no new taxes.” $160 billion budget deficit. Supply side economics of Reagan years has piled up huge debt, while creating a false boom. Country goes into recession. Bush lost reelection: “It’s the Economy,stupid.”)Democratic. Pres Bill Clinton…Reduces National debt by $500 billion and creates a boom economy.Republican. Pres Georg W. Bush… Briefly, increases debt and causes worst crash since 1929.Democratic. Pres Barak H. Obama, saves the economy from disaster.It seems that Republicans are bad for business and Democrats are good for business and workers. Conservatives(Cons) versus Progressives(Pros) Pros are better than Cons. For a healthy Economy.I don’t remember who said:” I can’t wait for the Democrats to get into office so that I can live like a Republican, again.”  Even Trump has said that the Economy is better under Democrats. Both Bush presidents were late responding to hurricanes. No FEMA head as of June 2017. Where do you live?  The first action by the Con controlled Congress was to try to get rid of The Congressional Ethics Office. Leading to questionable confirmations. Ethics gets lost in laissez faire    Laissez faire, unregulated business is bound to have the same dangers as a city without cops…like a Wild West movie, where the town’s rich guy owns most of the town, the sheriff and the Judge. Allowing for greater corruption, fraud, dangerous products, various harms to workers and consumers. Things don’t go better with Koch. There are no safety nets in the Con Circus, just a bunch of clowns who keep botching up the works. If the public has a low opinion of the politics of inaction and politicians, one can clearly point to the Republican Party since Reagan. The Koch brothers had a meeting with judges from all over the U.S. Was Gorsuch there?  Newt Gingrich, when he was Speaker of the House, handed out a list of 40 or more words to use to demean and ridicule Liberals. What are the words we can use to expose and devalue Cons? Obstructionists, Heartless, Constipoidal, Rigid, Discriminatory, Know Nothings………………………..If a man accuses all others of lying and keeps accusing others of lying, shouldn’t we be pretty clear on who is the liar. “If you once forfeit the confidence of your fellow citizens, you can never regain their respect or esteem. It is true that you may fool some of the people some of the time; you can even fool some of the people all of the time; but you can’t fool all the people all of the time.” Abe Lincoln. But the Republican Party is no longer the party of Lincoln. Not when it comes to voting rights or Justice to the Afro-American community. Never mind health, education, women’s health and safety nets. Nor are they inclusive. They are stuck in nineteenth century Originalism that doesn’t deal with the present or plan for the future world realities.“Fake Media?” The Media gave Trump unending coverage due to his tactless remarks. You don’t bite the hand that feeds you. Of course the Media will cast a light on his lies.When the centrist Media is accused of slanting the news, why not point to government hating AM talk jocks and their conspiracy theories and fear mongering. Back to History: In the 1930s Big biz execs sat at a round table to discuss how strike breaking, the use of violence against workers wasn’t working and hurting their corporate reputations. Someone who was doing business with Nazi Germany, brought up Propaganda Minister Goebbels and how he uses the radio waves to brainwash the people…”You keep repeating a lie until people begin to believe it.” With deregulation in the 80s Con networks were formed on AM radio to discredit and make Government fearful, evil…” Government isn’t the answer, it’s the problem.” Reagan would stress as he doubled the public debt.    “A Dictatorship is a lazy Democracy.” My Public High School history teacher.​   How do we  reach the 54% of eligible voters who didn’t vote and the folks who vote against their best interests. We need some civics education and talk about what the Constitution means by tranquility, justice and welfare. Those are not Cons concerns. The dumbing of America has to be countered. Let us keep proving the best of the Pros and discounting the Cons cons. How do you assuage the trumped up fear and brain washing that’s been going unanswered? How do we counter hate and fear of the Government?Connect the dots…Exxon CEO, Rex Tillerson, worked out a half trillion dollar oil deal with Putin and now he’s Sec. of State( with the urging of Jim Baker and Candy Rice, who do they lobby for?). Obama put a sanction on that deal after the Russian crimes in Crimea and Ukraine. Trump had advisors who worked with or had Russian contacts. The Russian interference of the election was a trade worth billions to who, Trump, Sessions, Manaford? Who owns Exxon stocks? That’s $500,000,000,000. Follow the money…I predict that if Trump doesn't give the Russians what they expect they will expose him before the F.B.I. does.If you owned a business, would you hire someone who hated it? Who planned to dismantle it and cripple it? Businesses fail, Governments can’t afford to.Tense about Pense, he is Con squared. He would be even worse.If you don’t believe in science, sigh. If you don’t support our culture and the Arts, Ugh! If your greed ignores need, barf!    Cons will always change the subject and constantly and loudly interrupt any question or statement that sheds bad light on one of their issues... The House passed a health bill that sounds like it was written by the insurance and drug lobbies. Health does not belong in the marketplace. It is part of the welfare stressed in the Constitution. More  hypocrisy  than Hippocratic ethics, even more, considering that several Con legislators were doctors! Cons hate entitlements. God asked us to heal the sick, care for the widowed and help the poor, but Cons follow Ayn Rand rather than God. If charities can't handle it all, if the states don't, then it has to be picked up by the Federal Government or we become a second World nation. Let’s stop talking about Gun “Control.” Let’s talk about gun regulations. “Control” scares those who have been brainwashed and fearful of government. If we had an epidemic that was killing 10,000 people most governments would go into action. We have an epidemic that killed 33,000 people in 2016. It is a blemish on the American psyche and soul. Pro Choice vs. Pro Life. "God breathed into Adam and Adam became a living soul." Makes it perfectly clear that life begins with breath, when the soul enters the body. AND...In Numbers 11:11 God speaks to Moses and tells him about an abortion procedure if a man believes that his wife is  pregnant by another man. Is not a woman's heath and well being be as important?   The religious right votes on this issue with the Cons. What about the abortion of the environment...God's creation for us?Isn’t Afghanistan the biggest grower of opium? Is that why we stayed so long?I COMMENTALLEY VIEW                                       9-11-2015...An act of GodAs always, American security was on alert on 9-11-2015. Fortune had it that the only disaster happened in Mecca. A huge construction crane crashed onto the Mosque, killing over a hundred and seriously injuring over 300. It was a ten second News item. None of the reporters mentioned that the Mosque was built by Osama bin Laden's father.    Saw an AD in a Tech Magazine a few years ago, don't remember the product, but it was prophetic...WW I                   WW II                   WWW                                                                                        We are living in a time when physics is confirming what ancient Metaphysical precepts knew. Science and religion seem to agree more. Let me add some of my own observations:  The Big Bang Theory...The Hebrew Bible states that..."darkness was upon the face of the deep...And God said 'Let there be light'. And there was light"                                            ................Evolution..."Rebecca conceived...there were twins in her womb. And the first came forth ruddy, all over like a hairy mantle..." (that was Esau, a hunter)...And Jacob was a quiet man and dwelling in tents" (civilized). Humanity moved from crude,impulsive hunter to smart, spiritual Sheppard.                                           *******************                                        E=MC(squared)...My take is the...  Eternal, Enlightened, Evolutionary, Enabling, Energy = Mass Creativity Scudded​  The Afghan war is the first Just war since WW II, sometimes war is unavoidable and even necessary...we are at war and what we need is to fight it smarter, with special forces, international police action and electronically, not just send in the troops and materiel.We Americans won the Revolution because we weren't regimented like the Redcoats...we learned guerrilla warfare from our Native Americans...we are now fighting like the Redcoats against a guerrilla army...we need new ways to deal with these undeveloped mentalities, who still live in the past...By the way, the word assassin is of Arabic derivation.We are at war and we need to understand that and own it...and, perhaps work for peace starting with ourselves...A client knocked me out with a comment I want to share: "You've gotta get out of the box to see the instructions."Yup, we are born into this life, this school, without a curriculum. Fortunately the cards reveal our lessons.We all have people or external conditions that can bring up anger...Jefferson said that when he got angry he counted to ten and when he got very, very angry he counted to a hundred...I have tried to remember that, not always in time. One thing that has worked for me when I get upset or angry is to mumble to myself, "Soften the belly...soften the belly."Whenever I sense toxic energies or psychic attacks around me I have a prayer/chant that clears it up...sometimes I burn sage as well when I say this prayer...let me share it with you:       In the name of divine Love, unalterable and eternal.       In the name of divine Knowledge, unalterable and eternal.       In the name of divine Values, unalterable and eternal.       In the name of divine Wisdom, unalterable and eternal.       In the name of divine Creativity, action, principle and work...in which we move and                have our being; in the name of the power, glory and grace of the living word....           yod-he-vav-he   (substitute the name of your deity)        May all evil and every thought inspired by evil be scattered and reduced to nothing...Amen...Note: yod he vav he are the four letters of the Hebrew name of God.If, as I stated before my summer escape,  worry is the absence of choice, how do we choose wisely? Lets take a look at our mental influences...Anthropologist Margaret Mead, wrote of three kinds of societies and, naturally, various combinations of the three.Those that look to the past for their answers..."Listen to your elders,"...  "The past is prelude to the future,"..."History repeats itself"...Religious writings...our parents and teachers...Those that learn from the present...Contemporary influences...Guys from guys...gals from gals...tots from tots...teens from teens...Being alert and mindful (as I often suggest)...Those that learn from the needs of the future...We learn from our young...When I was reluctant to go to college, my father said, " You better, or else you won't be able to talk to your kids." Science and mathematical probabilities indicate our need for preparedness and action...Our Health work and Wealth security.The dangers of looking for answers and living in the past, like Theocracies and their subsequent dictatorships, or past dysfunctional experiences, lead to rigidity, fear of progress and, repression of the feminine and denial of feelings, the dehumanization of the "other"...DenialLiving in the now, being mindful is "where it's at"...sure...BUT the dangers of living in the now only lead to...hedonism, me-ism and all sorts of depersonalization, being unprepared, neglectful, and, again, denial...Living for the future only...'I'll do it when I have time...when I retire", like those who invested and lost retirement and time...Dreams without action...Manana...and more denial.It seems to me that a healthy respect for the past, (or making peace with it) and using what is relevant to present understanding and knowledge and with an eye to the needs of the future is an ongoing balancing act and combination of perspectives that aid in choices we need to make...Samuel Champlain, the French seaman, explorer and founder of Quebec had no formal education, and yet, was a close friend and confidante of the French King...He was extremely smart in governing the part of Canada he ran. He said he used 'prevoyance', in other words, he looked to the needs of the future in dealing with native Canadians and the new settlers...We need politicians like that NOW!!!!!!!But...we live in worrisome times and we are often confronted by personal worries...Worry can linger and run around in a kind of circular thinking that runs around in our heads like a looped announcement...Unexamined worry can be as toxic as hate, anger, envy,etc...and block solutions and eat you up...There are two ways to deal with worry, either there is nothing you can do about it or something can be done. If there is nothing you can do about it...nature acting up, a major sun flare, terrorism, the Economy...Accept your powerlessness, but secure your residence and car with food and water and things you need to survive for at least a month...In other words take actions...it is what you do that gets you beyond the worry...Oh, yes, the Economy, or absence thereof, it IS giving us an opportunity to re-evaluate what our most important needs are, to prioritize our needs, to examine our value system and our System's values...If there is something that can be done, that is within your power  to do...why,worry ?I always say,  "Worry is the absence of choice...worry is the absence of action."So...if you find yourself in a worry fix, fix it by "doing an accounting"... on paper or PC and look at the asset and debit of each action that can solve the problem. See it in black and white...And take action. Be aware that one choice leads to others...How do we choose? What guides our choices? Coming soon to your PC...We sometimes torture ourselves over something we said or didn't say, something we've done or haven't done...STOP!....It is against the Law to torture your self or anyone else!​ This is a non-denominational page, but here is my last Rabbi story:Rabbi Zusia lay dying and his students surrounded him to give comfort and to hear what last wisdom's may be said...One student asked, " Rabbi, what do you fear most in the world to come, when you pass over?"Zusia said, " That I may be asked, ' Why weren't you Zusia'."So, be yourself, be who you are and be at peace with yourself. If you want to improve your self or your situation, the first thing is to accept who and where you are before you work An ancient Rabbi once said that there were 5 steps to wisdom...the first is Quiet...the second is Listen...the third is Learn...the fourth is Do!...the fifth is Teach ( Share, I guess )I share this with you now, because we all live in difficult times, because we all need to make sense of things and because materialism...buy now-pay-later...he who has the most toys wins..."supporting built in obsolescence"...doesn't soothe the soul. It is a time for re-evaluating our value system. What is really important...We don't take or allow ourselves enough quiet time...we don't harken to our still voice...we don't mull things over enough...we don't take action from our higher self enough...we don't share enough...Enough for now....COMMENTALLEY  VIEW                                                                                                  I remembered a line in the play/movie, "Teahouse of the August moon", the houseboy looks at the audience and says that life can be very painful, "...but pain makes Man think...thought makes Man wise and wisdom makes life endurable."Rummaging through the alley of my thoughts and research, I found a wonderful affirmation  that can be useful from time to time...                                    I CHOOSE A NEW LIFE...I forgive myself for all mistakes and confusions of the past. I wipe the slate clean and begin anew. The Perfect Power within expresses through me right thoughts and attitudes that produce right actions in my life...I choose a new life today... And so it is.                                                                                                                              ******For affirmations to work there has to be an equal belief of mind and heart to work...in other words, Science of Mind, as well as, Science of Heart. When thought and emotion agree affirmations can manifest...But...We often think one thing, while feeling another way, while speaking, yet something else. We are often in conflict with ourselves even before we come in contact with others. So, how can there be Peace on Earth?I have long believed that life is resolving a series of ambivalence...In the film, "The Colonel and Me," with Danny Kaye and Curt Jurgens, two very different people meet in times of trouble. The Kaye character always solves problems by saying, " Well, there are two possibilities...Either things will improve or they won't...If things improve, why worry...If things don't improve, there are two possibilities...Either we can fix it or we can't...If we fix it, why worry, if we can't fix it, well,  there are two possibilities..."...and so on...We can't be at Peace until we resolve our ambivalences, accept other points of view, fix our fixations and stop demonizing others' religious or political beliefs...                                                   ***************                 A saying, poem, lyric or book can sometimes shake your being and consciousness forever...the following one quaked me awake thirty years ago..." If I am not for myself, who will be for me ?  If I am for myself alone, what am I ?  And if not now, when? "                    Rabbi Hillel, circa 100 B.C.E.When Hillel was asked to sum up the Bible's teaching, he responded, " What is distasteful to you, do not do to another."Let me parse the above...If I am not for myself...conservative...If I am for myself alone...progressive...And if not now...AMERICAN...                                                              *******Several radio interviews ago on "COAST to COAST with George Noory", I wanted to point out something special and mystical about AMERICA that opened up a whole new unexpected topic.    I mentioned that I pondered one day that if 11 & 22 are Master numbers in numerology, what about 111...222...333 ? I kept going, adding until I reached 1776...Wham! another conscious quake. But that isn't all, all those numbers from 111 to 1776 are divisible by 37...Bam! another Ahaaa...because in the system I  work with, July 4th has a 37 value...From a mystic point of view that's not coincidence, that is a meant to be.George Noory then opened up a whole new aspect...he mentioned that he often sees the numbers 111 or 1111, I said I often see 444...that started callers mentioning seeing different combos of 3 and 4 like numbers...that started lots of questions on the meaning...An Angel communication? I say, yes. But what is the meaning of 111 as apposed to 1111. Numerology would say that 111 is "express yourself" or " choose your expressions wisely"  and 1111 would suggest " organize and build your expressions"....But rummaging through the alley of my old research and study I found the following...                                              YOUR ANGEL MESSAGE NUMBERS111...Successful changes and communications1111...Favorable long distance contacts.222...Secure yourself.2222...Reconcile differences.333...Unity brings success.3333...Progress is successful.444...Reflect and internalize.4444...A necessary journey.555...Be determined.5555...Regulate and bring order.666...Sense urges need calming...6666...Abundances needs care.777...Overcome your limitations.7777...Avoid intrigue, fraud & quarrels888...Public work.

Quote
“As you know, church publishing houses rarely do a great job with Preschool curriculum. Your “Growing With God” Preschool Bible Study puts everything easily at hand. As I read it I can see preschool teachers using it in their classrooms, Sunday School leaders using it in church and parents using it at home.” Barb Torgerson, Retired Christian School Teacher and Principal



Use at Home or School Over a Week
When using a lesson at home, in a preschool or daycare you may choose use the lesson throughout the week. A great way to start each day is with a prayer. I have provided several preschool level prayers for you in the lesson, or if you are comfortable praying with preschoolers you can create your own. Here’s how you can use the lesson activities throughout a week. Day One Use the memory verse coloring sheet. While coloring the sheet you will be indirectly introducing the Bible story in the lesson to your preschooler(s). Day Two Bring back out the memory verse coloring sheet and talk about it, and then sing the song with the finger movements. You can continue singing the song throughout the day and week. Day Three It is Bible story and Q&A time! Before or after you read the story review the memory verse coloring sheet and sing the song while doing the finger movements. Day Four Do the fun and educational art & craft project. Day Five and Beyond! For day five and other days use any of the activities for the extra content.

From the Back Cover:
                                                Rewrittenand reorganized, this new edition weaves together the most recent scholarship, the most current thinking in art history, and the most innovative online supplements, including digital art library.Experience the new Janson and re-experience the history of art. Long established as the classic and seminal introduction to art of the Western world, the Eighth Edition ofJanson's History of Artis groundbreaking. When Harry Abrams first published theHistory of Artin 1962, John F. Kennedy occupied the White House, and Andy Warhol was an emerging artist.  Janson offered his readers a strong focus on Western art, an important consideration of technique and style, and a clear point of view.The History of Art, said Janson, was not just a stringing together of historically significant objects, but the writing of a story about their interconnections, a history of styles and of stylistic change. Janson's text focused on the visual and technical characteristics of the objects he discussed, often in extraordinarily eloquent language. Janson'sHistory of Arthelped to establish the canon of art history for many generations of scholars.
