Mr. Saltz has served as a director of American Outdoor Brands Corporation (formerly Smith & Wesson Holding Corporation), a leading provider of firearms and quality products for the shooting, hunting, and rugged outdoor enthusiast, whose stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, since October 1998 and previously served as its Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer from February 1998 through December 2003. Mr. Saltz has served as the Chairman and Managing Partner of Southwest Capital Partners, LLC, an investment banking firm, since 2009. Mr. Saltz founded Saf-T-Hammer in 1987, which developed and marketed firearm safety and security products designed to prevent the unauthorized access to firearms, which acquired Smith & Wesson Corp. from Tomkins, PLC in May 2001 and changed its name to American Outdoor Brands Corporation. We believe Mr. Saltz's history as a founder of one of our predecessors and his financial, investment, and management experience provide the requisite qualifications, skills, perspectives, and experience that make him well qualified to serve on our Board of Directors.
