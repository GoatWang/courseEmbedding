Lands' End's Handpicked Ceo Ousted - tribunedigital-chicagotribune




 



Lands' End's Handpicked Ceo OustedOctober 29, 1998|By Susan Chandler, Tribune Staff Writer.Lands' End Inc. Chairman Gary Comer likes people to believe that he is sailing the world, far from the day-to-day concerns of the Dodgeville, Wis.-based catalog company he founded in 1963. Customers can even track Comer's course on the Lands' End Web site.But Comer, 70, was firmly back in control Wednesday as the cataloger tossed overboard Chief Executive Michael J. Smith. Also thrown over the side was William E. Ferry, Lands' End's vice chairman of sales and a veteran who played a major role in building the $1.3 billion company before it went public.Taking the helm as chief executive and president is David Dyer, a former Lands' End vice chairman who left the company in 1994 for Home Shopping Network in Florida.The changes come after two choppy quarters for Lands' End. Profits are sagging, inventories are ballooning and debt is soaring. The company's share price, meanwhile, has fallen almost 60 percent since February, to around $18."Obviously, Comer has a pretty heavy hand. It's a very negative thing for a company like Lands' End to have three presidents in five years," said Maxwell Sroge, an Evanston-based catalog consultant.Just four years ago, Smith, then 34, was Comer's handpicked successor after the board ousted CEO William End, a veteran catalog executive from L.L. Bean who had shaken up Lands' End's culture by acquiring other catalogs and pushing aside some company veterans.Smith's youth and lack of experience outside Lands' End led many industry players to think he was just a figurehead for Comer, a charge Smith always denied.Smith's marching orders from Comer, who controls 55 percent of Lands' End stock, were to take the company back to its roots by focusing on high-quality casual clothing and top-drawer customer service.He took to the task with fervor. During his tenure, Smith divested specialty catalogs, including Montbell America and The Territory Ahead. And just this month, he put Willis & Geiger, a specialty book of apparel and gear for outdoor adventurers, on the block.Smith also made an expensive bet to boost the catalog's in-stock order fulfillment rate to 90 percent, an unheard-of figure for the catalog industry, experts say. But that wager hasn't paid off.At the end of the second quarter, Lands' End's inventory had expanded 47 percent to $318 million, while its short-term borrowings increased almost tenfold, to $177 million from $18 million a year earlier.Lands' End, a traditionally tight-lipped company, says that the company's recent stumbles weren't the reason Smith and Ferry had to go."When the board looks at where we're going from here, they see economic uncertainty both here and abroad, and the core business is still problematic," said spokeswoman Charlotte LaComb. "They felt the best choice to deal with these long-term problems was Dave Dyer."Neither Dyer nor Smith were available for comment.After parting ways with Home Shopping Network, Dyer, 49, has been working as a consultant for J. Crew Group while the casual apparel cataloger searches for a permanent chief executive.Dyer is known as a good merchant and experienced manager, according to industry sources. He will need both those qualities, they say, as he competes against a bevy of energized purveyors of casual clothing such as Gap, Abercrombie & Fitch and American Eagle Outfitters, not to mention Lands' End's traditional catalog competition, Eddie Bauer and L.L. Bean.
