HINTO ENERGY, INC.





Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the Six Months Ended June 30, 2014 and 2013



(Unaudited)



NOTE 1 - BUSINESS, BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES




Business



Hinto Energy,  Inc. ("the Company") was incorporated in February 13, 1997 in the
state of Wyoming. The Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary,  South Uintah Gas
Properties,  Inc. are involved in the acquisition and development of oil and gas
prospects  in the rocky  mountain  region.  The  Company has oil and gas leases,
wells and new drilling prospects in both Utah and Montana.


The  Company's  fiscal  year  end is  December  31st.  The  Company's  financial
statements  are  presented  on  the  accrual  basis  of  accounting  under  GAAP
(Generally Accepted Accounting Principles).



Basis of Presentation




Consolidation



The accompanying audited consolidated  financial statements include the accounts
of Hinto  Energy,  Inc.  and its  wholly  owned  subsidiary,  South  Uintah  Gas
Properties,  Inc.  (collectively the "Company").  All intercompany  balances and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.



Interim Presentation



In the opinion of the  management  of the Company,  the  accompanying  unaudited
consolidated  financial statements include all material  adjustments,  including
all normal and recurring adjustments, considered necessary to present fairly the
financial  position  and  operating  results  of the  Company  for  the  periods
presented. The financial statements and notes do not contain certain information
included in the Company's  financial  statements for the year ended December 31,
2013. It is the Company's opinion that when the interim financial statements are
read in conjunction with the December 31, 2013 Audited Financial Statements, the
disclosures  are  adequate to make the  information  presented  not  misleading.
Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year or any
future period.



NOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES




Use of Estimates



The  preparation  of the  financial  statements in  conformity  with  accounting
principles   generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America  requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and  liabilities  and disclosure of contingent  assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial  statements  and the reported  amounts of revenues and
expenses  during the reporting  periods.  Actual results could differ from those
estimates.



Cash and Cash Equivalents



The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of
three months or less and money market instruments to be cash equivalents.

Property and Equipment



Property and  equipment  are stated at cost less  accumulated  depreciation  and
amortization.  Depreciation is computed  principally on the straight-line method
over the  estimated  useful life of each type of asset which ranges from five to
seven  years.  Maintenance  and  repairs  are  charged to  expense as  incurred;
improvements  and betterments are  capitalized.  Upon retirement or disposition,
the related costs and  accumulated  depreciation  are removed from the accounts,
and any resulting gains or losses are credited or charged to income.

Oil and Gas Properties, Full Cost Method



The Company uses the full cost method of  accounting  for oil and gas  producing
activities.  Costs to acquire mineral  interests in oil and gas  properties,  to
drill and equip exploratory wells used to find proved reserves, and to drill and
equip  development  wells including  directly related overhead costs and related
asset retirement costs are capitalized.


Under this method,  all costs,  including  internal  costs  directly  related to
acquisition,  exploration and development  activities are capitalized as oil and
gas  property  costs.   Properties  not  subject  to  amortization   consist  of
exploration and development costs which are evaluated on a  property-by-property
basis.  Amortization of these unproved property costs begins when the properties
become  proved  or their  values  become  impaired.  The  Company  assesses  the
realization  of unproved  properties,  taken as a whole,  if any, on at least an
annual basis or when there has been an indication  that  impairment in value may
have  occurred.   Impairment  of  unproved   properties  is  assessed  based  on
management's  intention  with regard to future  exploration  and  development of
individually  significant  properties  and the  ability of the Company to obtain
funds  to  finance  such  exploration  and  development.  If the  results  of an
assessment  indicate  that  the  properties  are  impaired,  the  amount  of the
impairment is added to the capitalized costs to be amortized.


Costs of oil and gas properties  will be amortized using the units of production
method.


The Company performs a quarterly  "ceiling test" calculation to test its oil and
gas properties for possible  impairment.  The primary components  impacting this
calculation are commodity prices, reserve quantities added and produced, overall
development costs,  depletion expense,  and tax effects.  If the net capitalized
cost of the  Company's  oil and gas  properties  subject  to  amortization  (the
carrying value) exceeds the ceiling  limitation,  the excess would be charged to
expense.  The  ceiling  limitation  is  equal  to the sum of the  present  value
discounted at 10% of estimated future net cash flows from proved  reserves,  the
cost of  properties  not being  amortized,  the lower of cost or estimated  fair
value of unproved  properties  included in the costs  being  amortized,  and all
related tax  effects.  At June 30,  2014,  the  calculated  value of the ceiling
limitation  exceeded the carrying  value of the Company's oil and gas properties
subject to the test, and no impairment was necessary.

Impairment



The Company  reviews  long-lived  assets held for use,  principally  oil and gas
leases, for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying
value may not be  recoverable.  Impairment  exists if the carrying amount of the
long-lived asset is not recoverable  from the  undiscounted  cash flows expected
from its use and eventual disposition. We determine the amount of the impairment
loss by comparing the carrying  value of the  long-lived  asset to its estimated
fair value. In the absence of quoted market prices, we determine  estimated fair
value generally based on the present value of future  probability  weighted cash
flows expected from the continued use and value at sale of the long-lived asset.



Revenue and Accounts Receivable



The  Company  recognizes  revenue for its  production  when the  quantities  are
delivered to, or collected by, the  purchaser.  Prices for such  production  are
generally  defined in sales  contracts  and are  readily  determinable  based on
certain publicly  available indices.  All  transportation  costs are included in
lease operating expenses.


Accounts  receivable  -- oil and natural gas sales  consist of  uncollateralized
accrued  revenues  due under normal trade  terms,  generally  requiring  payment
within 30 to 60 days of  production.  The Company  reviews  accounts  receivable
periodically  and reduces the  carrying  amount by a  valuation  allowance  that
reflects  its  best  estimate  of the  amount  that may not be  collectible.  No
valuation allowance was recognized as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013.



Dependence on Major Customers



During  the six  months  ended  June  30,  2014,  the  Company's  revenues  were
attributable  to sales of oil to two  customers.  During the year ended December
31,  2013,  the  Company's  revenues  were  attributable  to sales of oil to one
customer.  The Company believes that there are potential alternative  purchasers
and that it may be  necessary to establish  relationships  with new  purchasers.
However,  there  can  be no  assurance  that  the  Company  can  establish  such
relationships and that those relationships will result in an increased number of
purchasers.  Although the Company is exposed to a concentration  of credit risk,
the Company  believes that all of its purchasers are credit worthy.  The Company
had no bad debt at June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013.



Asset Retirement Obligations



Asset retirement obligations ("AROs") associated with the retirement of tangible
long-lived assets are recognized as liabilities with an increase to the carrying
amounts of the related long-lived assets in the period incurred. The cost of the
tangible asset,  including the asset  retirement  cost, is depreciated  over the
useful life of the asset. AROs are recorded at estimated fair value, measured by
reference  to  the  expected  future  cash  outflows  required  to  satisfy  the
retirement  obligations  discounted at the Company's  credit-adjusted  risk-free
interest  rate.  Accretion  expense is  recognized  over time as the  discounted
liabilities are accreted to their expected settlement value. If estimated future
costs  of AROs  change,  an  adjustment  is  recorded  to  both  the ARO and the
long-lived  asset.  Revisions  to  estimated  AROs can  result  from  changes in
retirement cost estimates, revisions to estimated inflation rates and changes in
the estimated timing of abandonment.

Net Loss per Share



Basic  net  loss  per  common  share  is  calculated  by  dividing  the net loss
applicable to common shares by the weighted  average number of common and common
equivalent shares  outstanding  during the period.  For the six and three months
ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, there were no potential common  equivalent  shares
used in the  calculation of weighted  average  common shares  outstanding as the
effect would be anti-dilutive because of the net loss.



Stock-Based Compensation



The Company adopted the provisions of and accounts for stock-based  compensation
using an estimate of value in accordance  with the fair value method.  Under the
fair value recognition  provisions of this statement,  stock-based  compensation
cost is  measured  at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is
recognized  as  expense on a  straight-line  basis  over the  requisite  service
period,  which  generally  is  the  vesting  period.  The  Company  elected  the
modified-prospective  method,  under  which  prior  periods  are not revised for
comparative  purposes.  The valuation method applies to new grants and to grants
that were outstanding as of the effective date and are subsequently modified.



Fair Value of Financial Instruments



The  Company's  financial  instruments,  including  cash and  cash  equivalents,
accounts  receivable,  accounts payable,  and notes payable are carried at cost,
which  approximates  fair  value  due  to  the  short-term   maturity  of  these
instruments.



Other Comprehensive Income



The Company has no material components of other comprehensive  income (loss) and
accordingly, net loss is equal to comprehensive loss in all periods.



Income Taxes



Provision for income taxes represents actual or estimated amounts payable on tax
return filings each year.  Deferred tax assets and  liabilities are recorded for
the estimated future tax effects of temporary  differences between the tax basis
of assets and  liabilities  and  amounts  reported in the  accompanying  balance
sheets,  and for  operating  loss and tax credit carry  forwards.  The change in
deferred  tax assets and  liabilities  for the period  measures the deferred tax
provision  or benefit for the period.  Effects of changes in enacted tax laws on
deferred  tax assets and  liabilities  are  reflected as  adjustment  to the tax
provision or benefit in the period of enactment.



Recent Accounting Pronouncements



There were accounting standards and interpretations issued during the six months
ended June 30, 2014, none of which are expected to have a material impact on the
Company's financial position, operations or cash flows.

NOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN AND MANAGEMENTS' PLAN



The Company's  unaudited  consolidated  financial  statements for the six months
ended June 30, 2014 and 2013 have been prepared on a going concern basis,  which
contemplates  the  realization of assets and the  settlement of liabilities  and
commitments in the normal course of business. The Company reported a net loss of
$891,582 for the six months ended June 30, 2014  ($334,164  for the three months
ended June 30, 2014),  and an  accumulated  deficit of $4,827,716 as of June 30,
2014.


The  future  success  of the  Company  is  dependent  on its  ability to attract
additional  capital,  or to find an  acquisition  to add  value  to its  present
shareholders  and  ultimately,  upon its  ability to develop  future  profitable
operations.  There can be no assurance  that the Company will be  successful  in
obtaining  such  financing,  or that it will  attain  positive  cash  flow  from
operations. Management believes that actions presently being taken to revise the
Company's operating and financial  requirements  provide the opportunity for the
Company to continue as a going concern.

Natural Buttes




The Company  purchased a farmout of deep right interests in approximately  5,366
gross and 4,887 net acres in the  central  part of the  Uintah  Basin at Natural
Buttes in Utah during July 2011 such purchase  agreement was amended in December
2011. The final purchase price of the farmout interest was $478,200,  made up of
$303,000 in cash,  $175,000 in notes payable and $200 in common stock (2,000,000
shares.)  The upper zones above  approximately  9,800 feet are  precluded in the
farmout and the overall targets will be zones from 9,800 feet to 16,000 feet.


During  the six months  ended  June 30,  2014,  the  Company  did not expend any
development  costs in connection  with the  re-working of this well. The Company
has not abandoned the well,  rather  management  refocused it re-work efforts on
those  properties that are oil producing and closer to revenue  production.  The
well is connected to a pipeline and produces gas,  thereby  holding the lease by
production. The Company intends to focus efforts on the well during 2014.

NOTE 6 - NOTES PAYABLES, OTHER



On July 15,  2011,  as part of the  purchase of the Natural  Buttes  properties,
South Uintah entered into two promissory notes. The first was for $100,000 had a
term of the  earlier of July 5, 2013 or the  completion  of a $2  Million  stock
offering. The second note was for $250,000, had a due date of July 5, 2013 and a
conversion rate of $5 per share. Both notes were non-interesting bearing.


In December  2011,  as part of the  amendment of the purchase  agreement for the
Natural Buttes, the terms and the amounts of the notes were modified. The amount
of the $100,000  note was reduced to $75,000 and the due date changed to July 5,
2013.  The $250,000  note was reduced to  $100,000,  the  conversion  rate of $5
removed and the due date of the note  remained at July 5, 2013.  At December 31,
2013,  the Company owed $100,000  under the note.  In January 2014,  the Company
negotiated  a discharge  of the  $100,000  note for $50,000 and paid the note in
full.


In July 2012, the Company  re-negotiated  the terms of the original $75,000 note

NOTE 7 - LONG TERM NOTE PAYABLES, CONVERTIBLE




$2 Million Convertible Promissory Note




On January 22, 2014, the Company issued a Secured Convertible Promissory Note in
exchange for cash of $2,000,000 in order to support  continuing  operations  and
the Company's re-completion and drilling plans in its oil and gas fields in Utah
and Montana.


The  Secured  Convertible  Promissory  Note  has a term of 3 years  and  accrues
interest at a rate of 10% per annum with quarterly interest payments starting in
July 2014. The Note is convertible  into shares of the Company's common stock at
a rate of $1.25 per share.  Since the stock  price was below this at the time of
signing  the note was  issued at a  premium  so no value is  apportioned  to the
conversion  feature when recording the issuance per ASC 470-20-05.  The debt and
its interest are reported as if it were a nonconvertible  debt. Upon Conversion,
the stock may be valued at either the book value or the market  value.  The Note
has provisions for issuance of up to 480,000 warrants  exercisable for shares of
the Company's common stock,  such warrants to be issued to the Note holder based
on the  amount of note  principal  converted  into  common  stock,  if any.  The
warrants,  if  issued,  would have a term of 3 years  from the  issuance  of the
promissory note and an exercise price of $2.00 per share.


The Note is secured by the assets  consisting of the Company's  leases and wells
in Musselshell County, Montana.


During the six months  ended June 30,  2014,  the  Company  accrued  interest of
$64,658 in connection with the note.



Class A Convertible Promissory Notes




During the year ended  December 31, 2013, the Company issued its Class A Secured
Convertible  Promissory  Notes  ("Class A  Promissory  Notes") in  exchange  for
$75,000, used to support ongoing operations. The Class A Promissory Notes have a
term of 3 years an  accrue  interest  at a rate of 12% per  annum.  The  Class A
Promissory  Notes are convertible into shares of the Company's common stock at a
rate of $1.00 per share.  In addition,  for every $5.00 in principal  converted,
the note holder will  receive a warrant to purchase  one (1) common share with a
purchase price of $2.00 per share. The Warrant would have a term of 3 years from
the issuance date of the Class A Promissory Note.


In December 2011, the Company, in exchange for cash, issued a $500,000,  secured
three-year note payable,  convertible at a $1 per share and bearing  interest at
10% per annum,  with interest payable  quarterly.  The note is secured by a well
bore held by South Uintah in the Natural  Buttes area.  During the quarter ended
June 30, 2013,  the Company  issued the holder a Class A Promissory  Note,  as a
replacement of the original note, with the terms described  above,  plus 100,000
warrants to purchase common shares with a purchase price of $2.00 per share. The
Warrant  would  have a term of 3 years  from the  issuance  date of the  Class A
Promissory Note.


At June 30,  2014,  the Company had $575,000 in  outstanding  Class A Promissory
Notes  and has  accrued  $22,190  in  interest  in  connection  with the Class A
Promissory Notes.

NOTE 8 - COMMITMENTS & CONTINGENCIES




Leases



The Company  sub-lets  furnished  office  space from a third party on a month to
month basis. The Company has  approximately  400 square feet and pays $1,000 per
month for the space.



General



There have been significant changes in the U.S. economy,  oil and gas prices and
the finance industry which have adversely affected and may continue to adversely
affect the  Company  in its  attempt to obtain  financing  or in its  process to
produce commercially feasible oil and gas production.


Federal,  state and local  authorities  regulate  the oil and gas  industry.  In
particular,  gas and oil  production  operations  and  economics are affected by
environmental  protection statutes,  tax statutes and other laws and regulations
relating to the petroleum  industry,  as well as changes in such laws,  changing
administrative regulations and the interpretations and application of such laws,
rules  and  regulations.  The  Company  believes  it is in  compliance  with all
federal, state and local laws, regulations, and orders applicable to the Company
and its properties and operations,  the violation of which would have a material
adverse effect on the Company or its financial condition.



Operating Hazards and Insurance



The gas and oil business  involves a variety of operating  risks,  including the
risk  of  fire,  explosions,   blow-outs,  pipe  failure,  abnormally  pressured
formation,  and environmental hazards such as oil spills, gas leaks, ruptures or
discharges  of toxic  gases,  the  occurrence  of any of which  could  result in
substantial  losses to the Company due to injury or loss of life,  severe damage
to or destruction  of property,  natural  resources and equipment,  pollution or
other environmental damage, cleanup  responsibilities,  regulatory investigation
and penalties and suspension of operations.


The  Company  to date  has not  acquired  its own  insurance  coverage  over its
interests in the  properties,  instead the Company has relied on the third party
operators  for its  properties  to maintain  insurance to cover its  operations;
however, the Company may purchase additional insurance coverage when necessary.


There can be no assurance that insurance,  if any, will be adequate to cover any
losses or exposure to liability. Although the Company believes that the policies
obtained by the third party operators  provide  coverage in scope and in amounts
customary in the industry,  they do not provide  complete  coverage  against all
operating  risks. An uninsured or partially  insured claim, if successful and of
significant  magnitude,  could have a material adverse effect on the Company and
its financial condition via its contractual liability to the prospect.


14






Title to Properties



The Company's  practice has been to acquire ownership or leasehold rights to oil
and natural gas  properties  from third parties.  Most of the Company's  current
operations are conducted on properties acquired from third parties. Our existing
rights are dependent on those previous third parties having obtained valid title
to the properties. Prior to the commencement of gas drilling operations on those
properties,  the third  parties  customarily  conduct a title  examination.  The
Company generally does not conduct  examinations of title prior to obtaining its
interests in its operations,  but rely on representations from the third parties
that they have good, valid and enforceable  title to the oil and gas properties.
Based upon the  foregoing,  we believe  that we have  satisfactory  title to our
producing properties in accordance with customary practices in the gas industry.
The  Company  is not  aware of any  title  deficiencies  as of the date of these
financial statements.

During the six months ended June 30, 2014,  the Company  issued 83,124 shares of
its restricted stock as a payment of $41,357 in interest on its outstanding long
term $500,000 convertible note payable.



Preferred Stock



On  August  18,  2011,  the  Company  filed  an  amendment  to the  Articles  of
Incorporation  with the  Secretary of State of Wyoming to  authorize  25,000,000
shares of Preferred  Shares to be  designated  in any series or classes and with
those rights,  privileges and  preferences to be determined at the discretion of
the Company's  Board of Directors.  At this time, the Company has not designated
any series of preferred stock or issued any shares of preferred stock.



Stock Option Plan



On August 17, 2011, the Company's  shareholders  approved the 2011 Hinto Energy,
Inc. Stock Option and Award  Incentive Plan ("Plan").  The Plan provides for the
grant of stock  options to  directors,  officers,  employees,  consultants,  and
advisors of the Company.  The Plan is administered by a committee  consisting of
members of the Board of  Directors  (the "Stock  Option  Committee"),  or in its
absence, the Board of Directors.


The Plan provides for a total of 2,000,000 shares of common stock to be reserved
for issuance  subject to options.  During the six months ended June 30, 2014 and
the year ended  December  31,  2013,  the Board did not approve the grant of any
options to purchase shares of common stock,  nor the conditions,  performance or
vesting requirements.

                                             ================== =================== ==================









Issuance



In May 2014, as part of a Consulting Agreement for one-year,  the Company issued
a warrant  exercisable  for 60,000  shares of the  Company's  restricted  common
stock.  The  warrant  has a term of 3 years and an  exercise  price of $0.65 per
share.  The  Warrant  has a  vesting  rate of  5,000  shares  per  month.  Using
Black-Scholes,  the Company  valued the warrant at $25,800 and is amortizing the
value of the warrant over the year period of the Consulting Agreement.


The fair value of the warrant  granted was  estimated as of the grant date using
the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:








Volatility                                  156%
Expected Warrant Term                       1.5 years
Risk-free interest rate                     0.09%
Expected dividend yield                     0.00%








The expected term of the options and warrants granted and sold were estimated to
be the contractual term. The expected  volatility was based on an average of the
volatility  disclosed based upon comparable  companies who had similar  expected
option terms.  The risk-free  rate was based on the one-year U.S.  Treasury bond
rate.



Expiration



On July 1, 2014, warrants  exercisable for a total of 3,900,000 shares at prices
ranging  from $3.00 to $1.00 and held by officers  and  directors of the Company
expired.



NOTE 10 - INCOME TAXES



The  Company is subject to domestic  income  taxes.  The Company has  recognized
minimal income during the six months ended June 30, 2014, and therefore has paid
no income tax.


16





Deferred income taxes arise from temporary timing differences in the recognition
of income and expenses for financial  reporting and tax purposes.  The Company's
deferred  tax assets  consist  entirely of the benefit from net  operating  loss
(NOL)  carry-forwards.  The NOL carry  forwards  expire in various years through
2034. The Company's deferred tax assets are offset by a valuation  allowance due
to  the  uncertainty  of  the  realization  of  the  NOL   carry-forwards.   NOL
carry-forwards may be further limited by a change in company ownership and other
provisions of the tax laws.


The Company's deferred tax assets,  valuation allowance, and change in valuation
allowance are as follows:








                                  Estimated NOL           Valuation       Net Tax
                            Carry-forward benefit         Allowance       Benefit
                            =========================================================
  June 30, 2014                       $962,697             $(962,697)          -
December 31, 2013                     $784,380             $(784,380)          -











NOTE 11 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS



The Company has evaluated it activities  subsequent to June 30, 2014 and through
the  issuance  of  the  financial  statements  and  found  no  other  reportable
subsequent events.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS



The  following  discussion  should  be read in  conjunction  with our  unaudited
financial  statements and notes thereto included herein. In connection with, and
because we desire to take  advantage  of, the "safe  harbor"  provisions  of the
Private  Securities  Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we caution readers regarding
certain forward looking statements in the following  discussion and elsewhere in
this report and in any other statement made by, or on our behalf, whether or not
in future filings with the Securities and Exchange  Commission.  Forward-looking
statements are statements not based on historical  information  and which relate
to future  operations,  strategies,  financial  results  or other  developments.
Forward looking  statements are necessarily based upon estimates and assumptions
that are inherently  subject to significant  business,  economic and competitive
uncertainties and  contingencies,  many of which are beyond our control and many
of which,  with  respect to future  business  decisions,  are subject to change.
These  uncertainties and contingencies can affect actual results and could cause
actual results to differ  materially from those expressed in any forward looking
statements  made by, or on our behalf.  We  disclaim  any  obligation  to update
forward-looking statements.


The  independent  registered  public  accounting  firm's report on the Company's
financial  statements as of December 31, 2013,  and for each of the years in the
two-year period then ended,  includes a "going concern"  explanatory  paragraph,
that describes  substantial  doubt about the Company's  ability to continue as a
going concern.



PLAN OF OPERATIONS




While we have generated revenues from our operational activities, these revenues
have been minimal and are not sufficient to support our operational  activities,
which are  focused  on  re-working  our  existing  properties  in order to reach
production goals. We have minimal capital and moderate cash. We will continue to
need cash infusions from investors or shareholders to provide capital,  or loans
from any sources, none of which have been arranged nor assured.


During the six months ended June 30, 2014, we continued our re-work efforts with
our Mason Lakes,  Montana  property,  suffering  slight  delays during the first
quarter due to the severe winter conditions.  During the second quarter,  we saw
progress  from  our  re-work  and  production  enhancement  efforts  and are now
producing  between 25 to 50 barrels of oil per day from the field.  In addition,
during  the last part of the  quarter  and  during  third  quarter we have begun
efforts to bring one of two shut-in wells back into  production and are starting
to see limited production from this well.


We continue our re-work  efforts on our Cisco,  Utah properties and have focused
our efforts on specific wells in the property in order to increase production on
existing producing wells.



Financing Efforts



On January 22, 2014, the Company issued a Secured Convertible Promissory Note in
exchange for cash of $2,000,000 in order to support  continuing  operations  and
the Company's re-completion and drilling plans in its oil and gas fields in Utah
and Montana.


18





The  Secured  Convertible  Promissory  Note  has a term of 3 years  and  accrues
interest at a rate of 10% per annum with quarterly interest payments starting in
July 2014. The Note is convertible  into shares of the Company's common stock at
a rate of $1.25 per share.  Since the stock  price was below this at the time of
signing  the note was  issued at a  premium  so no value is  apportioned  to the
conversion  feature when recording the issuance per ASC 470-20-05.  The debt and
its interest are reported as if it were a nonconvertible  debt. Upon Conversion,
the stock may be valued at either the book value or the market  value.  The Note
has provisions for issuance of up to 480,000 warrants  exercisable for shares of
the Company's common stock,  such warrants to be issued to the Note holder based
on the  amount of note  principal  converted  into  common  stock,  if any.  The
warrants,  if  issued,  would have a term of 3 years  from the  issuance  of the
promissory note and an exercise price of $2.00 per share.


The Note is secured by the assets  consisting of the Company's  leases and wells
in Musselshell County, Montana.


We will  require  substantial  additional  capital to support our  existing  and
proposed future energy operations.  We have only recognized minimal and sporadic
revenues.  We have no committed  source for any additional  funds as of the date
hereof.  No representation is made that any funds will be available when needed.
In the event funds cannot be raised when needed, we may not be able to carry out
our business plan, may never achieve sales or royalty income,  and could fail in
business as a result of these uncertainties.


Decisions   regarding  future  prospect   acquisitions  or  other  participation
activities will be made on a case-by-case basis. We may, in any particular case,
decide to participate or decline participation. If participating, we may pay our
proportionate share of costs to maintain our proportionate interest through cash
flow or debt or equity financing.  If participation is declined, we may elect to
farmout,  non-consent,  sell or otherwise  negotiate a method of cost sharing in
order to maintain some continuing interest in the prospect.



RESULTS OF OPERATIONS




For the Three Months Ended June 30, 2014 Compared to the Three Months Ended June
30, 2014


During the three months ended June 30, 2014, the Company recognized  revenues of
$163,339 from its  operational  activities  compared to $10,091 during the three
months  ended  June 30,  2013.  Revenues  increased  by  $153,248,  as result of
increased  production due primarily to re-work  efforts at our Mason Lakes Field
in Montana.  Management  expects that  revenues will continue to increase in the
next six months,  as the field in Montana is brought  into full  production  and
re-work on properties in Utah, is continued.  Management does not expect revenue
to be  sufficient  to cover  the full  costs of  operations  and  administrative
expenses in the near future.








                                               During the Three Months Ended
                                                          June 30,

Average Price Per Barrel                        $87.11              $63.09








During the three months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013,  the Company  recognized a
direct  cost of revenue of $51,306  and  $51,101,  respectively.  An increase of
$205, which is direct result of the costs incurred with our acquisition and work
on our Mason Lakes Field in Musselshell County, Montana.


19





During the three months ended June 30, 2014,  we  recognized  total  operational
expenses of $609,472 compared to $315,693 during the three months ended June 30,
2013, an increase of $293,779. The increase was a result of increases of $44,381
in consulting fees, $11,087 increase in general and administrative  expenses and
a $260,485 increase in operating lease expenses.


During  the three  months  ended  June 30,  2014,  we  recognized  a net loss of
$640,840  compared to $381,483  during the three months ended June 30, 2013. The
increase of $259,357 was primarily a result of the $153,248  increase in revenue
offset by the increase of $315,693 in operational expenses.


For the Six Months Ended June 30, 2014 Compared to the Six Months Ended June 30,
2013


During the six months ended June 30, 2014,  the Company  recognized  revenues of
$191,339  from its  operational  activities  compared to $21,722  during the six
months  ended  June 30,  2013.  Revenues  increased  by  $169,617,  as result of
increased production due to re-work efforts at our Mason Lakes Field in Montana.
Management  expects  that  revenues  will  continue  to increase in the next six
months,  as the field in Montana is brought into full  production and re-work on
properties  in Utah,  is  continued.  Management  does not expect  revenue to be
sufficient  enough  to cover the full  costs of  operations  and  administrative
expenses in the near future.

in consulting fees, $43,804 increase in general and administrative  expenses and
a $272,446  increase  in  operating  lease  expenses.  The  $80,160  increase in
consulting  fees is a result of  contracting  with a petroleum  engineer  and an

exchange for cash of $2,000,000 in order to support  continuing  operations  and
the Company's re-completion and drilling plans in its oil and gas fields in Utah
and Montana.


The  Secured  Convertible  Promissory  Note  has a term of 3 years  and  accrues
interest at a rate of 10% per annum with quarterly interest payments starting in
July 2014. The Note is convertible  into shares of the Company's common stock at
a rate of $1.25 per share.  Since the stock  price was below this at the time of
signing  the note was  issued at a  premium  so no value is  apportioned  to the
conversion  feature when recording the issuance per ASC 470-20-05.  The debt and
its interest are reported as if it were a nonconvertible  debt. Upon Conversion,
the stock may be valued at either the book value or the market  value.  The Note
has provisions for issuance of up to 480,000 warrants  exercisable for shares of
the Company's common stock,  such warrants to be issued to the Note holder based
on the  amount of note  principal  converted  into  common  stock,  if any.  The
warrants,  if  issued,  would have a term of 3 years  from the  issuance  of the
promissory note and an exercise price of $2.00 per share.


The Note is secured by the assets  consisting of the Company's  leases and wells
in Musselshell County, Montana.



Short Term.



On a  short-term  basis,  we do not  generate  any revenue  sufficient  to cover
operations.  Based on  prior  history,  we will  continue  to have  insufficient
revenue to satisfy  current and recurring  expenses and  liabilities.  For short
term needs we will be dependent on receipt, if any, of offering proceeds.


21






Capital Resources



We have only common and preferred stock as our capital resources.


We have no material  commitments for capital  expenditures within the next year,
however if operations are commenced,  substantial  capital will be needed to pay
for participation, investigation, exploration, acquisition and working capital.



Need for Additional Financing



We do not have capital  sufficient to meet our cash needs.  We will have to seek
loans or equity placements to cover such cash needs. Once exploration commences,
our needs for additional financing is likely to increase substantially.


No commitments to provide  additional  funds have been made by our management or
other stockholders.  Accordingly,  there can be no assurance that any additional
funds will be  available  to us to allow it to cover our expenses as they may be
incurred.



Critical Accounting Policies




Cash and Cash Equivalents



The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of
three months or less and money market instruments to be cash equivalents.



Oil and Gas Properties, Full Cost Method



The Company uses the full cost method of  accounting  for oil and gas  producing
activities.  Costs to acquire mineral  interests in oil and gas  properties,  to
drill and equip exploratory wells used to find proved reserves, and to drill and
equip  development  wells including  directly related overhead costs and related
asset retirement costs are capitalized.


Under this method,  all costs,  including  internal  costs  directly  related to
acquisition,  exploration and development  activities are capitalized as oil and
gas  property  costs.   Properties  not  subject  to  amortization   consist  of
exploration and development costs which are evaluated on a  property-by-property
basis.  Amortization of these unproved property costs begins when the properties
become  proved  or their  values  become  impaired.  The  Company  assesses  the
realization  of unproved  properties,  taken as a whole,  if any, on at least an
annual basis or when there has been an indication  that  impairment in value may
have  occurred.   Impairment  of  unproved   properties  is  assessed  based  on
management's  intention  with regard to future  exploration  and  development of
individually  significant  properties  and the  ability of the Company to obtain
funds  to  finance  such  exploration  and  development.  If the  results  of an
assessment  indicate  that  the  properties  are  impaired,  the  amount  of the
impairment is added to the capitalized costs to be amortized.


Costs of oil and gas properties  will be amortized using the units of production
method.


In applying the full cost method,  the Company will perform an  impairment  test
(ceiling  test) at each reporting  date,  whereby the carrying value of property
and  equipment  is  compared  to the  "estimated  present  value," of its proved
reserves discounted at a 10-percent interest rate of future net revenues,  based
on current  economic and operating  conditions,  plus the cost of properties not
being  amortized,  plus the  lower  of cost or fair  market  value  of  unproved
properties  included  in costs  being  amortized,  less the income  tax  effects
related to book and tax basis  differences  of the  properties.  If  capitalized
costs exceed this limit, the excess is charged as an impairment expense.


22






Revenue and Accounts Receivable



The  Company  recognizes  revenue for its  production  when the  quantities  are
delivered to, or collected by, the  purchaser.  Prices for such  production  are
generally  defined in sales  contracts  and are  readily  determinable  based on
certain publicly  available indices.  All  transportation  costs are included in
lease operating expenses.


Accounts  receivable  -- oil and natural gas sales  consist of  uncollateralized
accrued  revenues  due under normal trade  terms,  generally  requiring  payment
within 30 to 60 days of  production.  The Company  reviews  accounts  receivable
periodically  and reduces the  carrying  amount by a  valuation  allowance  that
reflects  its  best  estimate  of the  amount  that may not be  collectible.  No
valuation allowance was recognized as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013.



Dependence on Major Customers



During  the six  months  ended  June  30,  2014,  the  Company's  revenues  were
attributable  to sales of oil to two  customers.  During the year ended December
31,  2013,  the  Company's  revenues  were  attributable  to sales of oil to one
customer.  The Company believes that there are potential alternative  purchasers
and that it may be  necessary to establish  relationships  with new  purchasers.
However,  there  can  be no  assurance  that  the  Company  can  establish  such
relationships and that those relationships will result in an increased number of
purchasers.  Although the Company is exposed to a concentration  of credit risk,
the Company  believes that all of its purchasers are credit worthy.  The Company
had no bad debt at June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013.

ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES




Disclosures Controls and Procedures



We have adopted and maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is
defined in Rules 13a 15(e) and 15d-15(e)  under the  Securities  Exchange Act of
1934,  as amended  (the  "Exchange  Act")) and that are  designed to ensure that
information  required to be disclosed in our reports  under the Exchange Act, is
recorded,  processed,  summarized and reported within the time periods  required
under  the  SEC's  rules and forms  and that the  information  is  gathered  and
communicated to our management, including our Chief Financial Officer (Principal
Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer), as appropriate, to allow for
timely decisions regarding required disclosure.


As required by SEC Rule 15d-15(b),  our Chief  Financial  Officer carried out an
evaluation  under the supervision and with the  participation of our management,
of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure  controls and
procedures  pursuant  to  Exchange  Act Rule  15d-14 as of the end of the period
covered by this report.  Based on the foregoing  evaluation  and the  evaluation
conducted at June 30, 2014, our Chief  Financial  Officer has concluded that our
disclosure  controls  and  procedures  are  not  effective  in  timely  alerting
management them to material  information required to be included in our periodic
SEC filings  and to ensure that  information  required  to be  disclosed  in our
periodic  SEC  filings  is  accumulated  and  communicated  to  our  management,
including  our Chief  Financial  Officer,  to allow timely  decisions  regarding
required disclosure.

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.



Hinto's  management is responsible for  establishing  and  maintaining  adequate
internal control over financial  reporting for the company in accordance with as
defined in Rules  13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)  under the Exchange Act. The Company's
internal  control over  financial  reporting  is designed to provide  reasonable
assurance  regarding the reliability of financial  reporting and the preparation
of financial  statements  for external  purposes in  accordance  with  generally
accepted  accounting  principles.  The Company's internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that:


(1)  pertain  to  the  maintenance  of  records  that,  in  reasonable   detail,
accurately  and fairly reflect the  transactions  and  dispositions  of the
Company's assets;


(2)  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit  preparation  of financial  statements in accordance  with generally
accepted  accounting  principles,  and  that  the  Company's  receipts  and
expenditures  are being  made only in  accordance  with  authorizations  of
Hinto's management and directors; and


(3)  provide reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized  acquisition,  use or disposition of the Company's assets that
could have a material effect on Hinto's financial statements.


We  have  identified  certain  material  weaknesses  in  internal  control  over
financial reporting relating to a shortage of accounting and reporting personnel
due to limited  financial  resources  and the size of our  Company,  as detailed
below:


(1)  The Company  currently  does not have,  but is in the process of developing
formally  documented  accounting  policies and  procedures,  which includes
establishing a well-defined process for financial reporting.


(2)  Due to the limited size of our accounting department, we currently lack the
resources  to handle  complex  accounting  transactions.  We  believe  this
deficiency  could  lead to errors in the  presentation  and  disclosure  of
financial information in our annual, quarterly, and other filings.


(3)  As is the case with many  companies  of similar  size,  we  currently  lack
segregation  of duties in the accounting  department.  Until our operations
expand and additional  cash flow is generated from  operations,  a complete
segregation of duties within our accounting function will not be possible.


Considering  the nature and extent of our  current  operations  and any risks or
errors in financial reporting under current operations and the fact that we have
been a small  business with limited  employees,  such items caused a weakness in
internal controls involving the areas disclosed above.


We have  concluded  that our internal  controls over  financial  reporting  were
ineffective as of June 30, 2014, due to the existence of the material weaknesses
noted above that we have yet to fully remediate.


There  was no change in our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  that
occurred  during the fiscal  quarter  ended June 30, 2014,  that has  materially
affected,  or is reasonably  likely to materially  affect,  our internal control
over financial reporting.

which they requested,  and all information  necessary to verify such information
and were afforded  access to management of the Company in connection  with their
purchases.   All  purchasers  of  the  unregistered   securities  acquired  such
securities for investment and not with a view toward distribution, acknowledging
such intent to the Company.  All  certificates or agreements  representing  such
securities that were issued contained  restrictive legends,  prohibiting further

such  securities   either  being  first  registered  or  otherwise  exempt  from

Telephone costs 

The above figures represent only estimated costs.

The expenses shown above are estimates. The actual costs may differ from our
estimated values. 

The proceeds will not be used, fully or in part, to pay salary or make any other
payments to the Company’s sole officer and Director, Mr. Phiraphat Siwarirat.
Even though there are no written agreements in place supporting this restriction
on payment to Mr. Siwarirat upon the use of proceeds, the proceeds from this
offering are intended to be used exclusively as shown in the table above. 
Mr. Siwarirat is committed to receive salary or any other payment from the
Company only and if the company becomes profitable.

The total estimated expenses related to this offering of $8,770 are the sum of:
the estimated cost of $3,500 with auditor’s fees for the audit of the Financial
Statements contained herein; estimated $1,500 with bookkeeper’s fees to prepare
the December 31, 2014 fiscal year end financials contained herein; estimated
$2,000 for the attorney’s opinion letter; $20 for the SEC registration fee*;
Costs related to EDGARization, estimated at $750 and costs with Transfer Agent
and printing of $1,000.

* The SEC registration fee has been calculated pursuant to sections 6(b), 13(e),
  or 14(g) of the Securities Act of 1933. The fee is $114.60 per $1,000,000
  (prorated for amounts less than $1,000,000). It is calculated by multiplying
  the aggregate offering amount by .00011460 ($136,000 x .00011460 = $15.59).

In the twelve months after we become effective, in order to meet our reporting
obligations, we estimate to have the following costs: $2,000 with auditor’s fees
for each review of our Financial Statements for 3 forms 10Q’s (totalling
$6,000); $3,500 for the fiscal year end financials audit; bookkeeper’s fees for
each financial statement will be $1,500 (totalling $4,500); costs related to
EDGARization of $1,100 ($600 for 3 forms 10Q’s - $200 each- and $500 for 1 form
10K) and $2,500 for the annual XBRL mapping fee.

As shown on the table above, we intend to allocate proceeds from this offering
to keep our reporting status with the SEC current.

Our officer and director has committed to lend funds (up to $10,000) to the
company for the next twelve months to cover expenses to maintain the reporting
status current with the SEC. Mr. Phiraphat Siwarirat is willing to lend the full
amount of these funds to the Company as the expenses are incurred, if necessary
or if no other proceeds are available to the Company, regardless of the amount
raised through this offering. However, there is no contract in place or written
agreement with Mr. Phiraphat Siwarirat and the funds expressed in the above
verbal commitment, would be in the form of a non-secured loan and would have no
interest and no fixed repayment date.


Our company has yet to enter the Market and has not developed its products thus
far. In order to enter the Market, Global Gard, Inc. has to successfully
implement its plan of operations, which is dependent on the success of this
offering.

We believe that once we are able to develop our products, we could offer our
apps at an affordable price. However, there is no certainty that we will be able
to develop our apps or even if we could offer them at an affordable price.

We will be competing against already established companies and all the emerging
app companies.

The emergency or distress use of cellular technology has existed for a number of
years in both dedicated hardware and software.  The dedicated hardware market
has a range of phones designed for children and seniors that have dedicated
buttons for emergency purposes. These phones range in price from $39 dollars to
over $100 dollars. The Company feels that its software application will be more
desirable in the over 12 year old to the under 70-year-old market than the
dedicated phones. The Company’s application will be designed to operate on the
most popular existing cell phones that our target market will already own, plus
as our application will be more affordable than the dedicated phones.

The emergency smart phone software industry has been around for a number of
years with one of the most popular programs being Guardly ™ that started
operations in 2010. Guardly’s product line has multiple applications for
specific situations; in contrast G.G. App will provide many of the same features
in a single application and will offer a single more robust application.

The Company’s second application allowing for secure voice and messaging will be
entering an established market with competitors like Silent Circle ™. The
Company’s planned price of $1.99 per month for its application is 80% less than
the basic fee charged by Silent Circle. The Company feels that its’ pricing will
be its most distinguishing market feature and competitive advantage.”


Company Description
Global Gard, Inc. (GG) was incorporated in the State of Nevada as a for-profit
Company on July 16, 2014. We are a development-stage Company that intends to
develop security applications for smartphones (apps). We have not yet developed
any app.

Our first app to be developed is called G.G.App,


 intended to be used in
dangerous situations and moments of panic or distress. Our to-be-developed app
would alert the user’s family and friends ("observers") in possible moments of
danger. It may also be used to call Emergency Services such as the Police, Fire
Department or Medical Services. We plan to develop two modes of operation:
“Stealth Mode” and “Caution Mode”. The Company anticipates that it will not be
able to offer the Global Guard application through the Apple’s Apps store as the
Company’s application will require its users to Jail Break* their IPhones, the
Company anticipates it will be able to offer its G.G.APP on the Google Play
store as Android phones will not need to be Jail Broken and or Rooted. 

Once G.G.App has been activated in the Stealth Mode, the user cannot deactivate
it, only the Company for a fee can terminate it. To terminate the application,
the user will have to call into the Company and pay a $19.99.

Contingent on the sale of at least 75% of the shares offered herein, we also
intend to develop a second app: the G.G.App Encriptor. This app is planned to
encrypt all data exchanged by internet (Wi-Fi, 3G and 4G) and phone
conversations. The objective is to prevent stolen passwords and data obtained by
internet connection on untrusted Wi-Fi connections.

We intend to sell G.G.App on Google Play and for download on our website for US$
0.99. Also, we plan on offering a trial version of G.G.App. Encriptor for a
month, and after this period, this app can be used for monthly payment of
US$1.99. The Global Guard encryption application can be sold in both the Apple
Apps Store and the Google Play store, as its use will not require its users to
Jail break their smart phones.

Global Gard, Inc. has no plans to change its business activities or partner with
another business and is not aware of any circumstances or events that might
cause this plan to change.
