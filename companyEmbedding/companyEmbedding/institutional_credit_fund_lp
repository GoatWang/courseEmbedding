				Institutional Credit Opportunities Fund

Investor Class
TRXPX

Invests at least 80% in credit and derivative instruments. The fund may invest without limit in below investment-grade or unrated bonds and up to 50% in bank loans.
 This fund could have greater price declines than a fund that invests primarily in high-quality bonds or loans; the loans and debt securities held by the fund are usually considered speculative and involve a greater risk of default and price decline than higher-rated bonds.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.

Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. Average annual total return figures include changes in principal value, reinvested dividends, and capital gain distributions.







The 30-day dividend yield represents the average daily dividends for the 30-day period, annualized and divided by the net asset values per share at the end of the period; it is available the first quarter after the fund's inception. The SEC standardized yield is computed under an SEC standardized formula and reflects an estimated yield to maturity (assuming all portfolio securities are held to maturity); it is available the first month after the fund's inception.







The performance information shown does not reflect the deduction of a 2.00% redemption fee on shares held for 90 days or less; if it did, the performance would be lower.







The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.  If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.

Benefits & Risks
Offers high income potential and capital appreciation by primarily investing in below investment-grade corporate bonds and floating rate bank loans through a concentrated approach.Provides investors access to the distressed and restructuring high yield opportunity set on a highly selective basis.Fixed-income securities are subject to credit risk (high yield bonds carry a greater default risk than higher-rated bonds), liquidity risk, call risk, and interest-rate risk. 



Investor Profile
		An aggressive long-term, risk-tolerant investor seeking a high level of current income and some appreciation potential, and who is willing to accept the fund's higher risk characteristics. The fund should not represent a significant portion of your assets. Appropriate for both regular and tax-deferred accounts, such as IRAs and Keoghs.
