January 04, 2017

Early-adopters Spanning the Consumer, IoT, Healthcare and Financial Services Sectors Showcase Their Products With WattUp Wireless Charging at CES 2017
LAS VEGAS, NV -- (Marketwired) -- 01/04/17 -- 
        Energous Corporation
(NASDAQ: WATT), the developer of WattUp®, a revolutionary wire-free charging technology that provides over-the-air power at a distance, today announced that multiple partners will be unveiling products incorporating WattUp wireless charging at CES 2017 in Las Vegas. Energous is paving the path for its vision of a ubiquitous wireless-charging ecosystem and these partner installations represent a significant feat in terms of market readiness and adoption, consumer demand and ecosystem development. 
"Consistent with our business forecast, five consumer product companies and one medical device company will be unveiling WattUp-enabled products at CES. This is yet another major milestone for Energous that puts the company squarely on the path to generating significant revenues in 2017," said Stephen R. Rizzone, president and CEO of Energous. "Working with these innovative and agile partners, as well as a number of others who will be making similar announcements in the coming months, represents the first phase of our vision of building a WattUp ecosystem that will fundamentally change how people charge many different electronics including mobile and IoT devices."
Devices integrated with WattUp receiver technology can seamlessly transition from being charged by small, contact-based, portable transmitters, to forthcoming larger transmitters that offer charging at-a-distance of up to 15 feet. This scalable technology creates an ecosystem of products that are compatible, complimentary and provide seamless charging experiences at home, in the office, in the car and beyond. 
Partner products being unveiled at CES include:



Chipolo



Chipolo Plus Gen 2 is the world's loudest Bluetooth tracker, making it ideal for users to track items like a wallet, luggage, keys, phone and more. Chipolo Plus Gen 2 is the first tracking device with built-in wireless charging capabilities powered by the WattUp technology.

Chipolo Sticker is the world's smallest wireless tracking device, which is perfectly suited for items that have a smaller surface area. The technology will also be equipped with a wireless charging feature from WattUp.






CVR Global Inc./CVR Medical Corp.


CVR Medical Corporation in conjunction with CVR Global Inc., will be showcasing the Carotid Stenotic Scan (CSS), its patented and sub-sonic sound analysis technology that detects and diagnoses atherosclerosis and stenosis within the human arterial system, quickly arming clinicians with information to assist in improving clinical outcomes related to cardiovascular disease. The WattUp receiver technology will be integrated into the device's sensor array, while the cart, which will contain the charging cradle, will contain the WattUp transmitter technology.






PERI



PERI MicroPack provides a rapid 700mAh charge to any micro-USB port, and is the first-ever power dongle that can be recharged wirelessly.






Sejin Electronic Inc.


Sejin Electronic Inc., will be showcasing a universal Miniature WattUp transmitter at Energous' suite at CES.






SK Telesys


SK Telesys hearing aid will feature wireless charging from WattUp that enables SK Telesys to close out the charging port to make the hearing aid completely waterproof.
SK Telesys smart ID card will feature its proprietary Real Identity technology that requires fingerprint identification before usage. Consumers will also be able to recharge their smart IDs using the miniature WattUp transmitter.






Tactual Labs Co.


Tactual's Prism Pen™ featuring its breakthrough Prism™ single-sensor solution for touch and pen enables multiple users and pens to be simultaneously sensed and uniquely identified at near-zero latency. The Prism Pen™ will be equipped with fast, easy WattUp wire-free charging.



"Energous is at the forefront of the wireless charging movement with technology that is poised to change the way we interact with and use gadgets," said Tadej Jevsevar, CEO and co-founder of Chipolo. "Integrating the WattUp technology into Chipolo Plus Gen 2 and Chipolo Sticker is extremely valuable as it enables us to continue to make our products more user-friendly and gives us a leg up over competitors. We are thrilled to work with a company that shares our commitment and vision in challenging the ordinary and finding simple solutions to everyday problems."

Energous: Expectations After CES 2017 - Energous Corp. (NASDAQ:WATT) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Energous: Expectations After CES 2017Jan.12.17 | About: Energous Corp. (WATT) Stock Puzzle Long/short equity, special situationsSummaryEnergous announced six products but no launch dates.The two most publicized products were from crowd-funded companies with only one past product.None of the announced products have been approved by the FCC.Apple rumors made biggest headlines but safety issues were also raised in the media. Expectations for a strong showing at CES 2017 were high: During the last earnings call, Energous (NASDAQ:WATT) CEO Stephen Rizzone confirmed that several partners were going to display products at CES in January and that the first products using WattUp technology will reach consumers in Q1 2017. Now that CES is over and media coverage has tapered, it is good time to summarize Energous' showing and how it fits into the competing bullish and bearish narratives. Product announcements During CES, Energous announced several products with WattUp charging capability:  Chipolo, a Slovenian company funded on Kickstarter that makes Bluetooth lost item trackers, is planning second-generation devices with wireless charging capabilities. This application is an interesting test case for WattUp as the low cost is extremely important. Current Bluetooth lost item trackers have just a battery, a Bluetooth chip and a ceramic speaker. Adding wireless charge capability could easily double the bill of material as the WattUp receiver chip is similarly sized to the Bluetooth chip and the rechargeable battery is costlier than a cheap coin cell battery. No price or release date were announced and a search on the FCC website did not show the FCC approval for the upcoming product. This product bears careful watching as it will be a very good indication of the price competitiveness of WattUp technology. PERI, another crowd funded company that makes Bluetooth speakers for iPhone6 (the iPhone7 model is scheduled for this spring) is to release a portable USB battery called MicroPACK. The product has 700 mAh capacity and can be recharged wirelessly using WattUp. The small capacity, about 5-10x less than competing battery backs, may be due to the slow charging rate of WattUp Mini. In my estimate, it takes 25 hours to recharge PERI's battery back using the approved WattUp Mini transmitter which may limit its appeal. The product is not yet approved by the FCC. Release date and pricing were not announced but it is indicated that product is to ship in spring 2017. CVR Global Inc, a start-up working on medical devices, is planning to use WattUp technology. The product is not yet FDA approved so release may be years away. Sejin Electronic Inc, a Korean manufacturer known for keyboards and other computer peripheral, is to ship WattUp Mini transmitters. The release date and pricing were not announced. The FCC web site does not yet show the license application/approval. Another Korean manufacturer, SK Telesys, known for wireless routers, is to use WattUp for hearing aid and smart ID card. The release date and pricing were not announced. The FCC web site does not yet show license application/approval.  Tactual Labs, a start-up that works on 3D user interface, was also mentioned but this does not appear to be a available near term.  

 Figure 1. PERI MicroPACK (Source) In summary, Energous did show a few products with the portable battery and the Bluetooth lost item finder being the closest to commercialization. These are very cost sensitive product categories from small crowd funded companies which makes it unlikely that they will generate much revenue. For now, the positive PR of a having product in the pipeline may be sufficient for Energous' bulls. The real test will come later when we see the product pricing as this will be good indication of the WattUp cost competitiveness. Unfortunately, it is now evident that Energous will miss its target of getting the product to consumers in Q1 2017 and there are not even firm launch dates for the future products. The closest we have is a potential spring launch from a crowd funded company with one past product. This may or may not happen: The reader is reminded of the past product promises including a wireless charging case announced in CES 2015 and expectations to ship "millions and millions" of chips by the end of 2016. Until we see a product approval by FCC, the product announcements are just words. As it stands, the only WattUp product with FCC approval is the WattUp Mini approved last summer. The lack of products makes it difficult to achieve cash flow breakeven in Q3 2017 that has been the company guidance for some time. In an optimistic scenario, the initial product announcements lead to positive momentum and further partner deals. A pessimistic view is that WattUp is not anywhere near to being a vibrant ecosystem that could compete with alternative standards. Overall, CES showed the challenges in Energous' stepped strategy of trying to generate revenue with contact charging while waiting to release long-distance charging: No large manufacturer signed up for WattUp Mini which may indicate that its touted advantages are not very compelling without the long-distance charging capability. Media coverage Energous managed to raise a fair amount of media coverage during the conference. The biggest story, predictably, was the rumored Apple partnership that it made all the way to Forbes. The story can be traced to the Verge interview where CEO Rizzone states that Energous' partnership is with... one of the largest consumer electronic companies in the world. I cannot tell you who it is, but I can virtually guarantee that you have products from this company on your person, sitting on your desk, or at home. The Verge journalist inferred this to mean Apple. This author disagrees: If Energous was truly partnered with a company like Apple, it would be silly to spend effort with tiny crowd funded companies like PERI. The announced products received less media coverage but were noted in several news sources that cover technology (for example, here and here). In addition to the positive coverage, the media was also critical of Energous. The above mentioned the Verge article noted that Energous still isn't delivering truly wireless charging and that it barely worked in the past demos. In a Barron's interview, Menno Treffers, who is the public face of the Wireless Power Consortium, said that... they (Energous) are not very efficient, and they are not very safe. ... and went on to imply that Energous has not yet demonstrated long-distance charging safely. While this is coming from a backer of competing Qi charging standard, it is notable that media is starting to pick up on the safety issues in RF charging. The safety issues also were raised by the competing RF charging company Ossia. According to Ossia, the power levels sent by Energous put people at risk. Adding salt to the wound, Ossia won the CES Best Innovation Award while Energous was not honored in any category. Summary Energous' showing at CES gave something for everyone: Bulls point to the first products in the pipeline and cherish the Apple rumors. Bears point to the lack a credible product partners, yet another indefinite delay in the product launch, and the safety concerns raised in the media. Neither side can claim a compelling victory and stock price trades more or less are unchanged. The widely diverging narratives continue to make this an interesting stock to follow. Bulls will want to see definite product launch dates and more credible product partnerships. This could build positive momentum and keep hope for a new charging ecosystem alive. Bears hope to see for further delays in commercialization and more critical articles in mainstream media which would erode the management credibly and deflate the hype surrounding the stock. The author's personal view is that bear scenario is more likely and the author is short on Energous.

Product Overview











Power Unplugged
Energous Corporation is the developer of WattUp®—an award-winning, wire-free charging technology that will transform the way consumers and industries charge and power electronic devices at home, in the office, in the car and beyond. WattUp is a revolutionary radio frequency (RF) based charging solution that delivers intelligent, scalable power via radio bands, similar to a Wi-Fi router. WattUp differs from older wireless charging systems in that it delivers power at a distance, to multiple devices – thus resulting in a wire-free experience that saves users from having to remember to plug in their devices.















True Mobility
Wire-free power delivers on the promise of true mobility and the freedom to roam where you want to without worrying about your battery powered devices running out of a charge. WattUp Mid Field and Far Field transmitters give you the freedom to receive wireless power within a charging zone without having to surrender your device to a pad or static location. 



WattUp Receiver Devices
WattUp RF-based charging can be integrated to provide wire-free charging to a wide variety of electronic devices such as smartphones, tablets, fitness bands, smartwatches, wearables, cameras, wireless keyboards and mice, headsets, sensors, LED lights, remote controls and toys and many other battery-powered devices in your home, office and beyond.



Works Like Wi-Fi
A WattUp transmitter, or Power Router, sends energy via a Radio Frequency (RF) signal to your WattUp-enabled electronic devices when requested. A WattUp receiver in each device converts that signal into battery power. The entire system is software controlled, so it's intelligent and customizable to your needs and environment. And, because it's designed to work invisibly in the background, WattUp can make low battery anxiety a thing of the past.



How Does it Work?
A Radio Frequency (RF) system, similar to a Wi-Fi system, delivers safe wire-free charging energy at distances of up to approximately 15 feet from a transmitter to a receiver device.



The Hardware
Highly focused pockets of energy are delivered via multiple miniature antenna arrays and WattUp Transmitter technology in the transmitter. Capturing of the micro energy beams from these pockets then takes place via paired antenna arrays and WattUp® Receiver Technology in the receiver devices.



The Software
The WattUp® software system ensures that the charging waveforms are dynamically directed, focused and controlled via proprietary algorithms.

 






WattUp Technology at a Glance











Transmitters
WattUp transmitters deliver on-demand wireless charging energy. The power and distance delivered are determined by the size of the transmitter and the number of Transmitters ASICS and antennas used in the design. The WattUp® technology is very scalable, providing wireless power and charging options to partners that vary from contact-based charging all the way up to 15-foot charging-at-a-distance, covering a total of 30-feet end-to-end.
Learn More











Receivers
WattUp® receivers use multiple miniature antennas to capture the micro energy beams sent from the transmitter. This smart antenna technology means power is delivered in safe, small, and focused amounts.
Learn More











Software
The entire WattUp® wire-free charging system is software controlled. Using either a mobile app or cloud-based web portal, you can identify which devices you want to receive power, in which order of priority, and even at what times you want the devices to charge.
You can prioritize charging mobile phones and tablets when you get home, while also having the flexibility of charging household devices including sensors, remote controls, keyboards and mice while you’re away. If you prefer a hands-off approach, WattUp® has the ability to automatically and intelligently manage all of your charging needs.

"Seriously, of all the tech we saw amongst the hundreds of companies we came into contact with at CES, this has the biggest potential to completely changes our lives."

Scott Tharler															 / Maxim Magazine










"I don't say this often, but I think we are looking at the future of technology."

David Pogue															 / Yahoo! Tech










"Wireless charging has been a CES tech demo for years. But Energous may be the first company to  make the idea practical...the technology is small enough, smart enough, and powerful enough to make a big impact in the near future."

Mark Wilson															 / Fast Company










"Energous has a solution for wirelessly charging wearables. Its chip will fit where an inductive coil will not."

Aaron Souppouris															 / Engadget
