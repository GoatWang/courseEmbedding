NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:SGYP), a biopharmaceutical company 
      focused on the development and commercialization of novel 
      gastrointestinal (GI) therapies, today announced that Gary Sender has 
      joined the company as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial 
      Officer. Mr. Sender will be responsible for leading Synergy’s financial 
      strategy and operations, supporting all functions of the organization.
    


      “Gary is a strong leader whose broad experience in small and larger 
      specialty pharmaceutical organizations uniquely qualifies him to lead 
      and build our financial operations as we enter a transformative period 
      in our history,” said Gary S. Jacob, Ph.D., Chairman and CEO of Synergy. 
      “Having previously managed financial planning and analysis and strategic 
      growth initiatives of Shire’s Global Commercial businesses, Gary has a 
      thorough understanding of the exciting opportunities from which Synergy 
      is poised to benefit. I’m confident he can add significant value as we 
      prepare to successfully enter a growing and dynamic GI market.”
    

      “I was immediately attracted to the excitement and energy around 
      Synergy,” said Gary Sender. “The company is approaching a period of 
      immense growth and opportunity with anticipated regulatory filings next 
      year and the commercial launch of plecanatide planned for early 2017. I 
      look forward to working with the Synergy team to successfully execute on 
      these goals and continue to drive significant shareholder return.”
    

      Gary Sender has over 25 years of financial leadership experience in the 
      pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries, most recently at Shire 
      plc. From 2009-2015, Mr. Sender served as Senior Vice President, Finance 
      supporting its Specialty Pharmaceuticals business and subsequently its 
      Global Commercial businesses. He was responsible for financial 
      management and support of all commercial areas of Shire’s $6 billion 
      Specialty Pharmaceutical and Rare Disease businesses, including the 
      Gastroenterology Business Unit, with an emphasis on resource allocation, 
      financial forecasting, business cases and M&A. Prior to joining Shire, 
      he was the founding CFO of Tengion – a biotechnology company in the 
      field of Regenerative Medicine. Mr. Sender spent 15 years in a number of 
      leadership roles within Merck, including Investor Relations, M&A 
      Finance, Treasury and Divisional Financial Management. Mr. Sender holds 
      a bachelor’s degree in Finance and Information Systems from Boston 
      University and a master’s degree in Industrial Administration (MBA) with

About Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc.


      Synergy is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and 
      commercialization of novel GI therapies. Our proprietary GI platform 
      includes two fully-owned, late-stage clinical assets - plecanatide and 
      dolcanatide. We designed both plecanatide and dolcanatide to be 
      pharmacologically superior versions of the naturally occurring human GI 
      peptide, uroguanylin, which is an important regulator for digestive 
      fluid movement and gut health. Plecanatide is our first uroguanylin 
      analog being developed for chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) and 
      irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C). In the summer of 
      2015, we announced positive phase 3 data from two plecanatide clinical 
      trials for CIC. We plan to file our first plecanatide new drug 
      application (NDA) for CIC in January 2016. Plecanatide is also being 
      evaluated in two ongoing phase 3 IBS-C trials. Dolcanatide is our second 
      uroguanylin analog currently being evaluated in a phase 1b study for the 
      treatment of ulcerative colitis. Dolcanatide is designed to have 
      enhanced resistance to proteolysis in intestinal fluid relative to 
      uroguanylin and yet still retain the same physiologic characteristics as 
      natural uroguanylin. In November 2014, we announced positive data with 
      dolcanatide from our phase 2 clinical trial for opioid-induced 
      constipation (OIC). For more information, please visit www.synergypharma.com.
    

Forward-Looking Statements


      Certain statements in this press release are forward-looking within the 
      meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These 
      statements may be identified by the use of forward- looking words such 
      as "anticipate," "planned," "believe," "forecast," "estimated," 
      "expected," and "intend," among others. These forward-looking statements 
      are based on Synergy's current expectations and actual results could 
      differ materially. There are a number of factors that could cause actual 
      events to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking 
      statements. These factors include, but are not limited to, substantial 
      competition; our ability to continue as a going concern; our need for 
      additional financing; uncertainties of patent protection and litigation; 
      uncertainties of government or third party payer reimbursement; limited 
      sales and marketing efforts and dependence upon third parties; and risks 
      related to failure to obtain FDA clearances or approvals and 
      noncompliance with FDA regulations. As with any pharmaceutical under 
      development, there are significant risks in the development, regulatory 
      approval and commercialization of new products. There are no guarantees 
      that future clinical trials discussed in this press release will be 
      completed or successful or that any product will receive regulatory 
      approval for any indication or prove to be commercially successful. 
      Investors should read the risk factors set forth in Synergy's Form 10-K 
      for the year ended December 31, 2014 and other periodic reports filed 
      with the Securities and Exchange Commission. While the list of factors 
      presented here is considered representative, no such list should be 
      considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and 
      uncertainties. Unlisted factors may present significant additional 
      obstacles to the realization of forward-looking statements. 
      Forward-looking statements included herein are made as of the date 
      hereof, and Synergy does not undertake any obligation to update publicly 
      such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.

About Nabriva Therapeutics AG  Nabriva Therapeutics is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the research and development of novel anti-infective agents to treat serious bacterial infections, with a focus on the pleuromutilin class of antibiotics. Nabriva's medicinal chemistry expertise has enabled targeted discovery of novel pleuromutilins, including both intravenous and oral formulations of its lead product candidate. Nabriva's lead pleuromutilin product candidate, lefamulin, is being developed to be the first systemically available pleuromutilin for human use and is the first new class of antibiotic to reach late stage clinical development for CABP in over a decade. Nabriva believes lefamulin is well positioned for use as a first-line empiric monotherapy for the treatment of moderate to severe CABP due to its novel mechanism of action, targeted spectrum of activity, resistance profile, achievement of substantial drug concentration in lung tissue and fluid, oral and IV formulations and favorable tolerability profile. Nabriva also intends to further pursue the development of lefamulin for additional indications, including the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections, and is developing a formulation of lefamulin appropriate for pediatric use. Nabriva owns exclusive, worldwide rights to lefamulin, which is protected by composition of matter patents issued in the United States, Europe and Japan.
