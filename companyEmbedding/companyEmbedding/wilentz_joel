     I am a former patient of Dr. Wilentz, and only former because of the changes my medical insurance has made.  He answered all my questions, never rushed me at any time.  I have all the trust in the world in his professional decisions.  On occassions, had to wait a littler longer than my appointment time, but it was well worth it!          Good front office, and his staff were wonderful.

I knew I was getting top-of-the-line treatment when they told me about what they learned at the latest conference they attended, and how they were incorporating that knowledge into the practice. Just as a side note, I was very impressed with how conveniently located this business was and how close it was to other shopping centers. It was so easy to find, I didn't have any trouble at all. They always made sure that I wasn't in any pain.
