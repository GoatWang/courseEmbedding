Prior to her retirement in March 2014, Ms. Robeson was Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer of DCP Midstream GP, LLC, the general partner of DCP Midstream Partners, LP from May 2012 until January 2014. Ms. Robeson also served as Group Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of DCP Midstream LLC from January 2002 to May 2012. Ms. Robeson served as a director of American Midstream GP, LLC, the general partner of American Midstream Partners, LP (NYSE: AMID) from June 2014 to June 2016. Ms. Robeson earned her B.S. degree in accounting from the Northwest Missouri State University. Ms. Robeson became a certified public accountant in 1983 and her license is currently inactive. Ms. Robeson is a member of the board of directors of SM Energy, an independent energy company engaged in the acquisition, development, and production of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids in onshore North America, and serves as Audit Committee Chair. Ms. Robeson is also a director of Tesco Corporation (Nasdaq: TESO), a global leader in the design assembly and service delivery of technology-based solutions for the upstream energy industry and serves on both the Audit and Compensation committees.   Ms. Robeson brings to the Board 30 years of experience in various aspects of the oil and gas industry, including exploration and production, midstream and refining and marketing. She also has significant financial management, risk management and accounting oversight experience, which is important in the oversight of our financial reporting and risk management functions. Ms. Robeson s service on other public company boards enhances her strong corporate governance background.

He was forced to live his last years in internal exile under FBI surveillance, a broken man.Over twenty years in preparation, this massively researched biography takes Robeson from his humble beginnings in rural New Jersey to international fame on the eve of World War II. Drawing on a variety of new sources, the book presents a fully rounded picture -- a portrait that corrects, supplements, and revises previous work on Robeson and his circle.

Sophie, thank you so much for your reviews.  I am beginning to see that all those who try to teach high power, manifestation thing, energy healing they all have low vibration because they offer an easy fix… something you just create in your mind following their mind teachings without putting any work to it.  I would like to know the vibration of Dr. Mark Sircus and his teaching. drsircus.com.  I have his books and use his protocols. I am beginning to see some things there too… Thank you so much.







Your vibrational reviews have been very helpful, all of the ‘gurus’ etc. that I have been involved with over the years are virtually all under 200 or even as low as 140! No quick fix I am afraid! I would be grateful if you would review Maureen Moss at http://www.maureenmoss.com/ when you have time, as I am subscribed to her newsletter and have her audio course ‘Birthing the Heart and Mind of God’ although I have not started listening to it yet or may not even bother if your rating is poor. Thanks again for these reviews!







She will be included in the next vibrational review







Hi Sophie, 
Thanks for the honest and insightful reviews. I was searching to see if there is a review on this Erika awakening who uses EFT and her healing work… but couldn’t find… http://erikaawakening.com/erika-awakening/ This was brought to my attention by a friend who was sharing her content. Would appreciate your review on her.







Erika Awakening: personal vibration: 130. Inner state: extreme anxiety, difficulty to breathe, worry. It centers mostly around the stomach, but rises to the throat occasionally. Some greed.
EFT: eft is not effective at all. Beliefs cannot be eliminated only controlled. Controlling beliefs is what makes one not breathe… result: a shitty life, and illness.
EFT may work through the principle of Placebo: placebo actually a good technique, just unreliable.
7% of clients get some results (according to my muscle testing) but it is a flash in the pan result… temporary.
The biggest problem is that the methods promote greed… which is the desire trap: utter misery

Alternatively, a donation of $5 and the year/month/day of your birth will get you an email from me with your soul correction. You can send more if you feel compelled. It will make you feel good, and start you on raising your vibration and maybe even your soul correction. But if you are a professional giver: just the opposite. No kidding. Thank you.



Read some of the articles on Soul Correction. The actions of soul correction reliably raise your vibration: you earn your vibration!"

"Do you need to change to raise your vibration?"
"There is no requirement to change.
You will naturally change though when you are good and ready.
That is what the natural result of doing the Bach Flower Energies will do for you. To get you good and ready, so you will want to change.Whether it is the Bach Flower Remedies, or the "Heaven on Earth" energies, same exact results.What are the 5 interview questions? Can you put it here?if you REALLY want to know what your loved ones think of you, how they see you, there is this really great interview you can do. you have to be COMPLETELY OPEN AND WILLING to hear their honest responses. you ask them these 5 questions and let them know they can be totally honest and you won't freak out or get defensive. you have to listen actively but without reacting. Write down what they say, verbatim, the mind will forget!1. what do you like about me?
2. what don't you like about me?
3. what do you see as my strengths?
4. what do you see as my weaknesses?
5. is there anything else you've ever wanted to say to me?

if you are up for it, it can be a pretty AMAZING experience. very enlightening.
Who is this site for?I am an empath.

An empath is like a psychic in a way. A true empath can feel and identify your feelings, whether they are emotions or physical sensations. I can feel them stronger than you yourself. Using those feelings as guidance I can inform you about the source of your feelings and advise you on a way to restore balance and well-being.Through empathy I have also found a way to connect, directly, to the Source of All-of-It, in a two-way fashion, so I can ask questions and receive answers, get energies, get guidance, and support. I don't know of anyone who does what I do, and I cannot teach much of it: so far I haven't found anyone who can connect, at will, to another person, for example. .Continue ReadingWhat does it mean to raise the vibration?Vibration is an abstract number signifying the relationship between you and truth, between you and your true nature.

The vibration number is a non-linear number where 35 is despair, almost dead, and 1,000 is the maximum, where you are fully realized.

The average vibration on the planet is 135 (Nov.5,2013) which is being at about 1% of what it is to be a Human Being. A vibration of 200 is the dividing line between wretched and someone who is able to move further up.

Certain capacities, like gratitude, appreciation, love, acceptance are only available at a matching vibrational level, below that level these capacities can be imitated, pretended, role-played, but not fully felt and realized.

Above 200 vibration people are able to do and see a lot of stuff they are unable even to comprehend at a vibration under 200. The higher your vibration the more of the world you can see, the more connection you can detect between things, and you can make better decisions, consistently.How do you measure vibration?I am an empath and can connect to anyone if there is enough identification. When I am connected to someone or something, I can muscle test any information about them, except divination, which is predicting a future event. It is against ground rules: free will.

I need to be connected to Source (all-of-it, also called the zero point field) to get an accurate reading.

When I am connected to Source, I am not in my mind, so what I think, my personal judgment, likes or dislikes don't influence the muscle test result.

OUR WINE DEPARTMENT


Whole Foods Market is the only national grocer to employ a Master Sommelier — Devon Broglie knows his wine! Along with fellow Global Beverage Buyer and co-conspirator Doug Bell, he’s part of a team with more than 90 years of experience. And don’t forget, get 10% off when you buy 6 bottles or more.

The Wine Experts



“They’re their own perfect little tornado.” See what prompted noted winemaker Joel Gott to say this about the formidable wine-buying duo of Devon and Doug: 




Colors and Bubbles – The Main Wine Types
Red Wines
Color
Runs the gamut from dark pink to ink
Common Flavors
Everything red, everything dark, dark fruits, dark berries, leather, tobacco, coffee, cocoa, warm spices, black pepper — you get the idea.
Darker grape varieties are often used for making red wines, but it’s the amount of contact with the skin of the grape that truly determines color. More contact with the skin: darker wine. Skin contact also imparts a kaleidoscope of possible flavors and textures, contributing to body and complexity.
Extra credit: Tannins, those sometimes bitter or astringent notes, often very pleasant in well-balanced wines, come from grape skins. You won’t find tannins in a white wine.
Try These
El Terrano Tempranillo
Dark fruit aromas, loads of blackberry and currant flavors. Wild herbs in the mouthwatering finish.
Monterustico Rosso
Amazing quality from one of the best producers out there. Intense structure. More, please.
Criterion Coonawarra Cabernet Sauvignon
Grilling steak or ribs? Try this. Cherry, black plum, hint of eucalyptus. Quintessential complexity.
White Wines
Color
Near clear to honey
Common Flavors
White fruits, tropical fruits, citrus, peaches, butter, honey, vanilla, chalky minerality, white pepper — and many more.
Minimal grape skin contact allows room for the juice in a white wine to speak more clearly, subtle notes taking on greater significance. Because flaws in color or flavor are difficult to mask, a delicate hand is highly prized in the making of white wines.
Extra credit: Broadly speaking, as vineyards move farther north, they produce wines with more acidity, creating crisp, refreshing, mouthwatering white wines. 
Try These
Andover Estate Chardonnay
Beautifully balances between apricot flavors, buttery notes and a crisp finish. Super food-friendly.
El Terrano Albariño
Zippy, fresh. Saline minerality. Yes to paella, grilled shrimp or tapas. You can’t find it anywhere else.
Criterion Pinot Grigio Friuli Grave
An ideal example of pinot grigio. Peachy, juicy, crisp — perfect with seafood, light pasta or risotto.
Rosé Wines
Color
Gentle pink to light orange
Common Flavors
Strawberry, raspberry, cranberry, pomegranate, pink grapefruit, red currant, watermelon
Rosé wines came about as a way to quench a French summer thirst, like a white wine, but with a flavorful nod to the red wines that France highly treasures. Today, Rosés are on fire, making up nearly 40% of all wine purchases, and rightfully so — they’ve thrown off their “sweet and simple” shackles and are unabashedly delicious.
Extra credit: In the most common method, very short contact times with grape skins (1-2 days, as opposed to weeks for Reds) are dialed in by Rosé makers to get just the profile they want. Secondary method: Sometimes winemakers, wanting a denser red wine, will siphon off some early pink juice. This pink juice is then made into Rosé. 
Try These
Globerati Rosé
Crisp, delicate. Notes of wild strawberry. Perfect match for pork loin, rich salads, aged soft cheeses.
Innovación Malbec-Syrah Rosé
Fresh strawberries, blackberries. Light and elegant finish. More than 6 glasses of wine per 1-liter bottle!
El Terrano Rosado
Sipping feels like diving into a bowl of fresh raspberries and strawberries. Pair with goat cheese, tapas, pork chops. 
Bubbly
“Always have a backup bottle of bubbly on hand.” – Doug Bell, Global Beverage Buyer
Bubbly exists in its own world, apart from all other wines in both style and winemaking process. 
And…it’s a blast! The key players:
Champagne
To be called Champagne, it must be from the same named region of France. The most complex of the bunch, often with tantalizing notes of fresh-baked brioche, and running the spectrum from brut (driest) to demi-sec (a dessert Sparkler!), there’s a reason it’s the King of Bubbly. 
Prosecco
Italy’s offering to the world of sparkling wine is the fastest growing style in the category. While it lacks the complexity of its French counterpart, it makes up for it with reliably vibrant peach and apricot notes. And prosecco bubbles are famously unstoppable!
Cava
Spain’s Sparkler, because it is in-bottle fermented like Champagne, shares more in common with its French counterpart than prosecco. Almost always dry, cava often displays floral aromatics and citrus notes. 
Try These
Presto Prosecco
Pair with brunch. Crisp, lively. Apple and orange blossom notes. Touch of honey.

Madame Liberté Brut
A celebration bubbly! Zippy acidity, refreshing green apple notes. Touch of toast. Serve well chilled.

J. Lassalle Champagne Brut Premier Cru
A masterful example of a Grower Champagne. Refined, crisp. White peach and a graceful floral component. 
The Criterion® Line
Certain regions of the world are famous for a specific style of wine, like malbec from Argentina, sauvignon blanc from New Zealand or syrah from Australia. Have you ever wanted to know exactly what these sought-after wines are supposed to taste like? Our Criterion line of wines answers that question, with each wine providing a reference point for just how a wine from that region should taste. Each wine is an educational guide — the tastiest one you’ll ever try!
How to Store Your Wine
For short-term storage, keep your unopened wine bottles in a cool, dark place with a constant temperature — the main thing is to avoid big temperature changes. A closet, cabinet or under the bed works well here, ideally under 75°F. For long-term storage, wine is best when laid on its side (especially if it has a cork — otherwise the cork will dry out), in a cool, dark place between 55 and 60°F.
Cooking with Wine
