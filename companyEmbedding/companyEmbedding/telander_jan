The computations model developed focuses on dyssynchrony, a heart condition where some regions of the heart vary significantly in properties like internal muscle resistance, mass, or elastance.  Inertial effects are often assumed as negligible by cardiovascular models.  One primary function of this model is to investigate inertial effects as they relate to mechanical cardiac dyssynchrony.  An added dimension of this analysis is to observe the thermodynamics of the cardiac cycle as one long term indicator of heart failure.  This model was developed using an electrical analog to the hemodynamic system.  The parameters of a heart wall segment were represented by resistance, inductance, and capacitance.  The calculations were done using state space and programmed into Matlab for simulation. This research shows waveforms of volume outputs as well as pressure volume loops for synchronous waveforms as well as dyssychronous waveforms caused by a time delay, varied resistance, varied elastance, and varied mass.  The variation seen in the mass dyssynchrony waveforms suggest that inertial effect may be a significant factor in modeled cardiovascular systems.Authors: Erin Telander, Andrew McNally, Matthew Korpela, Matthew HudsonOrganizationsSociety of Women Engineers  - MNProfessional Development Chair, Newsletter ChairStarting June 2012Received National Level Award in 2015Received Regional Level Award in 2013-2015Received State Level Award in 2013-2015SWEnet (Society of Women Engineers - Medtronic)Outreach ChairJanuary 2012  –  December 2014American Society for Engineering Educators (ASEE)Starting May 2010American Society for Quality Young Professional Engineers (ASQ)Starting January 2012SkillsISO 13485Quality SystemMedical DevicesDesign ControlMinitabDesign of ExperimentsSPCCAPAGage R&RProcess CapabilityLabviewMicrosoft OfficeQuality AssuranceSupplier QualityHow's this translation?Great•Has errorsThanks for your help!EducationMinnesota State University, MankatoBachelors of Science In Engineering, MechanicalBachelors of Science In Engineering, Mechanical2009  –  2011ProjectsDyssynchrony – Cardiovascular Engineering Project                                    	                 •Modeled the thermodynamics of cardiac dyssynchrony by implementing and improving both a model of the circulatory system and a stacked model of the dyssynchronous heart.

Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"









More Testimonials





From the Press
Gizmodo.com
"It found my photos on Flickr, my Amazon wishlist, my public Foursquare records, Vimeo, Picassa, and Stumbleupon accounts. It grabbed approximately twelve bajillion photos of me (with many, many false positives) and even more web links."


From the Press
U.S. News & World Report
"BeenVerified easily and inexpensively provides access to public records information through its website and several mobile phone applications. No longer are large corporations the only ones who can afford background checks."


From the Press
NBC 6 Miami
