FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Forward-Looking
Statements

Certain
matters discussed in this report, excluding historical information,
as well as some statements by ETP Retail Holdings, LLC and its
subsidiaries (the “Company”) in periodic press releases
and some oral statements of Company officials during presentations
about the Company, include forward-looking statements. These
forward-looking statements are identified as any statement that
does not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Statements
using words such as “anticipate,”
“project,” “expect,” “plan,”
“goal,” “forecast,” “estimate,”
“intend,” “continue,”
“believe,” “may,” “will” or
similar expressions help identify forward-looking statements.
Although the Company believes such forward-looking statements are
based on reasonable assumptions and current expectations and
projections about future events, no assurance can be given that
such assumptions, expectations, or projections will prove to be
correct. Forward-looking statements are subject to a variety of
risks, uncertainties and assumptions. If one or more of these risks
or uncertainties materialize, or if underlying assumptions prove
incorrect, the Company’s actual results may vary materially
from those anticipated, projected, forecasted, estimated or
expressed in forward-looking statements since many of the factors
that determine these results are subject to uncertainties and risks
that are difficult to predict and beyond management’s
control. For additional discussion of risks, uncertainties and
assumptions, see “Part II — Item 1A. Risk
Factors” herein.

Operations
and Organization:




ETP
Retail Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, (the
“Company”) is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of
ETP formed in May 2014. In June 2014, the equity interests in
multiple entities were contributed to the Company, including (a)
100% of the membership interests in Sunoco LLC, (b) a 99%
membership interest in ETC M-A Acquisition, which owned 100% of the
membership interests in MACS and (c) a non-controlling membership
interest in PES comprising 33% of PES’ outstanding common
units (collectively, the “Contributed
Businesses”).

Sunoco
LLC was formed by Sunoco in June 2014, at which time Sunoco
contributed certain retail assets (the “Contributed
Assets”) of its subsidiaries to Sunoco LLC. Pursuant to the
contribution agreement, Sunoco contributed substantially all of its
wholesale motor fuel distribution business which
included:




 



 


 





•



dealer,
distributor and fuel supply agreements,


 





 



 





•



fuel
supply agreements to distribute motor fuel to Sunoco convenience
stores and other retail fuel outlets,





 



 


 





•



real
property owned in fee,


 





 



 


 





•



leases and
subleases under which it was a tenant, and


 





 



 


 





•



leases and
subleases under which it was a landlord.


 












All of
the Contributed Assets were recorded at book value as this
transaction was considered to be a reorganization of entities under
common control. As discussed above, Sunoco contributed its interest
in Sunoco LLC to the Company in June 2014. Sunoco was acquired by
ETP in October 2012.

In
October 2014, Sunoco LP, a publicly traded master limited
partnership, acquired MACS from ETC M-A Acquisition in a
transaction valued at $768 million (the “MACS
Transaction”). The transaction included company-operated
retail convenience stores and dealer-operated and consignment
sites, which had originally been acquired by ETC M-A Acquisition in
October 2013. The consideration paid by Sunoco LP consisted of
3,983,540 Sunoco LP common units and $556 million in
cash.

In April
2015, Sunoco LP acquired a 31.58% equity interest and 50.1% voting
interest in Sunoco LLC from the Company for $816 million (the
“Sunoco LLC Transaction”). Sunoco LP paid $775 million
in cash and issued 795,482 Sunoco LP common units to the Company.
As a result of the Sunoco LLC Transaction, the Company no longer
has a controlling interest in Sunoco LLC, therefore all of the
Sunoco LLC operations were deconsolidated as of April 1,
2015.

Effective
January 1, 2016, ETP contributed 100% of the equity interests in
Sunoco Retail to the Company. Sunoco Retail’s assets included
(i) the retail assets and the ethanol plant located in Fulton, NY
formerly owned by Sunoco R&M, (ii) the retail assets formerly
owned by Atlantic Refining and Marketing Corp; and (iii) 100% of
the membership interests in Sunmarks LLC.

Effective
January 1, 2016, the Company contributed to Sunoco LP the remaining
68.42% membership interest and 49.9% voting interest in Sunoco LLC
and 100% of the membership interest in Sunoco Retail for $2.2
billion in cash (including working capital) and the issuance to the
Company of 5,710,922 Sunoco LP common units (the “Sunoco
Retail Transaction”). Concurrently with the execution of the
transaction, the Company distributed the $2.2 billion in cash to
Sunoco R&M and Atlantic Refining & Marketing Corp in the
amount of $2 billion and $0.2 billion , respectively (the
“R&M and Atlantic Distribution”). In exchange for
the R&M and Atlantic Distribution, Sunoco R&M and Atlantic
Refining & Marketing Corp agreed to provide support to the
Company related to the Company’s guarantee of the Term Loan
Facility.

Through
its membership interest in Sunoco LLC, the Company was primarily
engaged in the wholesale distribution of motor fuels to Sunoco
R&M and third parties in the United States. Sunoco R&M
operated convenience stores and retail fuel outlets under the
proprietary Sunoco brand, primarily in the east coast and southeast
regions of the United States. Through its membership interest in
Sunoco LLC, the Company also distributed motor fuel to
Sunoco-branded retail fuel outlets operated by third parties under
long-term contracts and supplied other commercial customers on a
spot or short-term contract basis.

Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies:


 












Basis of
Presentation and Principles of Consolidation

The
unaudited financial information included in this Form 10-Q has been
prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in conformity with
GAAP. In the opinion of the Company’s management, such
financial information reflects all adjustments necessary for a fair
presentation of the financial position and the results of
operations for such interim periods in accordance with GAAP. All
intercompany items and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation. Certain information and footnote disclosures
normally included in annual consolidated financial statements
prepared in accordance with GAAP have been omitted pursuant to the
rules and regulations of the SEC.

Sunoco
allocated various corporate overhead expenses to the Contributed
Assets based on percentage of property, plant and equipment, cost
of goods sold, margin and headcount. These allocations are not
necessarily indicative of the cost that the Contributed Assets
would have incurred by operating as an independent stand-alone
entity. As such, the consolidated financial statements may not
fully reflect what the Contributed Assets’ financial
position, results of operations and cash flows would have been had
the Contributed Assets operated as a stand-alone company during the
periods presented.

Use of
Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements.  Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

New
Accounting Pronouncements

In
February 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No.
2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the
Consolidation Analysis (“ASU 2015-02”), which
changed the requirements for consolidations analysis. Under ASU
2015-02, reporting entities are required to evaluate whether they
should consolidate certain legal entities. The Company adopted this
standard on January 1, 2016, and the adoption did not impact the
Company’s financial position or results of
operations.

Cash

The
Company considers cash and cash equivalents to include investments
with original maturities of three months or less.

Investments
in Unconsolidated Affiliates

The
Company owns interests in Sunoco LP and PES that are accounted for
by the equity method for which the Company exercises significant
influence over, but does not control, the investee’s
operating and financial policies.

Revenue
Recognition

During
the periods presented, the Company derived revenue from the sale of
fuel. Revenue was recognized at the time of sale or when fuel was
delivered to the customer.

Refined
product exchange transactions, which are entered into primarily to
acquire refined products of a desired quantity or at a desired
location, are netted in cost of products sold in the consolidated
statements of operations.

Motor
Fuel Taxes

Consumer
excise taxes on sales of refined products are excluded from both
revenues and costs and expenses in the consolidated statements of
operations, with no effect on net income.

Table of

Income
Taxes

Income
taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method as if
the Company were a separate taxpayer during the period that its
operations were included as part of a federal consolidated tax
return filing group with its parent company. Under this method,
deferred tax assets and liabilities of the Company are recognized
for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax
rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences
are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in
earnings in the period that includes the enactment date.

Valuation
allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax
assets to the amounts more likely than not to be realized. The
determination of the provision for income taxes requires
significant judgment, use of estimates, and the interpretation and
application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required
in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items
and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The
benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in the financial
statements only after determining a more-likely-than-not
probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand
challenge, if any, from taxing authorities. Then, the tax benefit
recognized is the largest amount of benefit, determined on a
cumulative probability basis, which is more likely than not to be
realized upon ultimate settlement. When facts and circumstances
change, the Company reassesses these probabilities and record any
changes through the provision for income taxes.

Under the
separate entity method, the Company is assumed to file a separate
return with the taxing authority, thereby reporting its taxable
income or loss and paying the applicable tax to or receiving the
appropriate refund from its parent. However, since there is no
tax-sharing agreement in place between the Company and its parent,
any taxes payable or receivable on current taxable income or loss
at the end of each reporting date is treated as a capital
contribution or dividend.

The
Company’s investment in PES is treated as a partnership for
federal and state income tax purposes. Since income taxes are not
provided for partnerships, no income taxes are reflected in the
financial statements for those operations.

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments

The
carrying amounts recorded for advances to affiliated companies and
accrued and other current liabilities in the consolidated financial
statements approximate fair value because of the short-term
maturity of the instruments.

Investments
in Unconsolidated Affiliates:




PES

The
Company’s investment in PES consists of a non-controlling
membership interest in PES comprising 33% of PES’ outstanding
common units. PES is a joint venture with The Carlyle Group, L.P.
(“The Carlyle Group”), which owns two crude oil
refining facilities in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and an adjacent
crude oil rail unloading terminal.

Sunoco
LP

At
September 30, 2016, the Company’s investment in Sunoco LP
consists of 10,489,944 Sunoco LP common units, representing
approximately 11% of the total outstanding Sunoco LP common units
at September 30, 2016.
