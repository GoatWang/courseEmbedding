   NNN PROPERTIES
Tenant Credit Ratings



What are NNN Properties?
NNN Properties are typically free standing buildings that are leased to tenants for a 10 to 25 year term.  NNN Properties offer the benefit of little or no management responsibilities as the tenant pays for all, if not most of the expenses. The investor receives their rent with little to no other involvement.
Tenants in NNN Properties are divided by both quality and type of businesses they are in.  Qualitatively NNN Properties have either credit or non credit tenants.  The most desirable (least risk) NNN Properties have investment grade (rated BBB- and better) credit tenants.

Non credit tenant NNN Properties have tenants that are not credit rated.  These tenants frequently are regional or local businesses or companies that are unrated.  Some tenants are considered credit worthy yet are unrated because they carry no debt on their books.  Click Tenant Ratings for list of tenants for NNN Properties.
Who Buys NNN Properties?
NNN Properties are appealing to those who wish to have outright ownership of their commercial real estate investments and have little to no management responsibility.  The alternative ways of owning non management commercial real estate would be to own a security in the form of a mutual fund or REIT or invest in fractional ownership Tenant in Common properties.

A major advantage of 100% direct ownership is control and the ability to defer future capital gains by doing a 1031 exchange when the property is sold.  For many investors the lack of immediate liquidity inherent in NNN Properties is offset by the lack of volatility NNN Properties offer when compared to a securitized investment.   Investors should carefully consider their need for liquidity when considering investing in NNN Properties.
How are NNN Properties Valued?
NNN Properties typically are valued using their Capitalization Rate also referred to as Cap Rate. NNN Properties cap rates reflects the value of a stream of economic benefits discounted for time and risk. Generally this is computed as a pretax cap rate using the Net Operating Income (NOI) for NNN Properties.

NOI is income less all expenses before debt service. The Cap Rate is the NOI divided by the purchase price for NNN Properties. Conversely the NOI divided by the Cap Rate will equal the purchase or selling price.
Example of Cap Rates for NNN Properties:
NOI = $100,000/10%=$1,000,000 Purchase or Selling Price
NOI = $100,000/$1,000,000=10% Cap Rate
How are Cap Rates Determined for NNN Properties?
Some of the major considerations when calculating Cap Rates for NNN Properties are:

 The credit worthiness of the tenant.
 The length of the lease, typically 10 to 25 years.
 The type of lease, triple net (NNN) or double net (NN). See below for definition.
 Type and frequency of bumps or increases if any in rent.
 Cost of financing
 Strength of the demographics of the property location
 Nature of the improvements. Are the improvements easily converted for another tenant or are they special purpose that would require significant expense and time to convert before re tenanting?
 Age and condition of the improvements
The more positive the above factors for NNN Properties, the lower the Cap Rate or the higher the value of the property related to its income stream. Conversely if the above factors for NNN Properties are weak the Cap Rate will be higher and the resulting value will be lower reflecting the greater risk of the investment.

It is important to remember that markets are not perfect and low Cap Rate NNN Properties are  not necessary a lower risk investment, they could simply be a bad investment that is over priced.  Astute investors seek NNN Properties that are mispriced in their favor, namely a higher Cap Rate for a property that has lower risk factors.
What is Build-to-Suit?
In a build-to-suit the landlord builds the improvements for the tenant and the tenant leases them back typically on a Net Lease.  The Net Lease rent payable by the tenant is a function of the construction and financing costs of the project.  This arrangement allows the tenant to move in and occupy the property with zero initial cost.

The Net Lease rent is fully deductible over the lease term, making the tenant's after-tax cost less than with alternative forms of asset-based financing.
What is a Ground Lease?
A ground lease is a method for separating ownership of the improvements (building) from the ownership of the underlying fee (ground). Typically ground leases are long term Net Leases where the tenant pays all expenses except debt service.
  Any financing for the improvements are paid for by the tenant.  In some cases the ground lease is subordinated to the debt on the improvements.

On unsubordinated ground lease, no lien is placed against the fee simple title to the land. Instead, the leasehold estate is the primary security for any debt on the improvements.  There is no depreciation with the ownership of a ground lease.
Many investors favor ground leases because they don't need to use their own funds to build the improvements yet end up owning the improvements on termination of the lease.  When the Net Lease ends the improvements revert to the owner of the ground lease the owner benefits from the full rent for both the land and the improvements.
Tenants like ground leases because they reduce the tenant's cost of development by eliminating land acquisition costs.  A long term Net Lease provides predictable rent payments that are deductible by the tenant for federal and state income tax purposes.
Typically ground leases are long term Net Leases and include set rent escalations, foreclosure rights and reversionary right (improvements revert to owner of ground lease at termination of the lease).
What is a Sale Leaseback?
A Real estate sale leaseback is when a business sells its commercial property for current market value and then leases it back typically using a Net Lease.  The seller retains the use of their real estate and frees up capital which can be used to invest back into the business.  
Real estate sale leasebacks are popular because they generate capital for immediate use within the business.

A long term Net Lease on a sale leaseback create a predictable rent that is deductible for federal and state income tax purposes Some businesses do sale and leaseback transactions for equipment as well.
Types Net Leases
NNN Properties are generally categorized as either true triple net (NNN) or double net (NN).  The distinction between NNN and NN leases is an important one as can be seen in the following definitions.
Absolute Triple Net (NNN)
The tenant pays operating expenses such as maintenance, repairs, taxes and replacement for the entire property, without limitation. The owners pay the mortgage only. This is the type of lease that most investors expect when purchasing NNN Properties.
Bond Lease (NNN)
A bond lease is a slight variation on the true triple NNN lease because the tenant is required to absolutely comply with their rent and operating expense obligations regardless of extenuating circumstances affecting the property (i.e. Even if the property is under eminent domain proceedings).  
Double Net Lease  (NN)
Similar to NNN leases but with additional owner responsibilities. The owner is generally liable for the structural components of the building such as the roof, foundation, load-bearing walls and parking.  Leases will vary so they should be carefully read.
Net Lease Alternative
For investors considering NNN Properties but who would like to invest less capital (cash) and still have little to no management responsibilities Fractional Ownership can be a good option to consider.
Advantages of Fractional Properties are the lower minimum investment (starting at $100,000), greater diversification, prepackaged financing (if any) and due diligence material.  Unlike a stock, or bond Fractional Ownership can qualify for 1031 and 1033 exchanges providing they follow IRS guidelines.

The Value of Property Ratings

The Property Vault® rating system quantifies key drivers to value to quickly identify and match the best properties to investor’s unique needs. Hundreds of properties are rated each week to identify both their short and long term strengths and weaknesses. Ratings are based in-depth analysis of stability of cash flows, potential appreciation, demographic trends, supply & demand studies, local economic conditions, traffic patterns, tenant credit, lease terms, pricing, cap rate, nature of improvements and other key value drivers.
The ratings and property characteristics are then matched to each investor’s risk tolerance and objectives and needs. Email and text message notices are automatically sent to investors giving them the ability to quickly respond to their desired property match. Objective analytic reports and data are supplied for all rated properties. Key drivers to value can be easily compared using the Property Vault® “Compare Favorites” feature to assist investors in making their final investment decision.

Client Case Study



Recently I decided to it was time to sell three manufactured housing communities that I owned for a number of years. I was tired of dealing with tenants, the constant upkeep and repair and did not feel positive about the direction of the industry as a whole. In order to avoid paying over 3/4 of a million dollars in capital gains, my accountant advised me to do a 1031 exchange.
TM 1031 Exchange was recommended to me by my broker at Clear Point Financial. They located all three of the replacement properties (Verizon Wireless, Jiffy Lube, and a 14,000 sq. ft. medical office building.
I feel these properties are far superior investments than anything I could find on my own. The Property Vault was a tremendous help in sorting out and comparing properties and investment potential. TM 1031 negotiated the purchase with the sellers, arranged for the Facilitator, assisted with obtaining the needed loans and the due diligence. They were able to put me in touch with very competent legal counsel who were critical in closing the transactions in each geographic location where the properties are located.
Because I had to sell my properties and close properties in three different states while staying in compliance with the strict IRS regulations and timelines in regards to exchanges, this was not a simple transaction. TM 1031 made the whole process as smooth as possible and I would highly recommend them to other investors.

The distributions are payable on January 3, 2017 to shareholders of record on December 12, 2016, with an ex-dividend date of December 8, 2016.              Fund   NYSE Symbol   Monthly Distribution Per Share   PIMCO Corporate & Income Strategy Fund   (  NYSE :  PCN )   $ 0.112500   PIMCO Corporate & Income Opportunity Fund   (  NYSE :  PTY )   $ 0.130000   PIMCO Global StocksPLUS® & Income Fund   (  NYSE :  PGP )   $ 0.146680   PIMCO High Income Fund   (  NYSE :  PHK )   $ 0.103460   PIMCO Income Opportunity Fund   (  NYSE :  PKO )   $ 0.190000   PIMCO Strategic Income Fund, Inc.   (  NYSE :  RCS )   $ 0.080000   PCM Fund, Inc.   (  NYSE :  PCM )   $ 0.080000   PIMCO Income Strategy Fund   (  NYSE :  PFL )   $ 0.090000   PIMCO Income Strategy Fund II   (  NYSE :  PFN )   $ 0.080000   PIMCO Dynamic Income Fund   (  NYSE :  PDI )   $ 0.220500   PIMCO Dynamic Credit and Mortgage Income Fund   (  NYSE :  PCI )   $ 0.164063   PIMCO Municipal Income Fund   (  NYSE :  PMF )   $ 0.081250   PIMCO California Municipal Income Fund   (  NYSE :  PCQ )   $ 0.077000   PIMCO New York Municipal Income Fund   (  NYSE :  PNF )   $ 0.057000   PIMCO Municipal Income Fund II   (  NYSE :  PML )   $ 0.065000   PIMCO California Municipal Income Fund II   (  NYSE :  PCK )   $ 0.047300   PIMCO New York Municipal Income Fund II   (  NYSE :  PNI )   $ 0.066250   PIMCO Municipal Income Fund III   (  NYSE :  PMX )   $ 0.062300   PIMCO California Municipal Income Fund III   (  NYSE :  PZC )   $ 0.060000   PIMCO New York Municipal Income Fund III   (  NYSE :  PYN )   $ 0.052500              Distributions from PMF, PML, PMX, PCQ, PCK, PZC, PNF, PNI and PYN are generally exempt from regular Federal income taxes. In addition, distributions from PCQ, PCK and PZC are also generally exempt from California state income taxes, and distributions from PNF, PNI and PYN are generally exempt from New York State and city income taxes. There can be no assurance that all distributions paid by these Funds will be exempt from federal income taxes or applicable state or local income taxes.Distributions may include ordinary income, net capital gains and/or returns of capital. Generally, a return of capital occurs when the amount distributed by a Fund includes a portion of (or is comprised entirely of) your investment in the Fund in addition to (or rather than) your pro-rata portion of the Fund's net income or capital gains. A Fund's distributions in any period may be more or less than the net return earned by the Fund on its investments, and therefore should not be used as a measure of performance or confused with "yield" or "income." A return of capital is not taxable; rather it reduces a shareholder's tax basis in his or her shares of the Fund. If a Fund estimates that a portion of its distribution may be comprised of amounts from sources other than net investment income, such Fund will notify shareholders of the estimated composition of such distribution through a separate written notice. Such notices are provided for informational purposes only, and should not be used for tax reporting purposes. Final tax characteristics of all Fund distributions will be provided on Form 1099-DIV, which is mailed after the close of the calendar year.It is important to note that differences exist between a Fund's daily internal accounting records, a Fund's financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and recordkeeping practices under income tax regulations. It is possible that a Fund may not issue a Section 19 Notice in situations where the Fund's financial statements prepared later and in accordance with U.S. GAAP or the final tax character of those distributions might later report that the sources of those distributions included capital gains and/or a return of capital. Please see the Funds' most recent shareholder reports for more details.A Fund's distribution rate may be affected by numerous factors, including changes in realized and projected market returns, Fund performance, and other factors. There can be no assurance that a change in market conditions or other factors will not result in a change in a Fund distribution rate at a future time.Certain Funds may engage in investment strategies, including the use of derivatives, to, among other things, generate current, distributable income, even if such strategies could potentially result in declines in the Fund's net asset value. A Fund's income and gain-generating strategies, including certain derivatives strategies, may generate current income and gains taxable as ordinary income sufficient to support monthly distributions even in situations when the Fund has experienced a decline in net assets due to, for example, adverse changes in the broad U.S. or non-U.S. equity markets or the Fund's debt investments, or arising from its use of derivatives. A Fund may enter into opposite sides of interest rate swap and other derivatives for the principal purpose of generating distributable gains on the one side (characterized as ordinary income for tax purposes) that are not part of the Fund's duration or yield curve management strategies ("paired swap transactions"), with a substantial possibility that the Fund will later realize a corresponding capital loss and potential decline in net asset value with respect to the opposite side transaction (to the extent it does not have corresponding offsetting capital gains). Consequently, common shareholders may receive distributions and owe tax at a time when their investment in the Fund has declined in value, which tax may be at ordinary income rates, and which may be economically similar to a taxable return of capital. The tax treatment of certain derivatives may be open to different interpretations. Any recharacterization of payments made or received by a Fund pursuant to derivatives potentially could affect the amount, timing or character of Fund distributions. In addition, the tax treatment of such investment strategies may be changed by regulation or otherwise.Read MoreAs with any stock, the price of a Fund's common shares will fluctuate with market conditions and other factors. Shares of closed-end management investment companies frequently trade at a price that is less than (a "discount") or more than (a "premium") from their net asset value. If a Fund's shares trade at a premium to net asset value, there is no assurance that any such premium will be sustained for any period of time and will not decrease, or that the shares will not trade at a discount to net asset value thereafter.The Funds' daily New York Stock Exchange closing market prices, net asset values per share, as well as other information, including updated portfolio statistics and performance are available at pimco.com/closedendfunds or by calling the Funds' shareholder servicing agent at (844) 33-PIMCO. Updated portfolio holdings information about a Fund will be available approximately 15 calendar days after such Fund's most recent fiscal quarter end, and will remain accessible until such Fund files a Form N-Q or a shareholder report for the period which includes the date of the information.About PIMCOPIMCO is a leading global investment management firm with offices in 12 countries throughout North America, Europe and Asia.

The Value of Property Ratings

The Property Vault® rating system quantifies key drivers to value to quickly identify and match the best properties to investor’s unique needs. Hundreds of properties are rated each week to identify both their short and long term strengths and weaknesses. Ratings are based in-depth analysis of stability of cash flows, potential appreciation, demographic trends, supply & demand studies, local economic conditions, traffic patterns, tenant credit, lease terms, pricing, cap rate, nature of improvements and other key value drivers.
The ratings and property characteristics are then matched to each investor’s risk tolerance and objectives and needs. Email and text message notices are automatically sent to investors giving them the ability to quickly respond to their desired property match. Objective analytic reports and data are supplied for all rated properties. Key drivers to value can be easily compared using the Property Vault® “Compare Favorites” feature to assist investors in making their final investment decision.

Client Case Study



Recently I decided to it was time to sell three manufactured housing communities that I owned for a number of years. I was tired of dealing with tenants, the constant upkeep and repair and did not feel positive about the direction of the industry as a whole. In order to avoid paying over 3/4 of a million dollars in capital gains, my accountant advised me to do a 1031 exchange.
TM 1031 Exchange was recommended to me by my broker at Clear Point Financial. They located all three of the replacement properties (Verizon Wireless, Jiffy Lube, and a 14,000 sq. ft. medical office building.
I feel these properties are far superior investments than anything I could find on my own. The Property Vault was a tremendous help in sorting out and comparing properties and investment potential. TM 1031 negotiated the purchase with the sellers, arranged for the Facilitator, assisted with obtaining the needed loans and the due diligence. They were able to put me in touch with very competent legal counsel who were critical in closing the transactions in each geographic location where the properties are located.
Because I had to sell my properties and close properties in three different states while staying in compliance with the strict IRS regulations and timelines in regards to exchanges, this was not a simple transaction. TM 1031 made the whole process as smooth as possible and I would highly recommend them to other investors.
