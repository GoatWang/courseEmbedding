Amazing Customer Service

Outstanding customer service!
After receiving the runaround and otherwise lackluster customer service at other dealerships, I was ready to throw in the towel.
I called BMW of SF and received the best service from Nyomi.
She actually listened to what I had to say and ensured my buying experience exceeded my expectations.
Even the Finance Manager Raquel went above and beyond to find me an outstanding interest rate (much lower than the same bank quoted me), I don't typically write reviews, but wanted to pass on my recommendation for BMW of SF and Nyomi B.!

In late Feb 2007 (Feb 26), I became aware of BMW's March 01 price increases.  As I wanted to do European delivery in May, I decided to email local BMW dealers for a price quote immediately, rather than wait until late March.  My email listed the 335i E90 car specs and desired ED date.   Later that day, the internet manager at BMW SF was the first to reply, with an offer that met my target price.  So on Feb 27, I accepted the deal with BMW SF, and faxed my lease application.  A week or so later, I rec'd a production number and confirmed ED date.   My prior CA (client advisor in BMW-speak) at another Bay Area BMW dealer replied after 4 days, thus locking me into the price increase.  Plus, his offer was way over my target price.  Other dealers wouldn't state a price, and wanted me to come into the dealership.   In early May (about 2-3 weeks prior to the ED date), I finally met my new CA when I went in to sign the purchase order and lease paperwork.  The car was picked up in Munich on May 22.  After a nearly two week vacation in the Italian lake district and the south of France (during the Cannes film festival and Monaco GP), the car was dropped off in Paris on June 1.  Car was redelivered on July 23.

A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this release.KEY RATING DRIVERSThe rating affirmations of the Class A notes reflect loss coverage levels consistent with their current ratings. Hard credit enhancement (CE) has grown since close, credit losses have been within Fitch's initial expectations, and residual performance has recorded cumulative gains. The Stable Outlooks reflect Fitch's expectation that the notes will remain sufficiently enhanced to cover stressed credit and residual loss levels consistent with an 'AAAsf' rating.RATING SENSITIVITIESUnanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults or deterioration in vehicle values could produce loss levels higher than the current expectations and impact available loss coverage. Lower loss coverage could impact ratings and Rating Outlooks, depending on the extent of the decline in coverage.To date, the transaction has exhibited strong credit and residual performance, inside Fitch's initial expectations with rising loss coverage. Due to the growing CE levels and increased loss coverage afforded to the notes, a substantial deterioration in used vehicle values would have to occur to have a negative impact on the updated ratings.USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10Form ABS Due Diligence-15E was not provided to, or reviewed by, Fitch in relation to this rating action.Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:--Class A-3 notes at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--Class A-4 notes at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.Additional information is available at www.fitchratings.com.Applicable CriteriaCounterparty Criteria for Structured Finance and Covered Bonds (pub. 01 Sep 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/886006Criteria for Rating U.S. Auto Lease ABS (pub. 24 Mar 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/879019Global Structured Finance Rating Criteria (pub. 27 Jun 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/883130Rating Criteria for U.S. Auto Loan ABS (pub. 21 Mar 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/878723Additional DisclosuresDodd-Frank Rating Information Disclosure Formhttps://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/press_releases/content/ridf_frame.cfm?pr_id=1014698Solicitation Statushttps://www.fitchratings.com/gws/en/disclosure/solicitation?pr_id=1014698Endorsement Policyhttps://www.fitchratings.com/regulatoryALL FITCH CREDIT RATINGS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS.

      Fitch Affirms BMW Vehicle Lease Trust 2015-1
    





November 11, 2016 04:55 PM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has affirmed BMW Vehicle Lease Trust 2015-1. A full list 
      of rating actions follows at the end of this release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The rating affirmations of the Class A notes reflect loss coverage 
      levels consistent with their current ratings. Hard credit enhancement 
      (CE) has grown since close, credit losses have been within Fitch's 
      initial expectations, and residual performance has recorded cumulative 
      gains. The Stable Outlooks reflect Fitch's expectation that the notes 
      will remain sufficiently enhanced to cover stressed credit and residual 
      loss levels consistent with an 'AAAsf' rating.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults or deterioration in 
      vehicle values could produce loss levels higher than the current 
      expectations and impact available loss coverage. Lower loss coverage 
      could impact ratings and Rating Outlooks, depending on the extent of the 
      decline in coverage.
    

      To date, the transaction has exhibited strong credit and residual 
      performance, inside Fitch's initial expectations with rising loss 
      coverage. Due to the growing CE levels and increased loss coverage 
      afforded to the notes, a substantial deterioration in used vehicle 
      values would have to occur to have a negative impact on the updated 
      ratings.
    

      USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10
    

      Form ABS Due Diligence-15E was not provided to, or reviewed by, Fitch in 
      relation to this rating action.
    

      Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:
    

      --Class A-3 notes at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-4 notes at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.

      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative

Fitch Rates BMW Vehicle Lease Trust 2015-2
Tweet


Print



      Fitch Ratings has assigned the following ratings and Outlooks to the 
      notes issued by BMW Vehicle Lease Trust 2015-2:
    

      --$171,000,000 class A-1 asset-backed notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --$250,000,000 class A-2A asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$190,000,000 class A-2B asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$308,000,000 class A-3 asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$81,000,000 class A-4 asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Stable Collateral Quality: The pool is consistent with that of 2015-1. 
      Securitized residuals comprise 71.51% of the pool and the 3 Series 
      remains the top model at 22.8% of the pool. Seasoning is consistent at 
      10 months and the weighted average (WA) FICO score has increased to 776.
    

      Adequate Credit Enhancement (CE) Structure: Initial CE has decrease by 
      0.10% from 2015-1 and will be 17.05%. CE is composed of a 0.25% reserve 
      account and overcollateralization (OC) of 16.80% growing to a target of 
      18.95% of the initial securitization value (until class A-2 has been 
      paid in full, then the target OC drops to 17.95%). Initial excess spread 
      is 4.84% per annum.
    

      Strong Loss Performance: Credit and residuals performance on BMW FS's 
      portfolio has been strong in recent years. This is a result of robust 
      obligor credit quality and a strong wholesale used vehicle market, 
      leading to higher recovery rates and residuals realizations.
    

      Evolving Wholesale Market: The U.S. wholesale vehicle market has been 
      normalizing following strong performance in recent years. Fitch expects 
      that increasing off-lease vehicle supply and pressure from increased 
      production levels will lead to decreased residual realizations during 
      the life of the transaction.
    

      Stable Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: BMW FS demonstrates adequate 
      abilities as originator, underwriter and servicer, as evidenced by 
      historical portfolio delinquency and loss experience and securitization 
      performance.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of BMW FS would not impair the timeliness of 
      payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated decreases in the value of returned vehicles and/or 
      increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted 
      receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case and 
      would likely result in declines of CE and loss coverage levels available 
      to the notes. Hence, Fitch conducts sensitivity analyses by increasing 
      the transaction's initial base case RV and credit loss assumptions and 
      examining the rating implications on all classes of issued notes. The 
      increases to the base case losses are applied such that they represent 
      moderate (1.5x) and severe (2.5x) stresses, and are intended to provide 
      an indication of the rating sensitivity of notes to unexpected 
      deterioration of a trust's performance.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from KPMG, 
      LLP. The third-party due diligence focused on comparing or recalculating 
      certain information with respect to 100 receivables. Fitch considered 
      this information in its analysis and the findings did not have an impact 
      on our analysis/conclusions. A copy of the ABS Due Diligence Form-15E 
      received by Fitch in connection with this transaction may be obtained 
      through the link contained on the bottom of the related rating action 
      commentary.
    

      Fitch's analysis of the Representations and Warranties (R&W) of this 
      transaction can be found in 'BMW Lease Trust 2015-2 -Appendix'. These 
      R&Ws are compared to those of typical R&W for the asset class as 
      detailed in the special report 'Representations, Warranties, and 
      Enforcement Mechanisms in Global Structured Finance Transactions' dated 
      June 12, 2015.

of principal of and interest on, and any other amounts owing in
respect of, the Notes, equally and ratably without prejudice,
priority or distinction except as set forth herein, and to secure
compliance with the provisions of this Indenture, hereby Grants in
trust to the Indenture Trustee on the Closing Date, as trustee for
the benefit of the Noteholders, all of the Issuer’s right,
title and interest, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, in and
to (i) the Trust Estate and (ii) all present and future claims,
demands, causes and choses in action in respect of any or all of

terms are defined herein.

 

The foregoing Grant is made in
trust to secure the payment of principal of and interest on, and
any other amounts owing in respect of, the Notes, equally and

Exhibit A hereto are part of the terms of this
Indenture.

 

 Section
2.02      Execution, Authentication and
Delivery .  The Notes shall be executed by the Owner
Trustee on behalf of the Issuer.  The signature of any
authorized officer of the Owner Trustee on the Notes may be manual
or by facsimile.  Notes bearing the manual or facsimile
signature of individuals who were at any time authorized officers
of the Owner Trustee shall bind the Issuer, notwithstanding that
any such individuals have ceased to hold such offices prior to the
authentication and delivery of such Notes or did not hold such
offices at the date of such Notes.

 

The Indenture Trustee shall, upon
Issuer Order, authenticate and deliver for original issue the

Notes upon surrender of such temporary Notes at the office or
agency of the Issuer to be maintained as provided in Section 3.02,
without charge to the related Noteholder.  Upon surrender for
cancellation of any one or more temporary Notes, the Owner Trustee
shall execute, on behalf of the Issuer, and the Indenture Trustee
shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor, a like
principal amount of Definitive Notes of authorized
denominations.  Until so exchanged, such temporary Notes shall

Indenture as Definitive Notes.

 

 Section
2.04      Registration; Registration of Transfer
and Exchange .  The Issuer shall cause to be kept a
register (the “ Note Register ”) in which,

make such an appointment, assume the duties of Note
Registrar.

 

If a Person other than the
Indenture Trustee is appointed by the Issuer as Note Registrar, the

such appointment and the location, and any change in such location,
of the Note Register, and the Indenture Trustee shall have the
right to inspect the Note Register at all reasonable times and to
obtain copies thereof,

 


17






 

and the Indenture Trustee shall have
the right to rely upon a certificate executed on behalf of the Note
Registrar by an Executive Officer as to the names and addresses of
the Noteholders and the principal amounts and number of such Notes
until a replacement certificate is provided to it by the Note
Registrar.

 

Upon surrender for registration of
transfer of any Note at the office or agency of the Issuer to be

on behalf of the Issuer, and the Indenture Trustee shall
authenticate and the related Noteholder shall obtain from the
Indenture Trustee, in the name of the designated transferee, one or
more new Notes in any authorized denominations, of a like aggregate
principal amount.

 

At the option of the related
Noteholder, Notes may be exchanged for other Notes in any
authorized denominations, of a like aggregate principal amount,
upon surrender of such Notes at such office or agency. 
Whenever any Notes are so surrendered for exchange, if the
requirements of Section 8-401 of the UCC are met, the Owner Trustee
shall execute, on behalf of the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee shall
authenticate and the Noteholder shall obtain from the Indenture
Trustee the Notes that the Noteholder making such exchange is
entitled to receive.

 

Every Note presented or surrendered
for registration of transfer or exchange shall (if so required by
the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee) be duly endorsed, or be
accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form and
substance satisfactory to the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee,
duly executed by the Noteholder thereof or its attorney-in-fact
duly authorized in writing.

 

All Notes issued upon any
registration of transfer or exchange of Notes shall be the valid
obligations of the Issuer, evidencing the same debt and entitled to
the same benefits under this Indenture as the Notes surrendered
upon such registration of transfer or exchange.

 

No service charge shall be made to
a Noteholder for any registration of transfer or exchange of Notes,
but the Issuer may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any
tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection
therewith, other than exchanges pursuant to Sections 2.03 or 9.05
not involving any transfer.

may be transferred to an “employee benefit plan” within
the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA that is subject to ERISA, a
“plan” described in Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code, any
entity that is deemed to hold “plan assets” of any of
the foregoing by reason of an employee benefit plan’s or
other plan’s investment in such entity, or any governmental
or church plan subject to applicable law that is substantially
similar to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code, unless such transferee represents,
warrants and covenants that its purchase and holding of such note
will not result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code because it will
satisfy the requirements of an applicable prohibited transaction
exemption (or in the case of a governmental or church plan, will
not cause a non-exempt violation of any applicable law that is
substantially similar to ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code). 
By its acquisition of a Note in book-entry form or any interest
therein, each transferee will be deemed

 


18






 

to have represented, warranted and
covenanted that it satisfies the foregoing requirements and the
Indenture Trustee may relay conclusively on the same for purposes
hereof.

 

The preceding provisions of this
Section notwithstanding, the Issuer shall not be required to make,
and the Note Registrar need not register, transfers or exchanges of
any Note (i) selected for redemption or (ii) for a period of 15
days preceding the due date for any payment with respect to such
Note.

its satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Note and
(ii) there is delivered to the Indenture Trustee and the Issuer
such security or indemnity as may be required by it to hold the
Issuer and the Indenture Trustee harmless, then, in the absence of
notice to the Issuer, the Note Registrar or a Responsible Officer
of the Indenture Trustee that such Note has been acquired by a
“protected purchaser” (as contemplated by Article Eight
of the UCC), and provided that the requirements of Section 8-405 of
the UCC are met, the Owner Trustee shall execute, on behalf of the
Issuer, and upon Issuer Request the Indenture Trustee shall
authenticate and deliver, in exchange for or in lieu of any such
mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Note, a replacement Note;
provided, however, that if any such destroyed, lost or stolen Note
(but not a mutilated Note) shall have become or within seven days
shall become due and payable, or shall have been called for
redemption, instead of issuing a replacement Note, the Issuer may
pay such destroyed, lost or stolen Note when so due or payable or
upon the Redemption Date without the surrender thereof.  If,
after the delivery of such replacement Note or payment of a
destroyed, lost or stolen Note pursuant to the proviso to the
preceding sentence, a “protected purchaser” (as
contemplated by Article Eight of the UCC) of the original Note in
lieu of which such replacement Note was issued presents for payment
such original Note, the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee shall be
entitled to recover such replacement Note (or such payment) from
the Person to whom it was delivered or any Person taking such
replacement Note from such Person to whom such replacement Note was
delivered or any assignee of such Person, except a “protected
purchaser” (as contemplated by Article Eight of the UCC), and
shall be entitled to recover upon the security or indemnity
provided therefor to the extent of any loss, damage, cost or
expense incurred by the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee in
connection therewith.

 

Upon the issuance of any
replacement Note under this Section, the Issuer or the Indenture
Trustee may require the payment by the related Noteholder of a sum
sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may
be imposed in relation thereto and any other reasonable expenses
(including the fees and expenses of the Indenture Trustee or the
Note Registrar) connected therewith.

 

Every replacement Note issued
pursuant to this Section in replacement of any mutilated,
destroyed, lost or stolen Note shall constitute an original
additional contractual obligation of the Issuer, whether or not the
mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Note shall be at any time
enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of
this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other
Notes duly issued hereunder.

(c)             
to the extent that the provisions of
this Section conflict with any other provisions of this Indenture,
the provisions of this Section shall control;

 

(d)             
the rights of Note Owners shall be
exercised only through the Clearing Agency and shall be limited to
those established by law and agreements between or among such Note
Owners and the Clearing Agency or Clearing Agency Participants
pursuant to the Depository Agreement, unless and until Definitive
Notes are issued pursuant to Section 2.11, the initial Clearing
Agency will make book-entry transfers among the Clearing Agency
Participants and receive and transmit payments of principal of and
interest on the Notes to such Clearing Agency Participants;
and

 

(e)             
whenever this Indenture requires or
permits actions to be taken based upon instructions or directions
of Noteholders evidencing a specified percentage of the Outstanding
Amount, the Clearing Agency shall be deemed to represent such
percentage only to the extent that it has received instructions to
such effect from Note Owners or Clearing Agency Participants owning
or representing, respectively, such required percentage of the
beneficial interest in the Notes and has delivered such
instructions to the Indenture Trustee.

 

 Section
2.10      Notices to Clearing Agency . 
Whenever a notice or other communication to Noteholders is required
under this Indenture, unless and until Definitive Notes shall have
been issued to Note Owners pursuant to Section 2.11, the Indenture
Trustee shall give all such notices and communications specified
herein to be given to Noteholders to the Clearing Agency, and shall
have no obligation to the Note Owners.

 

 Section
2.11      Definitive Notes .  If (i) (A)
the Administrator advises the Indenture Trustee in writing that the
Clearing Agency is no longer willing or able to properly discharge
its responsibilities as described in the Depository Agreement and
(B) none of the Indenture Trustee, the Transferor or the
Administrator is able to locate a qualified successor, (ii) the
Administrator at its option, with the consent of the applicable
Clearing Agency Participants, advises the Indenture Trustee in
writing that it elects to terminate the book-entry system through
the Clearing Agency or (iii) after an Indenture Default, Note
Owners representing in the aggregate not less than 51% of the
Outstanding Amount advise the Indenture Trustee through the
Clearing Agency and its Participants in writing that the
continuation of a book-entry system through the Clearing Agency or
its successor is no longer in the best interest of Note Owners, the
Indenture Trustee shall be required to notify all Note Owners,
through the Clearing Agency, of the occurrence of such event and
the availability through the Clearing Agency of Definitive Notes to
Note Owners requesting the same.  Upon surrender to the
Indenture Trustee by the Clearing Agency of the Note or Notes
representing the Book-Entry Notes and the receipt of instructions
for re-registration, the Indenture Trustee shall issue Definitive
Notes to Note Owners, who thereupon shall become Noteholders for
all purposes of this Indenture.  None of the Owner Trustee,
the Note Registrar or the Indenture Trustee shall be liable for any
delay in delivery of such instructions and may conclusively rely
on, and shall be protected in relying on, such
instructions.

 

The Indenture Trustee shall not be
liable if the Indenture Trustee or the Administrator is unable to
locate a qualified successor Clearing Agency.  The Definitive
Notes shall be typewritten, printed, lithographed or engraved or

list of the names and addresses of the Noteholders (i) as of each
Record Date, within five days thereafter and (ii) as of not more
than ten days prior to the time such list is furnished, within 30
days after receipt by the Owner Trustee of a written request
therefor.

 

 Section
2.12      Authenticating Agents .  Upon
the request of the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee shall, and if the
Indenture Trustee so chooses the Indenture Trustee may, appoint one
or more Authenticating Agents with power to act on its behalf and
subject to its direction in the authentication of Notes in
connection with issuance, transfers and exchanges under
Sections 2.02, 2.04, 2.05 and 9.05, as fully to all intents
and purposes as though each such Authenticating Agent had been
expressly authorized by such Sections to authenticate such
Notes.  For all purposes of this Indenture, the authentication
of Notes by an Authenticating Agent pursuant to this Section shall
be deemed to be the authentication of Notes by the Indenture
Trustee.

 

Any corporation into which any
Authenticating Agent may be merged or converted or with which it
may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger,
consolidation or conversion to which any Authenticating Agent shall
be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the corporate trust
business of any Authenticating Agent, shall be the successor of
such Authenticating Agent hereunder, without the execution or
filing of any further act on the part of the parties hereto or such
Authenticating Agent or such successor corporation.

 

Any Authenticating Agent may at any
time resign by giving written notice of resignation to the
Indenture Trustee and the Issuer.  The Indenture Trustee may
at any time terminate the agency of any Authenticating Agent by
giving written notice of termination to such Authenticating Agent
and the Issuer.  Upon receiving such notice of resignation or
upon such termination, the Indenture Trustee shall promptly appoint
a successor Authenticating Agent and shall give written notice of
such appointment to the Issuer.

 

The Issuer agrees to pay to each
Authenticating Agent from time to time reasonable compensation for
its services and reimbursement for its reasonable expenses relating
thereto.  The provisions of Sections 2.07 and 6.04 shall be
applicable to any Authenticating Agent.

Trustee as its agent to receive all such surrenders, notices and
demands.  The Issuer shall give prompt written notice to the
Indenture Trustee of the location, and of any change in the
location, of any such office or agency.  If at any time the
Issuer shall fail to maintain any such office or agency or shall
fail to furnish the Indenture Trustee with the address thereof,
such surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the
Corporate Trust Office, and the Issuer hereby appoints the
Indenture Trustee as its agent to receive all such surrenders,
notices and demands.

 

 Section
3.03      Money for Payments to be Held in
Trust .  As provided in Sections 8.04 and 5.04(b), all
payments of amounts due and payable with respect to any Notes that

Trustee or by another Paying Agent, and no amounts so withdrawn
therefrom for payments of Notes shall be paid over to the Issuer
except as provided in this Section.

 

On each Payment Date and Redemption
Date, the Issuer shall deposit or cause to be deposited into the
Note Distribution Account an aggregate sum sufficient to pay the
amounts then becoming due under the Notes, and the Paying Agent
shall hold such sum in trust for the benefit of the Persons
entitled thereto and (unless the Paying Agent is the Indenture
Trustee) shall promptly notify the Indenture Trustee of any failure
by the Issuer to effect such deposit.

 

The Issuer shall cause each Paying
Agent other than the Indenture Trustee to execute and deliver to
the Indenture Trustee an instrument in which such Paying Agent
shall agree with the Indenture Trustee (and if the Indenture
Trustee acts as Paying Agent, it hereby so agrees to the extent
relevant), subject to the provisions of this Section, that such
Paying Agent shall:

 

(a)             
hold all sums held by it for the
payment of amounts due with respect to the Notes in trust for the
benefit of the Persons entitled thereto until such sums shall be
paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided
and pay such sums to such Persons as herein provided;

 

(b)             
give the Indenture Trustee notice of
any default by the Issuer of which it has actual knowledge (or any
other obligor upon the Notes) in the making of any payment required
to be made with respect to the Notes;

 

(c)             
at any time during the continuance
of any such default, upon the written request of the Indenture
Trustee, forthwith pay to the Indenture Trustee all sums so held in
trust by such Paying Agent;

 


23






 

(d)             
immediately resign as a Paying Agent
and forthwith pay to the Indenture Trustee all sums held by it in
trust for the payment of Notes if at any time it ceases to meet the
standards required to be met by a Paying Agent at the time of its
appointment; and

 

(e)             
comply with all requirements of the
Code with respect to the withholding from any payments made by it
on any Notes of any applicable withholding taxes imposed thereon
and with respect to any applicable reporting requirements in
connection therewith.

 

The Issuer may at any time, for the
purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and discharge of this
Indenture or for any other purpose, by Issuer Order direct any
Paying Agent to pay to the Indenture Trustee all sums held in trust
by such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Indenture Trustee
upon the same trusts as those upon which such sums were held by
such Paying Agent; and upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the
Indenture Trustee, such Paying Agent shall be released from all
further liability with respect to such money.

 

Subject to applicable laws with
respect to escheat of funds, any money held by the Indenture
Trustee or any Paying Agent in trust for the payment of any amount
due with respect to any Note and remaining unclaimed for two years
after such amount has become due and payable shall be discharged
from such trust and deposited by the Indenture Trustee into the
2017-1 SUBI Collection Account, and the related Noteholder shall
thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the
Issuer for payment thereof, and all liability of the Indenture
Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money shall
thereupon cease; provided, however, that the Indenture Trustee or
such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such
repayment, may at the expense of the Issuer cause to be published
once, in a newspaper published in the English language, customarily
published on each Business Day and of general circulation in The
City of New York, notice that such money remains unclaimed and
that, after a date specified therein, which date shall not be less
than 30 days from the date of such publication, any unclaimed
balance of such money then remaining shall be paid to the
Administrator.  The Indenture Trustee shall also adopt and
employ, at the expense of the Issuer, any other reasonable means of
notification of such repayment (including mailing notice of such
repayment to Noteholders the Notes of which have been called but
not surrendered for redemption or whose right to or interest in
monies due and payable but not claimed is determinable from the
records of the Indenture Trustee or any Paying Agent at the last
address of record for each such Noteholder).

Issuer shall keep in full effect its existence, rights and
franchises under the laws of such other jurisdiction) and shall

benefit of the Indenture Trustee on behalf of the Noteholders, a
first lien on and a first priority, perfected security interest in
the Trust Estate.  The Issuer shall from time to time execute

Administration of the 2017-1 SUBI Assets .

 

(a)             
The Issuer shall not take any action

by others, including the Administrator, that would release any
Person from any of such Person’s material covenants or
obligations under any instrument or agreement included

in the Trust Estate or that would
result in the amendment, hypothecation, subordination, termination
or discharge of, or impair the validity or effectiveness of, any
such instrument or agreement, except as expressly provided in the
Basic Documents or such other instrument or agreement.

 

(b)             
The Issuer may contract with other
Persons, to assist it in performing its duties under this
Indenture, and any performance of such duties by a Person
identified to the Indenture Trustee in an Officer’s
Certificate of the Issuer shall be deemed to be action taken by the
Issuer. Initially, the Issuer has contracted with the
Administrator, and the Administrator has agreed, to assist the
Issuer in performing its duties under this Indenture.

 

(c)             
The Issuer shall, and, shall cause
the Administrator and the Servicer to, punctually perform and
observe all of its and their respective obligations and agreements
contained in this Indenture, the other Basic Documents and the
instruments and agreements included in the Trust Estate, including
filing or causing to be filed all UCC financing statements and
continuation statements required to be filed by the terms of this
Indenture and the other Basic Documents in accordance with and
within the time periods provided for herein and therein. 
Except as otherwise expressly provided therein, the Issuer, as a
party to the Basic Documents and as Holder of the 2017-1 SUBI
Certificate, shall not, and shall cause each of the Servicer and
the Administrator not to, modify, amend, supplement, waive or
terminate any Basic Document to which it is a party or any
provision thereof without satisfying the Rating Agency Condition

Officer of the Indenture Trustee shall have actual knowledge of the
occurrence and continuation of a Servicer Default, such entity
shall promptly notify the other entity and the Administrator
thereof, and shall specify in such notice the action, if any, the
other entity is taking in respect of such default.  If a
Servicer Default shall arise from the failure of the Servicer to
perform any of its duties or obligations under the Servicing
Agreement with respect to the 2017-1 SUBI Assets, the Issuer shall
take all reasonable steps available to it to remedy such
failure.  Upon the occurrence and continuation of a Servicer
Default with respect to the 2017-1 SUBI, the Indenture Trustee may
(and at the direction of Noteholders holding not less than 66
⅔% of the Outstanding Amount shall) terminate all of the
rights and obligations of the Servicer with respect to the 2017-1
SUBI only, and a successor Servicer shall be appointed pursuant to
the Servicing Agreement.

 

(e)             
Upon any termination of the
Servicer’s rights and powers or resignation of the Servicer
pursuant to the Servicing Agreement, the Issuer or the Indenture
Trustee shall promptly, but in any event within two Business Days
of such termination or resignation, notify the other entity
thereof.  As soon as a successor Servicer is appointed
pursuant to the Servicing Agreement, the Issuer or the Indenture
Trustee shall notify the other entity of such appointment,
specifying in such notice the name and address of such successor
Servicer.

agreement, a default in the observance or performance of which is
elsewhere in this Section specifically dealt with), or any
representation or warranty of the Issuer made in this Indenture or
in any certificate or other writing delivered pursuant hereto or in
connection herewith proving to have been incorrect in any material
respect as of the time when the same shall have been made, and such
default shall continue or not be cured, or the circumstance or

together as a single class, a written notice specifying such
default or incorrect representation or warranty and requiring it to

relief by a court having jurisdiction in the premises in respect of
the Issuer or any substantial part of the Trust Estate in an
involuntary case under any applicable federal or state bankruptcy,
insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect, or
appointing a receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee,
sequestrator or similar official of the Issuer or for any
substantial part of the Trust Estate, or ordering the winding up or
liquidation of the Issuer’s affairs, and such decree or order
shall remain unstayed and in effect for a period of 60 consecutive
days; or

 

(e)

voluntary case under any applicable federal or state bankruptcy,
insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect or the
consent by the Issuer to the entry of an order for relief in an
involuntary case under any such law, the consent by the Issuer to
the appointment of or taking possession by a receiver, liquidator,
assignee, custodian, trustee, sequestrator or similar official of
the Issuer or for any substantial part of the Trust Estate, the
making by the Issuer of any general assignment for the benefit of
creditors, the failure by the Issuer generally to pay its debts as

delay in or failure of performance referred to under clause (a) for
a period of 45 days, under clause (b) for a period of 60 days or
under clause (c) for a period of 120 days, will not constitute an

Majeure.

 

The Issuer shall promptly deliver
to the Indenture Trustee, the Owner Trustee, the Vehicle Trustee,
each Noteholder, and with respect to each Rating Agency shall make
available, written notice in the form of an Officer’s
Certificate of any Indenture Default, its status and what action
the Issuer is taking or proposes to take with respect
thereto.

 

Subject to the provisions herein
relating to the duties of the Indenture Trustee, if an Indenture
Default occurs and is continuing, the Indenture Trustee shall be
under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under
this Indenture at the request or direction of any Noteholder, if
the Indenture Trustee reasonably believes that it will not be
adequately indemnified against the costs, expenses and liabilities
that might be incurred by it in complying with such request. 
Subject to such provisions for indemnification and certain
limitations contained herein, Noteholders holding not less than a
majority of the Outstanding Amount shall have the right to direct
the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding or any
remedy available to the Indenture Trustee or exercising any trust
power conferred on the Indenture Trustee, and Noteholders holding
not less than a majority of the Outstanding Amount may, in certain
cases, waive any default with respect thereto, except a default in
the payment of principal or interest or a default in respect of a
covenant or provision of the Indenture that cannot be modified
without the waiver or consent of all of the Noteholders of the
Outstanding Notes.

 

 Section
5.02      Acceleration of Maturity; Waiver of
Indenture Default .  If an Indenture Default should occur
and be continuing, the Indenture Trustee may (and, at the direction
of the Noteholders holding not less than a majority of the
Outstanding Amount of the Notes, shall) declare the principal of
the Notes to be immediately due and payable.  Upon such
declaration, the Indenture Trustee shall promptly provide written
notice to the Administrator.  Such declaration may be
rescinded by Noteholders holding a majority of the Outstanding
Amount before a judgment or decree for payment of the amount due
has been obtained by the Indenture Trustee if (a) the Issuer has
deposited with the Indenture Trustee an amount sufficient to pay
(i) all interest on and principal of the Notes as if the Indenture
Default giving rise to such declaration had not occurred and (ii)
all amounts advanced by the Indenture Trustee and its costs and
expenses and (b) all Indenture Defaults (other than the nonpayment
of principal of the Notes that has become due solely by such
acceleration) have been cured or waived.

 

At any time prior to the
declaration of the acceleration of the maturity of the Notes,
Noteholders holding not less than a majority of the Outstanding
Amount may waive an Indenture Default as set forth in Section
5.12.

 

If the Notes have been declared due
and payable following an Indenture Default, the Indenture Trustee
may institute proceedings to collect amounts due, exercise remedies
as a secured party (including foreclosure or sale of the Trust
Estate) or elect to maintain the Trust Estate and continue to apply
the proceeds from the Trust Estate as if there had been no
declaration of acceleration.  Any sale of the Trust Estate by
the Indenture Trustee will be subject to the terms and conditions
of Section 5.04.

is a default in the payment of (i) any interest on the Notes when
the same becomes due and payable, and such default continues for a

Final Scheduled Payment Date or the Redemption Date, the Issuer
shall, upon demand of the Indenture Trustee, pay to the Indenture
Trustee, for the benefit of such Noteholders, the entire amount
then due and payable on such Notes for principal and interest, with
interest on the overdue principal, and, to the extent payment at
such rate of interest shall be legally enforceable, upon overdue
installments of interest, at the Overdue Interest Rate and in
addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to
cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the
reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of
the Indenture Trustee and its agents, attorneys and
counsel.

 

(b)

due and unpaid, and may prosecute such Proceeding to judgment or
final decree, and may enforce the same against the Issuer or other
obligor upon such Notes and collect in the manner provided by law
out of the property of the Issuer or other obligor upon such Notes,
wherever situated, the monies adjudged or decreed to be
payable.

 

(c)             
If an Indenture Default occurs and
is continuing, the Indenture Trustee may, in its discretion,
proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the
Noteholders, by such appropriate Proceedings as the Indenture
Trustee shall deem most effective to protect and enforce any such
rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or
agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power
granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy or legal or
equitable right vested in the Indenture Trustee by this Indenture
or by law.

property or such other obligor or Person, or in case of any other
comparable judicial Proceedings relative to the Issuer or other
obligor upon the Notes, or to the property of the Issuer or such
other obligor, the Indenture Trustee, irrespective of whether the
principal of any Notes shall then be due and payable as therein
expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of
whether the Indenture Trustee shall have made any demand pursuant
to the provisions of this Section, shall be entitled and empowered,

and any trustee, receiver,
liquidator, custodian or other similar official in any such
Proceeding is hereby authorized by each Noteholder to make payments
to the Indenture Trustee and, in the event the Indenture Trustee
shall consent to the making of payments directly to such
Noteholders, to pay to the Indenture Trustee such amounts as shall
be sufficient to cover reasonable compensation to the Indenture
Trustee, each predecessor Indenture Trustee and their respective
agents, attorneys and counsel, and all other expenses and
liabilities incurred and all advances and disbursements made by the

Notes or the production thereof in any trial or other Proceedings
relative thereto, and any such action or Proceedings instituted by
the Indenture Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee
of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment, subject to the
payment of the expenses, advances, disbursements and compensation

held to represent all the Noteholders, and it shall not be
necessary to make any Noteholder a party to any such
Proceedings.

 Section
5.04      Remedies; Priorities .

 

(a)             
If an Indenture Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, the Indenture Trustee may do one or
more of the following (subject to Section 5.05):

 


(i)             
institute Proceedings in its own
name and as trustee of an express trust for the collection of all
amounts then payable on the Notes or under this Indenture with
respect thereto, whether by declaration or otherwise, enforce any
judgment obtained, and collect from the Issuer and any other
obligor upon such Notes monies adjudged due;


 


(ii)             
institute Proceedings from time to
time for the complete or partial foreclosure of this Indenture with
respect to the Trust Estate;


 


(iii)             
exercise any remedies of a secured
party under the UCC and take any other appropriate action to
protect and enforce the rights and remedies of the Indenture
Trustee and the Noteholders; and


 


(iv)             
subject to Section 5.17, after an
acceleration of the maturity of the Notes pursuant to Section 5.02,
sell the Trust Estate or any portion thereof or rights or interest
therein, at one or more public or private sales called and
conducted in any manner permitted by law;


 

provided, however, the Indenture
Trustee may not sell or otherwise liquidate the Trust Estate
following an Indenture Default pursuant to clause (iv) above, other
than an Indenture Default described in Section 5.01 (a) or (b),
unless (A) Noteholders holding 100% of the Outstanding Amount
consent thereto, (B) the proceeds of such sale are sufficient to
discharge in full all amounts then due and unpaid upon all
outstanding Notes or (C) the Indenture Trustee determines that the
Trust Estate will not continue to provide sufficient funds for the
payment of principal of and interest on the Notes as they would
have become due if the Notes had not been declared due and payable
and the Indenture Trustee obtains the consent of Noteholders
holding not less than 66 2/3% of the Outstanding Amount;
provided further, that the Indenture Trustee may not sell the Trust
Estate, unless it shall first have obtained an Opinion of Counsel
that such sale will not cause the Vehicle Trust or an interest
therein or portion thereof to be classified as an association (or a
publicly traded partnership) taxable as a corporation for federal
income tax purposes.  In determining such sufficiency or
insufficiency with respect to clauses (B) and (C) of the preceding
sentence, the Indenture Trustee may but need not obtain (at the
expense of the Issuer) and rely upon an opinion of an Independent
investment banking or accounting firm of national reputation as to
the feasibility of such proposed action and as to the sufficiency
of the Trust Estate for such purpose.

 

(b)             
If the Indenture Trustee collects
any money or property pursuant to this Article Five after an
acceleration of the maturity of the Notes pursuant to Section 5.02,

other amounts including amounts held on deposit in the Reserve
Fund) for the benefit of the Noteholders, net of liquidation costs
associated with the sale of the Trust Estate in the following
order:

 


(i)             
to the Indenture Trustee, the Note
Registrar, the Certificate Registrar, the Paying Agent, the Owner
Trustee and the Asset Representations Reviewer, pro

party, for payment of any Trustee and Reviewer Fees and other
amounts required to be paid and/or reimbursed to such party
pursuant to Section 6.07 of this Indenture, Section 8.01 of the
Trust Agreement or pursuant to the terms of the Asset
Representations Review Agreement, respectively;


 


(ii)             
to the Servicer, for any Payment
Date Advance Reimbursement;


 


(iii)             
to the Servicer, for amounts due in
respect of accrued and unpaid Servicing Fees;


 


(iv)             
to the Noteholders, pro rata, based
upon the aggregate amount of interest due to the Noteholders of
each Class, to pay due and unpaid interest, including any overdue
interest and, to the extent permitted under applicable law,
interest on any overdue interest at the applicable Overdue Interest
Rate;


 


(v)             
to the Noteholders of the Class A-1
Notes, in payment of the principal amount due and unpaid on the
Class A-1 Notes, until paid in full;


 


(vi)             
to the Noteholders of the Class A-2
Notes, Class A-3 Notes and Class A-4 Notes, pro rata, based on the
aggregate outstanding principal amount of each such Class, in
payment of the principal amount due and unpaid on such Notes until
paid in full; and


 


(vii)             
to the Certificateholder, any
remaining amounts.


 

(c)             
The Indenture Trustee, pursuant to
an Issuer Request may fix a record date and payment date for any
payment to Noteholders pursuant to this Section as provided in the
Issuer Request.  At least 15 days before such record date, the
Issuer shall mail to each Noteholder and the Indenture Trustee a
notice that states the record date, the payment date and the amount
to be paid.

 

 Section
5.05      Optional Preservation of the 2017-1
SUBI Assets .  If the Notes have been declared to be due
and payable under Section 5.02 following an Indenture Default and
such declaration and its consequences have not been rescinded and
annulled, the Indenture Trustee may, but need not, elect to
maintain possession of the Trust Estate and continue to apply the
proceeds thereof in accordance with Section 3.01 and 8.04.  It
is the intent of the parties hereto and the Noteholders that there
be at all times sufficient funds for the payment of principal of
and interest on the Notes, and the Indenture Trustee shall take
such intent into account when determining whether or not to
maintain possession of the Trust Estate.  In determining
whether to maintain possession of the Trust Estate, the Indenture

Amazing Customer Service

Outstanding customer service!
After receiving the runaround and otherwise lackluster customer service at other dealerships, I was ready to throw in the towel.
I called BMW of SF and received the best service from Nyomi.
She actually listened to what I had to say and ensured my buying experience exceeded my expectations.
Even the Finance Manager Raquel went above and beyond to find me an outstanding interest rate (much lower than the same bank quoted me), I don't typically write reviews, but wanted to pass on my recommendation for BMW of SF and Nyomi B.!

In late Feb 2007 (Feb 26), I became aware of BMW's March 01 price increases.  As I wanted to do European delivery in May, I decided to email local BMW dealers for a price quote immediately, rather than wait until late March.  My email listed the 335i E90 car specs and desired ED date.   Later that day, the internet manager at BMW SF was the first to reply, with an offer that met my target price.  So on Feb 27, I accepted the deal with BMW SF, and faxed my lease application.  A week or so later, I rec'd a production number and confirmed ED date.   My prior CA (client advisor in BMW-speak) at another Bay Area BMW dealer replied after 4 days, thus locking me into the price increase.  Plus, his offer was way over my target price.  Other dealers wouldn't state a price, and wanted me to come into the dealership.   In early May (about 2-3 weeks prior to the ED date), I finally met my new CA when I went in to sign the purchase order and lease paperwork.  The car was picked up in Munich on May 22.  After a nearly two week vacation in the Italian lake district and the south of France (during the Cannes film festival and Monaco GP), the car was dropped off in Paris on June 1.  Car was redelivered on July 23.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
