History[edit]

The company went public in 1967, issuing 323,000 shares.[3]
In 1971, the company changed its name to Rowan Companies, Inc.[3]
In 1994, Rowan acquired the assets of Marathon LeTourneau Company from General Cable for $52 million.[4]
In 2000, Rowan subsidiary LeTourneau, Inc. acquired The Ellis Williams Company, Inc., a manufacturer of mud pumps, for $9 million.[5]
In 2002, Rowan Electric, Inc. acquired Oilfield-Electric-Marine, Inc. for $8 million in stock. Oilfield-Electric-Marine, Inc. manufactured variable speed AC motors and variable frequency drive systems. Kevin R. Williams had been President of Oilfield-Electric-Marine, Inc., and he stayed on as President of Rowan Electric, Inc.[6]
In 2004, Rowan sold its aviation subsidiary business Era Aviation, Inc. for US$118.1 million in cash. The subsidiary chartered helicopter and fixed-wing services.[7]
In 2009, W. Matt Ralls became Rowan's President and Chief Executive Officer.[8]
