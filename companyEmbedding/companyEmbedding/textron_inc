History[edit]
Early history[edit]




Textron fabrics ad from 1948.


Textron started as a textile company in 1923, when 22-year-old Royal Little founded the Special Yarns Corporation in Boston, Massachusetts. The company manufactured synthetic yarns, a niche product at the time. By the start of World War II, the company was known as Atlantic Rayon Corporation and manufactured parachutes. As war production wound down, the company started making civilian products as well and was renamed Textron: “Tex" for "textiles", and "tron" from synthetics such as "Lustron". The company was listed on the NYSE in 1947.[2]
Over the next decade and a half, Textron purchased various other manufacturing companies. In 1960, the company also bought Bell Aerospace and E-Z-Go.[2] The textile division was sold to Deering Milliken in 1963.[3]
Later CEOs included G. William Miller (1968–1977), Joseph Collinson (1977–1979), and Robert P. Straetz (1979–1986). In 1984, Textron took on more debt and bought Avco, a conglomerate almost as big as itself. Later on, James Hardymon took over as CEO.[2]
Campbell era[edit]
Hardymon brought in Lewis B. Campbell, who became CEO in 1998.[citation needed] Starting in 2000, Campbell led a company-wide restructuring program. The share price fell to as low as $13/share in March 2003 after the economic downturn following the collapse of Internet companies and the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. Diminished demand for helicopters and airplanes led to layoffs at Cessna and Bell Helicopter.[citation needed] In 2004, Forbes magazine named Campbell as the fifth worst-performing CEO in the country.
In 2007, the Wall Street Journal reported that Campbell had received $494,700 in compensation in the form of his use of a corporate jet to travel between his home and office, which made him the most expensive CEO in the country in terms of use of jet travel. Some shareholders have questioned whether it is a good use of shareholder dollars to pay for the personal lifestyle choice of the CEO to live in one state and work in another.[4] Shares in Textron plummeted to as low as $10.09 per share in the aftermath of the 2008 economic downturn, driving its market capitalization down to just $3.17 billion.[citation needed] While the company lost 75% of its value in the first ten years of Campbell's leadership, he managed to take home over $120 million in compensation. His salary in 2008 was $25 million, making him the highest paid executive of a conglomerate. Campbell managed to sell over $40 million in Textron stock in April and May 2008, at prices over $60 per share.
After Campbell[edit]
Scott C. Donnelly became CEO in December 2009.[5]
Textron acquired Mechtronix in Montreal, Quebec, and OPINICUS in Tampa, Florida, in 2013. Donnelly combined these flight simulation companies, along with Textron’s AAI Logistics & Technical Services, to form TRU Simulation & Training in 2014.[2]
On December 26, 2013, Textron agreed to purchase Beechcraft, including the discontinued Hawker jet line, for $1.4 billion. The sale was expected to be concluded in the first half of 2014.[6][7][8][9] The company formed a new company called Textron Aviation to market the products of Beechcraft, Cessna, and Hawker as individual brands.[2]
Divisions and subsidiaries[edit]
Able Aerospace Services[edit]
Able Aerospace Services is an international business and $70 million aerospace enterprise that is performing more than 8,000 proprietary FAA-approved repairs on aircraft and components.[10]
Arctic Cat[edit]
On March 6, 2017, Textron bought out Arctic Cat for US$247M. Arctic Cat is a manufacturer of snowmobiles, all-terrain vehicles, and side-by-sides. Textron will operate Arctic Cat as a subsidiary of Textron Specialized Vehicles.[11]

Greenlee[edit]

It was founded in 1862 by brothers Robert and Ralph Greenlee to manufacture their invention, a drill surrounded by four chisel blades, used in making the pockets for a mortise and tenon joint for the furniture industry in Rockford. This device is still used in cabinetmaking. The brothers later diversified into a variety of hand woodworking tools as well as machinery for making wooden barrels. The company was acquired by Textron in 1986. Greenlee today produces various wire and cable installation tools that are used in a variety of fields.
Jacobsen[edit]
Textron purchased Jacobsen Manufacturing around 1975 and continued to produce Jacobsen garden tractors into the 1990s.[13] Today, Jacobsen sells various products used for turf care: maintenance equipment, vehicles, and other products.

History[edit]
Early history[edit]




Textron fabrics ad from 1948.


Textron started as a textile company in 1923, when 22-year-old Royal Little founded the Special Yarns Corporation in Boston, Massachusetts. The company manufactured synthetic yarns, a niche product at the time. By the start of World War II, the company was known as Atlantic Rayon Corporation and manufactured parachutes. As war production wound down, the company started making civilian products as well and was renamed Textron: “Tex" for "textiles", and "tron" from synthetics such as "Lustron". The company was listed on the NYSE in 1947.[2]
Over the next decade and a half, Textron purchased various other manufacturing companies. In 1960, the company also bought Bell Aerospace and E-Z-Go.[2] The textile division was sold to Deering Milliken in 1963.[3]
Later CEOs included G. William Miller (1968–1977), Joseph Collinson (1977–1979), and Robert P. Straetz (1979–1986). In 1984, Textron took on more debt and bought Avco, a conglomerate almost as big as itself. Later on, James Hardymon took over as CEO.[2]
Campbell era[edit]
Hardymon brought in Lewis B. Campbell, who became CEO in 1998.[citation needed] Starting in 2000, Campbell led a company-wide restructuring program. The share price fell to as low as $13/share in March 2003 after the economic downturn following the collapse of Internet companies and the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. Diminished demand for helicopters and airplanes led to layoffs at Cessna and Bell Helicopter.[citation needed] In 2004, Forbes magazine named Campbell as the fifth worst-performing CEO in the country.
In 2007, the Wall Street Journal reported that Campbell had received $494,700 in compensation in the form of his use of a corporate jet to travel between his home and office, which made him the most expensive CEO in the country in terms of use of jet travel. Some shareholders have questioned whether it is a good use of shareholder dollars to pay for the personal lifestyle choice of the CEO to live in one state and work in another.[4] Shares in Textron plummeted to as low as $10.09 per share in the aftermath of the 2008 economic downturn, driving its market capitalization down to just $3.17 billion.[citation needed] While the company lost 75% of its value in the first ten years of Campbell's leadership, he managed to take home over $120 million in compensation. His salary in 2008 was $25 million, making him the highest paid executive of a conglomerate. Campbell managed to sell over $40 million in Textron stock in April and May 2008, at prices over $60 per share.
After Campbell[edit]
Scott C. Donnelly became CEO in December 2009.[5]
Textron acquired Mechtronix in Montreal, Quebec, and OPINICUS in Tampa, Florida, in 2013. Donnelly combined these flight simulation companies, along with Textron’s AAI Logistics & Technical Services, to form TRU Simulation & Training in 2014.[2]
On December 26, 2013, Textron agreed to purchase Beechcraft, including the discontinued Hawker jet line, for $1.4 billion. The sale was expected to be concluded in the first half of 2014.[6][7][8][9] The company formed a new company called Textron Aviation to market the products of Beechcraft, Cessna, and Hawker as individual brands.[2]
Divisions and subsidiaries[edit]
Able Aerospace Services[edit]
Able Aerospace Services is an international business and $70 million aerospace enterprise that is performing more than 8,000 proprietary FAA-approved repairs on aircraft and components.[10]
Arctic Cat[edit]
On March 6, 2017, Textron bought out Arctic Cat for US$247M. Arctic Cat is a manufacturer of snowmobiles, all-terrain vehicles, and side-by-sides. Textron will operate Arctic Cat as a subsidiary of Textron Specialized Vehicles.[11]
Bell Helicopter[edit]




Bell 429 Helicopter


Bell Helicopter is an American helicopter and rotorcraft manufacturer headquartered in Hurst, Texas, near Fort Worth.
E-Z-GO[edit]
E-Z-GO is a designer and manufacturer of light transportation vehicles for golf courses and for other uses. Products include electric and internal combustion golf carts and multipurpose utility vehicles under the E-Z-Go, Cushman, and Bad Boy Buggy brands.[12]
Greenlee[edit]
Greenlee Textron is an industrial and electrical tool company headquartered in Rockford, Illinois. It was founded in 1862 by brothers Robert and Ralph Greenlee to manufacture their invention, a drill surrounded by four chisel blades, used in making the pockets for a mortise and tenon joint for the furniture industry in Rockford. This device is still used in cabinetmaking. The brothers later diversified into a variety of hand woodworking tools as well as machinery for making wooden barrels. The company was acquired by Textron in 1986. Greenlee today produces various wire and cable installation tools that are used in a variety of fields.
Jacobsen[edit]
Textron purchased Jacobsen Manufacturing around 1975 and continued to produce Jacobsen garden tractors into the 1990s.[13] Today, Jacobsen sells various products used for turf care: maintenance equipment, vehicles, and other products.
Kautex Textron[edit]
Kautex Textron is a supplier to the automotive industry. The company produces plastic fuel systems, selective catalytic reduction systems, windshield and headlamp washer systems, and other products.
Textron AirLand[edit]

Textron Aviation[edit]
Textron Aviation is a new venture formed in March 2014 from Beechcraft and Cessna, retaining the Beechcraft, Cessna, and Hawker aircraft type names as brands.[15]

Beechcraft Corporation is an American manufacturer of general aviation and military aircraft, ranging from light, single-engined aircraft to twin-engined turboprop transports and military trainers.

History[edit]
Early history[edit]




Textron fabrics ad from 1948.


Textron started as a textile company in 1923, when 22-year-old Royal Little founded the Special Yarns Corporation in Boston, Massachusetts. The company manufactured synthetic yarns, a niche product at the time. By the start of World War II, the company was known as Atlantic Rayon Corporation and manufactured parachutes. As war production wound down, the company started making civilian products as well and was renamed Textron: “Tex" for "textiles", and "tron" from synthetics such as "Lustron". The company was listed on the NYSE in 1947.[2]
Over the next decade and a half, Textron purchased various other manufacturing companies. In 1960, the company also bought Bell Aerospace and E-Z-Go.[2] The textile division was sold to Deering Milliken in 1963.[3]
Later CEOs included G. William Miller (1968–1977), Joseph Collinson (1977–1979), and Robert P. Straetz (1979–1986). In 1984, Textron took on more debt and bought Avco, a conglomerate almost as big as itself. Later on, James Hardymon took over as CEO.[2]
Campbell era[edit]
Hardymon brought in Lewis B. Campbell, who became CEO in 1998.[citation needed] Starting in 2000, Campbell led a company-wide restructuring program. The share price fell to as low as $13/share in March 2003 after the economic downturn following the collapse of Internet companies and the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. Diminished demand for helicopters and airplanes led to layoffs at Cessna and Bell Helicopter.[citation needed] In 2004, Forbes magazine named Campbell as the fifth worst-performing CEO in the country.
In 2007, the Wall Street Journal reported that Campbell had received $494,700 in compensation in the form of his use of a corporate jet to travel between his home and office, which made him the most expensive CEO in the country in terms of use of jet travel. Some shareholders have questioned whether it is a good use of shareholder dollars to pay for the personal lifestyle choice of the CEO to live in one state and work in another.[4] Shares in Textron plummeted to as low as $10.09 per share in the aftermath of the 2008 economic downturn, driving its market capitalization down to just $3.17 billion.[citation needed] While the company lost 75% of its value in the first ten years of Campbell's leadership, he managed to take home over $120 million in compensation. His salary in 2008 was $25 million, making him the highest paid executive of a conglomerate. Campbell managed to sell over $40 million in Textron stock in April and May 2008, at prices over $60 per share.
After Campbell[edit]
Scott C. Donnelly became CEO in December 2009.[5]
Textron acquired Mechtronix in Montreal, Quebec, and OPINICUS in Tampa, Florida, in 2013. Donnelly combined these flight simulation companies, along with Textron’s AAI Logistics & Technical Services, to form TRU Simulation & Training in 2014.[2]
On December 26, 2013, Textron agreed to purchase Beechcraft, including the discontinued Hawker jet line, for $1.4 billion. The sale was expected to be concluded in the first half of 2014.[6][7][8][9] The company formed a new company called Textron Aviation to market the products of Beechcraft, Cessna, and Hawker as individual brands.[2]
Divisions and subsidiaries[edit]
Able Aerospace Services[edit]
Able Aerospace Services is an international business and $70 million aerospace enterprise that is performing more than 8,000 proprietary FAA-approved repairs on aircraft and components.[10]
Arctic Cat[edit]
On March 6, 2017, Textron bought out Arctic Cat for US$247M. Arctic Cat is a manufacturer of snowmobiles, all-terrain vehicles, and side-by-sides. Textron will operate Arctic Cat as a subsidiary of Textron Specialized Vehicles.[11]

Greenlee[edit]

It was founded in 1862 by brothers Robert and Ralph Greenlee to manufacture their invention, a drill surrounded by four chisel blades, used in making the pockets for a mortise and tenon joint for the furniture industry in Rockford. This device is still used in cabinetmaking. The brothers later diversified into a variety of hand woodworking tools as well as machinery for making wooden barrels. The company was acquired by Textron in 1986. Greenlee today produces various wire and cable installation tools that are used in a variety of fields.
Jacobsen[edit]
Textron purchased Jacobsen Manufacturing around 1975 and continued to produce Jacobsen garden tractors into the 1990s.[13] Today, Jacobsen sells various products used for turf care: maintenance equipment, vehicles, and other products.

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

History[edit]
Early history[edit]




Textron fabrics ad from 1948.


Textron started as a textile company in 1923, when 22-year-old Royal Little founded the Special Yarns Corporation in Boston, Massachusetts. The company manufactured synthetic yarns, a niche product at the time. By the start of World War II, the company was known as Atlantic Rayon Corporation and manufactured parachutes. As war production wound down, the company started making civilian products as well and was renamed Textron: “Tex" for "textiles", and "tron" from synthetics such as "Lustron". The company was listed on the NYSE in 1947.[2]
Over the next decade and a half, Textron purchased various other manufacturing companies. In 1960, the company also bought Bell Aerospace and E-Z-Go.[2] The textile division was sold to Deering Milliken in 1963.[3]
Later CEOs included G. William Miller (1968–1977), Joseph Collinson (1977–1979), and Robert P. Straetz (1979–1986). In 1984, Textron took on more debt and bought Avco, a conglomerate almost as big as itself. Later on, James Hardymon took over as CEO.[2]
Campbell era[edit]
Hardymon brought in Lewis B. Campbell, who became CEO in 1998.[citation needed] Starting in 2000, Campbell led a company-wide restructuring program. The share price fell to as low as $13/share in March 2003 after the economic downturn following the collapse of Internet companies and the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. Diminished demand for helicopters and airplanes led to layoffs at Cessna and Bell Helicopter.[citation needed] In 2004, Forbes magazine named Campbell as the fifth worst-performing CEO in the country.
In 2007, the Wall Street Journal reported that Campbell had received $494,700 in compensation in the form of his use of a corporate jet to travel between his home and office, which made him the most expensive CEO in the country in terms of use of jet travel. Some shareholders have questioned whether it is a good use of shareholder dollars to pay for the personal lifestyle choice of the CEO to live in one state and work in another.[4] Shares in Textron plummeted to as low as $10.09 per share in the aftermath of the 2008 economic downturn, driving its market capitalization down to just $3.17 billion.[citation needed] While the company lost 75% of its value in the first ten years of Campbell's leadership, he managed to take home over $120 million in compensation. His salary in 2008 was $25 million, making him the highest paid executive of a conglomerate. Campbell managed to sell over $40 million in Textron stock in April and May 2008, at prices over $60 per share.
After Campbell[edit]
Scott C. Donnelly became CEO in December 2009.[5]
Textron acquired Mechtronix in Montreal, Quebec, and OPINICUS in Tampa, Florida, in 2013. Donnelly combined these flight simulation companies, along with Textron’s AAI Logistics & Technical Services, to form TRU Simulation & Training in 2014.[2]
On December 26, 2013, Textron agreed to purchase Beechcraft, including the discontinued Hawker jet line, for $1.4 billion. The sale was expected to be concluded in the first half of 2014.[6][7][8][9] The company formed a new company called Textron Aviation to market the products of Beechcraft, Cessna, and Hawker as individual brands.[2]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]




Textron fabrics ad from 1948.


Textron started as a textile company in 1923, when 22-year-old Royal Little founded the Special Yarns Corporation in Boston, Massachusetts. The company manufactured synthetic yarns, a niche product at the time. By the start of World War II, the company was known as Atlantic Rayon Corporation and manufactured parachutes. As war production wound down, the company started making civilian products as well and was renamed Textron: “Tex" for "textiles", and "tron" from synthetics such as "Lustron". The company was listed on the NYSE in 1947.[2]
Over the next decade and a half, Textron purchased various other manufacturing companies. In 1960, the company also bought Bell Aerospace and E-Z-Go.[2] The textile division was sold to Deering Milliken in 1963.[3]
Later CEOs included G. William Miller (1968–1977), Joseph Collinson (1977–1979), and Robert P. Straetz (1979–1986). In 1984, Textron took on more debt and bought Avco, a conglomerate almost as big as itself. Later on, James Hardymon took over as CEO.[2]
Campbell era[edit]
Hardymon brought in Lewis B. Campbell, who became CEO in 1998.[citation needed] Starting in 2000, Campbell led a company-wide restructuring program. The share price fell to as low as $13/share in March 2003 after the economic downturn following the collapse of Internet companies and the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. Diminished demand for helicopters and airplanes led to layoffs at Cessna and Bell Helicopter.[citation needed] In 2004, Forbes magazine named Campbell as the fifth worst-performing CEO in the country.
In 2007, the Wall Street Journal reported that Campbell had received $494,700 in compensation in the form of his use of a corporate jet to travel between his home and office, which made him the most expensive CEO in the country in terms of use of jet travel. Some shareholders have questioned whether it is a good use of shareholder dollars to pay for the personal lifestyle choice of the CEO to live in one state and work in another.[4] Shares in Textron plummeted to as low as $10.09 per share in the aftermath of the 2008 economic downturn, driving its market capitalization down to just $3.17 billion.[citation needed] While the company lost 75% of its value in the first ten years of Campbell's leadership, he managed to take home over $120 million in compensation. His salary in 2008 was $25 million, making him the highest paid executive of a conglomerate. Campbell managed to sell over $40 million in Textron stock in April and May 2008, at prices over $60 per share.
After Campbell[edit]
Scott C. Donnelly became CEO in December 2009.[5]
Textron acquired Mechtronix in Montreal, Quebec, and OPINICUS in Tampa, Florida, in 2013. Donnelly combined these flight simulation companies, along with Textron’s AAI Logistics & Technical Services, to form TRU Simulation & Training in 2014.[2]
On December 26, 2013, Textron agreed to purchase Beechcraft, including the discontinued Hawker jet line, for $1.4 billion. The sale was expected to be concluded in the first half of 2014.[6][7][8][9] The company formed a new company called Textron Aviation to market the products of Beechcraft, Cessna, and Hawker as individual brands.[2]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]




Textron fabrics ad from 1948.


Textron started as a textile company in 1923, when 22-year-old Royal Little founded the Special Yarns Corporation in Boston, Massachusetts. The company manufactured synthetic yarns, a niche product at the time. By the start of World War II, the company was known as Atlantic Rayon Corporation and manufactured parachutes. As war production wound down, the company started making civilian products as well and was renamed Textron: “Tex" for "textiles", and "tron" from synthetics such as "Lustron". The company was listed on the NYSE in 1947.[2]
Over the next decade and a half, Textron purchased various other manufacturing companies. In 1960, the company also bought Bell Aerospace and E-Z-Go.[2] The textile division was sold to Deering Milliken in 1963.[3]
Later CEOs included G. William Miller (1968–1977), Joseph Collinson (1977–1979), and Robert P. Straetz (1979–1986). In 1984, Textron took on more debt and bought Avco, a conglomerate almost as big as itself. Later on, James Hardymon took over as CEO.[2]
Campbell era[edit]
Hardymon brought in Lewis B. Campbell, who became CEO in 1998.[citation needed] Starting in 2000, Campbell led a company-wide restructuring program. The share price fell to as low as $13/share in March 2003 after the economic downturn following the collapse of Internet companies and the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. Diminished demand for helicopters and airplanes led to layoffs at Cessna and Bell Helicopter.[citation needed] In 2004, Forbes magazine named Campbell as the fifth worst-performing CEO in the country.
In 2007, the Wall Street Journal reported that Campbell had received $494,700 in compensation in the form of his use of a corporate jet to travel between his home and office, which made him the most expensive CEO in the country in terms of use of jet travel. Some shareholders have questioned whether it is a good use of shareholder dollars to pay for the personal lifestyle choice of the CEO to live in one state and work in another.[4] Shares in Textron plummeted to as low as $10.09 per share in the aftermath of the 2008 economic downturn, driving its market capitalization down to just $3.17 billion.[citation needed] While the company lost 75% of its value in the first ten years of Campbell's leadership, he managed to take home over $120 million in compensation. His salary in 2008 was $25 million, making him the highest paid executive of a conglomerate. Campbell managed to sell over $40 million in Textron stock in April and May 2008, at prices over $60 per share.
After Campbell[edit]
Scott C. Donnelly became CEO in December 2009.[5]
Textron acquired Mechtronix in Montreal, Quebec, and OPINICUS in Tampa, Florida, in 2013. Donnelly combined these flight simulation companies, along with Textron’s AAI Logistics & Technical Services, to form TRU Simulation & Training in 2014.[2]
On December 26, 2013, Textron agreed to purchase Beechcraft, including the discontinued Hawker jet line, for $1.4 billion. The sale was expected to be concluded in the first half of 2014.[6][7][8][9] The company formed a new company called Textron Aviation to market the products of Beechcraft, Cessna, and Hawker as individual brands.[2]
Divisions and subsidiaries[edit]
Able Aerospace Services[edit]
Able Aerospace Services is an international business and $70 million aerospace enterprise that is performing more than 8,000 proprietary FAA-approved repairs on aircraft and components.[10]
Arctic Cat[edit]
On March 6, 2017, Textron bought out Arctic Cat for US$247M. Arctic Cat is a manufacturer of snowmobiles, all-terrain vehicles, and side-by-sides. Textron will operate Arctic Cat as a subsidiary of Textron Specialized Vehicles.[11]
Bell Helicopter[edit]

E-Z-GO[edit]
E-Z-GO is a designer and manufacturer of light transportation vehicles for golf courses and for other uses. Products include electric and internal combustion golf carts and multipurpose utility vehicles under the E-Z-Go, Cushman, and Bad Boy Buggy brands.[12]
Greenlee[edit]
Greenlee Textron is an industrial and electrical tool company headquartered in Rockford, Illinois. It was founded in 1862 by brothers Robert and Ralph Greenlee to manufacture their invention, a drill surrounded by four chisel blades, used in making the pockets for a mortise and tenon joint for the furniture industry in Rockford. This device is still used in cabinetmaking. The brothers later diversified into a variety of hand woodworking tools as well as machinery for making wooden barrels. The company was acquired by Textron in 1986. Greenlee today produces various wire and cable installation tools that are used in a variety of fields.
Jacobsen[edit]
Textron purchased Jacobsen Manufacturing around 1975 and continued to produce Jacobsen garden tractors into the 1990s.[13] Today, Jacobsen sells various products used for turf care: maintenance equipment, vehicles, and other products.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Textron Inc. Company Profile


   Officers, corporate and military, really take to Textron's vehicles. The company's E-Z-GO golf carts enrich their golfing jaunts, while its Cessna and Beechcraft airplanes and Bell helicopters whisk them around the world. In addition, its auto parts keep their cars running, and its Financial subsidiary provides loans. Besides golf carts and car parts, Textron's Industrial segment makes power tools, electrical and fiber optic assemblies, and turf maintenance equipment. The Textron Systems segment sells land and marine systems, sensors, and unmanned aerial vehicles to the Defense Department. Various US government entities account for almost 25% of Textron's sales.
  
† Some telephone numbers on the Hoover’s site may be on a country’s do not call or do not contact list including, but not limited to, the United Kingdom’s CTPS or TPS registers.

Textron Inc. Revenue and Financial Data


   Officers, corporate and military, really take to Textron's vehicles. The company's E-Z-GO golf carts enrich their golfing jaunts, while its Cessna and Beechcraft airplanes and Bell helicopters whisk them around the world. In addition, its auto parts keep their cars running, and its Financial subsidiary provides loans. Besides golf carts and car parts, Textron's Industrial segment makes power tools, electrical and fiber optic assemblies, and turf maintenance equipment. The Textron Systems segment sells land and marine systems, sensors, and unmanned aerial vehicles to the Defense Department. Various US government entities account for almost 25% of Textron's sales.

 PROVIDENCE, R.I.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
      Textron Inc. (NYSE: TXT) today reported fourth quarter 2016 income from
      continuing operations of $0.78 per share compared to $0.81 per share in
      the fourth quarter of 2015. During this year’s fourth quarter, the
      company recorded an $8 million pre-tax restructuring charge ($0.02 per
      share, after-tax). Excluding this item, adjusted income from continuing
      operations, a non-GAAP measure that is defined and reconciled to GAAP in
      an attachment to this release, was $0.80 per share for the fourth
      quarter of 2016.
    

      Revenues in the quarter were $3.8 billion, down 2.5 percent from the
      fourth quarter of 2015. Textron segment profit in the quarter was $391
      million, up $13 million from the fourth quarter of 2015.
    

      “Overall, revenues were down in the quarter but we were encouraged by
      increasing demand at Industrial and strong operating performance at
      Bell,” said Textron Chairman and CEO Scott C. Donnelly. “We also
      completed the first flight of our production Scorpion jet as we
      continued to ramp investment in this program to position us to compete
      for opportunities in 2017.”
    

      Full-year income from continuing operations was $3.09 per share compared
      to $2.50 per share last year. Full-year adjusted income from continuing
      operations, a non-GAAP measure that is defined and reconciled to GAAP in
      an attachment to this release, was $2.62 per share, compared to $2.50 in
      2015.
    

Cash Flow


      Net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations of
      the manufacturing group for the full year was $988 million, compared to
      $1,038 million last year. Manufacturing cash flow before pension
      contributions, a non-GAAP measure that is defined and reconciled to GAAP
      in an attachment to this release, was $573 million compared to $631
      million last year.
    

Acquisition


      Today, Textron announced that it has reached a definitive agreement to
      acquire Arctic Cat Inc. (NASDAQ: ACAT) in a cash transaction valued at
      approximately $247 million, plus the assumption of existing debt. Arctic
      Cat is a leader in the recreational vehicle industry. The company
      manufactures and markets all-terrain vehicles (ATVs), side-by-sides and
      snowmobiles, in addition to related parts, garments and accessories
      under the Arctic Cat® and Motorfist® brand names.
    

      “Arctic Cat is a superb strategic fit for Textron,” said Donnelly. “With
      our recent product introductions in the outdoor recreational vehicle
      market under the Stampede name, we believe Arctic Cat, one of the most
      recognized brands in the industry, provides an excellent platform to
      expand our portfolio, increase our distribution and create growth within
      our Specialized Vehicles business.”
    

Textron has agreed to make a cash tender offer for all outstanding
      shares of Arctic Cat common stock at a price of $18.50 per share. The
      tender offer is expected to commence no later than February 7, 2017. The
      completion of the acquisition is subject to customary conditions and
      regulatory approvals.
    

Share Repurchase Plan


      On January 24, 2017, Textron’s Board of Directors approved a new
      authorization for the repurchase of up to 25 million shares, under which
      the company intends to purchase shares to offset the impact of dilution
      from stock-based compensation and benefit plans and for opportunistic
      capital management purposes.
    

Outlook


Textron is forecasting 2017 revenues of approximately $14.3 billion, up
      four percent. Textron expects full-year 2017 GAAP earnings per share
      from continuing operations will be in the range of $2.40 to $2.65, or
      $2.50 to $2.70 on an adjusted basis (non-GAAP), which is reconciled to
      GAAP in an attachment to this release. The company is estimating net
      cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations of the
      manufacturing group will be between $1,035 million and $1,135 million
      and manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions (the non-GAAP
      measure) will be between $650 and $750 million with planned pension
      contributions of about $55 million. Textron intends to update its 2017
      outlook to include Arctic Cat following the completion of the
      transaction.
    

      Donnelly continued, “Our outlook reflects the continuation of our
      strategy around organic growth through new product investments amid
      challenging end markets. As we transition our product portfolios to
      comprise a greater percentage of these new offerings, we’ll expect
      improvement in our growth rate and margins over the longer term.”
    

Fourth Quarter Segment Results

      turboprops in the quarter, compared to 60 jets and 33 King Airs in last

Textron Systems

      threats, including the potential misappropriation of assets or sensitive
      information, corruption of data, operational disruption or the
      occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give
      rise to the termination of the Agreement and Plan of Merger; the
      inability to complete the transaction due to an insufficient percentage
      of shares being tendered in the transaction or due to the failure to
      receive required regulatory or other approvals or to satisfy other
      conditions to the transaction; the risk that the proposed transaction
      disrupts current plans and operations; the risk that anticipated
      synergies and opportunities as a result of the transaction will not be

      (a) During 2016, our Board of Directors approved a plan to restructure
      and realign our businesses by implementing headcount reductions,
      facility consolidations and other actions in order to improve overall
      operating efficiency across Textron. Special charges for the three and
      twelve months ended December 31, 2016 include restructuring charges for
      this plan, which primarily consists of severance costs of $4 million and
      $70 million, respectively, and asset impairments of $2 million and $38
      million, respectively.
    

      (b) The twelve months ended December 31, 2016 include an income tax
      benefit of $319 million, inclusive of interest, of which $206 million is
      attributable to continuing operations and $113 million is attributable
      to discontinued operations. This benefit is a result of the final
      settlement with the Internal Revenue Service Office of Appeals for our
      1998 to 2008 tax years.

TEXTRON INC.Non-GAAP Financial Measures


      We supplement the reporting of our financial information determined
      under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) with certain
      non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude
      certain significant items that may not be indicative of, or are
      unrelated to, results from our ongoing business operations. We believe
      that these non-GAAP measures may be useful for period-over-period
      comparisons of underlying business trends and our ongoing business
      performance, however, they should be used in conjunction with GAAP
      measures. Our non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or
      as a substitute for the related GAAP measures, and other companies may
      define similarly named measures differently. We encourage investors to
      review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their
      entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. We utilize the
      following definitions for the non-GAAP financial measures included in
      this release:
    

Adjusted income from continuing operations and
      adjusted diluted earnings per shareAdjusted income from
      continuing operations and adjusted diluted earnings per share both
      exclude Special charges, net of income taxes, and a significant
      multi-year income tax settlement. We consider items recorded in Special
      charges, net of income taxes, such as enterprise-wide restructuring, to
      be of a non-recurring nature that is not indicative of ongoing
      operations. In addition, the income tax settlement is not considered to
      be indicative of ongoing operations since it represents a significant
      one-time favorable settlement of our 1998 to 2008 tax years.
    

Manufacturing cash flow before pension
      contributionsManufacturing cash flow before pension
      contributions adjusts net cash from operating activities of continuing
      operations (GAAP) for the following:
    


        Excludes dividends received from Textron Financial Corporation (TFC)
        and capital contributions to TFC provided under the Support Agreement
        and debt agreements as these cash flows are not representative of
        manufacturing operations;
      

        Deducts capital expenditures and includes proceeds from the sale of
        property, plant and equipment to arrive at the net capital investment
        required to support ongoing manufacturing operations;
      

        Adds back pension contributions as we consider our pension obligations
        to be debt-like liabilities. Additionally, these contributions can
        fluctuate significantly from period to period and we believe that they
        are not representative of cash used by our manufacturing operations
        during the period.
      


      While we believe this measure provides a focus on cash generated from
      manufacturing operations, before pension contributions, and may be used
      as an additional relevant measure of liquidity, it does not necessarily
      provide the amount available for discretionary expenditures since we
      have certain non-discretionary obligations that are not deducted from
      the measure.
