Washington University in St. Louis Investment Management Company »
Washington University Investment Management Company (WUIMC) has adopted endowment investment and spending policies that attempt to provide a predictable stream of funding to programs supported by its endowment while seeking to maintain the purchasing power of endowment assets. The return objective for the endowment assets, measured over a full market cycle, is to maximize the return against various indices, based on the endowment’s target allocation applied to the appropriate individual benchmarks. The University expects its endowment funds, over time, to provide an average rate of return of approximately 8% to 9% percent annually. To achieve its long-term rate of return objectives, WUIMC employs a total return strategy in which investment returns are achieved through both capital appreciation (realized and unrealized gains) and current yield (interest and dividends). They target a diversified asset allocation that places greater emphasis on equity-based and alternative investments to achieve their long-term objectives within prudent risk constraints. The endowment is invested in a variety of asset classes including developed markets equity, emerging markets equity, hedged strategies, private equity, private real assets, public real assets, opportunistic, nominal bonds, inflation-indexed bonds and cash. In January 2014, WUIMC was granted a Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) license by the Chinese government, allowing them to invest directly on China's mainland stock exchanges.
