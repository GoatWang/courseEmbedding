What is an 'Automatic Session'?
To avoid having to sign in with every visit to FiftiesStore.com we created the 'Automatic Sign In'.This feature stores your credentials (Email-address and password) on your computer. When you visit us again, the stored information is used to automate the Sign in process.
Is it safe?
Your password is only sent over the Internet using a secure link (SSL). Because of this secure link, the transmission of your password cannot be intercepted. As an additional security feature only an encrypted version of your password is stored in the Cookie. If your computer is used by people other than yourself then we advise you do not to use the 'remember me' feature.
And...
The use of the 'Automatic Sign In' is optional. If you choose not to use this feature, you will need to login manually with each visit to FiftiesStore.com.

How to Make It


Step 1
Season the chicken as desired.  Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the chicken and cook for 10 minutes or until well browned on both sides.  Remove the chicken from the skillet.
Step 2
Stir the soup, water, paprika and black pepper in the skillet and heat to a boil.  Stir in the rice and broccoli.  Reduce the heat to low.  Return the chicken to the skillet.  Sprinkle the chicken with additional paprika.  Cover and cook for 5 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through.  Season to taste.
 

Recipe Tips

Recipe Note: For a creamier dish, decrease the rice to 1 1/2 cups.
Easy Substitution: This recipe is also delicious using Campbell's® Condensed Cream of Mushroom Soup instead of the Cream of Chicken.
Ingredient Note: We develop our recipes using a 4-to 5-ounce skinless, boneless chicken breast half per serving.  However, there are a range of sizes available in-store, from the butcher counter to the meat case and the freezer section.  Use whichever you prefer- just follow the recipe as written above for the best result.  If you're using larger chicken breasts they may require a little longer cooking time.

Great recipe.
Quick, easy and delicious! Was craving this and once I made it, everyone loved it. I did use chicken flavored instant rice though, we are chicken lovers.

Quick but bland
I used cream chicken with herbs, and cooked this in my electric skillet. The chicken and the rice cooked wonderfully, but the end product was bland. If I make again I will change it up.

so easy!
Loved it! My family loves chicken, rice and broccoli. Putting them together with cream of chicken soup made a wonderful sauce. I used two cans instead of 1. I wanted to make sure it had enough sauce for all the rice and broccoli. I will definitely make it again.

Recipe Tips

Ingredient Note: We develop our recipes using a 4-to 5-ounce skinless, boneless chicken breast half per serving.  However, there are a range of sizes available in-store, from the butcher counter to the meat case and the freezer section.  Use whichever you prefer- just follow the recipe as written above for the best result.  If you're using larger chicken breasts they may require a little longer cooking time.

Quick and Easy
This was extremely easy to make and I loved the fact that it was prepared in a single skillet. I will add that I used the cream of celery instead of cream of mushroom, just because I wasn't sure what the overall taste would be like. I served this dish with a side of rice. Quick and easy meal.

Definitely will try!!
Campbell's never mentions their Golden Mushroom Soup. One would not believe the taste that adds to the simple tuna-nooclle casserole. I would think it would also add much taste to this dish as well as any dish that uses a mushroom soup. Yes, it is a bit more expensive but well worth the added taste.

Um - Um - Good!!!
This was such an easy recipe to make. I only made one change and that was the soup. I am highly allergic to MSG so - I used Campbell's Healthy Request Cream of Mushroom Soup that is low sodium and has no MSG!!! That was the only change I really made except I added a bit more garlic - like 1 tablespoon of minced garlic.

One Pot Spaghetti Carbonara





4

(3)

This one-pot wonder makes a simply delicious recipe easier than ever.  Pasta cooks right in the sauce adding to the rich creaminess that comes from cream of chicken soup.  Bacon adds a smoky note while Parmesan gives a great flavor boost.

Easy
Tried this tonight. I doubled the recipe, used whole wheat noodles and low sodium chicken broth. I also added some extra diced chicken breast for more protein. It has as great flavor. This recipe is one of my new favorites. It would be great with broccoli instead of peas.

One pot that's easy!
Tried this tonight both my picky kids liked it! It was super easy and fast, I like the idea of not having to boil spaghetti separate, you add it right to the pot! It tasted OK, I like the different ingredients although the cream of chicken soup was the majority flavor of the dish.I will definitely make this dish again in the future!

No way Carbonara
No way is this Spagetti Carbonara, it does not contain peas, and never eat pasta that has not been boiled in plenty of water & drained. Add crumbled bacon that has been cooked well also cream or milk.
