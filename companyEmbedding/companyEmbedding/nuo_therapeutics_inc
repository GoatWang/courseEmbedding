About Aurix™
Aurix™ is a biodynamic hematogel that harnesses a patient’s innate healing mechanisms to jumpstart the natural healing process.
Broaden Your Reach
Aurix is the first platelet and plasma therapy system to be cleared by the FDA for the management of ulcers and wounds of all types (DFU, pressure, VLU, etc.) and all severities (partial thickness, full thickness, and complex wounds).
Aurix can be used successfully on patients with:

Tunneling
Sinus tracts
Bone and tendon exposure
Hardware exposure

Flexibility for Patients and Providers
Aurix is effective at all stages of wound care for non-healing wounds, allowing providers more treatment flexibility across a broader range of patients.
 
 

 
 
 



Harnessing the body’s natural healing power leads to fewer applications and less time-to-heal.

The largest segment, the market for cardiovascular drugs, records huge sales every year. The rising world population, rapid ageing of the same, and an increased prevalence of diseases are the major factors driving growth of this industry. The recent breakthroughs in proteomics and genomics have led to the development of modernized approaches to drug discovery and development in the industry, for the possibility of newer, advanced, and more sophisticated therapies and drugs. Developments in biotechnology research have led to introduction of advanced therapies involving biopharmaceuticals, regenerative medicine, stem cells, etc. These new age therapies and products have caused ease of treatment procedures and enabled speedy recovery from various disorders. Technological growth in such interdisciplinary fields has opened up new arenas in drug discovery, drug delivery, and life sciences research.View Less
