    By having high schools use this I am able to follow the game in real time. Like what I'm accustomed to with following my favorite college or pro teams on the ESPN App.

The Seattle Times and Scorebook Live Join Forces to Expand High School Prep Coverage in the Northwest 


 by Scorebook Live
Posted on June 19, 2017June 19, 2017




Seattle, WA (June 2017) – The Seattle Times has entered into a Content Licensing Agreement with Scorebook Live, Inc. that will create a revolutionary change in regard to how high school content is created, published and distributed to fans across the region.
“We are excited about this opportunity to work with Scorebook Live and enhance our high-school sports content on seattletimes.com,” The Seattle Times Sports Editor Paul Barrett said. “Covering high-school sports is important to us, and providing live updates along with scores, standings and schedules is a key part of our mission.”
“The Metro League is excited to work with and use the Scorebook Live technology to better promote our student-athletes educational based athletic programs. Our fans are going to love how easy it will be to follow our teams and players throughout the upcoming sports season,” Executive Director of Athletics Eric McCurdy. “Working with Dan Beach, the team at Scorebook Live and our partners at The Seattle Times, it is very important for our student-athletes, coaches, families and communities.”
Scorebook Live will work collaboratively with The Seattle Times to provide fans with “live” scoreboards, schedules, league standings, and other exciting content that will be available at http://www.seattletimes.com/ and https://www.scorebooklive.com. High School football and basketball teams using the Scorebook Live apps will have their game updates and scores electronically delivered to The Seattle Times, thus eliminating the time consuming process of having coaches “call in” scores and fans being forced to wait until the games are over to check the results.
“Scorebook Live gives high school sports teams the ability to engage their fans in a manner that pro and college fans have become accustomed to… in real-time and from multiple sources,” says Scorebook Live Founder & CEO Dan Beach, “We are honored that both The Seattle Times and Metro League’s leadership immediately saw the value that working with us can bring to high school sports teams and their fans.”

AboutScorebook Live is a sports media and technology company that provides teams, leagues and tournaments with free mobile apps to create and publish real-time content to their fans while also supporting the efforts of local media. Founders are from ESPN & Lead Investor is the Cowles Company in Spokane, WA. Scorebook Live creates digital scorebooks that are different than stat apps. They are designed for today's scorekeeper, who is still using paper and pencil, and for coaches that don't want to share "all of their stats publicly". The box scores can be used by local media partners to eliminate the need for coaches to "call in scores". Maybe most importantly, the ScorebookCast, a real-time play-by-play feature, will get thousands of fans to engage and follow high school sports on a nightly basis.
