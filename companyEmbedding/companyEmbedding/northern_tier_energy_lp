               		June 23, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Western Refining, Inc. (NYSE:WNR) and Northern Tier Energy LP (NYSE:NTI) today announced that at the special meeting of NTI common unitholders held on June 23, 2016, NTI unitholders voted to approve the previously announced merger of NTI and a subsidiary of WNR, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated December 21, 2015, between NTI, WNR and certain other related parties thereto. On the same day, following the approval of the merger by NTI common unitholders, all closing conditions to the merger were satisfied, and the merger was successfully completed.

The election is subject to proration to ensure that the aggregate cash paid and WNR common stock issued in the merger will equal the total amount of cash and number of shares of WNR common stock that would have been paid and delivered if all NTI unitholders received $15.00 in cash and 0.2986 of a share of WNR common stock per NTI common unit. Preliminary merger consideration election results were previously disclosed by WNR and NTI in a joint press release dated June 22, 2016. The final allocation of merger consideration, which is currently expected to occur on or about June 28, 2016, will be calculated in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement.
