History[edit]




Smucker's in Canada


The J.M. Smucker Company was founded in 1897 by Jerome Monroe Smucker. The company produces many types of jellies, jams, and other food items. Jerome was born on December 5, 1858 in Orrville, Ohio. Much of his life was spent as a farmer in Orrville. In 1897 Jerome built a cider mill that was located in Orrville. Fruit that was used was from trees that Johnny Appleseed had planted in the early nineteenth century.[2] Later, he prepared apple butter and sold it from the back of a horse-drawn wagon.[2][3] The company was incorporated in 1921.[4]
The J. M. Smucker Company is a marketer and manufacturer of fruit spreads, peanut butter, shortening and oils, ice cream toppings, sweetened condensed milk, and health and natural foods and beverages. J.M. Smucker company brands include Smucker's, Santa Cruz Organic, Jif, Laura Scudder's, Crisco, Pillsbury, R.W. Knudsen Family, Hungry Jack, White Lily, and Martha White in the United States, along with Bick's, Five Roses, Robin Hood, and Shirriff in Canada.
The J. M. Smucker Company has been headquartered in Orrville, Ohio, since its founding, and has been family-run for four generations. Since 1998, the company has appeared on FORTUNE Magazine's annual listing of the "100 Best Companies to Work For in the United States", ranking number one in 2004.[5]
In May 2008, Smucker's announced it had bought the food division of Knott's Berry Farm from ConAgra Foods (Cedar Fair continues to own the theme park itself).
On June 4, 2008, Smucker's announced it would purchase the Folgers coffee brand division from Procter & Gamble for $3.3 billion.[6][7] Completion of the sale was announced on November 6, 2008.[8]
Throughout 2012, Smucker's contributed $485,000 to a $46-million political campaign known as the "Coalition Against The Costly Food Labeling Proposition, sponsored by Farmers and Food Producers".[9][10][11] This organization was set up to oppose a citizen's initiative in California, known as Proposition 37, demanding mandatory labeling of foods containing genetically modified ingredients. About 70% of the funding for the initiative was provided by a PAC and by companies with financial interests in the organic foods industry, with most of the remainder coming from a handful of wealthy individuals.[12] Following rejection of the proposition in the November 2012 referendum, organizers called for a boycott of companies funding the campaign to defeat the referendum.[13]
Past and present slogans[edit]

"With a name like Smucker's, it has to be good!"
"Smucker will make you pucker!"
"If you find a better jelly, you buy it!"
"Smucker Company, the brand you can trust"
"There ain't no place like Smucker's!"
"The only brand of jams that can make a piece of bread lively!"
"If you're hungry, Smucker's is the way to go!"
"Smucker's may be yummy, your tummy may be too, but your grocer's freezer, is not far from you!"
"Bread, jam and jelly, in your belly, lick your spoon and cut your bread, then you will be Smucker's well fed"

Johnny Carson, former host of The Tonight Show, once introduced his sponsor on air as "With a name like Smucker's, it had better be good!"

J.M. Smucker (SJM) Rewards Shareholders With a Raise - Dividend Growth Investor

      skip to sidebar







Dividend Growth Investor




On my way to financial independence with Dividend Growth Stocks

J.M. Smucker (SJM) Rewards Shareholders With a Raise





The J. M. Smucker Company (SJM) engages in manufacturing and marketing branded food products primarily in the United States, Canada, and internationally. The company is a member of the dividend achievers index.  The company’s largest competitors include Conagra (CAG), Kraft Heinz (KHC) and Hershey (HSY).  

The Board of Directors approved a 4% dividend increase last week, bringing the quarterly payment to 78 cents/share.  This marked the 20th consecutive annual dividend increase for this dividend achiever.



This was the slowest dividend increase since the 4.70% dividend hike in 2015. Over the past decade, this company has managed to boost annual dividends at a rate of 9.80%/year.  A small dividend hike shows that management is cautious about near term prospects for the business. 

The company has managed to grow earnings per share from $3/share in 2008 to $5.10 in 2017. Analysts expect J. M. Smucker to earn an adjusted EPS of $8.35 per share in 2018. In comparison, the company earned an adjusted $7.72/share in 2017, which was down from the adjusted $7.79/share in 2016.




Under GAAP, J.M. Smucker earned $5.10/share in 2017. However, the company also shows adjusted earnings per share, which they believe to be closer to the true operating performance of the business. This adjusted amount excludes things like amortization for finite-lived intangible assets as well as impairments. At the current rate, we could expect a $200 million non-cash charge every year for the next 22 years. This is the weighted-average useful life of total finite-lived intangible assets is 22 years. This will depress near term earnings by a little less than $1.80/share for two decades. This is something to take into account when looking at measuring earnings power. I still use GAAP EPS numbers for historical comparison purposes, in order to evaluate how a business has done over a longer period of time.  Unfortunately, the company has only provided adjusted earnings per share using the current formula that only go as far back as 2012.  J.M. Smucker earned $5.31/share in adjusted earnings in 2012, which was equivalent to $4.06/share. As the company makes more acquisitions, these amortization charges may even increase over time.

The company has grown by acquisitions over the past decade. This could likely continue in the future.  The most recent acquisition was that of Big Heart Pet Brands in 2015. However, we also want to have organic growth in revenues and earnings to further boost our shareholder wealth and income.  While the items sold by Smucker are sticky products, which generate recurring revenues from customers, we want to evaluate whether those relationships hold in the future. We seem to operate under a more competitive environment, where customers are also getting more health conscious. 

J.M. Smucker also regularly does share buybacks. The company dilutes existing shareholders by issuing shares in its acquisitions however, which is why the number of shares outstanding has increased slightly over the past five years. The number of shares outstanding is slightly lower than the number from 2008.

Currently, J. M. Smucker looks overvalued at 23 times 2017 GAAP earnings, but looks attractive at 15.30 times adjusted earnings. The stock yields 2.60%. The dividend payout ratio is at 61% using EPS  and at 40% using adjusted earnings per share. The dividend is safe, because there is more than enough margin of safety in dividends from earnings. I believe that this is an attractively valued business for long-term investors who are willing to patiently sit on it for years.

                        IN EVERY JAR FROM SMUCKER'S®,

                        THERE'S MORE THAN YOU SEE.                    









                        Apple Tree ROOTS                    
Back in 1897, J.M. Smucker made his first batch of Apple Butter — from apples picked off of trees planted by Johnny Appleseed himself. Apple Butter was our best-selling product until the 1960s, when jams, jellies, and preserves took over. And though you can now find Smucker’s fruit spreads from Strawberry Preserves to Guava Jelly, we still honor the humble beginnings of our apple tree roots.








                        THERE ARE MEMORIES, SMILES, AND LOVE                     

                        SHARED BY PEOPLE WHO MAKE IT                    








                        From Orrville to Your-Ville                    
How many FORTUNE® 500 companies base their corporate headquarters in Orrville, Ohio? Smucker’s and Orrville go together like PB & J. Orrville may be small, but it’s where we found our pioneering spirit and our guiding principles.
Learn more about us in our About Smucker’s section.








                        AND THOSE                     

                        WHO ENJOY IT.                    








                        Welcome to the Family                    
For Smucker’s 100th birthday in 1997, we popped open the syrup bottles and treated the whole town of Orrville, Ohio — 6,000 people — to a pancake breakfast at the high school gym. We love making meals for our family.

                        AND WHILE YOU MIGHT NOT                    

                        SEE THIS IN EVERY JAR                    








                        Making Life More Fruitful                    
Smucker’s has maintained relationships with many of our fruit-grower families since the 1970s. In fact, we’re often invited to their weddings, graduations, and birthday parties. Our growers are just another part of our extended family, and they inspire us to find new ways to make life more fruitful.
Discover simple ways to make today more fruitful.

                        it has to be good.® 









Smucker’s Sweet Slogan                    
Our famous slogan started out as a way to have fun with the Smucker’s name. Turns out, being simply honest about who you are can turn out to be a great way to sell some jam. Who knew?

Smucker’s History



Our Company



 



Our History

The History of Our Company



In the early 19th century, John Chapman, or “Johnny Appleseed,” wandered the Ohio countryside, sowing apple seeds and securing a place in American history.
It was from the fruit of Johnny Appleseed's trees that Orrville, Ohio, resident Jerome Monroe Smucker first pressed cider at a mill he opened in 1897. Later, he also prepared apple butter, which he sold from the back of a horse-drawn wagon. Each crock bore a hand-signed seal as his personal guarantee of quality.
Before long, J.M. Smucker’s name became well known in its own right, as residents throughout the region — and eventually the nation — came to associate the Smucker’s® brand name with wholesome, high-quality fruit products.
Much like Johnny Appleseed's trees, The J.M. Smucker Company has strong roots that have allowed it to grow and prosper for nearly 120 years. Today, our products can be found in homes and restaurants throughout the world.

History[edit]




Smucker's in Canada


The J.M. Smucker Company was founded in 1897 by Jerome Monroe Smucker. The company produces many types of jellies, jams, and other food items. Jerome was born on December 5, 1858 in Orrville, Ohio. Much of his life was spent as a farmer in Orrville. In 1897 Jerome built a cider mill that was located in Orrville. Fruit that was used was from trees that Johnny Appleseed had planted in the early nineteenth century.[2] Later, he prepared apple butter and sold it from the back of a horse-drawn wagon.[2][3] The company was incorporated in 1921.[4]
The J. M. Smucker Company is a marketer and manufacturer of fruit spreads, peanut butter, shortening and oils, ice cream toppings, sweetened condensed milk, and health and natural foods and beverages. J.M. Smucker company brands include Smucker's, Santa Cruz Organic, Jif, Laura Scudder's, Crisco, Pillsbury, R.W. Knudsen Family, Hungry Jack, White Lily, and Martha White in the United States, along with Bick's, Five Roses, Robin Hood, and Shirriff in Canada.
The J. M. Smucker Company has been headquartered in Orrville, Ohio, since its founding, and has been family-run for four generations. Since 1998, the company has appeared on FORTUNE Magazine's annual listing of the "100 Best Companies to Work For in the United States", ranking number one in 2004.[5]
In May 2008, Smucker's announced it had bought the food division of Knott's Berry Farm from ConAgra Foods (Cedar Fair continues to own the theme park itself).
On June 4, 2008, Smucker's announced it would purchase the Folgers coffee brand division from Procter & Gamble for $3.3 billion.[6][7] Completion of the sale was announced on November 6, 2008.[8]
Throughout 2012, Smucker's contributed $485,000 to a $46-million political campaign known as the "Coalition Against The Costly Food Labeling Proposition, sponsored by Farmers and Food Producers".[9][10][11] This organization was set up to oppose a citizen's initiative in California, known as Proposition 37, demanding mandatory labeling of foods containing genetically modified ingredients. About 70% of the funding for the initiative was provided by a PAC and by companies with financial interests in the organic foods industry, with most of the remainder coming from a handful of wealthy individuals.[12] Following rejection of the proposition in the November 2012 referendum, organizers called for a boycott of companies funding the campaign to defeat the referendum.[13]
Past and present slogans[edit]

"With a name like Smucker's, it has to be good!"
"Smucker will make you pucker!"
"If you find a better jelly, you buy it!"
"Smucker Company, the brand you can trust"
"There ain't no place like Smucker's!"
"The only brand of jams that can make a piece of bread lively!"
"If you're hungry, Smucker's is the way to go!"
"Smucker's may be yummy, your tummy may be too, but your grocer's freezer, is not far from you!"
"Bread, jam and jelly, in your belly, lick your spoon and cut your bread, then you will be Smucker's well fed"

Johnny Carson, former host of The Tonight Show, once introduced his sponsor on air as "With a name like Smucker's, it had better be good!"

History[edit]




Smucker's in Canada


The J.M. Smucker Company was founded in 1897 by Jerome Monroe Smucker. The company produces many types of jellies, jams, and other food items. Jerome was born on December 5, 1858 in Orrville, Ohio. Much of his life was spent as a farmer in Orrville. In 1897 Jerome built a cider mill that was located in Orrville. Fruit that was used was from trees that Johnny Appleseed had planted in the early nineteenth century.[2] Later, he prepared apple butter and sold it from the back of a horse-drawn wagon.[2][3] The company was incorporated in 1921.[4]
The J. M. Smucker Company is a marketer and manufacturer of fruit spreads, peanut butter, shortening and oils, ice cream toppings, sweetened condensed milk, and health and natural foods and beverages. J.M. Smucker company brands include Smucker's, Santa Cruz Organic, Jif, Laura Scudder's, Crisco, Pillsbury, R.W. Knudsen Family, Hungry Jack, White Lily, and Martha White in the United States, along with Bick's, Five Roses, Robin Hood, and Shirriff in Canada.
The J. M. Smucker Company has been headquartered in Orrville, Ohio, since its founding, and has been family-run for four generations. Since 1998, the company has appeared on FORTUNE Magazine's annual listing of the "100 Best Companies to Work For in the United States", ranking number one in 2004.[5]
In May 2008, Smucker's announced it had bought the food division of Knott's Berry Farm from ConAgra Foods (Cedar Fair continues to own the theme park itself).
On June 4, 2008, Smucker's announced it would purchase the Folgers coffee brand division from Procter & Gamble for $3.3 billion.[6][7] Completion of the sale was announced on November 6, 2008.[8]
Throughout 2012, Smucker's contributed $485,000 to a $46-million political campaign known as the "Coalition Against The Costly Food Labeling Proposition, sponsored by Farmers and Food Producers".[9][10][11] This organization was set up to oppose a citizen's initiative in California, known as Proposition 37, demanding mandatory labeling of foods containing genetically modified ingredients. About 70% of the funding for the initiative was provided by a PAC and by companies with financial interests in the organic foods industry, with most of the remainder coming from a handful of wealthy individuals.[12] Following rejection of the proposition in the November 2012 referendum, organizers called for a boycott of companies funding the campaign to defeat the referendum.[13]
Past and present slogans[edit]

"With a name like Smucker's, it has to be good!"
"Smucker will make you pucker!"
"If you find a better jelly, you buy it!"
"Smucker Company, the brand you can trust"
"There ain't no place like Smucker's!"
"The only brand of jams that can make a piece of bread lively!"
"If you're hungry, Smucker's is the way to go!"
"Smucker's may be yummy, your tummy may be too, but your grocer's freezer, is not far from you!"
"Bread, jam and jelly, in your belly, lick your spoon and cut your bread, then you will be Smucker's well fed"

Johnny Carson, former host of The Tonight Show, once introduced his sponsor on air as "With a name like Smucker's, it had better be good!"

                        Apple Tree ROOTS                    
Back in 1897, J.M. Smucker made his first batch of Apple Butter — from apples picked off of trees planted by Johnny Appleseed himself. Apple Butter was our best-selling product until the 1960s, when jams, jellies, and preserves took over. And though you can now find Smucker’s fruit spreads from Strawberry Preserves to Guava Jelly, we still honor the humble beginnings of our apple tree roots.

How many FORTUNE® 500 companies base their corporate headquarters in Orrville, Ohio? Smucker’s and Orrville go together like PB & J. Orrville may be small, but it’s where we found our pioneering spirit and our guiding principles.

For Smucker’s 100th birthday in 1997, we popped open the syrup bottles and treated the whole town of Orrville, Ohio — 6,000 people — to a pancake breakfast at the high school gym. We love making meals for our family.

Smucker’s Sweet Slogan                    
Our famous slogan started out as a way to have fun with the Smucker’s name. Turns out, being simply honest about who you are can turn out to be a great way to sell some jam. Who knew?

History[edit]




Smucker's in Canada


The J.M. Smucker Company was founded in 1897 by Jerome Monroe Smucker. The company produces many types of jellies, jams, and other food items. Jerome was born on December 5, 1858 in Orrville, Ohio. Much of his life was spent as a farmer in Orrville. In 1897 Jerome built a cider mill that was located in Orrville. Fruit that was used was from trees that Johnny Appleseed had planted in the early nineteenth century.[2] Later, he prepared apple butter and sold it from the back of a horse-drawn wagon.[2][3] The company was incorporated in 1921.[4]
The J. M. Smucker Company is a marketer and manufacturer of fruit spreads, peanut butter, shortening and oils, ice cream toppings, sweetened condensed milk, and health and natural foods and beverages. J.M. Smucker company brands include Smucker's, Santa Cruz Organic, Jif, Laura Scudder's, Crisco, Pillsbury, R.W. Knudsen Family, Hungry Jack, White Lily, and Martha White in the United States, along with Bick's, Five Roses, Robin Hood, and Shirriff in Canada.
The J. M. Smucker Company has been headquartered in Orrville, Ohio, since its founding, and has been family-run for four generations. Since 1998, the company has appeared on FORTUNE Magazine's annual listing of the "100 Best Companies to Work For in the United States", ranking number one in 2004.[5]
In May 2008, Smucker's announced it had bought the food division of Knott's Berry Farm from ConAgra Foods (Cedar Fair continues to own the theme park itself).
On June 4, 2008, Smucker's announced it would purchase the Folgers coffee brand division from Procter & Gamble for $3.3 billion.[6][7] Completion of the sale was announced on November 6, 2008.[8]
Throughout 2012, Smucker's contributed $485,000 to a $46-million political campaign known as the "Coalition Against The Costly Food Labeling Proposition, sponsored by Farmers and Food Producers".[9][10][11] This organization was set up to oppose a citizen's initiative in California, known as Proposition 37, demanding mandatory labeling of foods containing genetically modified ingredients. About 70% of the funding for the initiative was provided by a PAC and by companies with financial interests in the organic foods industry, with most of the remainder coming from a handful of wealthy individuals.[12] Following rejection of the proposition in the November 2012 referendum, organizers called for a boycott of companies funding the campaign to defeat the referendum.[13]
Past and present slogans[edit]

"With a name like Smucker's, it has to be good!"
"Smucker will make you pucker!"
"If you find a better jelly, you buy it!"
"Smucker Company, the brand you can trust"
"There ain't no place like Smucker's!"
"The only brand of jams that can make a piece of bread lively!"
"If you're hungry, Smucker's is the way to go!"
"Smucker's may be yummy, your tummy may be too, but your grocer's freezer, is not far from you!"
"Bread, jam and jelly, in your belly, lick your spoon and cut your bread, then you will be Smucker's well fed"

Johnny Carson, former host of The Tonight Show, once introduced his sponsor on air as "With a name like Smucker's, it had better be good!"

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

History[edit]




Smucker's in Canada


The J.M. Smucker Company was founded in 1897 by Jerome Monroe Smucker. The company produces many types of jellies, jams, and other food items. Jerome was born on December 5, 1858 in Orrville, Ohio. Much of his life was spent as a farmer in Orrville. In 1897 Jerome built a cider mill that was located in Orrville. Fruit that was used was from trees that Johnny Appleseed had planted in the early nineteenth century.[2] Later, he prepared apple butter and sold it from the back of a horse-drawn wagon.[2][3] The company was incorporated in 1921.[4]
The J. M. Smucker Company is a marketer and manufacturer of fruit spreads, peanut butter, shortening and oils, ice cream toppings, sweetened condensed milk, and health and natural foods and beverages. J.M. Smucker company brands include Smucker's, Santa Cruz Organic, Jif, Laura Scudder's, Crisco, Pillsbury, R.W. Knudsen Family, Hungry Jack, White Lily, and Martha White in the United States, along with Bick's, Five Roses, Robin Hood, and Shirriff in Canada.
The J. M. Smucker Company has been headquartered in Orrville, Ohio, since its founding, and has been family-run for four generations. Since 1998, the company has appeared on FORTUNE Magazine's annual listing of the "100 Best Companies to Work For in the United States", ranking number one in 2004.[5]
In May 2008, Smucker's announced it had bought the food division of Knott's Berry Farm from ConAgra Foods (Cedar Fair continues to own the theme park itself).
On June 4, 2008, Smucker's announced it would purchase the Folgers coffee brand division from Procter & Gamble for $3.3 billion.[6][7] Completion of the sale was announced on November 6, 2008.[8]
Throughout 2012, Smucker's contributed $485,000 to a $46-million political campaign known as the "Coalition Against The Costly Food Labeling Proposition, sponsored by Farmers and Food Producers".[9][10][11] This organization was set up to oppose a citizen's initiative in California, known as Proposition 37, demanding mandatory labeling of foods containing genetically modified ingredients. About 70% of the funding for the initiative was provided by a PAC and by companies with financial interests in the organic foods industry, with most of the remainder coming from a handful of wealthy individuals.[12] Following rejection of the proposition in the November 2012 referendum, organizers called for a boycott of companies funding the campaign to defeat the referendum.[13]
Past and present slogans[edit]

"With a name like Smucker's, it has to be good!"
"Smucker will make you pucker!"
"If you find a better jelly, you buy it!"
"Smucker Company, the brand you can trust"
"There ain't no place like Smucker's!"
"The only brand of jams that can make a piece of bread lively!"
"If you're hungry, Smucker's is the way to go!"
"Smucker's may be yummy, your tummy may be too, but your grocer's freezer, is not far from you!"
"Bread, jam and jelly, in your belly, lick your spoon and cut your bread, then you will be Smucker's well fed"

Johnny Carson, former host of The Tonight Show, once introduced his sponsor on air as "With a name like Smucker's, it had better be good!"

                        IN EVERY JAR FROM SMUCKER'S®,

                        THERE'S MORE THAN YOU SEE.                    









                        Apple Tree ROOTS                    
Back in 1897, J.M. Smucker made his first batch of Apple Butter — from apples picked off of trees planted by Johnny Appleseed himself. Apple Butter was our best-selling product until the 1960s, when jams, jellies, and preserves took over. And though you can now find Smucker’s fruit spreads from Strawberry Preserves to Guava Jelly, we still honor the humble beginnings of our apple tree roots.








                        THERE ARE MEMORIES, SMILES, AND LOVE                     

                        SHARED BY PEOPLE WHO MAKE IT                    








                        From Orrville to Your-Ville                    
How many FORTUNE® 500 companies base their corporate headquarters in Orrville, Ohio? Smucker’s and Orrville go together like PB & J. Orrville may be small, but it’s where we found our pioneering spirit and our guiding principles.
Learn more about us in our About Smucker’s section.








                        AND THOSE                     

                        WHO ENJOY IT.                    








                        Welcome to the Family                    
For Smucker’s 100th birthday in 1997, we popped open the syrup bottles and treated the whole town of Orrville, Ohio — 6,000 people — to a pancake breakfast at the high school gym. We love making meals for our family.
Find a recipe for your next family meal.












                        AND WHILE YOU MIGHT NOT                    

                        SEE THIS IN EVERY JAR                    








                        Making Life More Fruitful                    
Smucker’s has maintained relationships with many of our fruit-grower families since the 1970s. In fact, we’re often invited to their weddings, graduations, and birthday parties. Our growers are just another part of our extended family, and they inspire us to find new ways to make life more fruitful.
Discover simple ways to make today more fruitful.








                        YOU CAN TASTE IT                    

                        With a name like Smucker's,                    

                        it has to be good.® 









Smucker’s Sweet Slogan                    
Our famous slogan started out as a way to have fun with the Smucker’s name. Turns out, being simply honest about who you are can turn out to be a great way to sell some jam. Who knew?

J.M. Smucker profit and sales beat expectations, boosted by its consumer foods and coffee business
J.M. Smucker Co.  reported Thursday a fiscal first-quarter net profit that fell to $196.7 million, or 96 cents a share, from $246.1 million, or $1.61 a share, in the same period a year ago.

The stock, which was still inactive in premarket trade, has edged up 2.2% year to date, while the S&P 500  has gained 8.7%.

Smucker to acquire Wesson oil brand from Conagra for $285 million
The J.M. Smucker Co.  said Tuesday that it has signed an agreement with Conagra Brands Inc.  to acquire the century-old Wesson oil brand for about $285 million excluding an expected tax benefit of about $45 million. The all-cash transaction will be funded primarily with debt and is subject to regulatory approval. Smucker expects annual net sales of $230 million and additional adjusted earnings of 10 cents per share in the first full year after closing. Annual cost synergies of about $20 million should be realized within two years after closing. Conagra will continue to manufacture Wesson brand products and provide other services for up to a year following the close of the transaction, at which point Smucker expects to consolidate Wesson production into its existing oil manufacturing facility in Cincinnati. Smucker shares are down 0.5% in Tuesday trading, and down 10% for the last three months. Conagra shares are down 1.3% in Tuesday trading, and down 6.5% for the past three months. The S&P 500 index  is up 2% for the last three months.

About The J M Smucker Company

   The J. M. Smucker Company gets its bread and butter from more than just making and marketing jelly. The company, known for manufacturing its namesake Smucker's fruit spread and for selling the Jif peanut butter brand, has expanded its product portfolio to include Folgers, the #1-coffee brand in the US, as well as market leaders in espresso (Café Bustelo) and premium java (Dunkin' Donuts, licensed). Other top-shelf lines are Hungry Jack and Pillsbury baking mixes and frostings, Eagle canned milk, and Crisco shortening and oils, among others. Smucker's brands are sold to consumers through retail outlets in the US and Canada, with some products exported.
   Operations

   Smucker's operations are divided among three business segments: US Retail Coffee, US Retail Pet Foods, and US Retail Consumer Foods. The US retail market segments are distinguished by product, which combined account for more than 85% of the company's sales. (Consumer Foods and Coffee each contributed 29% of revenues in fiscal 2016.)
  

   The International and Foodservice segment (13% of sales) comprises Smucker's portfolio of brands that are distributed both at home and abroad through retailers (grocery stores, mass merchandisers, club stores, and drug stores), as well as through food service suppliers and operators, such as restaurants, educational and health care institutions, and natural foods stores.
  

   After acquiring Big Heart, Smucker established its newest segment, US Retail Pet Foods. That unit contributed 29% of revenues in 2016.
  

   Smucker's long-term agreements include one with Dunkin' Donuts to manufacture and market its namesake coffee brand; the pact is effective until 2034. In the single-serve coffee market, Smucker holds sway through a manufacturing and distribution deal with Keurig Green Mountain and Keurig. Smucker also totes royalty-free licensing agreements with General Mills, National Dairy, and Nestlé to make and sell, respectively, Pillsbury flour and baking mixes, Borden canned milk, and Carnation canned milk.
  
Geographic Reach

   Smucker operates in the US, where it generates more than 90% of its revenue. It has an international presence, as well, through its extended reach into Canada, Mexico, and China. The company has established a small customer base along with some manufacturing facilities in Canada, and a limited export market.
  

   The company has a principal distribution center in Canada, Nine sales and administrative offices in the US, and one each in China, Canada, and Mexico. Its corporate headquarters are located in Orrville, Ohio, and its Canadian headquarters are located in Markham, Ontario. The headquarters of its pet food business is in San Francisco; it has additional administrative facilities in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and in Burbank, California.
  
Sales and Marketing

   Products are sold through direct sales and brokers to a broad range of retailers. Wal-Mart and subsidiaries account for more than 30% of sales. Indeed, the company's top 10 customers generates some 70% of Smucker's 2016 revenues. The company's International and Foodservice business distributes Smucker's products through retailers and food service suppliers and operators both domestically and internationally.
  

   In the US retail market segments, the company's products are primarily sold through direct sales and brokers to food retailers, food wholesalers, drug stores, club stores, mass merchandisers, discount and dollar stores, military commissaries, natural foods stores and distributors, and pet specialty stores. Its International and Foodservice products are distributed through retail channels and foodservice distributors and operators (e.g., restaurants, lodging, schools and universities, health care operators).
  
Financial Performance

   In fiscal 2016 Smucker's net sales increased by 37% due to higher sales from US Retail Pet foods driven by distribution gains for the Natural Balance brand and growth in Milk-Bone dog snacks.
  

   Net income grew by 100% due to increased sales.
  

   In fiscal 2016 the company's net cash provided by the operating activities increased by 99%.
  
Strategy

   Smucker's strategy focuses on growth through owning and marketing the #1 brand name food products in North America, with potential for worldwide appeal. Acquisitions and manufacturing and distribution agreements underpin these ends.  As part of the company's long-term growth objectives, it is working to increase sales by 6% and earnings per share by more than 8% annually on average. While the sales contribution from acquisitions will vary from year to year, it expects organic growth, including new products, to add up to 4% per year and acquisitions to contribute the remainder over the long term. Products launched in 2015 included Café Bustelo K-Cup pods and Jif To Go Dippers; pipeline products range from Dunkin' Donuts K-Cup pods to Milk-Bone Good Morning dog vitamin treats.
  

   In response to ongoing declines in the green coffee futures market, Smucker lowered the prices of most of its US packaged coffee products (with the exception of its K-Cup pods) in 2015. It slashed prices by an average of 6%; the move was intended to bring coffee sales volumes back up.
  

   With the 2015 acquisition of Big Heart Pet Brands, the company instantly became a player in the growing pet food and snacks market. The company plans to pay down debt it took to finance that purchase over the next three to five years.
  

   That year, the company sold its US canned milk brands and operations to Eagle Family Foods, a subsidiary of funds affiliated with Kelso & Company. The transaction included canned milk products that were primarily sold in US retail and food service channels under the Eagle Brand and Magnolia brands, along with other branded and private label trade names.
  
Mergers and Acquisitions

   In early 2015, Smucker purchased Big Heart Pet Brands in a cash and stock transaction valued at $5.8 billion (including $2.6 billion of debt). Smucker gained a huge product portfolio with the deal, adding such notable names as Mew Mix, Milk-Bone, Kibbles 'n Bits, Natural Balance, and Milo's Kitchen, among others, to its own list of brands.
  

   In 2014, the company bought Sahale Snacks, a maker of nut and fruit mixes. The Seattle-based company rings up an estimated $50 million in annual sales from warehouse clubs, convenience stores, and supermarkets. In 2013, Smucker purchased privately held $45 million-in-sales Enray to strengthen its natural foods business. Enray, which is based in California, is a supplier of organic grains, beans, and seeds.

J.M. Smucker (SJM) Rewards Shareholders With a Raise - Dividend Growth Investor

Dividend Growth Investor




On my way to financial independence with Dividend Growth Stocks

J.M. Smucker (SJM) Rewards Shareholders With a Raise





The J. M. Smucker Company (SJM) engages in manufacturing and marketing branded food products primarily in the United States, Canada, and internationally. The company is a member of the dividend achievers index.  The company’s largest competitors include Conagra (CAG), Kraft Heinz (KHC) and Hershey (HSY).  

The Board of Directors approved a 4% dividend increase last week, bringing the quarterly payment to 78 cents/share.  This marked the 20th consecutive annual dividend increase for this dividend achiever.



This was the slowest dividend increase since the 4.70% dividend hike in 2015. Over the past decade, this company has managed to boost annual dividends at a rate of 9.80%/year.  A small dividend hike shows that management is cautious about near term prospects for the business. 

The company has managed to grow earnings per share from $3/share in 2008 to $5.10 in 2017. Analysts expect J. M. Smucker to earn an adjusted EPS of $8.35 per share in 2018. In comparison, the company earned an adjusted $7.72/share in 2017, which was down from the adjusted $7.79/share in 2016.




Under GAAP, J.M. Smucker earned $5.10/share in 2017. However, the company also shows adjusted earnings per share, which they believe to be closer to the true operating performance of the business. This adjusted amount excludes things like amortization for finite-lived intangible assets as well as impairments. At the current rate, we could expect a $200 million non-cash charge every year for the next 22 years. This is the weighted-average useful life of total finite-lived intangible assets is 22 years. This will depress near term earnings by a little less than $1.80/share for two decades. This is something to take into account when looking at measuring earnings power. I still use GAAP EPS numbers for historical comparison purposes, in order to evaluate how a business has done over a longer period of time.  Unfortunately, the company has only provided adjusted earnings per share using the current formula that only go as far back as 2012.  J.M. Smucker earned $5.31/share in adjusted earnings in 2012, which was equivalent to $4.06/share. As the company makes more acquisitions, these amortization charges may even increase over time.

The company has grown by acquisitions over the past decade. This could likely continue in the future.  The most recent acquisition was that of Big Heart Pet Brands in 2015. However, we also want to have organic growth in revenues and earnings to further boost our shareholder wealth and income.  While the items sold by Smucker are sticky products, which generate recurring revenues from customers, we want to evaluate whether those relationships hold in the future. We seem to operate under a more competitive environment, where customers are also getting more health conscious. 

J.M. Smucker also regularly does share buybacks. The company dilutes existing shareholders by issuing shares in its acquisitions however, which is why the number of shares outstanding has increased slightly over the past five years. The number of shares outstanding is slightly lower than the number from 2008.

Currently, J. M. Smucker looks overvalued at 23 times 2017 GAAP earnings, but looks attractive at 15.30 times adjusted earnings. The stock yields 2.60%. The dividend payout ratio is at 61% using EPS  and at 40% using adjusted earnings per share. The dividend is safe, because there is more than enough margin of safety in dividends from earnings. I believe that this is an attractively valued business for long-term investors who are willing to patiently sit on it for years.
