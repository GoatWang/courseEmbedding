CONSUMER INFO
ELECTRICITY






	Electricity

	The PUC has jurisdiction over 11 electric distribution companies which serve the majority of the Commonwealth. Rural electric cooperatives and most utilities owned and operated by cities, boroughs or townships are not regulated by the Commission. For information on these, contact the electric co-op, Pennsylvania Rural Electric Association, or your local municipality.

	 

	PPL Electric Public Input Hearings

PPL Electric Utilities’ proposed rate increase at Docket No. R-2015-2469275

	The PUC has scheduled three public input hearings to accept public comment on PPL Electric Utilities’ proposal for an overall rate increase of $167.5 million. Members of the public are invited to comment for the public record. Two public input hearings will be "Smart Hearings," broadcast as a live streams on the PUC's website. 

	The new Smart Hearings will enable residents throughout Pennsylvania to see and hear the testimony being offered. During the Smart Hearings, concerned individuals will be able to offer their comments by telephone, to be included in the live Internet stream, allowing those consumers to testify from the convenience of their homes or other locations, rather that requiring them to travel to a hearing site. In-person testimony at the Harrisburg hearing site will also be included, for those who prefer to comment in that manner.

	A public input hearing is to gather the opinions and evidence of the ratepayers of PPL Electric regarding its request for a base rate increase.  Because PPL Electric's service territory covers all or parts of 29 counties, the public input hearings will be accessible by telephone, meaning that you can testify by telephone from anywhere in those 29 counties.   

	 

	Electricity Presentations

PA Electricity Generation Choice and Competition Act - Presentation given by Chairman Cawley to the Philadelphia Business Journal's 2010 Energy Summit on October 28, 2010.

Expiration of Rate Caps: The Numbers Tell the Story - Presentation given by Chairman Cawley to the National Energy Marketers Association at the Annual Fall Leadership Roundtable on October 19, 2010.

Act 129 Update - Presentation given by Chairman Cawley to the Association of Energy Engineers - Central Pennsylvania Chapter on January 21, 2010.

	 

	EDC Service Outage Response Reports

Winter Storm Nika Report - The February 2014 ice storm (Nika) had a significant impact on Pennsylvania and its electric distribution companies (EDCs).  The number and duration of Nika-related outages warranted a review of the EDCs’ preparation and response by the PUC’s Bureau of Technical Utility Services (TUS). This review is based on a combination of the utilities’ reports required by Commission regulations, telephonic and email conversations with the EDCs throughout the restoration period, and information from subsequent meetings and communications with EDCs and other stakeholders. This includes two after-action review meetings held by the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency (PEMA) and three public input sessions conducted by the PUC.

Hurricane Sandy Report  – The number and duration of Sandy-related outages warranted a review of the EDCs’ preparation and response by the PUC. The review is based on the utilities’ reports required by Commission regulations, telephonic and email conversations with the EDCs throughout the restoration period, and information from subsequent meetings and communications with EDCs and other stakeholders. Recommendations for further action by the Commission and EDCs are included.

Executive Summary - Pennsylvania’s electric distribution companies (EDCs) were affected by several strong storm systems of varying meteorological circumstances in 2011.  All jurisdictional EDCs except one had at least one PUC reportable outage event in 2011. Released August 7, 2012.

	To address these concerns, the Commission staff was tasked with preparing the following three reports:

Hurricane Irene Report

Summary Report of EDCs’ Handling of High-Call Volumes and Analysis of Storm and Severe Weather Data

Summary Report of Outage Information Required by Nov. 11, 2011 Order at Docket No. I-2011-2271989
	 

	EPA Proposed Regulations Under Clean Air Act (CAA) Section 111(d)

	On June 18, 2014, the EPA proposed new regulations governing greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants for the states. The EPA’s proposed CAA Section 111 (d) regulations represent a far-reaching first step in controlling GHG emissions on a national basis. The EPA’s framework is intended to maximize compliance flexibility by presenting the states with a range of options for achieving compliance. EPA’s proposed building block approach allows the states to choose the compliance mechanism that best suits existing and proposed generation mix, renewable/energy efficiency/DR programs and single or multi-state compliance options.

	The PA Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) will be the responsible party to administer PA’s compliance program. The PUC will be involved in assisting PADEP in designing that compliance program to ensure there are no adverse impacts to the reliability of electric service.

	On December 1, 2014, the Commission filed comments on the CAA 111(d) proposed regulations.
