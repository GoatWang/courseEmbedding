April 25, 2016 06:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



INDIANAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--US Agriculture, LLC (“USAG”) announced today that it has merged 
      operations with Halderman Real Asset Management, LLC (“HRAM”). The 
      combined entity will continue to operate as US Agriculture. Anatole 
      Pevnev, Managing Director of USAG, will serve as Managing Director of 
      the merged company. Howard Halderman, Founder and President of HRAM will 
      serve as Executive Chairman of USAG’s Board of Managers. Terms of the 
      transaction were not disclosed.
    


      As part of the merger, US Agriculture will make the following senior 
      management appointments:
    


        Adam Gore will join USAG as Director of Portfolio Management,
      

        David Martin will join USAG as Director of Asset Management,
      

        Brian Wise will join USAG as Director of Acquisitions, and
      

        James Boren will join USAG as Controller.
      


      US Agriculture, founded in 2015 by Hageman Group, is an SEC registered 
      investment adviser focused on institutional investment in farmland. 
      Hageman Group is the family office founded by Steve Hageman, who has a 
      deep history in production agriculture and real estate investment. Steve 
      was a founding partner of Remington Seeds, which, over the course of 
      thirty years, grew to become the nation’s largest non-retail corn and 
      soybean seed production, conditioning, and distribution company. Mr. 
      Hageman, who serves as a Member of USAG’s Board of Managers, sold his 
      interest in Remington Seeds in 2013 to an institutional investor focused 
      on agricultural operating assets.
    

      Halderman Real Asset Management, founded in 2013 by Howard Halderman, is 
      a privately held, SEC registered investment adviser, providing 
      agricultural investment management services for institutional investors. 
      HRAM grew out of the farm management business of Halderman Farm 
      Management Service, which was founded in 1930 by Howard’s grandparents, 
      Howard H. Halderman and Marie Halderman.
    

      With regard to the transaction, Howard Halderman noted that, “We’re very 
      excited about this merger and the benefits it brings to both our clients 
      and our firm. The deep network of relationships that the Hageman family 
      and US Agriculture bring will open significantly more investment 
      opportunities and allow us to expand the breadth and depth of what we 
      offer investors.”
    

      “HRAM brings with it a strong investment team with a deep background in 
      farming and agriculture. We’re excited to have them join us as part of 
      US Agriculture,” commented Steve Hageman.
    

      Mr. Hageman added that, “My family has been farming in Indiana for over 
      a hundred years. As we grew Remington Seeds, we knew that the success of 
      our partners was fundamental to our own success. So, it was only natural 
      that when we launched US Agriculture, we would be focused on the success 
      of the farmers we work with. Howard and his team bring with them that 
      same sharp focus on the success of their tenants and their partners.”

Title: President
               Company: Halderman Farm
Job Details
               Halderman Farm Management Service, Inc. was founded in 1930 in Wabash, Ind., by Howard H. and Marie Halderman. They started the business in their home, vowing "To do for your farm what you would do if you had the time and the experience." Business grew, as did the staff. Area representatives began handling responsibilities throughout regions in Indiana, Illinois, Michigan and Ohio. In 1958, Howard and Marie's son, Robert, joined the Halderman Farm Management team. Upon Howard's death in 1964, Robert assumed the position of president. In 1988, the addition of Robert's older son, Howard, marked the beginning of a third generation of family management and ownership. To extend the real estate services, in 1990, Robert and Howard founded Halderman Real Estate Services, Inc., a sister corporation to HFMS, having the same management and employees. In 2010 Halderman expanded into the farmland asset management business, which led to the creation of Halderman Real Asset Management, LLC (HRAM) in the spring of 2013. Today, Robert Halderman serves as chairman of the companies. Howard is the CEO of the Halderman Companies, specifically president of HFMS, HRES and HRAM. Pat Karst is the Vice President of Real Estate and David Martin is the Vice President of Asset Management. From two people, one client and a hand-full of farms to manage, the Halderman companies have steadily grown to 40 full- and part-time staff members managing 650+ farms, selling and acquiring over 150 properties and performing over 700 appraisals annually. It is now one of the largest family-owned professional farm management and real estate organizations in the United States, and that is the reason they say, "If it has anything to do with the business of farming, Halderman Can Help!"

F. Howard Halderman
B.S. Agriucltural Economics, Purdue University 1988 

F. Howard Halderman is the third-generation  head of one of the largest family-owned professional farm management and real  estate organizations in the United States. His grandparents established the  business in 1930, his father joined it in 1958, and Howard came on board in  1988. Today, he oversees 40 full- and part-time staff members who manage 625  farms in 22 states with a market value of more than $1 billion. The company  also sells and acquires 150 properties and performs 400 appraisals annually.
Halderman knows his way around a farm  and around the business. He worked on his family’s grain and livestock farm in Wabash,  Indiana, and was active in FFA and 4-H. He spent summer breaks from college  interning at the farm management company. When he returned to the business full  time after graduation, his father allowed him “to try things, to be creative,”  he says. “Not everything worked, but having that latitude at a relatively young  age really helped in terms of growing the business over time.”
Today, Halderman affects the  agricultural sector on many fronts. While his activities vary every day, at its  core the company represents landowners. Typical farm management services range  from determining optimum crop rotations and tillage practices that comply with government  regulations to marketing the commodities. The company’s work on flexible  leasing arrangements has transformed tenant-landlord relationships into  profitable risk-sharing ventures with long-term stability.
He is also involved in the real  estate side of the business and in setting strategic direction for the  company’s growth. Expanding services are natural offshoots of his grandfather’s  founding focus: “To do for your farm what you would do if you had the time and  the experience.”
Halderman and his wife Kari have  three children, and he supports many of their activities, especially coaching  sports. Like the business, his commitment to his profession and community is  something he both inherited and embraces: “It’s a belief we’ve always had as a  family — giving back.”

Pull out Quote
  “I found the College of  Agriculture to be very hands-on, with personal contact with the professors.  Because my name’s on the door of the company, one of the things we’ve always believed  in is having a very personal contact with each of our clients. That’s the  Purdue model.”

Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.

Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
