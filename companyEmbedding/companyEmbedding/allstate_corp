  ﻿Allstate History & Timeline

Making History For Over 80 Years.
Since it was founded in 1931, Allstate has been a pioneer of the insurance industry. Americans have trusted Allstate to help protect their families and their belongings for over 80 years. 


Based in Northbrook, Illinois, Allstate is the nation's largest publicly held personal lines insurer. Its leaders, employees and agency owners have been an integral part of Allstate's heritage. 


Today, Allstate is reinventing protection to help consumers better prepare for tomorrow and protect what matters most.

The Good Hands Throughout The Years. 

Allstate's history began in the fall of 1930 when Sears, Roebuck & Co. President and Board Chairman, General Robert E. Wood, got the idea to start an auto insurance company and sell insurance by mail. It was the beginning of something big.

General Robert E. Wood, the president and board Chairman of Sears, Roebuck & Co., recognized that an automobile insurance company presented a great opportunity. 


1931

With a name borrowed from an automobile tire sold in the Sears catalog, and the backing of Sears, the great adventure of Allstate Insurance Company begins on April 17, 1931.
On May 17, William Lehnertz becomes Allstate's first policyholder. He pays $41.60 for a 12-month policy on his 1930 Studebaker.
Allstate paid its first claim on the spot when a customer walked into the one-room Allstate office holding an auto door handle broken off in a theft attempt.
By year-end, Allstate had 4,217 active policies, a premium volume of $118,323 and 20 employees. The company suffered a $76,000 loss for the year.



1933

At the Chicago World's Fair, Richard Roskam became Allstate's first agent when he set up a card table in the Sears exhibit. He was swamped with applications.



1934


The first Allstate sales location opened in a Chicago Sears store, changing the sales method from direct mail to agent representation.



1937

Allstate hired its first full-time salaried claim adjuster.



1939

Allstate startled the insurance industry by tailoring auto rates by age, mileage and use of car. The plan was so popular, the industry followed suit.
Allstate had 113,472 policyholders, 529 employees and received 25,461 claims for the year.






World War II brought gasoline rationing and a halt to auto production. With many men on military leave, women began entering the workforce. 


1942


Allstate developed a series of training courses to help women replace male agents on military leave. Women also began handling claims.



1944

Allstate's post-war planning committee predicted Allstate would write $13 million in premium volume by 1949. Written premium in 1949 actually reached more than $45 million.



1947

Allstate created the "Illustrator Policy." It used simpler language and illustrations so customers could more easily understand policy language and coverage.



1949

Written premium was $45.3 million, with 708,763 policyholders and more than 2,800 employees.






Expanding and growing rapidly, Allstate moved beyond auto insurance into personal liability insurance, including life, health and commercial insurance.


1950

Davis W. Ellis, general sales manager, created the "You're In Good Hands With Allstate®" slogan, illustrated with a drawing of a pair of hands cradling a car.



1952

Allstate began work with high school drivers education, teaching thousands of teachers and millions of young drivers.



1954

Residential fire insurance was introduced.



1957

Network television advertising was launched by sponsoring "Playhouse 90." Ed Reimers, an actor, became the Allstate television spokesperson for 22 years.
On September 3, the Allstate Life Insurance Company sold policy #000001, a mortgage cancellation policy, to Dale and Norma Jean Huddlestun of West Liberty, Illinois. 



1959

Allstate established a catastrophe plan that brought large numbers of claim specialists into a catastrophe area immediately following a disaster.
Allstate became the first major insurance company to offer premium discounts specifically to owners of increasingly popular small cars.
Property-liability written premium was $438.6 million with 5.3 million policyholders and 14,633 employees.






Allstate advocated making seat belt use mandatory and its headquarters moved to Northbrook, Illinois.


1960

Allstate Enterprises, Inc., was established, offering auto, boat and RV financing, savings and loans, mortgage banking and mutual fund management.
Allstate's Good Driver Discount Plan was introduced in many states, offering good drivers the lowest rate for their particular driver classification.



1961

Allstate Motor Club was created—the first truly national service of its kind in the United States.



1964

After 11 years of successful operations in Canada, Allstate formed Allstate Insurance Company of Canada and Allstate Life Insurance Company of Canada.



1966

Allstate formed the Allstate Research and Planning Center in Menlo Park, Calif., to help research markets and customer expectations.



1967


Allstate moved its home office from Skokie, Illinois, to a new six-building complex on a 122-acre tract in suburban Northbrook, Illinois.



1968

Allstate began working with the government and automakers on auto passenger safety, including seat belts and airbags.
Allstate offered a Business Umbrella package, providing total insurance protection for commercial businesses.



1969

Allstate looked at doing business internationally and took a strong stance on consumer safety.


1970

Allstate began an awareness program encouraging automakers to produce "tougher cars," including sturdier bumpers of uniform height. The company continued its efforts to promote auto passenger safety via seat belts, air bags and anti-drunk-driving campaigns.



1974

Allstate offered greater flexibility by serving customers considered high risk through the formation of the Allstate Indemnity Company.



1975

Allstate entered the Japanese life insurance market through a joint venture with Sears and Seibu Retail.



1976


The "Helping Hands" Program was created and mobilized more than 75 percent of Allstate employees to volunteer their time and talents for community causes.
Tech-Cor, Inc. commenced operations for technical research and auto/home repair training. It also handled a great deal of salvage and auto reclamation for Allstate.



1978

1990

The Neighborhood Exclusive Agent contract became available to agents, giving them the opportunity to be independent contractors, managing their own business for Allstate.
Working Mother magazine honored Allstate as a top company for working moms in its annual list of the "100 Best Companies for Working Mothers."

But there are some standard coverages included in most homeowners policies, such as protection for your dwelling and personal property for certain natural disasters and personal liabilities. It's important to know exactly what is and isn't covered by your policy and to understand your coverage limits. If you'd like to talk through your current policy or get coverage tailored to life in CA, I'd be happy to help.Learn More Car Insurance for College StudentsWhen you think about college, you may think about choosing a school, how to decorate a dorm or apartment and what classes to take. Car insurance may not be on your radar, but it's something you should review if you're heading off to school. You may be eligible for discounts, especially if you're not bringing a car to campus or if you maintain good grades. Be smart and call me before you start your school year!Learn More Comparing Renters Insurance QuotesWhen comparing renters insurance quotes from different insurers, it's important to take more than price into consideration. Understanding what the policy covers and making sure it fits your needs may help give you the peace of mind that comes from knowing you have certain protections in place while you're living in a rented home or apartment.Learn More What Is An Annuity?Thanks to healthier living and great medical care, more people are living longer. Hopefully that means a longer retirement. But that prolonged retirement means you'll need to make your money last longer. One way of doing that is by investing in an annuity, which may provide you with regular income during your golden years. From tax deferred income to a lifetime income, annuities can offer some great benefits and may provide financial security during your retirement.Learn More Small Business Insurance NeedsYou know the ins and outs of your small business and what it takes to keep things running. But do you know how to help protect the business you've worked so hard to build? From merchandise to machinery to a home-based operation, there are a lot of coverage options available to choose from. This quick rundown of things you'll want to consider when insuring your small business is a great place to start. I know the effort a small business takes, and I'm here to help you protect your life's work.Learn More Cheap Motorcycle Coverage - Worth It?You love the freedom that comes with your motorcycle and the open road, and paying a lot for insurance feels like taking away a bit of that joy. But the truth is that paying less now could mean paying more out of pocket for repairs and medical bills down the road. It's important to have the right coverage, and a cheap motorcycle insurance may not offer you the best protection. Consider these tips and ways to save as your shopping for motorcycle coverage.Learn More Condo InsuranceYou found the perfect condominium, called about the utilities and have movers lined up. But before you move in, do you have the right coverage for your new home? Condos are unique in the way they are insured - both you and the condo association need policies. From common areas to personal property, it's important that you understand what your policy covers and what your condo association's insurance may help protect. Take a look at this overview of condominium insurance, and then let's make sure you have the coverage you need.Learn More Show moreShow lessInsurance Products & ServicesInsurance is unlike any other product out there - you pay for it and hope you never have to use it. And that makes paying more than you need to that much more uncomfortable.With a policy from Allstate, you can help keep your insurance costs low with the wide variety of discounts we offer. Keep in mind, not all discounts are available in every state. The best way to get all that you qualify for is to get an insurance quote specific to Los Altos.You can get a rough "ballpark" insurance quote from many companies online, but talking with an agent allows you to ask questions and get a quote for coverage that matters most to you. As an Allstate agent, I can prepare a quote that details the coverage, deductibles (your portion of a loss) and cost (premium) of your insurance policy.Insurance products and services offered at my Allstate agency include:Auto InsuranceCar InsuranceFlood InsuranceInsuranceLife InsuranceMotorcycle InsuranceHome InsuranceInsurance QuoteInsurance AgencyBusiness InsuranceAnnuitiesRetirementCollege Savings PlanContactPhone(650) 947-1600(650) 947-1600Fax(650) 947-1602(650) 947-1602Email:norvvogel@allstate.comnorvvogel@allstate.comAddress:199 1st St, Ste 328Los Altos, CA 94022Get DirectionsAreas Served:Proud to serve the areas of Los Altos, Los Altos Hills, Sunnyvale, Mountain View, Ladera, Loyola, Palo Alto, Cupertino, Stanford.

The agency reviewed my insurance and saved me money. Their staff are friendly and always return my calls and emails quickly. I really like working with this agency!







Horrible incompetent fools!!! Twice now they have called me in a case of mistaken identity. First time was 4 years or so ago and second time was this week! They called me both times telling me I have a life insurance policy that needs updating and I insist that it NOT ME! Each time they put me through a bunch of crap and in the end after divulging someone else's personal information to me after my insisting that it's NOT my policy! Don't trust them with your personal information, obviously they are open to giving it out to the wrong people. 

I never had any life insurance policy with them. I had a auto and renters insurance policy with them and that was about 4 YEARS AGO! I canceled my policy with them because they managed to repeatedly screw up my policy by letting other people on my policy who were not the main policy holder go in and make unauthorized changes. Norvin and his staff were almost impossible to get a hold of. They raised my rates and would not fight for me after a accident that was not my fault. I asked them how I could get my rates down lower and they had me make changes that made my policy higher when they told me to take the other driver off my policy. The other driver was providing me a "good driver discount" which I lost after removing her upon their advice. 

I miss the days when Norvin Vogel's Allstate brokerage was owned by Gary Hellman. Gary and his wife knew what they were doing!







Wouldn't recommend. I have found Vogel and associates to be disconnected, lacking attention to detail and patronizing. 

Like most people I don't give my insurance a second thought and have wanted to change but it was never a high priority until now. I won't go into details except to say that because of how they handled a paperwork issue I was motivated to change agents and have started to shop around for other quotes.







I am rating Norv extremely poor because he is extremely non-responsive. By the way, I have never filed a claim so am an ideal customer. 

A copy of my policy is required to go to an Additional Interested Party. My policy says that a certificate of insurance has been sent to said party, but none seem to be received. 

I recently received an email from Norv requesting that I rate him "10" on an upcoming survey, and to contact them if I am not completely satisfied so they can address any concerns. I immediately replied to the email that the interested party says they have not received a certificate of insurance and to send me a copy if you did send it. No response. A few days later I received an email from Norv soliciting term life insurance. I immediately replied that he hadn't replied to my email. No response. Then I called Norv. Not in. Two weeks after my initial email, I received a call from his son saying Norv was out of town and has asked him to assist me. 

Based upon the above events, I have little faith that I would receive decent service in the event of a claim.







Specifically came to this Allstate office owned by Norvin Vogel since their website said they'd be open on Sat morning. If your website says you are open, you better be open during those promised times.  Showed up there and was completely eerie - lights in the hallway off and of course, no one in the office.

Bottom line: Lame. Update your freakin website. What's up with these Allstate agents who lie that they are open on Saturdays. 0 for 2.







Recently divorced, these folks have been fooling around promising me they would change the beneficiary on my Universal Life and nothing ever happens! The paperwork is done and despite numerous calls nothing gets done and I get no returned call! It has been an absolute nagging sore for 6 months....aaaagh!!!

I worked with Elliott from this office and found him to be very professional and smooth in the transaction. I'd like to recommend this office for any insurance related transactions.

But there are some standard coverages included in most homeowners policies, such as protection for your dwelling and personal property for certain natural disasters and personal liabilities. It's important to know exactly what is and isn't covered by your policy and to understand your coverage limits. If you'd like to talk through your current policy or get coverage tailored to life in CA, I'd be happy to help.Learn More Car Insurance for College StudentsWhen you think about college, you may think about choosing a school, how to decorate a dorm or apartment and what classes to take. Car insurance may not be on your radar, but it's something you should review if you're heading off to school. You may be eligible for discounts, especially if you're not bringing a car to campus or if you maintain good grades. Be smart and call me before you start your school year!Learn More Comparing Renters Insurance QuotesWhen comparing renters insurance quotes from different insurers, it's important to take more than price into consideration.

From tax deferred income to a lifetime income, annuities can offer some great benefits and may provide financial security during your retirement.Learn More Small Business Insurance NeedsYou know the ins and outs of your small business and what it takes to keep things running.

It's important to have the right coverage, and a cheap motorcycle insurance may not offer you the best protection. Consider these tips and ways to save as your shopping for motorcycle coverage.Learn More Condo InsuranceYou found the perfect condominium, called about the utilities and have movers lined up.

But there are some standard coverages included in most homeowners policies, such as protection for your dwelling and personal property for certain natural disasters and personal liabilities.

No one wants to think about leaving their loved ones behind.

        (408) 737-0711
    






I would like to thank this agency for pointing me in the right direction after a disastrous experience with another agency.  Specifically Alicia Hamilton, who searched and found me an agent who could help me continue my coverage even though her agency couldn't help me.  It's rare to find a company that will help you when there is nothing in it for them.  She truly understood my needs and went out of her way to help me.   I would recommend this agency to anyone looking for insurance.







High rates, unresponsive.  Heidi is horrible, she is nice to you when she's selling you a policy, as I wanted to get umbrella policy coverage.  She's terrible, not at all helpful, and insulting when you are asking a lot of questions to understand impact of an accident on your auto policy.  Raymond is no different, when I asked to be assigned to a different member of his staff to get a quote, did not not get a response.  I decided to move to a different agent.  In terms of rate, my auto policy went down and even got some refund on my condo after my policy was moved to the different agent.  there's a lot of allstate agents in the area, highly recommend to go work with those agency and avoid raymond and his team







Finally had enough of the high rates, arbitrary changes and minimal contact hours.

I found them to be minimally responsive and not friendly when making changes to the policy like adding or removing a car. 

But then when they made the change, they also made very arbitrary changes to the quote.  For instance, we dropped a car, which was the highest car on the policy, and found the price was still about the same.  They just made arbitrary changes to the other cars to make up for the dropped car.  Dropping the expensive sports car entirely didn't lower our bill.

Even in between bills arbitrary changes are made, but mysteriously it always ends up at about the same amount.  We had two bills a few months apart because we added two new cars.  In between the two bills, the amount for one car went down (with no explanation) by $300 and the amount for the other car went up (with no explanation) but $300.

I got fed up and decided to call AAA where we are already a member.  AAA gave an excellent price.  Allstate's price is 50% higher for less coverage.

But the thing that annoys me the most is the arbitrary changes so that they always get the same amount no matter what.

Oh, and another thing, the new AAA agent answered the call at 5:25 PM (answering machine at Barri at 5:05 PM) and then told me to call him as late as 11 PM.

Bye bye Allstate.  Hello AAA.







I have been with allstate for a long time. I generally call them for payment purpose and have been a good customer to them. But when I called them to inform them about removing a car from policy, they informed that they will prorate the amount and return me the rest of the policy money for the car. They promised they will follow up with an email which never happened. Its always that case with this agency. Finally I called again and I was informed that they will pay me some amount of money because my insurance increased to the other vehicles in that policy. I had to finally call them to cancel my policy. I went to get a quote from another insurance and its way to less than allstate.

Finally I wanted to talk to the management and I did not get any call from them.. Thats it - Good bye Allstate for the Mayhem you had created.







WORST EVER!!! 
Raise the rates and deny it (even though you have the bill!), tried to charge me $260.00 for two months when I didn't have a car!! I was late paying (my brother died suddenly & I still refused to pay that $260.) & they sent me to collections -- without that illegal $260!!! 
Terrible service, never call back, "lose" emails, "forget" to call -- blame you every time. 
Went to another agency got better coverage and WAY better rates.  

Do yourself a favor and go to a more professional and cheaper company. 

These people be nice as can be for your first check...and worst as can be after that!!







Wanted to recommend the Allstate Barri agency in Sunnyvale.  They are incredibly responsive (thank you Alicia for going in to office on a rainy Saturday to create a new PDF of policy for new car addition!).  Documentation is timely and helpful and they are always good about reviewing your policy and discussing options. Have had AAA, State Farm and others in the past & this Allstate team is really good.







Still with this terrible insurance agency. They don't pick up their phone, don't quote you the right numbers, and in my opinion generally provide some of the worst service I have ever seen inside or outside the insurance industry. I mean, how hard is it to quote correct car insurance costs on a Mazda?

I would like to thank this agency for pointing me in the right direction after a disastrous experience with another agency.  Specifically Alicia Hamilton, who searched and found me an agent who could help me continue my coverage even though her agency couldn't help me.  It's rare to find a company that will help you when there is nothing in it for them.  She truly understood my needs and went out of her way to help me.   I would recommend this agency to anyone looking for insurance.

High rates, unresponsive.  Heidi is horrible, she is nice to you when she's selling you a policy, as I wanted to get umbrella policy coverage.  She's terrible, not at all helpful, and insulting when you are asking a lot of questions to understand impact of an accident on your auto policy.  Raymond is no different, when I asked to be assigned to a different member of his staff to get a quote, did not not get a response.  I decided to move to a different agent.  In terms of rate, my auto policy went down and even got some refund on my condo after my policy was moved to the different agent.  there's a lot of allstate agents in the area, highly recommend to go work with those agency and avoid raymond and his team

Finally had enough of the high rates, arbitrary changes and minimal contact hours.I found them to be minimally responsive and not friendly when making changes to the policy like adding or removing a car. But then when they made the change, they also made very arbitrary changes to the quote.  For instance, we dropped a car, which was the highest car on the policy, and found the price was still about the same.  They just made arbitrary changes to the other cars to make up for the dropped car.  Dropping the expensive sports car entirely didn't lower our bill.Even in between bills arbitrary changes are made, but mysteriously it always ends up at about the same amount.  We had two bills a few months apart because we added two new cars.  In between the two bills, the amount for one car went down (with no explanation) by $300 and the amount for the other car went up (with no explanation) but $300.I got fed up and decided to call AAA where we are already a member.  AAA gave an excellent price.  Allstate's price is 50% higher for less coverage.But the thing that annoys me the most is the arbitrary changes so that they always get the same amount no matter what.Oh, and another thing, the new AAA agent answered the call at 5:25 PM (answering machine at Barri at 5:05 PM) and then told me to call him as late as 11 PM.Bye bye Allstate.  Hello AAA.

I have been with allstate for a long time. I generally call them for payment purpose and have been a good customer to them. But when I called them to inform them about removing a car from policy, they informed that they will prorate the amount and return me the rest of the policy money for the car. They promised they will follow up with an email which never happened. Its always that case with this agency. Finally I called again and I was informed that they will pay me some amount of money because my insurance increased to the other vehicles in that policy. I had to finally call them to cancel my policy. I went to get a quote from another insurance and its way to less than allstate.Finally I wanted to talk to the management and I did not get any call from them.. Thats it - Good bye Allstate for the Mayhem you had created.

WORST EVER!!! Raise the rates and deny it (even though you have the bill!), tried to charge me $260.00 for two months when I didn't have a car!! I was late paying (my brother died suddenly & I still refused to pay that $260.) & they sent me to collections -- without that illegal $260!!! Terrible service, never call back, "lose" emails, "forget" to call -- blame you every time. Went to another agency got better coverage and WAY better rates.  Do yourself a favor and go to a more professional and cheaper company. These people be nice as can be for your first check...and worst as can be after that!!

Wanted to recommend the Allstate Barri agency in Sunnyvale.  They are incredibly responsive (thank you Alicia for going in to office on a rainy Saturday to create a new PDF of policy for new car addition!).  Documentation is timely and helpful and they are always good about reviewing your policy and discussing options. Have had AAA, State Farm and others in the past & this Allstate team is really good.

Still with this terrible insurance agency. They don't pick up their phone, don't quote you the right numbers, and in my opinion generally provide some of the worst service I have ever seen inside or outside the insurance industry. I mean, how hard is it to quote correct car insurance costs on a Mazda?

I had a question about an excessive bill. I called and requested some information but nobody ever called me back. Nobody seemed to know how to insure my new car. They didn't have their act together. They had to revise the policy several times. Not the brightest bulbs in the world.

But there are some standard coverages included in most homeowners policies, such as protection for your dwelling and personal property for certain natural disasters and personal liabilities. It's important to know exactly what is and isn't covered by your policy and to understand your coverage limits. If you'd like to talk through your current policy or get coverage tailored to life in CA, I'd be happy to help.Learn More What Does Auto Liability Insurance Cover?You know you need liability car insurance, but what is it exactly? Liability insurance may help cover damages to another person resulting from an accident you cause, such as damage to their property or costs associated with their resulting injuries if you are found at fault. While liability is a basic type of auto insurance coverage, you'll still have some decisions to make, including setting property damage and bodily injury coverage limits. I'm here to help you choose the coverage that fits your needs while also meeting CA's minimum requirements.Learn More Vacation Home CoverageWhether you're looking for that perfect spot on the beach, want a kitchen to use or need somewhere with room for extended family, sometimes a vacation rental is the best fit for your getaway. And while you probably thought about the cost, you may not have thought about the insurance implications of staying in a rental. Are you covered if your suitcases are stolen during your stay? What happens if the home is damaged while you're there? Before you start packing, make sure you'll be covered while you're away.Learn More What Is A Beneficiary?I know that choosing to buy life insurance can be an emotional decision. No one wants to think about leaving their loved ones behind. And selecting beneficiaries, who will receive the benefits from the policy, can be a very hard choice - especially if you have multiple people or groups you'd like to provide for. Your life insurance beneficiary may be your spouse, your children of even your alma mater.

Remember to always keep current proof of insurance in the car, and follow these tips about your personal safety, documenting the accident and beginning the claims process.Learn More What Is Renters Insurance?Renting a home can be great, particularly if you don't have to worry about regular maintenance and upkeep. But you, and your stuff, are still at risk — from things such as a fire, theft or a guest getting injured. Having renters insurance in place can help protect you and your belongings.

But relying on the landlord's insurance to cover your business if a fire or break-in should occur is not a savvy decision. The landlord's policy typically covers the building but not your company's equipment or the business if there is an accident in the office. Whether it's making sure your computers would be replaced or recouping potential losses after a disaster, let's talk about insuring your business before you sign that lease.Learn More Safety Vs. StyleThe choice between stylish riding gear and truly protective gear should be easy - whatever makes it more likely you'll walk away from an accident safely. Thankfully there is a lot of gear that is both safe and stylish these days.

I have enjoyed working with Cathy over the years.  She is friendly and knowledgeable.  After a minor accident she took the time to explain the process of getting the car fixed and back on the road. Very motivated and easy to work with.  An outstanding agent.







I've been with Cathy for a little over a year and I am so happy I've had the opportunity to do business with her.  When I purchased my first car, she was very helpful through the entire process and was able to explain to me all my paper work, since insurance is a foreign language to me.

What I love about Cathy is her exuberant personality.  I love dropping off my monthly check for my insurance payment to sit down with her and chit chat.  She truly cares about her clients and she remembers each and every person- you are not treated like you are a number or commission.  She is very professional.  Her assistant is also very personable and the two compliment one another to have a success business.  

As for the other post that was so negative, I wanted to inform you, her sign informs you that she is available by appointment only on Saturdays.







Specifically came to this Allstate office owned by Cathy Nguyen since their website said they'd be open on Sat morning. If your website says you are open and so does the info on your office window, you better be open during those promised times.  Showed up there - ghost town.

Bottom line: Lame. Update your freakin website.







I have been with Cathy since I was 16 and could drive. The staff in the office is very friendly and will explain and guide you through all paperwork. They make the policy very understandable. I had an car accident and Cathy guided me through the whole process which made it stress free. As for price, ask for student discount if you have over a 3.0 gpa.







Cathy Nguyen is an awesome agent, very friendly, helpful, and on top of everything. Whenever I had a question or request, she responded within the hour.  Thanks Cathy for your great service!







My family has used Kathy's service for over 23 years. We started with car insurance when we just moved here. We then added our home insurance and now all the cars for our children who weren't even born when we signed up with her. I have used other ibsurance agents and will go on record to say Kathy is the best. I saw a lot of letters from other companies promising better deals if we move. But I have never tempted because Kathy is so awesome. Some example:  She told us when renting cars, we do not need to get collision insurance because our umbrella will cover that. That saves us lots of money over the last 25+ years.  She told us about free towing Servixes we get with All State and sent us the cards for that. Once my son car was towed while in college and he couldn't get it out of the towing company because his name was not on the registration; only his dad name was on there and dad was out of the country.  We could wait for his dad to get back but that meant paying $80/day extra. In desperation, I called Cathy and she showed me how to addmy son's name to the registration.

I have enjoyed working with Cathy over the years.  She is friendly and knowledgeable.  After a minor accident she took the time to explain the process of getting the car fixed and back on the road. Very motivated and easy to work with.  An outstanding agent.

I've been with Cathy for a little over a year and I am so happy I've had the opportunity to do business with her.  When I purchased my first car, she was very helpful through the entire process and was able to explain to me all my paper work, since insurance is a foreign language to me.What I love about Cathy is her exuberant personality.  I love dropping off my monthly check for my insurance payment to sit down with her and chit chat.  She truly cares about her clients and she remembers each and every person- you are not treated like you are a number or commission.  She is very professional.  Her assistant is also very personable and the two compliment one another to have a success business.  As for the other post that was so negative, I wanted to inform you, her sign informs you that she is available by appointment only on Saturdays.

Specifically came to this Allstate office owned by Cathy Nguyen since their website said they'd be open on Sat morning. If your website says you are open and so does the info on your office window, you better be open during those promised times.  Showed up there - ghost town.Bottom line: Lame. Update your freakin website.

I have been with Cathy since I was 16 and could drive. The staff in the office is very friendly and will explain and guide you through all paperwork. They make the policy very understandable. I had an car accident and Cathy guided me through the whole process which made it stress free. As for price, ask for student discount if you have over a 3.0 gpa.

My family has used Kathy's service for over 23 years. We started with car insurance when we just moved here. We then added our home insurance and now all the cars for our children who weren't even born when we signed up with her. I have used other ibsurance agents and will go on record to say Kathy is the best. I saw a lot of letters from other companies promising better deals if we move. But I have never tempted because Kathy is so awesome. Some example:  She told us when renting cars, we do not need to get collision insurance because our umbrella will cover that. That saves us lots of money over the last 25+ years.  She told us about free towing Servixes we get with All State and sent us the cards for that. Once my son car was towed while in college and he couldn't get it out of the towing company because his name was not on the registration; only his dad name was on there and dad was out of the country.  We could wait for his dad to get back but that meant paying $80/day extra. In desperation, I called Cathy and she showed me how to addmy son's name to the registration. We were able to fix that without incurring additional cost. She and her staffs are awesome. They are ALWAYS there to pick up the phone during business hours. They are always pleasant, professional and have answers to all my questions. They are the best. You should use Cathy's agency if you need any insurance services. She is the best.

But there are some standard coverages included in most homeowners policies, such as protection for your dwelling and personal property for certain natural disasters and personal liabilities. It's important to know exactly what is and isn't covered by your policy and to understand your coverage limits. If you'd like to talk through your current policy or get coverage tailored to life in CA, I'd be happy to help.Learn More After A Car AccidentMost people don't want to think about getting into an accident, but it's a reality many of us will have to deal with at some point. I know that a car accident can be frightening, but you can help reduce some of the stress by knowing what to do ahead of time. Remember to always keep current proof of insurance in the car, and follow these tips about your personal safety, documenting the accident and beginning the claims process.Learn More What Is Renters Insurance?Renting a home can be great, particularly if you don't have to worry about regular maintenance and upkeep. But you, and your stuff, are still at risk — from things such as a fire, theft or a guest getting injured. Having renters insurance in place can help protect you and your belongings. Whether it's helping you replace stolen items, paying for damage that you caused to a neighbor's window or paying for a hotel if you can't live in your home because of a covered loss, renters insurance may help when the unexpected happens.Learn More What Is A Beneficiary?I know that choosing to buy life insurance can be an emotional decision. No one wants to think about leaving their loved ones behind. And selecting beneficiaries, who will receive the benefits from the policy, can be a very hard choice - especially if you have multiple people or groups you'd like to provide for. Your life insurance beneficiary may be your spouse, your children of even your alma mater. Start here for some helpful information on selecting or changing your beneficiary.Learn More Is Your Office Rental Covered?Renting an office for your business makes sense - you have the space you need without the costs or maintenance of owning the building. But relying on the landlord's insurance to cover your business if a fire or break-in should occur is not a savvy decision. The landlord's policy typically covers the building but not your company's equipment or the business if there is an accident in the office.

History[edit]
In 1925, Sears held a national contest to decide the name of a new brand of car tires. After over two million name submissions, "Allstate" was chosen as the winner; the trademark was adopted the very next year. The tires' success in both the catalog and retail stores prompted Sears Chairman General Robert E. Wood to praise the Allstate tire's contribution to Sears' retail store success.[1]
The idea for Allstate Insurance Company came during a bridge game on a commuter train in 1930, when insurance broker Carl L. Odell proposed to Wood, his neighbor, the idea of selling auto insurance by direct mail. The idea appealed to Wood, and he passed the proposal to the Sears board of directors, which approved it. Allstate Insurance Company, named after Sears’ tire brand, went into business on April 17, 1931, offering auto insurance by direct mail and through the Sears catalog.[7] This was in line with one of the objectives of a company to sell automobile insurance in the same manner as Sears sold its merchandise.[8]
Lessing J. Rosenwald was Allstate's first board chairman, and Odell was named vice president and secretary.[9]
In 1933, at the Century of Progress World’s Fair in Chicago, Allstate’s Richard E. Roskam sold insurance at a booth in the Sears pavilion. In 1934, Allstate opened its first permanent sales office in a Chicago Sears store.[10]
In 1941, only about a quarter of U.S. drivers had auto liability insurance. This led to the state of New York passing a law which established the financial responsibility of drivers for damage or injuries resulting from auto mishaps. That law inspired legislation in other states, and by the mid-1950s nearly every state had some sort of financial responsibility law on its books.[7]
In 1949 the Allstate Headquarters Building was completed at 3245 W. Arthington Street in Chicago.[11] The mid-rise building is currently vacant (as of 2013) and in danger of demolition. The building is noted for its early post-war mid-rise construction. This location was vacated at some point when the company relocated in the post-war years.
The company’s "You're in Good Hands with Allstate" slogan was created in 1950 by Allstate’s general sales manager Davis W. Ellis. At the end of the decade, it was used in the company's first network television advertising campaign, which featured actor Ed Reimers.[9]
Allstate added products throughout the 1950s, including fire insurance in 1954 and homeowners and life insurance in 1957. Allstate began selling insurance to Canadians in 1953. Allstate Insurance Company of Canada was incorporated in 1964.[7] (In 1952 and 1953, Sears also sold an automobile called Allstate.)
In 1967, the company's home office was moved from Skokie to Northbrook, Illinois. Allstate continued to sell additional types of insurance to customers throughout the decade, including worker's compensation insurance in 1964, surety bonds in 1966, inland-marine coverage in 1967 and a business package policy in 1969.[9]
The brand itself expanded in the 1950s and 1960s and could be found on a variety of products like fire extinguishers and motor scooters. In 1952, an Allstate car was produced, but it was a flop; it was pulled from stores by 1953. The Allstate brand was eventually limited to insurance, tires, and car batteries by the late 1960s before becoming insurance-only in the mid-1970s.[1] In 1991, the company went public[4] before becoming completely independent in 1995.[1]
In 1984, Neighborhood Office Agent program was introduced to make agents more accessible to customers
In 1985, Allstate began to move agents out of Sears stores and locate agents in neighborhood offices. In June 1993, 19.8 percent of Allstate became public through a stock offering. Allstate became completely independent in June 1995, when Sears spun off the remaining 80 percent stake in the company, distributing 350.5 million shares of Allstate stock to its stockholders.[7]
In 1993, Allstate went public when Sears sells 19.8% of the company. At the time, it was the largest IPO to date.
In 1996, their website www.allstate.com was launched.
In 1999, Allstate unveiled a new business model that created a single contract for exclusive, independent agents selling Allstate insurance. It also created a network of call centers.
In 1999, Allstate purchased the personal lines division of CNA Financial[12] and subsequently renamed it to Encompass Insurance Company which is written by independent insurance agents, as opposed to the direct writing that constitutes the core part of its business.[13]
In 2003, actor Dennis Haysbert became Allstate’s spokesman, using the tagline "That’s Allstate’s stand."[14]
In 2010 the actor Dean Winters became a part of Allstate’s campaign "Mayhem" “personifying the pitfalls, like collisions and storm damage, that can befall drivers”.
In 2012 Allstate Solutions Private Limited (also called Allstate India) was inaugurated in Bangalore which is a technology and operations centre to provides software development and business process outsourcing services to its US parent. [15] Allstate's Bangalore operation is focused on the areas of business intelligence, analytics, testing and mobility.

Advertising[edit]
"Good hands"[edit]
Allstate's slogan "You're in good hands" was created in the 1950s by Allstate Insurance Company's sales executive, Davis W. Ellis based on a similar phrase he used to reassure his wife about a doctor caring for their child. It has been the slogan ever since 1950. Allstate also referred to themselves as the Good Hands People.
In the 1960s and 1970s, TV, print and radio advertising featured Allstate’s spokesman, Ed Reimers. Reimers was often shown making the cupped-hand gesture. For 22 years, he remained the spokesman.[17]
A study in 2000 by Northwestern University's Medill Graduate Department of Integrated Marketing Communications found that the Allstate slogan "You're in good hands" ranked as the most recognizable in America.[18]
"Allstate’s stand"[edit]
Beginning in 2003, as policy growth slowed, Allstate’s television commercials used spokesman Dennis Haysbert. The ads were intended to carry the message that Allstate's service was superior to that from low-cost providers Geico and Progressive.[19] Haysbert appeared in more than 250 commercials between 2003 and 2016.
Mayhem[edit]
Beginning in 2010, Allstate used Dean Winters as "Mayhem", mean to personify the hazards drivers face. The ads conclude with Haysbert asking "Are You In Good Hands?"[20]
Social media[edit]
In January 2011, Allstate released The Lines,[21] a multi-episode TV drama web series starring actors Teresa Cesario, Kyle Sandgate-Blix, Jackson Schultz, Bridgette Pechman, Chase Maser, and Corey Doyle cast as High-School seniors. The series, filmed in the style of a television drama, depicts the cast in common situations facing teens with respect to driving (Texting while driving in particular). The series appears aimed at promoting interest and support in favor of responsible teen driving and road-safety in general. The Lines spans a total of 8 episodes, each 6–8 minutes in length. Allstate and other large corporations are attracted to the rapid growth of social media for use in their advertising campaigns.

Allstate has a Sustainability Leadership Team composed of officers and senior staff from all areas of the company. The team focuses on sustainability efforts from a company-wide perspective — including environmental initiatives that embed “green” programs and processes throughout their operations.[29]
Criticism[edit]
In July 2008, the American Association for Justice ranked Allstate No. 1 among nation's worst insurers. This ranking was given because: “While Allstate publicly touts its ‘good hands’ approach, it has instead privately instructed its agents to employ a ‘boxing gloves’ strategy against its policyholders,” said American Association for Justice CEO Jon Haber. They've since revamped their approach.[30] Allstate criticized the report, with a spokesman noting that "The personal injury lawyers behind this report provide no support for their statements other than decade old recycled allegations that have been shown to be without merit in courts of law." [31] In 2009 Allstate successfully fought to obtain Federal government TARP fund eligibility only to decline it once they obtained eligibility.[32]
Auto insurance claims[edit]
An investigative report in February 2007 by CNN found that major car insurance companies, like Allstate, are increasingly fighting auto insurance claims from those who incurred injuries by their insured members.[33] Allstate currently commands 18% of the auto insurance market in the United States.[34]
Homeowners claims[edit]
The PBS television program Now,[35] in conjunction with Bloomberg Markets magazine, did an exposé regarding Allstate and other major insurers' homeowners insurance policies.
Catastrophe exposure management[edit]
Allstate has stated intentions of reducing its exposure in hurricane-prone Florida. In November 2006, Allstate did not renew 120,000 policies that were expiring at that time. Governor Charlie Crist and the Florida Cabinet passed a 90-day emergency order to temporarily prevent insurance companies from nonrenewing policies.[36] On February 20, 2007, Florida Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty clarified the order, stating that insurance companies can nonrenew policies if they satisfy certain conditions, including filing new, lower rates with the state and give customers 100 days’ notice.[37]
From Good Hands to Boxing Gloves[edit]
This is the title of a book written by David Berardinelli, JD;, Michael Freeman, PhD, DC, MPH; and Aaron DeShaw, DC, JD with a foreword by Eugene R. Anderson.[38]
The book relates profit-boosting strategies that consulting firm McKinsey & Company presented to Allstate to maximize profits and diminish the amount of money sent to clients who put in a claim. McKinsey specializes in redesigning product delivery systems for Fortune 100 companies (including controversial clients such as Enron) to maximize profits. McKinsey’s recommendation to Allstate, according to Berardinelli, was to low-ball claims so that desperate customers in dire straits would be more likely to accept a settlement offer while Allstate continued to make a profit and collect interest on the insurance payment. Allstate would offer its "good hands" in the way of a low-ball claim and, if the customer did not accept, to get out "boxing gloves." [39]
The book was reviewed by Business Week magazine.[40] According to that article, Allstate responded to Berardinelli's allegations by claiming that Berardinelli's allegations were "unfounded and unproven." Rather than trying to cheat customers, the company stated that its major goal was to benefit policyholders by identifying "exaggerated and fraudulent claims" and that its "processes are absolutely sound . . . to investigate, evaluate, and promptly resolve each claim fairly, based on the merits."[40]
Court decisions on the issues debated by Berardinelli and Allstate have gone both ways. According to the Business Week article, as of 2006, "Courts and regulators in a number of states, including New York, Pennsylvania, and Washington, have forced Allstate to halt or change its practice of handing out a controversial 'Do I Need an Attorney?' form to people involved in accidents." On the other hand, the article also states that "Although plaintiffs have had piecemeal success in bad-faith cases against Allstate, the insurer points to seven court rulings that have rejected attacks on CCPR. Last December a Montana state court noted that while CCPR practices may be illegal 'if misapplied in a particular case, they nevertheless are neutral with no manifestly illegal purpose.'" While many of the cost-reduction strategies McKinsey recommended at Allstate remain in place, some have been reined in following legal and regulatory challenges in several states.[40]
Use of Colossus[edit]
Many criticisms leveled against Allstate (and other insurers), including Barardinelli's book, involved the use of a software program called "Colossus" to process claims. In 2010, Allstate paid a $10 million fine to settle a lawsuit brought by 41 states concerning inconsistencies in the manner in which Colossus was used. It also agreed to standardize its use of the software. However, “it is important to note that we found no systemic underpayment of bodily injury claims,” New York Insurance Superintendent James J. Wrynn said in a press release.[41]

The claims handled in the matter were very minor collision type losses that did not result in any ($0) damage to the car, and therefore was the insurance company protecting it assets and the premium paying public money, by keeping rates as low as possible."Auto insurers play hardball in minor-crash claims".

History[edit]
In 1925, Sears held a national contest to decide the name of a new brand of car tires. After over two million name submissions, "Allstate" was chosen as the winner; the trademark was adopted the very next year. The tires' success in both the catalog and retail stores prompted Sears Chairman General Robert E. Wood to praise the Allstate tire's contribution to Sears' retail store success.[1]
The idea for Allstate Insurance Company came during a bridge game on a commuter train in 1930, when insurance broker Carl L. Odell proposed to Wood, his neighbor, the idea of selling auto insurance by direct mail. The idea appealed to Wood, and he passed the proposal to the Sears board of directors, which approved it. Allstate Insurance Company, named after Sears’ tire brand, went into business on April 17, 1931, offering auto insurance by direct mail and through the Sears catalog.[7] This was in line with one of the objectives of a company to sell automobile insurance in the same manner as Sears sold its merchandise.[8]
Lessing J. Rosenwald was Allstate's first board chairman, and Odell was named vice president and secretary.[9]
In 1933, at the Century of Progress World’s Fair in Chicago, Allstate’s Richard E. Roskam sold insurance at a booth in the Sears pavilion. In 1934, Allstate opened its first permanent sales office in a Chicago Sears store.[10]
In 1941, only about a quarter of U.S. drivers had auto liability insurance. This led to the state of New York passing a law which established the financial responsibility of drivers for damage or injuries resulting from auto mishaps. That law inspired legislation in other states, and by the mid-1950s nearly every state had some sort of financial responsibility law on its books.[7]
In 1949 the Allstate Headquarters Building was completed at 3245 W. Arthington Street in Chicago.[11] The mid-rise building is currently vacant (as of 2013) and in danger of demolition. The building is noted for its early post-war mid-rise construction. This location was vacated at some point when the company relocated in the post-war years.
The company’s "You're in Good Hands with Allstate" slogan was created in 1950 by Allstate’s general sales manager Davis W. Ellis. At the end of the decade, it was used in the company's first network television advertising campaign, which featured actor Ed Reimers.[9]
Allstate added products throughout the 1950s, including fire insurance in 1954 and homeowners and life insurance in 1957. Allstate began selling insurance to Canadians in 1953. Allstate Insurance Company of Canada was incorporated in 1964.[7] (In 1952 and 1953, Sears also sold an automobile called Allstate.)
In 1967, the company's home office was moved from Skokie to Northbrook, Illinois. Allstate continued to sell additional types of insurance to customers throughout the decade, including worker's compensation insurance in 1964, surety bonds in 1966, inland-marine coverage in 1967 and a business package policy in 1969.[9]
The brand itself expanded in the 1950s and 1960s and could be found on a variety of products like fire extinguishers and motor scooters. In 1952, an Allstate car was produced, but it was a flop; it was pulled from stores by 1953. The Allstate brand was eventually limited to insurance, tires, and car batteries by the late 1960s before becoming insurance-only in the mid-1970s.[1] In 1991, the company went public[4] before becoming completely independent in 1995.[1]
In 1984, Neighborhood Office Agent program was introduced to make agents more accessible to customers
In 1985, Allstate began to move agents out of Sears stores and locate agents in neighborhood offices. In June 1993, 19.8 percent of Allstate became public through a stock offering. Allstate became completely independent in June 1995, when Sears spun off the remaining 80 percent stake in the company, distributing 350.5 million shares of Allstate stock to its stockholders.[7]
In 1993, Allstate went public when Sears sells 19.8% of the company. At the time, it was the largest IPO to date.
In 1996, their website www.allstate.com was launched.
In 1999, Allstate unveiled a new business model that created a single contract for exclusive, independent agents selling Allstate insurance. It also created a network of call centers.
In 1999, Allstate purchased the personal lines division of CNA Financial[12] and subsequently renamed it to Encompass Insurance Company which is written by independent insurance agents, as opposed to the direct writing that constitutes the core part of its business.[13]
In 2003, actor Dennis Haysbert became Allstate’s spokesman, using the tagline "That’s Allstate’s stand."[14]
In 2010 the actor Dean Winters became a part of Allstate’s campaign "Mayhem" “personifying the pitfalls, like collisions and storm damage, that can befall drivers”.
In 2012 Allstate Solutions Private Limited (also called Allstate India) was inaugurated in Bangalore which is a technology and operations centre to provides software development and business process outsourcing services to its US parent. [15] Allstate's Bangalore operation is focused on the areas of business intelligence, analytics, testing and mobility.

Advertising[edit]
"Good hands"[edit]
Allstate's slogan "You're in good hands" was created in the 1950s by Allstate Insurance Company's sales executive, Davis W. Ellis based on a similar phrase he used to reassure his wife about a doctor caring for their child. It has been the slogan ever since 1950. Allstate also referred to themselves as the Good Hands People.
In the 1960s and 1970s, TV, print and radio advertising featured Allstate’s spokesman, Ed Reimers. Reimers was often shown making the cupped-hand gesture. For 22 years, he remained the spokesman.[17]
A study in 2000 by Northwestern University's Medill Graduate Department of Integrated Marketing Communications found that the Allstate slogan "You're in good hands" ranked as the most recognizable in America.[18]
"Allstate’s stand"[edit]
Beginning in 2003, as policy growth slowed, Allstate’s television commercials used spokesman Dennis Haysbert. The ads were intended to carry the message that Allstate's service was superior to that from low-cost providers Geico and Progressive.[19] Haysbert appeared in more than 250 commercials between 2003 and 2016.
Mayhem[edit]
Beginning in 2010, Allstate used Dean Winters as "Mayhem", mean to personify the hazards drivers face. The ads conclude with Haysbert asking "Are You In Good Hands?"[20]
Social media[edit]
In January 2011, Allstate released The Lines,[21] a multi-episode TV drama web series starring actors Teresa Cesario, Kyle Sandgate-Blix, Jackson Schultz, Bridgette Pechman, Chase Maser, and Corey Doyle cast as High-School seniors. The series, filmed in the style of a television drama, depicts the cast in common situations facing teens with respect to driving (Texting while driving in particular). The series appears aimed at promoting interest and support in favor of responsible teen driving and road-safety in general. The Lines spans a total of 8 episodes, each 6–8 minutes in length. Allstate and other large corporations are attracted to the rapid growth of social media for use in their advertising campaigns.

Allstate has a Sustainability Leadership Team composed of officers and senior staff from all areas of the company. The team focuses on sustainability efforts from a company-wide perspective — including environmental initiatives that embed “green” programs and processes throughout their operations.[29]
Criticism[edit]
In July 2008, the American Association for Justice ranked Allstate No. 1 among nation's worst insurers. This ranking was given because: “While Allstate publicly touts its ‘good hands’ approach, it has instead privately instructed its agents to employ a ‘boxing gloves’ strategy against its policyholders,” said American Association for Justice CEO Jon Haber. They've since revamped their approach.[30] Allstate criticized the report, with a spokesman noting that "The personal injury lawyers behind this report provide no support for their statements other than decade old recycled allegations that have been shown to be without merit in courts of law." [31] In 2009 Allstate successfully fought to obtain Federal government TARP fund eligibility only to decline it once they obtained eligibility.[32]
Auto insurance claims[edit]
An investigative report in February 2007 by CNN found that major car insurance companies, like Allstate, are increasingly fighting auto insurance claims from those who incurred injuries by their insured members.[33] Allstate currently commands 18% of the auto insurance market in the United States.[34]
Homeowners claims[edit]
The PBS television program Now,[35] in conjunction with Bloomberg Markets magazine, did an exposé regarding Allstate and other major insurers' homeowners insurance policies.
Catastrophe exposure management[edit]
Allstate has stated intentions of reducing its exposure in hurricane-prone Florida. In November 2006, Allstate did not renew 120,000 policies that were expiring at that time. Governor Charlie Crist and the Florida Cabinet passed a 90-day emergency order to temporarily prevent insurance companies from nonrenewing policies.[36] On February 20, 2007, Florida Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty clarified the order, stating that insurance companies can nonrenew policies if they satisfy certain conditions, including filing new, lower rates with the state and give customers 100 days’ notice.[37]
From Good Hands to Boxing Gloves[edit]
This is the title of a book written by David Berardinelli, JD;, Michael Freeman, PhD, DC, MPH; and Aaron DeShaw, DC, JD with a foreword by Eugene R. Anderson.[38]
The book relates profit-boosting strategies that consulting firm McKinsey & Company presented to Allstate to maximize profits and diminish the amount of money sent to clients who put in a claim. McKinsey specializes in redesigning product delivery systems for Fortune 100 companies (including controversial clients such as Enron) to maximize profits. McKinsey’s recommendation to Allstate, according to Berardinelli, was to low-ball claims so that desperate customers in dire straits would be more likely to accept a settlement offer while Allstate continued to make a profit and collect interest on the insurance payment. Allstate would offer its "good hands" in the way of a low-ball claim and, if the customer did not accept, to get out "boxing gloves." [39]
The book was reviewed by Business Week magazine.[40] According to that article, Allstate responded to Berardinelli's allegations by claiming that Berardinelli's allegations were "unfounded and unproven." Rather than trying to cheat customers, the company stated that its major goal was to benefit policyholders by identifying "exaggerated and fraudulent claims" and that its "processes are absolutely sound . . . to investigate, evaluate, and promptly resolve each claim fairly, based on the merits."[40]
Court decisions on the issues debated by Berardinelli and Allstate have gone both ways. According to the Business Week article, as of 2006, "Courts and regulators in a number of states, including New York, Pennsylvania, and Washington, have forced Allstate to halt or change its practice of handing out a controversial 'Do I Need an Attorney?' form to people involved in accidents." On the other hand, the article also states that "Although plaintiffs have had piecemeal success in bad-faith cases against Allstate, the insurer points to seven court rulings that have rejected attacks on CCPR. Last December a Montana state court noted that while CCPR practices may be illegal 'if misapplied in a particular case, they nevertheless are neutral with no manifestly illegal purpose.'" While many of the cost-reduction strategies McKinsey recommended at Allstate remain in place, some have been reined in following legal and regulatory challenges in several states.[40]
Use of Colossus[edit]
Many criticisms leveled against Allstate (and other insurers), including Barardinelli's book, involved the use of a software program called "Colossus" to process claims. In 2010, Allstate paid a $10 million fine to settle a lawsuit brought by 41 states concerning inconsistencies in the manner in which Colossus was used. It also agreed to standardize its use of the software. However, “it is important to note that we found no systemic underpayment of bodily injury claims,” New York Insurance Superintendent James J. Wrynn said in a press release.[41]

The claims handled in the matter were very minor collision type losses that did not result in any ($0) damage to the car, and therefore was the insurance company protecting it assets and the premium paying public money, by keeping rates as low as possible."Auto insurers play hardball in minor-crash claims".

History[edit]
In 1925, Sears held a national contest to decide the name of a new brand of car tires. After over two million name submissions, "Allstate" was chosen as the winner; the trademark was adopted the very next year. The tires' success in both the catalog and retail stores prompted Sears Chairman General Robert E. Wood to praise the Allstate tire's contribution to Sears' retail store success.[1]
The idea for Allstate Insurance Company came during a bridge game on a commuter train in 1930, when insurance broker Carl L. Odell proposed to Wood, his neighbor, the idea of selling auto insurance by direct mail. The idea appealed to Wood, and he passed the proposal to the Sears board of directors, which approved it. Allstate Insurance Company, named after Sears’ tire brand, went into business on April 17, 1931, offering auto insurance by direct mail and through the Sears catalog.[7] This was in line with one of the objectives of a company to sell automobile insurance in the same manner as Sears sold its merchandise.[8]
Lessing J. Rosenwald was Allstate's first board chairman, and Odell was named vice president and secretary.[9]
In 1933, at the Century of Progress World’s Fair in Chicago, Allstate’s Richard E. Roskam sold insurance at a booth in the Sears pavilion. In 1934, Allstate opened its first permanent sales office in a Chicago Sears store.[10]
In 1941, only about a quarter of U.S. drivers had auto liability insurance. This led to the state of New York passing a law which established the financial responsibility of drivers for damage or injuries resulting from auto mishaps. That law inspired legislation in other states, and by the mid-1950s nearly every state had some sort of financial responsibility law on its books.[7]
In 1949 the Allstate Headquarters Building was completed at 3245 W. Arthington Street in Chicago.[11] The mid-rise building is currently vacant (as of 2013) and in danger of demolition. The building is noted for its early post-war mid-rise construction. This location was vacated at some point when the company relocated in the post-war years.
The company’s "You're in Good Hands with Allstate" slogan was created in 1950 by Allstate’s general sales manager Davis W. Ellis. At the end of the decade, it was used in the company's first network television advertising campaign, which featured actor Ed Reimers.[9]
Allstate added products throughout the 1950s, including fire insurance in 1954 and homeowners and life insurance in 1957. Allstate began selling insurance to Canadians in 1953. Allstate Insurance Company of Canada was incorporated in 1964.[7] (In 1952 and 1953, Sears also sold an automobile called Allstate.)
In 1967, the company's home office was moved from Skokie to Northbrook, Illinois. Allstate continued to sell additional types of insurance to customers throughout the decade, including worker's compensation insurance in 1964, surety bonds in 1966, inland-marine coverage in 1967 and a business package policy in 1969.[9]
The brand itself expanded in the 1950s and 1960s and could be found on a variety of products like fire extinguishers and motor scooters. In 1952, an Allstate car was produced, but it was a flop; it was pulled from stores by 1953. The Allstate brand was eventually limited to insurance, tires, and car batteries by the late 1960s before becoming insurance-only in the mid-1970s.[1] In 1991, the company went public[4] before becoming completely independent in 1995.[1]
In 1984, Neighborhood Office Agent program was introduced to make agents more accessible to customers
In 1985, Allstate began to move agents out of Sears stores and locate agents in neighborhood offices. In June 1993, 19.8 percent of Allstate became public through a stock offering. Allstate became completely independent in June 1995, when Sears spun off the remaining 80 percent stake in the company, distributing 350.5 million shares of Allstate stock to its stockholders.[7]
In 1993, Allstate went public when Sears sells 19.8% of the company. At the time, it was the largest IPO to date.
In 1996, their website www.allstate.com was launched.
In 1999, Allstate unveiled a new business model that created a single contract for exclusive, independent agents selling Allstate insurance. It also created a network of call centers.
In 1999, Allstate purchased the personal lines division of CNA Financial[12] and subsequently renamed it to Encompass Insurance Company which is written by independent insurance agents, as opposed to the direct writing that constitutes the core part of its business.[13]
In 2003, actor Dennis Haysbert became Allstate’s spokesman, using the tagline "That’s Allstate’s stand."[14]
In 2010 the actor Dean Winters became a part of Allstate’s campaign "Mayhem" “personifying the pitfalls, like collisions and storm damage, that can befall drivers”.
In 2012 Allstate Solutions Private Limited (also called Allstate India) was inaugurated in Bangalore which is a technology and operations centre to provides software development and business process outsourcing services to its US parent. [15] Allstate's Bangalore operation is focused on the areas of business intelligence, analytics, testing and mobility.

Advertising[edit]
"Good hands"[edit]
Allstate's slogan "You're in good hands" was created in the 1950s by Allstate Insurance Company's sales executive, Davis W. Ellis based on a similar phrase he used to reassure his wife about a doctor caring for their child. It has been the slogan ever since 1950. Allstate also referred to themselves as the Good Hands People.
In the 1960s and 1970s, TV, print and radio advertising featured Allstate’s spokesman, Ed Reimers. Reimers was often shown making the cupped-hand gesture. For 22 years, he remained the spokesman.[17]
A study in 2000 by Northwestern University's Medill Graduate Department of Integrated Marketing Communications found that the Allstate slogan "You're in good hands" ranked as the most recognizable in America.[18]
"Allstate’s stand"[edit]
Beginning in 2003, as policy growth slowed, Allstate’s television commercials used spokesman Dennis Haysbert. The ads were intended to carry the message that Allstate's service was superior to that from low-cost providers Geico and Progressive.[19] Haysbert appeared in more than 250 commercials between 2003 and 2016.
Mayhem[edit]
Beginning in 2010, Allstate used Dean Winters as "Mayhem", mean to personify the hazards drivers face. The ads conclude with Haysbert asking "Are You In Good Hands?"[20]
Social media[edit]
In January 2011, Allstate released The Lines,[21] a multi-episode TV drama web series starring actors Teresa Cesario, Kyle Sandgate-Blix, Jackson Schultz, Bridgette Pechman, Chase Maser, and Corey Doyle cast as High-School seniors. The series, filmed in the style of a television drama, depicts the cast in common situations facing teens with respect to driving (Texting while driving in particular). The series appears aimed at promoting interest and support in favor of responsible teen driving and road-safety in general. The Lines spans a total of 8 episodes, each 6–8 minutes in length. Allstate and other large corporations are attracted to the rapid growth of social media for use in their advertising campaigns.

Criticism[edit]
In July 2008, the American Association for Justice ranked Allstate No. 1 among nation's worst insurers. This ranking was given because: “While Allstate publicly touts its ‘good hands’ approach, it has instead privately instructed its agents to employ a ‘boxing gloves’ strategy against its policyholders,” said American Association for Justice CEO Jon Haber. They've since revamped their approach.[30] Allstate criticized the report, with a spokesman noting that "The personal injury lawyers behind this report provide no support for their statements other than decade old recycled allegations that have been shown to be without merit in courts of law." [31] In 2009 Allstate successfully fought to obtain Federal government TARP fund eligibility only to decline it once they obtained eligibility.[32]
Auto insurance claims[edit]
An investigative report in February 2007 by CNN found that major car insurance companies, like Allstate, are increasingly fighting auto insurance claims from those who incurred injuries by their insured members.[33] Allstate currently commands 18% of the auto insurance market in the United States.[34]
Homeowners claims[edit]
The PBS television program Now,[35] in conjunction with Bloomberg Markets magazine, did an exposé regarding Allstate and other major insurers' homeowners insurance policies.
Catastrophe exposure management[edit]
Allstate has stated intentions of reducing its exposure in hurricane-prone Florida. In November 2006, Allstate did not renew 120,000 policies that were expiring at that time. Governor Charlie Crist and the Florida Cabinet passed a 90-day emergency order to temporarily prevent insurance companies from nonrenewing policies.[36] On February 20, 2007, Florida Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty clarified the order, stating that insurance companies can nonrenew policies if they satisfy certain conditions, including filing new, lower rates with the state and give customers 100 days’ notice.[37]
From Good Hands to Boxing Gloves[edit]
This is the title of a book written by David Berardinelli, JD;, Michael Freeman, PhD, DC, MPH; and Aaron DeShaw, DC, JD with a foreword by Eugene R. Anderson.[38]
The book relates profit-boosting strategies that consulting firm McKinsey & Company presented to Allstate to maximize profits and diminish the amount of money sent to clients who put in a claim. McKinsey specializes in redesigning product delivery systems for Fortune 100 companies (including controversial clients such as Enron) to maximize profits. McKinsey’s recommendation to Allstate, according to Berardinelli, was to low-ball claims so that desperate customers in dire straits would be more likely to accept a settlement offer while Allstate continued to make a profit and collect interest on the insurance payment. Allstate would offer its "good hands" in the way of a low-ball claim and, if the customer did not accept, to get out "boxing gloves." [39]
The book was reviewed by Business Week magazine.[40] According to that article, Allstate responded to Berardinelli's allegations by claiming that Berardinelli's allegations were "unfounded and unproven." Rather than trying to cheat customers, the company stated that its major goal was to benefit policyholders by identifying "exaggerated and fraudulent claims" and that its "processes are absolutely sound . . . to investigate, evaluate, and promptly resolve each claim fairly, based on the merits."[40]
Court decisions on the issues debated by Berardinelli and Allstate have gone both ways. According to the Business Week article, as of 2006, "Courts and regulators in a number of states, including New York, Pennsylvania, and Washington, have forced Allstate to halt or change its practice of handing out a controversial 'Do I Need an Attorney?' form to people involved in accidents." On the other hand, the article also states that "Although plaintiffs have had piecemeal success in bad-faith cases against Allstate, the insurer points to seven court rulings that have rejected attacks on CCPR. Last December a Montana state court noted that while CCPR practices may be illegal 'if misapplied in a particular case, they nevertheless are neutral with no manifestly illegal purpose.'" While many of the cost-reduction strategies McKinsey recommended at Allstate remain in place, some have been reined in following legal and regulatory challenges in several states.[40]
Use of Colossus[edit]
Many criticisms leveled against Allstate (and other insurers), including Barardinelli's book, involved the use of a software program called "Colossus" to process claims. In 2010, Allstate paid a $10 million fine to settle a lawsuit brought by 41 states concerning inconsistencies in the manner in which Colossus was used. It also agreed to standardize its use of the software. However, “it is important to note that we found no systemic underpayment of bodily injury claims,” New York Insurance Superintendent James J. Wrynn said in a press release.[41]

The claims handled in the matter were very minor collision type losses that did not result in any ($0) damage to the car, and therefore was the insurance company protecting it assets and the premium paying public money, by keeping rates as low as possible."Auto insurers play hardball in minor-crash claims".

History[edit]
In 1925, Sears held a national contest to decide the name of a new brand of car tires. After over two million name submissions, "Allstate" was chosen as the winner; the trademark was adopted the very next year. The tires' success in both the catalog and retail stores prompted Sears Chairman General Robert E. Wood to praise the Allstate tire's contribution to Sears' retail store success.[1]
The idea for Allstate Insurance Company came during a bridge game on a commuter train in 1930, when insurance broker Carl L. Odell proposed to Wood, his neighbor, the idea of selling auto insurance by direct mail. The idea appealed to Wood, and he passed the proposal to the Sears board of directors, which approved it. Allstate Insurance Company, named after Sears’ tire brand, went into business on April 17, 1931, offering auto insurance by direct mail and through the Sears catalog.[7] This was in line with one of the objectives of a company to sell automobile insurance in the same manner as Sears sold its merchandise.[8]
Lessing J. Rosenwald was Allstate's first board chairman, and Odell was named vice president and secretary.[9]
In 1933, at the Century of Progress World’s Fair in Chicago, Allstate’s Richard E. Roskam sold insurance at a booth in the Sears pavilion. In 1934, Allstate opened its first permanent sales office in a Chicago Sears store.[10]
In 1941, only about a quarter of U.S. drivers had auto liability insurance. This led to the state of New York passing a law which established the financial responsibility of drivers for damage or injuries resulting from auto mishaps. That law inspired legislation in other states, and by the mid-1950s nearly every state had some sort of financial responsibility law on its books.[7]
In 1949 the Allstate Headquarters Building was completed at 3245 W. Arthington Street in Chicago.[11] The mid-rise building is currently vacant (as of 2013) and in danger of demolition. The building is noted for its early post-war mid-rise construction. This location was vacated at some point when the company relocated in the post-war years.
The company’s "You're in Good Hands with Allstate" slogan was created in 1950 by Allstate’s general sales manager Davis W. Ellis. At the end of the decade, it was used in the company's first network television advertising campaign, which featured actor Ed Reimers.[9]
Allstate added products throughout the 1950s, including fire insurance in 1954 and homeowners and life insurance in 1957. Allstate began selling insurance to Canadians in 1953. Allstate Insurance Company of Canada was incorporated in 1964.[7] (In 1952 and 1953, Sears also sold an automobile called Allstate.)
In 1967, the company's home office was moved from Skokie to Northbrook, Illinois. Allstate continued to sell additional types of insurance to customers throughout the decade, including worker's compensation insurance in 1964, surety bonds in 1966, inland-marine coverage in 1967 and a business package policy in 1969.[9]
The brand itself expanded in the 1950s and 1960s and could be found on a variety of products like fire extinguishers and motor scooters. In 1952, an Allstate car was produced, but it was a flop; it was pulled from stores by 1953. The Allstate brand was eventually limited to insurance, tires, and car batteries by the late 1960s before becoming insurance-only in the mid-1970s.[1] In 1991, the company went public[4] before becoming completely independent in 1995.[1]
In 1984, Neighborhood Office Agent program was introduced to make agents more accessible to customers
In 1985, Allstate began to move agents out of Sears stores and locate agents in neighborhood offices. In June 1993, 19.8 percent of Allstate became public through a stock offering. Allstate became completely independent in June 1995, when Sears spun off the remaining 80 percent stake in the company, distributing 350.5 million shares of Allstate stock to its stockholders.[7]
In 1993, Allstate went public when Sears sells 19.8% of the company. At the time, it was the largest IPO to date.
In 1996, their website www.allstate.com was launched.
In 1999, Allstate unveiled a new business model that created a single contract for exclusive, independent agents selling Allstate insurance. It also created a network of call centers.
In 1999, Allstate purchased the personal lines division of CNA Financial[12] and subsequently renamed it to Encompass Insurance Company which is written by independent insurance agents, as opposed to the direct writing that constitutes the core part of its business.[13]
In 2003, actor Dennis Haysbert became Allstate’s spokesman, using the tagline "That’s Allstate’s stand."[14]
In 2010 the actor Dean Winters became a part of Allstate’s campaign "Mayhem" “personifying the pitfalls, like collisions and storm damage, that can befall drivers”.
In 2012 Allstate Solutions Private Limited (also called Allstate India) was inaugurated in Bangalore which is a technology and operations centre to provides software development and business process outsourcing services to its US parent. [15] Allstate's Bangalore operation is focused on the areas of business intelligence, analytics, testing and mobility.

Advertising[edit]
"Good hands"[edit]
Allstate's slogan "You're in good hands" was created in the 1950s by Allstate Insurance Company's sales executive, Davis W. Ellis based on a similar phrase he used to reassure his wife about a doctor caring for their child. It has been the slogan ever since 1950. Allstate also referred to themselves as the Good Hands People.
In the 1960s and 1970s, TV, print and radio advertising featured Allstate’s spokesman, Ed Reimers. Reimers was often shown making the cupped-hand gesture. For 22 years, he remained the spokesman.[17]
A study in 2000 by Northwestern University's Medill Graduate Department of Integrated Marketing Communications found that the Allstate slogan "You're in good hands" ranked as the most recognizable in America.[18]
"Allstate’s stand"[edit]
Beginning in 2003, as policy growth slowed, Allstate’s television commercials used spokesman Dennis Haysbert. The ads were intended to carry the message that Allstate's service was superior to that from low-cost providers Geico and Progressive.[19] Haysbert appeared in more than 250 commercials between 2003 and 2016.
Mayhem[edit]
Beginning in 2010, Allstate used Dean Winters as "Mayhem", mean to personify the hazards drivers face. The ads conclude with Haysbert asking "Are You In Good Hands?"[20]
Social media[edit]
In January 2011, Allstate released The Lines,[21] a multi-episode TV drama web series starring actors Teresa Cesario, Kyle Sandgate-Blix, Jackson Schultz, Bridgette Pechman, Chase Maser, and Corey Doyle cast as High-School seniors. The series, filmed in the style of a television drama, depicts the cast in common situations facing teens with respect to driving (Texting while driving in particular). The series appears aimed at promoting interest and support in favor of responsible teen driving and road-safety in general. The Lines spans a total of 8 episodes, each 6–8 minutes in length. Allstate and other large corporations are attracted to the rapid growth of social media for use in their advertising campaigns.

The team focuses on sustainability efforts from a company-wide perspective — including environmental initiatives that embed “green” programs and processes throughout their operations.[29]
Criticism[edit]
In July 2008, the American Association for Justice ranked Allstate No. 1 among nation's worst insurers. This ranking was given because: “While Allstate publicly touts its ‘good hands’ approach, it has instead privately instructed its agents to employ a ‘boxing gloves’ strategy against its policyholders,” said American Association for Justice CEO Jon Haber. They've since revamped their approach.[30] Allstate criticized the report, with a spokesman noting that "The personal injury lawyers behind this report provide no support for their statements other than decade old recycled allegations that have been shown to be without merit in courts of law." [31] In 2009 Allstate successfully fought to obtain Federal government TARP fund eligibility only to decline it once they obtained eligibility.[32]
Auto insurance claims[edit]
An investigative report in February 2007 by CNN found that major car insurance companies, like Allstate, are increasingly fighting auto insurance claims from those who incurred injuries by their insured members.[33] Allstate currently commands 18% of the auto insurance market in the United States.[34]
Homeowners claims[edit]
The PBS television program Now,[35] in conjunction with Bloomberg Markets magazine, did an exposé regarding Allstate and other major insurers' homeowners insurance policies.
Catastrophe exposure management[edit]
Allstate has stated intentions of reducing its exposure in hurricane-prone Florida. In November 2006, Allstate did not renew 120,000 policies that were expiring at that time. Governor Charlie Crist and the Florida Cabinet passed a 90-day emergency order to temporarily prevent insurance companies from nonrenewing policies.[36] On February 20, 2007, Florida Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty clarified the order, stating that insurance companies can nonrenew policies if they satisfy certain conditions, including filing new, lower rates with the state and give customers 100 days’ notice.[37]
From Good Hands to Boxing Gloves[edit]
This is the title of a book written by David Berardinelli, JD;, Michael Freeman, PhD, DC, MPH; and Aaron DeShaw, DC, JD with a foreword by Eugene R. Anderson.[38]
The book relates profit-boosting strategies that consulting firm McKinsey & Company presented to Allstate to maximize profits and diminish the amount of money sent to clients who put in a claim. McKinsey specializes in redesigning product delivery systems for Fortune 100 companies (including controversial clients such as Enron) to maximize profits. McKinsey’s recommendation to Allstate, according to Berardinelli, was to low-ball claims so that desperate customers in dire straits would be more likely to accept a settlement offer while Allstate continued to make a profit and collect interest on the insurance payment. Allstate would offer its "good hands" in the way of a low-ball claim and, if the customer did not accept, to get out "boxing gloves." [39]
The book was reviewed by Business Week magazine.[40] According to that article, Allstate responded to Berardinelli's allegations by claiming that Berardinelli's allegations were "unfounded and unproven." Rather than trying to cheat customers, the company stated that its major goal was to benefit policyholders by identifying "exaggerated and fraudulent claims" and that its "processes are absolutely sound . . . to investigate, evaluate, and promptly resolve each claim fairly, based on the merits."[40]
Court decisions on the issues debated by Berardinelli and Allstate have gone both ways. According to the Business Week article, as of 2006, "Courts and regulators in a number of states, including New York, Pennsylvania, and Washington, have forced Allstate to halt or change its practice of handing out a controversial 'Do I Need an Attorney?' form to people involved in accidents." On the other hand, the article also states that "Although plaintiffs have had piecemeal success in bad-faith cases against Allstate, the insurer points to seven court rulings that have rejected attacks on CCPR. Last December a Montana state court noted that while CCPR practices may be illegal 'if misapplied in a particular case, they nevertheless are neutral with no manifestly illegal purpose.'" While many of the cost-reduction strategies McKinsey recommended at Allstate remain in place, some have been reined in following legal and regulatory challenges in several states.[40]
Use of Colossus[edit]
Many criticisms leveled against Allstate (and other insurers), including Barardinelli's book, involved the use of a software program called "Colossus" to process claims. In 2010, Allstate paid a $10 million fine to settle a lawsuit brought by 41 states concerning inconsistencies in the manner in which Colossus was used. It also agreed to standardize its use of the software. However, “it is important to note that we found no systemic underpayment of bodily injury claims,” New York Insurance Superintendent James J. Wrynn said in a press release.[41]

The claims handled in the matter were very minor collision type losses that did not result in any ($0) damage to the car, and therefore was the insurance company protecting it assets and the premium paying public money, by keeping rates as low as possible."Auto insurers play hardball in minor-crash claims".

History[edit]
In 1925, Sears held a national contest to decide the name of a new brand of car tires. After over two million name submissions, "Allstate" was chosen as the winner; the trademark was adopted the very next year. The tires' success in both the catalog and retail stores prompted Sears Chairman General Robert E. Wood to praise the Allstate tire's contribution to Sears' retail store success.[1]
The idea for Allstate Insurance Company came during a bridge game on a commuter train in 1930, when insurance broker Carl L. Odell proposed to Wood, his neighbor, the idea of selling auto insurance by direct mail. The idea appealed to Wood, and he passed the proposal to the Sears board of directors, which approved it. Allstate Insurance Company, named after Sears’ tire brand, went into business on April 17, 1931, offering auto insurance by direct mail and through the Sears catalog.[7] This was in line with one of the objectives of a company to sell automobile insurance in the same manner as Sears sold its merchandise.[8]
Lessing J. Rosenwald was Allstate's first board chairman, and Odell was named vice president and secretary.[9]
In 1933, at the Century of Progress World’s Fair in Chicago, Allstate’s Richard E. Roskam sold insurance at a booth in the Sears pavilion. In 1934, Allstate opened its first permanent sales office in a Chicago Sears store.[10]
In 1941, only about a quarter of U.S. drivers had auto liability insurance. This led to the state of New York passing a law which established the financial responsibility of drivers for damage or injuries resulting from auto mishaps. That law inspired legislation in other states, and by the mid-1950s nearly every state had some sort of financial responsibility law on its books.[7]
In 1949 the Allstate Headquarters Building was completed at 3245 W. Arthington Street in Chicago.[11] The mid-rise building is currently vacant (as of 2013) and in danger of demolition. The building is noted for its early post-war mid-rise construction. This location was vacated at some point when the company relocated in the post-war years.
The company’s "You're in Good Hands with Allstate" slogan was created in 1950 by Allstate’s general sales manager Davis W. Ellis. At the end of the decade, it was used in the company's first network television advertising campaign, which featured actor Ed Reimers.[9]
Allstate added products throughout the 1950s, including fire insurance in 1954 and homeowners and life insurance in 1957. Allstate began selling insurance to Canadians in 1953. Allstate Insurance Company of Canada was incorporated in 1964.[7] (In 1952 and 1953, Sears also sold an automobile called Allstate.)
In 1967, the company's home office was moved from Skokie to Northbrook, Illinois. Allstate continued to sell additional types of insurance to customers throughout the decade, including worker's compensation insurance in 1964, surety bonds in 1966, inland-marine coverage in 1967 and a business package policy in 1969.[9]
The brand itself expanded in the 1950s and 1960s and could be found on a variety of products like fire extinguishers and motor scooters. In 1952, an Allstate car was produced, but it was a flop; it was pulled from stores by 1953. The Allstate brand was eventually limited to insurance, tires, and car batteries by the late 1960s before becoming insurance-only in the mid-1970s.[1] In 1991, the company went public[4] before becoming completely independent in 1995.[1]
In 1984, Neighborhood Office Agent program was introduced to make agents more accessible to customers
In 1985, Allstate began to move agents out of Sears stores and locate agents in neighborhood offices. In June 1993, 19.8 percent of Allstate became public through a stock offering. Allstate became completely independent in June 1995, when Sears spun off the remaining 80 percent stake in the company, distributing 350.5 million shares of Allstate stock to its stockholders.[7]
In 1993, Allstate went public when Sears sells 19.8% of the company. At the time, it was the largest IPO to date.
In 1996, their website www.allstate.com was launched.
In 1999, Allstate unveiled a new business model that created a single contract for exclusive, independent agents selling Allstate insurance. It also created a network of call centers.
In 1999, Allstate purchased the personal lines division of CNA Financial[12] and subsequently renamed it to Encompass Insurance Company which is written by independent insurance agents, as opposed to the direct writing that constitutes the core part of its business.[13]
In 2003, actor Dennis Haysbert became Allstate’s spokesman, using the tagline "That’s Allstate’s stand."[14]
In 2010 the actor Dean Winters became a part of Allstate’s campaign "Mayhem" “personifying the pitfalls, like collisions and storm damage, that can befall drivers”.
In 2012 Allstate Solutions Private Limited (also called Allstate India) was inaugurated in Bangalore which is a technology and operations centre to provides software development and business process outsourcing services to its US parent. [15] Allstate's Bangalore operation is focused on the areas of business intelligence, analytics, testing and mobility.

Advertising[edit]
"Good hands"[edit]
Allstate's slogan "You're in good hands" was created in the 1950s by Allstate Insurance Company's sales executive, Davis W. Ellis based on a similar phrase he used to reassure his wife about a doctor caring for their child. It has been the slogan ever since 1950. Allstate also referred to themselves as the Good Hands People.
In the 1960s and 1970s, TV, print and radio advertising featured Allstate’s spokesman, Ed Reimers. Reimers was often shown making the cupped-hand gesture. For 22 years, he remained the spokesman.[17]
A study in 2000 by Northwestern University's Medill Graduate Department of Integrated Marketing Communications found that the Allstate slogan "You're in good hands" ranked as the most recognizable in America.[18]
"Allstate’s stand"[edit]
Beginning in 2003, as policy growth slowed, Allstate’s television commercials used spokesman Dennis Haysbert. The ads were intended to carry the message that Allstate's service was superior to that from low-cost providers Geico and Progressive.[19] Haysbert appeared in more than 250 commercials between 2003 and 2016.
Mayhem[edit]
Beginning in 2010, Allstate used Dean Winters as "Mayhem", mean to personify the hazards drivers face. The ads conclude with Haysbert asking "Are You In Good Hands?"[20]
Social media[edit]
In January 2011, Allstate released The Lines,[21] a multi-episode TV drama web series starring actors Teresa Cesario, Kyle Sandgate-Blix, Jackson Schultz, Bridgette Pechman, Chase Maser, and Corey Doyle cast as High-School seniors. The series, filmed in the style of a television drama, depicts the cast in common situations facing teens with respect to driving (Texting while driving in particular). The series appears aimed at promoting interest and support in favor of responsible teen driving and road-safety in general. The Lines spans a total of 8 episodes, each 6–8 minutes in length. Allstate and other large corporations are attracted to the rapid growth of social media for use in their advertising campaigns.

Environmental record[edit]
Allstate has a Sustainability Leadership Team composed of officers and senior staff from all areas of the company. The team focuses on sustainability efforts from a company-wide perspective — including environmental initiatives that embed “green” programs and processes throughout their operations.[29]
Criticism[edit]
In July 2008, the American Association for Justice ranked Allstate No. 1 among nation's worst insurers. This ranking was given because: “While Allstate publicly touts its ‘good hands’ approach, it has instead privately instructed its agents to employ a ‘boxing gloves’ strategy against its policyholders,” said American Association for Justice CEO Jon Haber. They've since revamped their approach.[30] Allstate criticized the report, with a spokesman noting that "The personal injury lawyers behind this report provide no support for their statements other than decade old recycled allegations that have been shown to be without merit in courts of law." [31] In 2009 Allstate successfully fought to obtain Federal government TARP fund eligibility only to decline it once they obtained eligibility.[32]
Auto insurance claims[edit]
An investigative report in February 2007 by CNN found that major car insurance companies, like Allstate, are increasingly fighting auto insurance claims from those who incurred injuries by their insured members.[33] Allstate currently commands 18% of the auto insurance market in the United States.[34]
Homeowners claims[edit]
The PBS television program Now,[35] in conjunction with Bloomberg Markets magazine, did an exposé regarding Allstate and other major insurers' homeowners insurance policies.
Catastrophe exposure management[edit]
Allstate has stated intentions of reducing its exposure in hurricane-prone Florida. In November 2006, Allstate did not renew 120,000 policies that were expiring at that time. Governor Charlie Crist and the Florida Cabinet passed a 90-day emergency order to temporarily prevent insurance companies from nonrenewing policies.[36] On February 20, 2007, Florida Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty clarified the order, stating that insurance companies can nonrenew policies if they satisfy certain conditions, including filing new, lower rates with the state and give customers 100 days’ notice.[37]
From Good Hands to Boxing Gloves[edit]
This is the title of a book written by David Berardinelli, JD;, Michael Freeman, PhD, DC, MPH; and Aaron DeShaw, DC, JD with a foreword by Eugene R. Anderson.[38]
The book relates profit-boosting strategies that consulting firm McKinsey & Company presented to Allstate to maximize profits and diminish the amount of money sent to clients who put in a claim. McKinsey specializes in redesigning product delivery systems for Fortune 100 companies (including controversial clients such as Enron) to maximize profits. McKinsey’s recommendation to Allstate, according to Berardinelli, was to low-ball claims so that desperate customers in dire straits would be more likely to accept a settlement offer while Allstate continued to make a profit and collect interest on the insurance payment. Allstate would offer its "good hands" in the way of a low-ball claim and, if the customer did not accept, to get out "boxing gloves." [39]
The book was reviewed by Business Week magazine.[40] According to that article, Allstate responded to Berardinelli's allegations by claiming that Berardinelli's allegations were "unfounded and unproven." Rather than trying to cheat customers, the company stated that its major goal was to benefit policyholders by identifying "exaggerated and fraudulent claims" and that its "processes are absolutely sound . . . to investigate, evaluate, and promptly resolve each claim fairly, based on the merits."[40]
Court decisions on the issues debated by Berardinelli and Allstate have gone both ways. According to the Business Week article, as of 2006, "Courts and regulators in a number of states, including New York, Pennsylvania, and Washington, have forced Allstate to halt or change its practice of handing out a controversial 'Do I Need an Attorney?' form to people involved in accidents." On the other hand, the article also states that "Although plaintiffs have had piecemeal success in bad-faith cases against Allstate, the insurer points to seven court rulings that have rejected attacks on CCPR. Last December a Montana state court noted that while CCPR practices may be illegal 'if misapplied in a particular case, they nevertheless are neutral with no manifestly illegal purpose.'" While many of the cost-reduction strategies McKinsey recommended at Allstate remain in place, some have been reined in following legal and regulatory challenges in several states.[40]
Use of Colossus[edit]
Many criticisms leveled against Allstate (and other insurers), including Barardinelli's book, involved the use of a software program called "Colossus" to process claims. In 2010, Allstate paid a $10 million fine to settle a lawsuit brought by 41 states concerning inconsistencies in the manner in which Colossus was used. It also agreed to standardize its use of the software. However, “it is important to note that we found no systemic underpayment of bodily injury claims,” New York Insurance Superintendent James J. Wrynn said in a press release.[41]

The claims handled in the matter were very minor collision type losses that did not result in any ($0) damage to the car, and therefore was the insurance company protecting it assets and the premium paying public money, by keeping rates as low as possible."Auto insurers play hardball in minor-crash claims".

History[edit]
In 1925, Sears held a national contest to decide the name of a new brand of car tires. After over two million name submissions, "Allstate" was chosen as the winner; the trademark was adopted the very next year. The tires' success in both the catalog and retail stores prompted Sears Chairman General Robert E. Wood to praise the Allstate tire's contribution to Sears' retail store success.[1]
The idea for Allstate Insurance Company came during a bridge game on a commuter train in 1930, when insurance broker Carl L. Odell proposed to Wood, his neighbor, the idea of selling auto insurance by direct mail. The idea appealed to Wood, and he passed the proposal to the Sears board of directors, which approved it. Allstate Insurance Company, named after Sears’ tire brand, went into business on April 17, 1931, offering auto insurance by direct mail and through the Sears catalog.[7] This was in line with one of the objectives of a company to sell automobile insurance in the same manner as Sears sold its merchandise.[8]
Lessing J. Rosenwald was Allstate's first board chairman, and Odell was named vice president and secretary.[9]
In 1933, at the Century of Progress World’s Fair in Chicago, Allstate’s Richard E. Roskam sold insurance at a booth in the Sears pavilion. In 1934, Allstate opened its first permanent sales office in a Chicago Sears store.[10]
In 1941, only about a quarter of U.S. drivers had auto liability insurance. This led to the state of New York passing a law which established the financial responsibility of drivers for damage or injuries resulting from auto mishaps. That law inspired legislation in other states, and by the mid-1950s nearly every state had some sort of financial responsibility law on its books.[7]
In 1949 the Allstate Headquarters Building was completed at 3245 W. Arthington Street in Chicago.[11] The mid-rise building is currently vacant (as of 2013) and in danger of demolition. The building is noted for its early post-war mid-rise construction. This location was vacated at some point when the company relocated in the post-war years.
The company’s "You're in Good Hands with Allstate" slogan was created in 1950 by Allstate’s general sales manager Davis W. Ellis. At the end of the decade, it was used in the company's first network television advertising campaign, which featured actor Ed Reimers.[9]
Allstate added products throughout the 1950s, including fire insurance in 1954 and homeowners and life insurance in 1957. Allstate began selling insurance to Canadians in 1953. Allstate Insurance Company of Canada was incorporated in 1964.[7] (In 1952 and 1953, Sears also sold an automobile called Allstate.)
In 1967, the company's home office was moved from Skokie to Northbrook, Illinois. Allstate continued to sell additional types of insurance to customers throughout the decade, including worker's compensation insurance in 1964, surety bonds in 1966, inland-marine coverage in 1967 and a business package policy in 1969.[9]
The brand itself expanded in the 1950s and 1960s and could be found on a variety of products like fire extinguishers and motor scooters. In 1952, an Allstate car was produced, but it was a flop; it was pulled from stores by 1953. The Allstate brand was eventually limited to insurance, tires, and car batteries by the late 1960s before becoming insurance-only in the mid-1970s.[1] In 1991, the company went public[4] before becoming completely independent in 1995.[1]
In 1984, Neighborhood Office Agent program was introduced to make agents more accessible to customers
In 1985, Allstate began to move agents out of Sears stores and locate agents in neighborhood offices. In June 1993, 19.8 percent of Allstate became public through a stock offering. Allstate became completely independent in June 1995, when Sears spun off the remaining 80 percent stake in the company, distributing 350.5 million shares of Allstate stock to its stockholders.[7]
In 1993, Allstate went public when Sears sells 19.8% of the company. At the time, it was the largest IPO to date.
In 1996, their website www.allstate.com was launched.
In 1999, Allstate unveiled a new business model that created a single contract for exclusive, independent agents selling Allstate insurance. It also created a network of call centers.
In 1999, Allstate purchased the personal lines division of CNA Financial[12] and subsequently renamed it to Encompass Insurance Company which is written by independent insurance agents, as opposed to the direct writing that constitutes the core part of its business.[13]
In 2003, actor Dennis Haysbert became Allstate’s spokesman, using the tagline "That’s Allstate’s stand."[14]
In 2010 the actor Dean Winters became a part of Allstate’s campaign "Mayhem" “personifying the pitfalls, like collisions and storm damage, that can befall drivers”.
In 2012 Allstate Solutions Private Limited (also called Allstate India) was inaugurated in Bangalore which is a technology and operations centre to provides software development and business process outsourcing services to its US parent. [15] Allstate's Bangalore operation is focused on the areas of business intelligence, analytics, testing and mobility.

Advertising[edit]
"Good hands"[edit]
Allstate's slogan "You're in good hands" was created in the 1950s by Allstate Insurance Company's sales executive, Davis W. Ellis based on a similar phrase he used to reassure his wife about a doctor caring for their child. It has been the slogan ever since 1950. Allstate also referred to themselves as the Good Hands People.
In the 1960s and 1970s, TV, print and radio advertising featured Allstate’s spokesman, Ed Reimers. Reimers was often shown making the cupped-hand gesture. For 22 years, he remained the spokesman.[17]
A study in 2000 by Northwestern University's Medill Graduate Department of Integrated Marketing Communications found that the Allstate slogan "You're in good hands" ranked as the most recognizable in America.[18]
"Allstate’s stand"[edit]
Beginning in 2003, as policy growth slowed, Allstate’s television commercials used spokesman Dennis Haysbert. The ads were intended to carry the message that Allstate's service was superior to that from low-cost providers Geico and Progressive.[19] Haysbert appeared in more than 250 commercials between 2003 and 2016.
Mayhem[edit]
Beginning in 2010, Allstate used Dean Winters as "Mayhem", mean to personify the hazards drivers face. The ads conclude with Haysbert asking "Are You In Good Hands?"[20]
Social media[edit]
In January 2011, Allstate released The Lines,[21] a multi-episode TV drama web series starring actors Teresa Cesario, Kyle Sandgate-Blix, Jackson Schultz, Bridgette Pechman, Chase Maser, and Corey Doyle cast as High-School seniors. The series, filmed in the style of a television drama, depicts the cast in common situations facing teens with respect to driving (Texting while driving in particular). The series appears aimed at promoting interest and support in favor of responsible teen driving and road-safety in general. The Lines spans a total of 8 episodes, each 6–8 minutes in length. Allstate and other large corporations are attracted to the rapid growth of social media for use in their advertising campaigns.

Since 2007, Allstate has been the title sponsor of the Sugar Bowl, one of the four games that make up the Bowl Championship Series. The game is played at the Louisiana Superdome, which is also the home of the New Orleans Saints. Allstate is also a sponsor of the New Orleans Saints.
The 2012 Allstate BCS National Championship Game was played on January 9, 2012 and broadcast on ESPN.
Allstate Wrigleyville Classic[edit]
The Northwestern Wildcats and the Illinois Fighting Illini played a collegiate football game at Wrigley Field on November 20, 2010. It was the first football game at Wrigley Field since 1970 and the first collegiate football game at Wrigley Field since 1938 when DePaul University played its regular games at Wrigley.[9] Allstate title sponsored this game.[25]
Allstate AFCA Good Works Team[edit]
Allstate advertises through the American Football Coaches Association "Good Works Team" in which local Allstate agents surprise players with trophies in key Allstate marketing regions.

Allstate was a sponsor of the Allstate 400 at the Brickyard from 2005-2009 – the annual NASCAR Sprint Cup Series race held at Indianapolis Motor Speedway in late summer.[27] Driver Kasey Kahne was featured in advertisements.

Allstate has a Sustainability Leadership Team composed of officers and senior staff from all areas of the company. The team focuses on sustainability efforts from a company-wide perspective — including environmental initiatives that embed “green” programs and processes throughout their operations.[29]
Criticism[edit]
In July 2008, the American Association for Justice ranked Allstate No. 1 among nation's worst insurers. This ranking was given because: “While Allstate publicly touts its ‘good hands’ approach, it has instead privately instructed its agents to employ a ‘boxing gloves’ strategy against its policyholders,” said American Association for Justice CEO Jon Haber. They've since revamped their approach.[30] Allstate criticized the report, with a spokesman noting that "The personal injury lawyers behind this report provide no support for their statements other than decade old recycled allegations that have been shown to be without merit in courts of law." [31] In 2009 Allstate successfully fought to obtain Federal government TARP fund eligibility only to decline it once they obtained eligibility.[32]
Auto insurance claims[edit]
An investigative report in February 2007 by CNN found that major car insurance companies, like Allstate, are increasingly fighting auto insurance claims from those who incurred injuries by their insured members.[33] Allstate currently commands 18% of the auto insurance market in the United States.[34]
Homeowners claims[edit]
The PBS television program Now,[35] in conjunction with Bloomberg Markets magazine, did an exposé regarding Allstate and other major insurers' homeowners insurance policies.
Catastrophe exposure management[edit]
Allstate has stated intentions of reducing its exposure in hurricane-prone Florida. In November 2006, Allstate did not renew 120,000 policies that were expiring at that time. Governor Charlie Crist and the Florida Cabinet passed a 90-day emergency order to temporarily prevent insurance companies from nonrenewing policies.[36] On February 20, 2007, Florida Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty clarified the order, stating that insurance companies can nonrenew policies if they satisfy certain conditions, including filing new, lower rates with the state and give customers 100 days’ notice.[37]
From Good Hands to Boxing Gloves[edit]
This is the title of a book written by David Berardinelli, JD;, Michael Freeman, PhD, DC, MPH; and Aaron DeShaw, DC, JD with a foreword by Eugene R. Anderson.[38]
The book relates profit-boosting strategies that consulting firm McKinsey & Company presented to Allstate to maximize profits and diminish the amount of money sent to clients who put in a claim. McKinsey specializes in redesigning product delivery systems for Fortune 100 companies (including controversial clients such as Enron) to maximize profits. McKinsey’s recommendation to Allstate, according to Berardinelli, was to low-ball claims so that desperate customers in dire straits would be more likely to accept a settlement offer while Allstate continued to make a profit and collect interest on the insurance payment. Allstate would offer its "good hands" in the way of a low-ball claim and, if the customer did not accept, to get out "boxing gloves." [39]
The book was reviewed by Business Week magazine.[40] According to that article, Allstate responded to Berardinelli's allegations by claiming that Berardinelli's allegations were "unfounded and unproven." Rather than trying to cheat customers, the company stated that its major goal was to benefit policyholders by identifying "exaggerated and fraudulent claims" and that its "processes are absolutely sound . . . to investigate, evaluate, and promptly resolve each claim fairly, based on the merits."[40]
Court decisions on the issues debated by Berardinelli and Allstate have gone both ways. According to the Business Week article, as of 2006, "Courts and regulators in a number of states, including New York, Pennsylvania, and Washington, have forced Allstate to halt or change its practice of handing out a controversial 'Do I Need an Attorney?' form to people involved in accidents." On the other hand, the article also states that "Although plaintiffs have had piecemeal success in bad-faith cases against Allstate, the insurer points to seven court rulings that have rejected attacks on CCPR. Last December a Montana state court noted that while CCPR practices may be illegal 'if misapplied in a particular case, they nevertheless are neutral with no manifestly illegal purpose.'" While many of the cost-reduction strategies McKinsey recommended at Allstate remain in place, some have been reined in following legal and regulatory challenges in several states.[40]
Use of Colossus[edit]
Many criticisms leveled against Allstate (and other insurers), including Barardinelli's book, involved the use of a software program called "Colossus" to process claims. In 2010, Allstate paid a $10 million fine to settle a lawsuit brought by 41 states concerning inconsistencies in the manner in which Colossus was used. It also agreed to standardize its use of the software. However, “it is important to note that we found no systemic underpayment of bodily injury claims,” New York Insurance Superintendent James J. Wrynn said in a press release.[41]

^ In some cases, Allstate proposed settlement amounts as small as $50, asking claimants to "take it or leave it". The investigative report found that insurance companies often make it so expensive and time consuming to go to court to get full settlement amounts, that it would not be worth the victims time. The claims handled in the matter were very minor collision type losses that did not result in any ($0) damage to the car, and therefore was the insurance company protecting it assets and the premium paying public money, by keeping rates as low as possible."Auto insurers play hardball in minor-crash claims".

History[edit]
In 1925, Sears held a national contest to decide the name of a new brand of car tires. After over two million name submissions, "Allstate" was chosen as the winner; the trademark was adopted the very next year. The tires' success in both the catalog and retail stores prompted Sears Chairman General Robert E. Wood to praise the Allstate tire's contribution to Sears' retail store success.[1]
The idea for Allstate Insurance Company came during a bridge game on a commuter train in 1930, when insurance broker Carl L. Odell proposed to Wood, his neighbor, the idea of selling auto insurance by direct mail. The idea appealed to Wood, and he passed the proposal to the Sears board of directors, which approved it. Allstate Insurance Company, named after Sears’ tire brand, went into business on April 17, 1931, offering auto insurance by direct mail and through the Sears catalog.[7] This was in line with one of the objectives of a company to sell automobile insurance in the same manner as Sears sold its merchandise.[8]
Lessing J. Rosenwald was Allstate's first board chairman, and Odell was named vice president and secretary.[9]
In 1933, at the Century of Progress World’s Fair in Chicago, Allstate’s Richard E. Roskam sold insurance at a booth in the Sears pavilion. In 1934, Allstate opened its first permanent sales office in a Chicago Sears store.[10]
In 1941, only about a quarter of U.S. drivers had auto liability insurance. This led to the state of New York passing a law which established the financial responsibility of drivers for damage or injuries resulting from auto mishaps. That law inspired legislation in other states, and by the mid-1950s nearly every state had some sort of financial responsibility law on its books.[7]
In 1949 the Allstate Headquarters Building was completed at 3245 W. Arthington Street in Chicago.[11] The mid-rise building is currently vacant (as of 2013) and in danger of demolition. The building is noted for its early post-war mid-rise construction. This location was vacated at some point when the company relocated in the post-war years.
The company’s "You're in Good Hands with Allstate" slogan was created in 1950 by Allstate’s general sales manager Davis W. Ellis. At the end of the decade, it was used in the company's first network television advertising campaign, which featured actor Ed Reimers.[9]
Allstate added products throughout the 1950s, including fire insurance in 1954 and homeowners and life insurance in 1957. Allstate began selling insurance to Canadians in 1953. Allstate Insurance Company of Canada was incorporated in 1964.[7] (In 1952 and 1953, Sears also sold an automobile called Allstate.)
In 1967, the company's home office was moved from Skokie to Northbrook, Illinois. Allstate continued to sell additional types of insurance to customers throughout the decade, including worker's compensation insurance in 1964, surety bonds in 1966, inland-marine coverage in 1967 and a business package policy in 1969.[9]
The brand itself expanded in the 1950s and 1960s and could be found on a variety of products like fire extinguishers and motor scooters. In 1952, an Allstate car was produced, but it was a flop; it was pulled from stores by 1953. The Allstate brand was eventually limited to insurance, tires, and car batteries by the late 1960s before becoming insurance-only in the mid-1970s.[1] In 1991, the company went public[4] before becoming completely independent in 1995.[1]
In 1984, Neighborhood Office Agent program was introduced to make agents more accessible to customers
In 1985, Allstate began to move agents out of Sears stores and locate agents in neighborhood offices. In June 1993, 19.8 percent of Allstate became public through a stock offering. Allstate became completely independent in June 1995, when Sears spun off the remaining 80 percent stake in the company, distributing 350.5 million shares of Allstate stock to its stockholders.[7]
In 1993, Allstate went public when Sears sells 19.8% of the company. At the time, it was the largest IPO to date.
In 1996, their website www.allstate.com was launched.
In 1999, Allstate unveiled a new business model that created a single contract for exclusive, independent agents selling Allstate insurance. It also created a network of call centers.
In 1999, Allstate purchased the personal lines division of CNA Financial[12] and subsequently renamed it to Encompass Insurance Company which is written by independent insurance agents, as opposed to the direct writing that constitutes the core part of its business.[13]
In 2003, actor Dennis Haysbert became Allstate’s spokesman, using the tagline "That’s Allstate’s stand."[14]
In 2010 the actor Dean Winters became a part of Allstate’s campaign "Mayhem" “personifying the pitfalls, like collisions and storm damage, that can befall drivers”.
In 2012 Allstate Solutions Private Limited (also called Allstate India) was inaugurated in Bangalore which is a technology and operations centre to provides software development and business process outsourcing services to its US parent. [15] Allstate's Bangalore operation is focused on the areas of business intelligence, analytics, testing and mobility.

Advertising[edit]
"Good hands"[edit]
Allstate's slogan "You're in good hands" was created in the 1950s by Allstate Insurance Company's sales executive, Davis W. Ellis based on a similar phrase he used to reassure his wife about a doctor caring for their child. It has been the slogan ever since 1950. Allstate also referred to themselves as the Good Hands People.
In the 1960s and 1970s, TV, print and radio advertising featured Allstate’s spokesman, Ed Reimers. Reimers was often shown making the cupped-hand gesture. For 22 years, he remained the spokesman.[17]
A study in 2000 by Northwestern University's Medill Graduate Department of Integrated Marketing Communications found that the Allstate slogan "You're in good hands" ranked as the most recognizable in America.[18]
"Allstate’s stand"[edit]
Beginning in 2003, as policy growth slowed, Allstate’s television commercials used spokesman Dennis Haysbert. The ads were intended to carry the message that Allstate's service was superior to that from low-cost providers Geico and Progressive.[19] Haysbert appeared in more than 250 commercials between 2003 and 2016.
Mayhem[edit]
Beginning in 2010, Allstate used Dean Winters as "Mayhem", mean to personify the hazards drivers face. The ads conclude with Haysbert asking "Are You In Good Hands?"[20]
Social media[edit]
In January 2011, Allstate released The Lines,[21] a multi-episode TV drama web series starring actors Teresa Cesario, Kyle Sandgate-Blix, Jackson Schultz, Bridgette Pechman, Chase Maser, and Corey Doyle cast as High-School seniors. The series, filmed in the style of a television drama, depicts the cast in common situations facing teens with respect to driving (Texting while driving in particular). The series appears aimed at promoting interest and support in favor of responsible teen driving and road-safety in general. The Lines spans a total of 8 episodes, each 6–8 minutes in length. Allstate and other large corporations are attracted to the rapid growth of social media for use in their advertising campaigns.

Criticism[edit]
In July 2008, the American Association for Justice ranked Allstate No. 1 among nation's worst insurers. This ranking was given because: “While Allstate publicly touts its ‘good hands’ approach, it has instead privately instructed its agents to employ a ‘boxing gloves’ strategy against its policyholders,” said American Association for Justice CEO Jon Haber. They've since revamped their approach.[30] Allstate criticized the report, with a spokesman noting that "The personal injury lawyers behind this report provide no support for their statements other than decade old recycled allegations that have been shown to be without merit in courts of law." [31] In 2009 Allstate successfully fought to obtain Federal government TARP fund eligibility only to decline it once they obtained eligibility.[32]
Auto insurance claims[edit]
An investigative report in February 2007 by CNN found that major car insurance companies, like Allstate, are increasingly fighting auto insurance claims from those who incurred injuries by their insured members.[33] Allstate currently commands 18% of the auto insurance market in the United States.[34]
Homeowners claims[edit]
The PBS television program Now,[35] in conjunction with Bloomberg Markets magazine, did an exposé regarding Allstate and other major insurers' homeowners insurance policies.
Catastrophe exposure management[edit]
Allstate has stated intentions of reducing its exposure in hurricane-prone Florida. In November 2006, Allstate did not renew 120,000 policies that were expiring at that time. Governor Charlie Crist and the Florida Cabinet passed a 90-day emergency order to temporarily prevent insurance companies from nonrenewing policies.[36] On February 20, 2007, Florida Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty clarified the order, stating that insurance companies can nonrenew policies if they satisfy certain conditions, including filing new, lower rates with the state and give customers 100 days’ notice.[37]
From Good Hands to Boxing Gloves[edit]
This is the title of a book written by David Berardinelli, JD;, Michael Freeman, PhD, DC, MPH; and Aaron DeShaw, DC, JD with a foreword by Eugene R. Anderson.[38]
The book relates profit-boosting strategies that consulting firm McKinsey & Company presented to Allstate to maximize profits and diminish the amount of money sent to clients who put in a claim. McKinsey specializes in redesigning product delivery systems for Fortune 100 companies (including controversial clients such as Enron) to maximize profits. McKinsey’s recommendation to Allstate, according to Berardinelli, was to low-ball claims so that desperate customers in dire straits would be more likely to accept a settlement offer while Allstate continued to make a profit and collect interest on the insurance payment. Allstate would offer its "good hands" in the way of a low-ball claim and, if the customer did not accept, to get out "boxing gloves." [39]
The book was reviewed by Business Week magazine.[40] According to that article, Allstate responded to Berardinelli's allegations by claiming that Berardinelli's allegations were "unfounded and unproven." Rather than trying to cheat customers, the company stated that its major goal was to benefit policyholders by identifying "exaggerated and fraudulent claims" and that its "processes are absolutely sound . . . to investigate, evaluate, and promptly resolve each claim fairly, based on the merits."[40]
Court decisions on the issues debated by Berardinelli and Allstate have gone both ways. According to the Business Week article, as of 2006, "Courts and regulators in a number of states, including New York, Pennsylvania, and Washington, have forced Allstate to halt or change its practice of handing out a controversial 'Do I Need an Attorney?' form to people involved in accidents." On the other hand, the article also states that "Although plaintiffs have had piecemeal success in bad-faith cases against Allstate, the insurer points to seven court rulings that have rejected attacks on CCPR. Last December a Montana state court noted that while CCPR practices may be illegal 'if misapplied in a particular case, they nevertheless are neutral with no manifestly illegal purpose.'" While many of the cost-reduction strategies McKinsey recommended at Allstate remain in place, some have been reined in following legal and regulatory challenges in several states.[40]
Use of Colossus[edit]
Many criticisms leveled against Allstate (and other insurers), including Barardinelli's book, involved the use of a software program called "Colossus" to process claims. In 2010, Allstate paid a $10 million fine to settle a lawsuit brought by 41 states concerning inconsistencies in the manner in which Colossus was used. It also agreed to standardize its use of the software. However, “it is important to note that we found no systemic underpayment of bodily injury claims,” New York Insurance Superintendent James J. Wrynn said in a press release.[41]

The investigative report found that insurance companies often make it so expensive and time consuming to go to court to get full settlement amounts, that it would not be worth the victims time. The claims handled in the matter were very minor collision type losses that did not result in any ($0) damage to the car, and therefore was the insurance company protecting it assets and the premium paying public money, by keeping rates as low as possible."Auto insurers play hardball in minor-crash claims".

The corporate spokesperson is Dennis Haysbert.

History[edit]
In 1925, Sears held a national contest to decide the name of a new brand of car tires. After over two million name submissions, "Allstate" was chosen as the winner; the trademark was adopted the very next year. The tires' success in both the catalog and retail stores prompted Sears Chairman General Robert E. Wood to praise the Allstate tire's contribution to Sears' retail store success.[1]
The idea for Allstate Insurance Company came during a bridge game on a commuter train in 1930, when insurance broker Carl L. Odell proposed to Wood, his neighbor, the idea of selling auto insurance by direct mail. The idea appealed to Wood, and he passed the proposal to the Sears board of directors, which approved it. Allstate Insurance Company, named after Sears’ tire brand, went into business on April 17, 1931, offering auto insurance by direct mail and through the Sears catalog.[7] This was in line with one of the objectives of a company to sell automobile insurance in the same manner as Sears sold its merchandise.[8]
Lessing J. Rosenwald was Allstate's first board chairman, and Odell was named vice president and secretary.[9]
In 1933, at the Century of Progress World’s Fair in Chicago, Allstate’s Richard E. Roskam sold insurance at a booth in the Sears pavilion. In 1934, Allstate opened its first permanent sales office in a Chicago Sears store.[10]
In 1941, only about a quarter of U.S. drivers had auto liability insurance. This led to the state of New York passing a law which established the financial responsibility of drivers for damage or injuries resulting from auto mishaps. That law inspired legislation in other states, and by the mid-1950s nearly every state had some sort of financial responsibility law on its books.[7]
In 1949 the Allstate Headquarters Building was completed at 3245 W. Arthington Street in Chicago.[11] The mid-rise building is currently vacant (as of 2013) and in danger of demolition. The building is noted for its early post-war mid-rise construction. This location was vacated at some point when the company relocated in the post-war years.
The company’s "You're in Good Hands with Allstate" slogan was created in 1950 by Allstate’s general sales manager Davis W. Ellis. At the end of the decade, it was used in the company's first network television advertising campaign, which featured actor Ed Reimers.[9]
Allstate added products throughout the 1950s, including fire insurance in 1954 and homeowners and life insurance in 1957. Allstate began selling insurance to Canadians in 1953. Allstate Insurance Company of Canada was incorporated in 1964.[7] (In 1952 and 1953, Sears also sold an automobile called Allstate.)
In 1967, the company's home office was moved from Skokie to Northbrook, Illinois. Allstate continued to sell additional types of insurance to customers throughout the decade, including worker's compensation insurance in 1964, surety bonds in 1966, inland-marine coverage in 1967 and a business package policy in 1969.[9]
The brand itself expanded in the 1950s and 1960s and could be found on a variety of products like fire extinguishers and motor scooters. In 1952, an Allstate car was produced, but it was a flop; it was pulled from stores by 1953. The Allstate brand was eventually limited to insurance, tires, and car batteries by the late 1960s before becoming insurance-only in the mid-1970s.[1] In 1991, the company went public[4] before becoming completely independent in 1995.[1]
In 1984, Neighborhood Office Agent program was introduced to make agents more accessible to customers
In 1985, Allstate began to move agents out of Sears stores and locate agents in neighborhood offices. In June 1993, 19.8 percent of Allstate became public through a stock offering. Allstate became completely independent in June 1995, when Sears spun off the remaining 80 percent stake in the company, distributing 350.5 million shares of Allstate stock to its stockholders.[7]
In 1993, Allstate went public when Sears sells 19.8% of the company. At the time, it was the largest IPO to date.
In 1996, their website www.allstate.com was launched.
In 1999, Allstate unveiled a new business model that created a single contract for exclusive, independent agents selling Allstate insurance. It also created a network of call centers.
In 1999, Allstate purchased the personal lines division of CNA Financial[12] and subsequently renamed it to Encompass Insurance Company which is written by independent insurance agents, as opposed to the direct writing that constitutes the core part of its business.[13]
In 2003, actor Dennis Haysbert became Allstate’s spokesman, using the tagline "That’s Allstate’s stand."[14]
In 2010 the actor Dean Winters became a part of Allstate’s campaign "Mayhem" “personifying the pitfalls, like collisions and storm damage, that can befall drivers”.
In 2012 Allstate Solutions Private Limited (also called Allstate India) was inaugurated in Bangalore which is a technology and operations centre to provides software development and business process outsourcing services to its US parent. [15] Allstate's Bangalore operation is focused on the areas of business intelligence, analytics, testing and mobility.

Advertising[edit]
"Good hands"[edit]
Allstate's slogan "You're in good hands" was created in the 1950s by Allstate Insurance Company's sales executive, Davis W. Ellis based on a similar phrase he used to reassure his wife about a doctor caring for their child. It has been the slogan ever since 1950. Allstate also referred to themselves as the Good Hands People.
In the 1960s and 1970s, TV, print and radio advertising featured Allstate’s spokesman, Ed Reimers. Reimers was often shown making the cupped-hand gesture. For 22 years, he remained the spokesman.[17]
A study in 2000 by Northwestern University's Medill Graduate Department of Integrated Marketing Communications found that the Allstate slogan "You're in good hands" ranked as the most recognizable in America.[18]
"Allstate’s stand"[edit]
Beginning in 2003, as policy growth slowed, Allstate’s television commercials used spokesman Dennis Haysbert. The ads were intended to carry the message that Allstate's service was superior to that from low-cost providers Geico and Progressive.[19] Haysbert appeared in more than 250 commercials between 2003 and 2016.
Mayhem[edit]
Beginning in 2010, Allstate used Dean Winters as "Mayhem", mean to personify the hazards drivers face. The ads conclude with Haysbert asking "Are You In Good Hands?"[20]
Social media[edit]
In January 2011, Allstate released The Lines,[21] a multi-episode TV drama web series starring actors Teresa Cesario, Kyle Sandgate-Blix, Jackson Schultz, Bridgette Pechman, Chase Maser, and Corey Doyle cast as High-School seniors. The series, filmed in the style of a television drama, depicts the cast in common situations facing teens with respect to driving (Texting while driving in particular). The series appears aimed at promoting interest and support in favor of responsible teen driving and road-safety in general. The Lines spans a total of 8 episodes, each 6–8 minutes in length. Allstate and other large corporations are attracted to the rapid growth of social media for use in their advertising campaigns.

Environmental record[edit]
Allstate has a Sustainability Leadership Team composed of officers and senior staff from all areas of the company. The team focuses on sustainability efforts from a company-wide perspective — including environmental initiatives that embed “green” programs and processes throughout their operations.[29]
Criticism[edit]
In July 2008, the American Association for Justice ranked Allstate No. 1 among nation's worst insurers. This ranking was given because: “While Allstate publicly touts its ‘good hands’ approach, it has instead privately instructed its agents to employ a ‘boxing gloves’ strategy against its policyholders,” said American Association for Justice CEO Jon Haber. They've since revamped their approach.[30] Allstate criticized the report, with a spokesman noting that "The personal injury lawyers behind this report provide no support for their statements other than decade old recycled allegations that have been shown to be without merit in courts of law." [31] In 2009 Allstate successfully fought to obtain Federal government TARP fund eligibility only to decline it once they obtained eligibility.[32]
Auto insurance claims[edit]
An investigative report in February 2007 by CNN found that major car insurance companies, like Allstate, are increasingly fighting auto insurance claims from those who incurred injuries by their insured members.[33] Allstate currently commands 18% of the auto insurance market in the United States.[34]
Homeowners claims[edit]
The PBS television program Now,[35] in conjunction with Bloomberg Markets magazine, did an exposé regarding Allstate and other major insurers' homeowners insurance policies.
Catastrophe exposure management[edit]
Allstate has stated intentions of reducing its exposure in hurricane-prone Florida. In November 2006, Allstate did not renew 120,000 policies that were expiring at that time. Governor Charlie Crist and the Florida Cabinet passed a 90-day emergency order to temporarily prevent insurance companies from nonrenewing policies.[36] On February 20, 2007, Florida Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty clarified the order, stating that insurance companies can nonrenew policies if they satisfy certain conditions, including filing new, lower rates with the state and give customers 100 days’ notice.[37]
From Good Hands to Boxing Gloves[edit]
This is the title of a book written by David Berardinelli, JD;, Michael Freeman, PhD, DC, MPH; and Aaron DeShaw, DC, JD with a foreword by Eugene R. Anderson.[38]
The book relates profit-boosting strategies that consulting firm McKinsey & Company presented to Allstate to maximize profits and diminish the amount of money sent to clients who put in a claim. McKinsey specializes in redesigning product delivery systems for Fortune 100 companies (including controversial clients such as Enron) to maximize profits. McKinsey’s recommendation to Allstate, according to Berardinelli, was to low-ball claims so that desperate customers in dire straits would be more likely to accept a settlement offer while Allstate continued to make a profit and collect interest on the insurance payment. Allstate would offer its "good hands" in the way of a low-ball claim and, if the customer did not accept, to get out "boxing gloves." [39]
The book was reviewed by Business Week magazine.[40] According to that article, Allstate responded to Berardinelli's allegations by claiming that Berardinelli's allegations were "unfounded and unproven." Rather than trying to cheat customers, the company stated that its major goal was to benefit policyholders by identifying "exaggerated and fraudulent claims" and that its "processes are absolutely sound . . . to investigate, evaluate, and promptly resolve each claim fairly, based on the merits."[40]
Court decisions on the issues debated by Berardinelli and Allstate have gone both ways. According to the Business Week article, as of 2006, "Courts and regulators in a number of states, including New York, Pennsylvania, and Washington, have forced Allstate to halt or change its practice of handing out a controversial 'Do I Need an Attorney?' form to people involved in accidents." On the other hand, the article also states that "Although plaintiffs have had piecemeal success in bad-faith cases against Allstate, the insurer points to seven court rulings that have rejected attacks on CCPR. Last December a Montana state court noted that while CCPR practices may be illegal 'if misapplied in a particular case, they nevertheless are neutral with no manifestly illegal purpose.'" While many of the cost-reduction strategies McKinsey recommended at Allstate remain in place, some have been reined in following legal and regulatory challenges in several states.[40]
Use of Colossus[edit]
Many criticisms leveled against Allstate (and other insurers), including Barardinelli's book, involved the use of a software program called "Colossus" to process claims. In 2010, Allstate paid a $10 million fine to settle a lawsuit brought by 41 states concerning inconsistencies in the manner in which Colossus was used. It also agreed to standardize its use of the software. However, “it is important to note that we found no systemic underpayment of bodily injury claims,” New York Insurance Superintendent James J. Wrynn said in a press release.[41]

^ In some cases, Allstate proposed settlement amounts as small as $50, asking claimants to "take it or leave it". The investigative report found that insurance companies often make it so expensive and time consuming to go to court to get full settlement amounts, that it would not be worth the victims time. The claims handled in the matter were very minor collision type losses that did not result in any ($0) damage to the car, and therefore was the insurance company protecting it assets and the premium paying public money, by keeping rates as low as possible."Auto insurers play hardball in minor-crash claims".

History[edit]
In 1925, Sears held a national contest to decide the name of a new brand of car tires. After over two million name submissions, "Allstate" was chosen as the winner; the trademark was adopted the very next year. The tires' success in both the catalog and retail stores prompted Sears Chairman General Robert E. Wood to praise the Allstate tire's contribution to Sears' retail store success.[1]
The idea for Allstate Insurance Company came during a bridge game on a commuter train in 1930, when insurance broker Carl L. Odell proposed to Wood, his neighbor, the idea of selling auto insurance by direct mail. The idea appealed to Wood, and he passed the proposal to the Sears board of directors, which approved it. Allstate Insurance Company, named after Sears’ tire brand, went into business on April 17, 1931, offering auto insurance by direct mail and through the Sears catalog.[7] This was in line with one of the objectives of a company to sell automobile insurance in the same manner as Sears sold its merchandise.[8]
Lessing J. Rosenwald was Allstate's first board chairman, and Odell was named vice president and secretary.[9]
In 1933, at the Century of Progress World’s Fair in Chicago, Allstate’s Richard E. Roskam sold insurance at a booth in the Sears pavilion. In 1934, Allstate opened its first permanent sales office in a Chicago Sears store.[10]
In 1941, only about a quarter of U.S. drivers had auto liability insurance. This led to the state of New York passing a law which established the financial responsibility of drivers for damage or injuries resulting from auto mishaps. That law inspired legislation in other states, and by the mid-1950s nearly every state had some sort of financial responsibility law on its books.[7]
In 1949 the Allstate Headquarters Building was completed at 3245 W. Arthington Street in Chicago.[11] The mid-rise building is currently vacant (as of 2013) and in danger of demolition. The building is noted for its early post-war mid-rise construction. This location was vacated at some point when the company relocated in the post-war years.
The company’s "You're in Good Hands with Allstate" slogan was created in 1950 by Allstate’s general sales manager Davis W. Ellis. At the end of the decade, it was used in the company's first network television advertising campaign, which featured actor Ed Reimers.[9]
Allstate added products throughout the 1950s, including fire insurance in 1954 and homeowners and life insurance in 1957. Allstate began selling insurance to Canadians in 1953. Allstate Insurance Company of Canada was incorporated in 1964.[7] (In 1952 and 1953, Sears also sold an automobile called Allstate.)
In 1967, the company's home office was moved from Skokie to Northbrook, Illinois. Allstate continued to sell additional types of insurance to customers throughout the decade, including worker's compensation insurance in 1964, surety bonds in 1966, inland-marine coverage in 1967 and a business package policy in 1969.[9]
The brand itself expanded in the 1950s and 1960s and could be found on a variety of products like fire extinguishers and motor scooters. In 1952, an Allstate car was produced, but it was a flop; it was pulled from stores by 1953. The Allstate brand was eventually limited to insurance, tires, and car batteries by the late 1960s before becoming insurance-only in the mid-1970s.[1] In 1991, the company went public[4] before becoming completely independent in 1995.[1]
In 1984, Neighborhood Office Agent program was introduced to make agents more accessible to customers
In 1985, Allstate began to move agents out of Sears stores and locate agents in neighborhood offices. In June 1993, 19.8 percent of Allstate became public through a stock offering. Allstate became completely independent in June 1995, when Sears spun off the remaining 80 percent stake in the company, distributing 350.5 million shares of Allstate stock to its stockholders.[7]
In 1993, Allstate went public when Sears sells 19.8% of the company. At the time, it was the largest IPO to date.
In 1996, their website www.allstate.com was launched.
In 1999, Allstate unveiled a new business model that created a single contract for exclusive, independent agents selling Allstate insurance. It also created a network of call centers.
In 1999, Allstate purchased the personal lines division of CNA Financial[12] and subsequently renamed it to Encompass Insurance Company which is written by independent insurance agents, as opposed to the direct writing that constitutes the core part of its business.[13]
In 2003, actor Dennis Haysbert became Allstate’s spokesman, using the tagline "That’s Allstate’s stand."[14]
In 2010 the actor Dean Winters became a part of Allstate’s campaign "Mayhem" “personifying the pitfalls, like collisions and storm damage, that can befall drivers”.
In 2012 Allstate Solutions Private Limited (also called Allstate India) was inaugurated in Bangalore which is a technology and operations centre to provides software development and business process outsourcing services to its US parent. [15] Allstate's Bangalore operation is focused on the areas of business intelligence, analytics, testing and mobility.

Advertising[edit]
"Good hands"[edit]
Allstate's slogan "You're in good hands" was created in the 1950s by Allstate Insurance Company's sales executive, Davis W. Ellis based on a similar phrase he used to reassure his wife about a doctor caring for their child. It has been the slogan ever since 1950. Allstate also referred to themselves as the Good Hands People.
In the 1960s and 1970s, TV, print and radio advertising featured Allstate’s spokesman, Ed Reimers. Reimers was often shown making the cupped-hand gesture. For 22 years, he remained the spokesman.[17]
A study in 2000 by Northwestern University's Medill Graduate Department of Integrated Marketing Communications found that the Allstate slogan "You're in good hands" ranked as the most recognizable in America.[18]
"Allstate’s stand"[edit]
Beginning in 2003, as policy growth slowed, Allstate’s television commercials used spokesman Dennis Haysbert. The ads were intended to carry the message that Allstate's service was superior to that from low-cost providers Geico and Progressive.[19] Haysbert appeared in more than 250 commercials between 2003 and 2016.
Mayhem[edit]
Beginning in 2010, Allstate used Dean Winters as "Mayhem", mean to personify the hazards drivers face. The ads conclude with Haysbert asking "Are You In Good Hands?"[20]
Social media[edit]
In January 2011, Allstate released The Lines,[21] a multi-episode TV drama web series starring actors Teresa Cesario, Kyle Sandgate-Blix, Jackson Schultz, Bridgette Pechman, Chase Maser, and Corey Doyle cast as High-School seniors. The series, filmed in the style of a television drama, depicts the cast in common situations facing teens with respect to driving (Texting while driving in particular). The series appears aimed at promoting interest and support in favor of responsible teen driving and road-safety in general. The Lines spans a total of 8 episodes, each 6–8 minutes in length. Allstate and other large corporations are attracted to the rapid growth of social media for use in their advertising campaigns.

Allstate has a Sustainability Leadership Team composed of officers and senior staff from all areas of the company. The team focuses on sustainability efforts from a company-wide perspective — including environmental initiatives that embed “green” programs and processes throughout their operations.[29]
Criticism[edit]
In July 2008, the American Association for Justice ranked Allstate No. 1 among nation's worst insurers. This ranking was given because: “While Allstate publicly touts its ‘good hands’ approach, it has instead privately instructed its agents to employ a ‘boxing gloves’ strategy against its policyholders,” said American Association for Justice CEO Jon Haber. They've since revamped their approach.[30] Allstate criticized the report, with a spokesman noting that "The personal injury lawyers behind this report provide no support for their statements other than decade old recycled allegations that have been shown to be without merit in courts of law." [31] In 2009 Allstate successfully fought to obtain Federal government TARP fund eligibility only to decline it once they obtained eligibility.[32]
Auto insurance claims[edit]
An investigative report in February 2007 by CNN found that major car insurance companies, like Allstate, are increasingly fighting auto insurance claims from those who incurred injuries by their insured members.[33] Allstate currently commands 18% of the auto insurance market in the United States.[34]
Homeowners claims[edit]
The PBS television program Now,[35] in conjunction with Bloomberg Markets magazine, did an exposé regarding Allstate and other major insurers' homeowners insurance policies.
Catastrophe exposure management[edit]
Allstate has stated intentions of reducing its exposure in hurricane-prone Florida. In November 2006, Allstate did not renew 120,000 policies that were expiring at that time. Governor Charlie Crist and the Florida Cabinet passed a 90-day emergency order to temporarily prevent insurance companies from nonrenewing policies.[36] On February 20, 2007, Florida Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty clarified the order, stating that insurance companies can nonrenew policies if they satisfy certain conditions, including filing new, lower rates with the state and give customers 100 days’ notice.[37]
From Good Hands to Boxing Gloves[edit]
This is the title of a book written by David Berardinelli, JD;, Michael Freeman, PhD, DC, MPH; and Aaron DeShaw, DC, JD with a foreword by Eugene R. Anderson.[38]
The book relates profit-boosting strategies that consulting firm McKinsey & Company presented to Allstate to maximize profits and diminish the amount of money sent to clients who put in a claim. McKinsey specializes in redesigning product delivery systems for Fortune 100 companies (including controversial clients such as Enron) to maximize profits. McKinsey’s recommendation to Allstate, according to Berardinelli, was to low-ball claims so that desperate customers in dire straits would be more likely to accept a settlement offer while Allstate continued to make a profit and collect interest on the insurance payment. Allstate would offer its "good hands" in the way of a low-ball claim and, if the customer did not accept, to get out "boxing gloves." [39]
The book was reviewed by Business Week magazine.[40] According to that article, Allstate responded to Berardinelli's allegations by claiming that Berardinelli's allegations were "unfounded and unproven." Rather than trying to cheat customers, the company stated that its major goal was to benefit policyholders by identifying "exaggerated and fraudulent claims" and that its "processes are absolutely sound . . . to investigate, evaluate, and promptly resolve each claim fairly, based on the merits."[40]
Court decisions on the issues debated by Berardinelli and Allstate have gone both ways. According to the Business Week article, as of 2006, "Courts and regulators in a number of states, including New York, Pennsylvania, and Washington, have forced Allstate to halt or change its practice of handing out a controversial 'Do I Need an Attorney?' form to people involved in accidents." On the other hand, the article also states that "Although plaintiffs have had piecemeal success in bad-faith cases against Allstate, the insurer points to seven court rulings that have rejected attacks on CCPR. Last December a Montana state court noted that while CCPR practices may be illegal 'if misapplied in a particular case, they nevertheless are neutral with no manifestly illegal purpose.'" While many of the cost-reduction strategies McKinsey recommended at Allstate remain in place, some have been reined in following legal and regulatory challenges in several states.[40]
Use of Colossus[edit]
Many criticisms leveled against Allstate (and other insurers), including Barardinelli's book, involved the use of a software program called "Colossus" to process claims. In 2010, Allstate paid a $10 million fine to settle a lawsuit brought by 41 states concerning inconsistencies in the manner in which Colossus was used. It also agreed to standardize its use of the software. However, “it is important to note that we found no systemic underpayment of bodily injury claims,” New York Insurance Superintendent James J. Wrynn said in a press release.[41]

The investigative report found that insurance companies often make it so expensive and time consuming to go to court to get full settlement amounts, that it would not be worth the victims time. The claims handled in the matter were very minor collision type losses that did not result in any ($0) damage to the car, and therefore was the insurance company protecting it assets and the premium paying public money, by keeping rates as low as possible."Auto insurers play hardball in minor-crash claims".
