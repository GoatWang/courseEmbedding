Education and career[edit]
LeBow was born to a Jewish family,[2] the son of Suara and Martin LeBow.[3] His father was a life insurance salesman and his mother a teacher.[4][5] He graduated from West Philadelphia High School[5] and in 1960, earned a degree in electrical engineering from Drexel University.[5] LeBow then went on to graduate school at Princeton University. Before completing his degree, LeBow left Princeton and joined the army where he installed early data systems at the Pentagon.[5] LeBow's first foray into business occurred in the 1960s when he started a computer company to continue his Pentagon project. LeBow eventually sold the business in 1971 for a profit and became a full-time investor.[5] In 1980 he founded the investment holding company Brooke Group Ltd.[6] LeBow went on to purchase many companies including: Western Union, Information Displays, MAI Basic Four, Liggett Group, Brigham's Ice Cream,[5][7] and the trading card company, SkyBox International (which he sold to Marvel).[8][9] In 2000, Brooke Group Ltd. was renamed Vector Group Ltd.[6]
Cigarettes and litigation[edit]
In 1986, he purchased the 5th largest cigarette manufacturer in the United States,[6] the Liggett Group for $140 million.[2] In 1993, Lebow stated under sworn testimony that since cigarettes are a legal product and people choose to use them, whether or not that they cause cancer is irrelevant.[10] In 1996, while under his leadership, Liggett Group broke ranks with the rest of the US tobacco industry, including Philip Morris, Brown and Williamson, RJR Nabisco, Loews and Lorillard, when he announced that Liggett would settle the Medicaid tobacco suits brought by forty state attorneys general.[11] Liggett had previously been accused of being illegally influenced by Philip Morris which allegedly paid some of Liggett's legal bills in order to buy its cooperation in anti-tobacco lawsuits.[12] LeBow stated that the reason for the settlement was to obtain immunity for Liggett from future liabilities[4] and to prevent a future bankruptcy.[13] The settlement entailed that Liggett agree to pay $1 million in damages;[2] publicly announce that smoking is addictive and causes cancer; turn over long-secret tobacco industry documents; disclose ingredients in its cigarettes; and testify against the industry. Liggett was the first cigarette company to voluntarily put the label "Nicotine is Addictive" on their product.[13]
LeBow's actions were pivotal to the government in their signing of the Master Settlement Agreement. In addition to this, LeBow was honored with a proclamation by Florida Governor Lawton Chiles for his "invaluable assistance" in helping Florida achieve its historic $11.3 billion settlement with the tobacco industry.[14] Following this presentation, Lebow and Mr. Chiles addressed a group of students, who "saved their toughest questions for Liggett Group chief Bennett Lebow of Miami". One student asked, "If you want to be a watchdog of the industry, why not get out altogether and stop making cigarettes?" to which he responded that if he did, others would continue.[15] LeBow also developed, through Vector Tobacco Inc., the nicotine-free cigarette Quest (cigarette) which is a cigarette designed to help people quit smoking.[16] Also that year LeBow teamed up with corporate raider Carl Icahn to make a bid for RJR Nabisco. In response to this proposed spin-off of Nabisco from RJR Reynolds, tobacco industry analyst Ellen Barabas stated that "I think there are people who would support a spin-off of Nabisco, but not by Lebow. One of the prime factors was Lebows dubious reputation as a manager. In 1994 his shareholders sued him, claiming he had taken millions of dollars in improper loans; Lebow settled out of court." [17] According to court documents, Liggett, while under LeBow's leadership, "engage(d) in marketing tactics that appeal to youths, such as couponing, sampling, and “buy one get one free” offers for its cigarettes, and advertise(d) in magazines with substantial youth readership."[18]
Notable acquisitions[edit]
In 1987, Liggett bought a majority stake in Western Union which had a negative net worth of $200 million. The company, then renamed New Valley LLC, eventually filed for bankruptcy but was able to pay its bondholders in full via asset sales. Liggett later sold its remaining interest in Western Union Financial Services Inc for $1.2 billion earning it a $300 million profit.[19]
In May 2010, after a $25 million investment, he became a member of the Board of Directors at Borders Group Inc. and was immediately elected Chairman of the Board, replacing Mick McGuire, who resigned.[20] In June 2010, LeBow became CEO of Borders Group Inc.[21] In February 2011, Borders declared bankruptcy.[22][23]
LeBow is also Chairman of the Board of Vector Group, the holding company for Liggett Group, Vector Tobacco, New Valley LLC, and Douglas Elliman.
Philanthropy and political activity[edit]
LeBow is a large supporter of his alma mater, Drexel University. In 1998, Drexel's College of Business and Administration was named the Bennett S. LeBow College of Business in his honor after a contribution of $10 million to the university.[24] Further, he endowed the Bennett S. LeBow Engineering Center, a state-of-the-art facility that houses Drexel's College of Engineering. In November 2010, the 72-year-old West Philadelphia native contributed $45 million for the construction of a new facility for the LeBow College of Business — the 12th largest gift to any US business school, and the biggest ever to Drexel University.[25][26] In 2011, LeBow was named the nation's 23rd largest charitable donor by The Chronicle of Philanthropy for donating more than $49 million to charitable causes.[27]
In 2009, LeBow made a $10,000 campaign contribution to Manhattan District Attorney candidate Leslie Crocker Snyder, whose law firm - Kasowitz, Benson, Torres & Friedman - had represented the Liggett Group in smoking and health litigation since 1996.[28]
Criticism[edit]
LeBow has also been scrutinized a number of times for a variety of decisions and business dealings:

In 2005, LeBow resigned from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Board of Trustees shortly after his appointment over discussions about the propriety of associating with the owner of a company which sells products that are known to cause cancer.[29]
In 1993, Brooke Group Shareholder Frank Gyetvan sued LeBow on behalf of other company shareholders, claiming Brooke had improperly lent Lebow money for luxury personal items, such as a $21 million yacht. The suit was settled the following year, with LeBow repaying $16 million to Brooke's other shareholders and giving up his right to receive 6.25 million in preferred dividends .[30]
In 1989, LeBow was criticized for using $3 million to fly a planeload of friends to a London party for the launch of his 177-foot yacht. The trip came during the time LeBow controlled MAI Systems, an Irvine, Calif.-based computer network company, and Western Union. Both companies filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization in 1993."[31]
In 1984, LeBow completed the sale of Information Displays which subsequently went bankrupt. The buyer sued LeBow and his partners for fraud and misrepresentation.[32]
In the past, LeBow's business associations have come into question. In the book "Red Mafiya: How the Russian Mob Has Invaded America", the author states: "Ukrainian mob boss Vadim Rabinovich attended a Clinton-Gore fund raiser at the Sheraton Bal Harbor Hotel in Miami. Rabinovich came as a guest of Bennett S. LeBow, the Chairman of Brooke Group Ltd, Parent of Liggett, a cigarette manufacturing company (LeBow refused to comment)."[33] According to a spokesman for LeBow, LeBow's Brooke Group and Rabinovich developed a business center and luxury hotel in Kiev.[34]

Personal life[edit]
LeBow was married to Geraldine Cosher[35] whom he met while they were students, he was at Drexel and she attended Temple.[citation needed] They had two daughters.[5][7] Geraldine died in 2011.[35] They were married for 52 years.[citation needed]Bennett LeBow is currently married to Jacqueline Finkelstein-LeBow .

Education and career[edit]
LeBow was born to a Jewish family,[2] the son of Suara and Martin LeBow.[3] His father was a life insurance salesman and his mother a teacher.[4][5] He graduated from West Philadelphia High School[5] and in 1960, earned a degree in electrical engineering from Drexel University.[5] LeBow then went on to graduate school at Princeton University. Before completing his degree, LeBow left Princeton and joined the army where he installed early data systems at the Pentagon.[5] LeBow's first foray into business occurred in the 1960s when he started a computer company to continue his Pentagon project. LeBow eventually sold the business in 1971 for a profit and became a full-time investor.[5] In 1980 he founded the investment holding company Brooke Group Ltd.[6] LeBow went on to purchase many companies including: Western Union, Information Displays, MAI Basic Four, Liggett Group, Brigham's Ice Cream,[5][7] and the trading card company, SkyBox International (which he sold to Marvel).[8][9] In 2000, Brooke Group Ltd. was renamed Vector Group Ltd.[6]
Cigarettes and litigation[edit]
In 1986, he purchased the 5th largest cigarette manufacturer in the United States,[6] the Liggett Group for $140 million.[2] In 1993, Lebow stated under sworn testimony that since cigarettes are a legal product and people choose to use them, whether or not that they cause cancer is irrelevant.[10] In 1996, while under his leadership, Liggett Group broke ranks with the rest of the US tobacco industry, including Philip Morris, Brown and Williamson, RJR Nabisco, Loews and Lorillard, when he announced that Liggett would settle the Medicaid tobacco suits brought by forty state attorneys general.[11] Liggett had previously been accused of being illegally influenced by Philip Morris which allegedly paid some of Liggett's legal bills in order to buy its cooperation in anti-tobacco lawsuits.[12] LeBow stated that the reason for the settlement was to obtain immunity for Liggett from future liabilities[4] and to prevent a future bankruptcy.[13] The settlement entailed that Liggett agree to pay $1 million in damages;[2] publicly announce that smoking is addictive and causes cancer; turn over long-secret tobacco industry documents; disclose ingredients in its cigarettes; and testify against the industry. Liggett was the first cigarette company to voluntarily put the label "Nicotine is Addictive" on their product.[13]
LeBow's actions were pivotal to the government in their signing of the Master Settlement Agreement. In addition to this, LeBow was honored with a proclamation by Florida Governor Lawton Chiles for his "invaluable assistance" in helping Florida achieve its historic $11.3 billion settlement with the tobacco industry.[14] Following this presentation, Lebow and Mr. Chiles addressed a group of students, who "saved their toughest questions for Liggett Group chief Bennett Lebow of Miami". One student asked, "If you want to be a watchdog of the industry, why not get out altogether and stop making cigarettes?" to which he responded that if he did, others would continue.[15] LeBow also developed, through Vector Tobacco Inc., the nicotine-free cigarette Quest (cigarette) which is a cigarette designed to help people quit smoking.[16] Also that year LeBow teamed up with corporate raider Carl Icahn to make a bid for RJR Nabisco. In response to this proposed spin-off of Nabisco from RJR Reynolds, tobacco industry analyst Ellen Barabas stated that "I think there are people who would support a spin-off of Nabisco, but not by Lebow. One of the prime factors was Lebows dubious reputation as a manager. In 1994 his shareholders sued him, claiming he had taken millions of dollars in improper loans; Lebow settled out of court." [17] According to court documents, Liggett, while under LeBow's leadership, "engage(d) in marketing tactics that appeal to youths, such as couponing, sampling, and “buy one get one free” offers for its cigarettes, and advertise(d) in magazines with substantial youth readership."[18]
Notable acquisitions[edit]
In 1987, Liggett bought a majority stake in Western Union which had a negative net worth of $200 million. The company, then renamed New Valley LLC, eventually filed for bankruptcy but was able to pay its bondholders in full via asset sales. Liggett later sold its remaining interest in Western Union Financial Services Inc for $1.2 billion earning it a $300 million profit.[19]
In May 2010, after a $25 million investment, he became a member of the Board of Directors at Borders Group Inc. and was immediately elected Chairman of the Board, replacing Mick McGuire, who resigned.[20] In June 2010, LeBow became CEO of Borders Group Inc.[21] In February 2011, Borders declared bankruptcy.[22][23]
LeBow is also Chairman of the Board of Vector Group, the holding company for Liggett Group, Vector Tobacco, New Valley LLC, and Douglas Elliman.
Philanthropy and political activity[edit]
LeBow is a large supporter of his alma mater, Drexel University. In 1998, Drexel's College of Business and Administration was named the Bennett S. LeBow College of Business in his honor after a contribution of $10 million to the university.[24] Further, he endowed the Bennett S. LeBow Engineering Center, a state-of-the-art facility that houses Drexel's College of Engineering. In November 2010, the 72-year-old West Philadelphia native contributed $45 million for the construction of a new facility for the LeBow College of Business — the 12th largest gift to any US business school, and the biggest ever to Drexel University.[25][26] In 2011, LeBow was named the nation's 23rd largest charitable donor by The Chronicle of Philanthropy for donating more than $49 million to charitable causes.[27]
In 2009, LeBow made a $10,000 campaign contribution to Manhattan District Attorney candidate Leslie Crocker Snyder, whose law firm - Kasowitz, Benson, Torres & Friedman - had represented the Liggett Group in smoking and health litigation since 1996.[28]
Criticism[edit]
LeBow has also been scrutinized a number of times for a variety of decisions and business dealings:

In 2005, LeBow resigned from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Board of Trustees shortly after his appointment over discussions about the propriety of associating with the owner of a company which sells products that are known to cause cancer.[29]
In 1993, Brooke Group Shareholder Frank Gyetvan sued LeBow on behalf of other company shareholders, claiming Brooke had improperly lent Lebow money for luxury personal items, such as a $21 million yacht. The suit was settled the following year, with LeBow repaying $16 million to Brooke's other shareholders and giving up his right to receive 6.25 million in preferred dividends .[30]
In 1989, LeBow was criticized for using $3 million to fly a planeload of friends to a London party for the launch of his 177-foot yacht. The trip came during the time LeBow controlled MAI Systems, an Irvine, Calif.-based computer network company, and Western Union. Both companies filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization in 1993."[31]
In 1984, LeBow completed the sale of Information Displays which subsequently went bankrupt. The buyer sued LeBow and his partners for fraud and misrepresentation.[32]
In the past, LeBow's business associations have come into question. In the book "Red Mafiya: How the Russian Mob Has Invaded America", the author states: "Ukrainian mob boss Vadim Rabinovich attended a Clinton-Gore fund raiser at the Sheraton Bal Harbor Hotel in Miami. Rabinovich came as a guest of Bennett S. LeBow, the Chairman of Brooke Group Ltd, Parent of Liggett, a cigarette manufacturing company (LeBow refused to comment)."[33] According to a spokesman for LeBow, LeBow's Brooke Group and Rabinovich developed a business center and luxury hotel in Kiev.[34]

Personal life[edit]
LeBow was married to Geraldine Cosher[35] whom he met while they were students, he was at Drexel and she attended Temple.[citation needed] They had two daughters.[5][7] Geraldine died in 2011.[35] They were married for 52 years.[citation needed]Bennett LeBow is currently married to Jacqueline Finkelstein-LeBow .

Education and career[edit]
LeBow was born to a Jewish family,[2] the son of Suara and Martin LeBow.[3] His father was a life insurance salesman and his mother a teacher.[4][5] He graduated from West Philadelphia High School[5] and in 1960, earned a degree in electrical engineering from Drexel University.[5] LeBow then went on to graduate school at Princeton University. Before completing his degree, LeBow left Princeton and joined the army where he installed early data systems at the Pentagon.[5] LeBow's first foray into business occurred in the 1960s when he started a computer company to continue his Pentagon project. LeBow eventually sold the business in 1971 for a profit and became a full-time investor.[5] In 1980 he founded the investment holding company Brooke Group Ltd.[6] LeBow went on to purchase many companies including: Western Union, Information Displays, MAI Basic Four, Liggett Group, Brigham's Ice Cream,[5][7] and the trading card company, SkyBox International (which he sold to Marvel).[8][9] In 2000, Brooke Group Ltd. was renamed Vector Group Ltd.[6]
Cigarettes and litigation[edit]
In 1986, he purchased the 5th largest cigarette manufacturer in the United States,[6] the Liggett Group for $140 million.[2] In 1993, Lebow stated under sworn testimony that since cigarettes are a legal product and people choose to use them, whether or not that they cause cancer is irrelevant.[10] In 1996, while under his leadership, Liggett Group broke ranks with the rest of the US tobacco industry, including Philip Morris, Brown and Williamson, RJR Nabisco, Loews and Lorillard, when he announced that Liggett would settle the Medicaid tobacco suits brought by forty state attorneys general.[11] Liggett had previously been accused of being illegally influenced by Philip Morris which allegedly paid some of Liggett's legal bills in order to buy its cooperation in anti-tobacco lawsuits.[12] LeBow stated that the reason for the settlement was to obtain immunity for Liggett from future liabilities[4] and to prevent a future bankruptcy.[13] The settlement entailed that Liggett agree to pay $1 million in damages;[2] publicly announce that smoking is addictive and causes cancer; turn over long-secret tobacco industry documents; disclose ingredients in its cigarettes; and testify against the industry. Liggett was the first cigarette company to voluntarily put the label "Nicotine is Addictive" on their product.[13]
LeBow's actions were pivotal to the government in their signing of the Master Settlement Agreement. In addition to this, LeBow was honored with a proclamation by Florida Governor Lawton Chiles for his "invaluable assistance" in helping Florida achieve its historic $11.3 billion settlement with the tobacco industry.[14] Following this presentation, Lebow and Mr. Chiles addressed a group of students, who "saved their toughest questions for Liggett Group chief Bennett Lebow of Miami". One student asked, "If you want to be a watchdog of the industry, why not get out altogether and stop making cigarettes?" to which he responded that if he did, others would continue.[15] LeBow also developed, through Vector Tobacco Inc., the nicotine-free cigarette Quest (cigarette) which is a cigarette designed to help people quit smoking.[16] Also that year LeBow teamed up with corporate raider Carl Icahn to make a bid for RJR Nabisco. In response to this proposed spin-off of Nabisco from RJR Reynolds, tobacco industry analyst Ellen Barabas stated that "I think there are people who would support a spin-off of Nabisco, but not by Lebow. One of the prime factors was Lebows dubious reputation as a manager. In 1994 his shareholders sued him, claiming he had taken millions of dollars in improper loans; Lebow settled out of court." [17] According to court documents, Liggett, while under LeBow's leadership, "engage(d) in marketing tactics that appeal to youths, such as couponing, sampling, and “buy one get one free” offers for its cigarettes, and advertise(d) in magazines with substantial youth readership."[18]
Notable acquisitions[edit]
In 1987, Liggett bought a majority stake in Western Union which had a negative net worth of $200 million. The company, then renamed New Valley LLC, eventually filed for bankruptcy but was able to pay its bondholders in full via asset sales. Liggett later sold its remaining interest in Western Union Financial Services Inc for $1.2 billion earning it a $300 million profit.[19]
In May 2010, after a $25 million investment, he became a member of the Board of Directors at Borders Group Inc. and was immediately elected Chairman of the Board, replacing Mick McGuire, who resigned.[20] In June 2010, LeBow became CEO of Borders Group Inc.[21] In February 2011, Borders declared bankruptcy.[22][23]
LeBow is also Chairman of the Board of Vector Group, the holding company for Liggett Group, Vector Tobacco, New Valley LLC, and Douglas Elliman.
Philanthropy and political activity[edit]
LeBow is a large supporter of his alma mater, Drexel University. In 1998, Drexel's College of Business and Administration was named the Bennett S. LeBow College of Business in his honor after a contribution of $10 million to the university.[24] Further, he endowed the Bennett S. LeBow Engineering Center, a state-of-the-art facility that houses Drexel's College of Engineering. In November 2010, the 72-year-old West Philadelphia native contributed $45 million for the construction of a new facility for the LeBow College of Business — the 12th largest gift to any US business school, and the biggest ever to Drexel University.[25][26] In 2011, LeBow was named the nation's 23rd largest charitable donor by The Chronicle of Philanthropy for donating more than $49 million to charitable causes.[27]
In 2009, LeBow made a $10,000 campaign contribution to Manhattan District Attorney candidate Leslie Crocker Snyder, whose law firm - Kasowitz, Benson, Torres & Friedman - had represented the Liggett Group in smoking and health litigation since 1996.[28]
Criticism[edit]
LeBow has also been scrutinized a number of times for a variety of decisions and business dealings:

In 2005, LeBow resigned from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Board of Trustees shortly after his appointment over discussions about the propriety of associating with the owner of a company which sells products that are known to cause cancer.[29]
In 1993, Brooke Group Shareholder Frank Gyetvan sued LeBow on behalf of other company shareholders, claiming Brooke had improperly lent Lebow money for luxury personal items, such as a $21 million yacht. The suit was settled the following year, with LeBow repaying $16 million to Brooke's other shareholders and giving up his right to receive 6.25 million in preferred dividends .[30]
In 1989, LeBow was criticized for using $3 million to fly a planeload of friends to a London party for the launch of his 177-foot yacht. The trip came during the time LeBow controlled MAI Systems, an Irvine, Calif.-based computer network company, and Western Union. Both companies filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization in 1993."[31]
In 1984, LeBow completed the sale of Information Displays which subsequently went bankrupt. The buyer sued LeBow and his partners for fraud and misrepresentation.[32]
In the past, LeBow's business associations have come into question. In the book "Red Mafiya: How the Russian Mob Has Invaded America", the author states: "Ukrainian mob boss Vadim Rabinovich attended a Clinton-Gore fund raiser at the Sheraton Bal Harbor Hotel in Miami. Rabinovich came as a guest of Bennett S. LeBow, the Chairman of Brooke Group Ltd, Parent of Liggett, a cigarette manufacturing company (LeBow refused to comment)."[33] According to a spokesman for LeBow, LeBow's Brooke Group and Rabinovich developed a business center and luxury hotel in Kiev.[34]

Personal life[edit]
LeBow was married to Geraldine Cosher[35] whom he met while they were students, he was at Drexel and she attended Temple.[citation needed] They had two daughters.[5][7] Geraldine died in 2011.[35] They were married for 52 years.[citation needed]Bennett LeBow is currently married to Jacqueline Finkelstein-LeBow .

LeBow,  (born 1938, Philadelphia, Pa., U.S.), American businessman who became the first tobacco executive to publicly admit to the dangers of cigarettes.LeBow received an engineering degree in 1960 from Drexel University in Philadelphia and did postgraduate work at Princeton University. In 1961 he formed a computer company, DSI Systems, Inc., which he sold in 1971. During the 1970s and ’80s, LeBow was successful as a financial speculator. In one notable venture he made a profit of $30 million on sales of stock in cigarette maker American Brands. In 1980 he founded holding company Brooke Group Ltd., and in 1986—20 years after LeBow himself had quit smoking—it acquired the Liggett Group, the fifth largest tobacco company in the United States.In a lawsuit in 1993, LeBow maintained solidarity with the heads of the other big tobacco companies by refusing to admit any knowledge of the dangers of smoking. In early 1996, however, Liggett became the first tobacco company to arrange a monetary settlement in a class-action lawsuit, though the amount was small. Some said LeBow’s plan at the time was to merge Liggett with the much larger firm RJR Nabisco, which would participate in the settlement and be free from future litigation, but this did not come to pass.On March 20, 1997, Liggett took another unprecedented step in the controversy over the dangers of smoking. LeBow admitted in a settlement with 22 states that cigarette smoking is addictive and causes cancer. The statement signed by LeBow in March included frank admissions about the hazards of smoking. In it he affirmed thatwe at Liggett know and acknowledge that, as the Surgeon General and respected medical researchers have found, cigarette smoking causes health problems, including lung cancer, heart and vascular disease and emphysema. We at Liggett also know and acknowledge that…nicotine is addictive.Later in the document he also admitted that “the tobacco industry markets to ‘youth,’ which means those under 18 years of age.” The statement promised that Liggett would turn over pertinent documents to plaintiffs’ lawyers in tobacco lawsuits. LeBow’s settlement was immediately attacked by large tobacco companies such as Philip Morris, which claimed it was made simply as a business ploy and had no basis in fact. Liggett did not back down, and by mid-1997 it had begun labeling its cigarette packages with the warning “Smoking is addictive.” In June of that year, LeBow announced the company’s intent to list all ingredients, including nicotine levels, on all cartons of cigarettes. Liggett was the first company to take such a step.

Brooke Group Ltd. was renamed Vector Group Ltd. in 2000. In 2001 the company launched Vector Tobacco Inc., a subsidiary charged with the development of low- and no-nicotine products, of which LeBow was president and chief executive officer (2001–07). He was also chairman of the board (1988–2005) and chief executive officer (1994–2005) of another Vector subsidiary, the New Valley Corporation. From January 2006 until his retirement in late 2008, LeBow served as executive chairman of Vector Group Ltd. He was thereafter a private investor with the company. He was honoured in 1998 by his alma mater, Drexel University, when the school renamed their business college the LeBow College of Business.

Bennett Lebow Net Worth | Bennett LeBow, flashy financier, 'likes to be in control' rTC Setting the agenda for tobacco industry - tribunedigital-baltimoresun






 


Home→Collections→AssetsBennett LeBow, flashy financier, 'likes to be in control' rTC Setting the agenda for tobacco industryMarch 24, 1996|By BLOOMBERG BUSINESS NEWSMIAMI - Nobody tells Bennett LeBow what to do.Starting in the morning, the 58-year-old renegade financier likes to cook his own breakfast so he can eat exactly what he wants. All day long, Mr. LeBow demands control, losing his cool when he's stuck in traffic or provoking corporate chieftains with audacious takeover bids.This month, the majority shareholder of Liggett Group, the smallest of the United States' five major tobacco companies, struck again, breaking with the $50 billion-a-year tobacco industry by agreeing to settle a class-action lawsuit that claims the industry knowingly sells addictive nicotine products."Bennett LeBow sets the agenda, no matter what the issue," said Stanley Witkow, vice president of MAI Systems Corp., an Irvine, Calif., computer company that Mr. LeBow controls. "This guy likes to be in control."The first-ever tobacco settlement could arm Mr. LeBow in his effort to gain control of No. 2 cigarette maker RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. and force it to spin off its Nabisco food unit."He's trying to do the best for himself, with morals aside," said Stephen Yacktman of Yacktman Asset Management, an RJR shareholder.Chiding Mr. LeBow as lacking in morals is hardly the harshest criticism levied against stocky, bearded Philadelphia native.No surprise there: Two of his public companies MAI Systems and New Valley Corp. filed for bankruptcy. His Miami-based Brooke Group Ltd., Liggett's parent, has reported losses for years and recently had to restructure much of its $400 million debt.Angry Brooke shareholders repeatedly claimed that Mr. LeBow improperly helped himself to company assets, allegations that he denies.He's also been criticized for his ostentatious lifestyle that has included a yacht, jets, several pricey homes and elaborate entertaining.The son of an insurance man and a schoolteacher, Mr. LeBow graduated from Drexel University with an engineering degree and started his own computer company in 1961. Six years later, he rescued his own company from failure through a merger and financial restructuring. In the ensuing two decades, he focused on troubled companies.Mr. LeBow also prospered with the backing of since-fallen junk-bond king Michael Milken and Drexel Burnham Lambert, which provided junk-bond financing for a string of LeBow acquisitions.Among his conquests: reported.In 1987, a LeBow company bought a majority stake in Western Union Corp., then a grab bag of money-losing assets with a negative net worth of $200 million.The company, renamed New Valley, ended up filing for bankruptcy, selling assets and repaying bondholders in full. The company sold its interest in Western Union Financial Services Inc. for $1.2 billion, leaving it with more than $300 million.Mr. LeBow, who says he grew up poor, began to spend money as soon as he had it.An avid scuba diver, he moved to south Florida in the late 1980s from New York, buying a home on tony Fisher Island.In early 1989, according to numerous press reports, Mr. LeBow flew 150 friends on a chartered jet to London for a $3 million bash to celebrate the maiden voyage of his custom-built yacht, modeled after Queen Victoria's private yacht.The guests stayed at the posh Claridge hotel and were met at the port by a marching band in full regalia. Mr. LeBow doled out souvenirs, including gold coins with a likeness of the financier donning a Lord Nelson hat.The spending blitz came as financial pressures mounted.In November 1990, Mr. LeBow combined several unprofitable interests into Brooke Group, which was the renamed Liggett cigarette company acquired in a 1986 buyout. Within months, Mr. LeBow was drawing millions in salary and personal loans.Securities and Exchange Commission filings show that in 1992 Mr. LeBow drew a $1.5 million salary from Brooke while the company reported a $6 million loss. He also received loans and lines of credit from Liggett and Brooke.Mr. LeBow, who has faced scores of shareholder suits, counters that he repaid the loans with interest, and that investors who stayed with Brooke from 1991 through 1995 reaped an annual return of 27 percent.Mr. LeBow is a most unlikely shareholder activist in his fight with RJR, the focus of a titanic takeover contest between management and buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.Brooke Group proposes an insurgent slate that includes Mr. LeBow to replace RJR's board. If elected, the new board would immediately spin off the company's food business. Mr. LeBow claims this would benefit shareholders, who earned a 4 percent compound annual return on their investment in RJR in the past four years.The slate is expected to be voted on at RJR's April 17 annual meeting.Pub Date: 3/24/96

Education and career[edit]
LeBow was born to a Jewish family,[2] the son of Suara and Martin LeBow.[3] His father was a life insurance salesman and his mother a teacher.[4][5] He graduated from West Philadelphia High School[5] and in 1960, earned a degree in electrical engineering from Drexel University.[5] LeBow then went on to graduate school at Princeton University. Before completing his degree, LeBow left Princeton and joined the army where he installed early data systems at the Pentagon.[5] LeBow's first foray into business occurred in the 1960s when he started a computer company to continue his Pentagon project. LeBow eventually sold the business in 1971 for a profit and became a full-time investor.[5] In 1980 he founded the investment holding company Brooke Group Ltd.[6] LeBow went on to purchase many companies including: Western Union, Information Displays, MAI Basic Four, Liggett Group, Brigham's Ice Cream,[5][7] and the trading card company, SkyBox International (which he sold to Marvel).[8][9] In 2000, Brooke Group Ltd. was renamed Vector Group Ltd.[6]
Cigarettes and litigation[edit]
In 1986, he purchased the 5th largest cigarette manufacturer in the United States,[6] the Liggett Group for $140 million.[2] In 1993, Lebow stated under sworn testimony that since cigarettes are a legal product and people choose to use them, whether or not that they cause cancer is irrelevant.[10] In 1996, while under his leadership, Liggett Group broke ranks with the rest of the US tobacco industry, including Philip Morris, Brown and Williamson, RJR Nabisco, Loews and Lorillard, when he announced that Liggett would settle the Medicaid tobacco suits brought by forty state attorneys general.[11] Liggett had previously been accused of being illegally influenced by Philip Morris which allegedly paid some of Liggett's legal bills in order to buy its cooperation in anti-tobacco lawsuits.[12] LeBow stated that the reason for the settlement was to obtain immunity for Liggett from future liabilities[4] and to prevent a future bankruptcy.[13] The settlement entailed that Liggett agree to pay $1 million in damages;[2] publicly announce that smoking is addictive and causes cancer; turn over long-secret tobacco industry documents; disclose ingredients in its cigarettes; and testify against the industry. Liggett was the first cigarette company to voluntarily put the label "Nicotine is Addictive" on their product.[13]
LeBow's actions were pivotal to the government in their signing of the Master Settlement Agreement. In addition to this, LeBow was honored with a proclamation by Florida Governor Lawton Chiles for his "invaluable assistance" in helping Florida achieve its historic $11.3 billion settlement with the tobacco industry.[14] Following this presentation, Lebow and Mr. Chiles addressed a group of students, who "saved their toughest questions for Liggett Group chief Bennett Lebow of Miami". One student asked, "If you want to be a watchdog of the industry, why not get out altogether and stop making cigarettes?" to which he responded that if he did, others would continue.[15] LeBow also developed, through Vector Tobacco Inc., the nicotine-free cigarette Quest (cigarette) which is a cigarette designed to help people quit smoking.[16] Also that year LeBow teamed up with corporate raider Carl Icahn to make a bid for RJR Nabisco. In response to this proposed spin-off of Nabisco from RJR Reynolds, tobacco industry analyst Ellen Barabas stated that "I think there are people who would support a spin-off of Nabisco, but not by Lebow. One of the prime factors was Lebows dubious reputation as a manager. In 1994 his shareholders sued him, claiming he had taken millions of dollars in improper loans; Lebow settled out of court." [17] According to court documents, Liggett, while under LeBow's leadership, "engage(d) in marketing tactics that appeal to youths, such as couponing, sampling, and “buy one get one free” offers for its cigarettes, and advertise(d) in magazines with substantial youth readership."[18]
Notable acquisitions[edit]
In 1987, Liggett bought a majority stake in Western Union which had a negative net worth of $200 million. The company, then renamed New Valley LLC, eventually filed for bankruptcy but was able to pay its bondholders in full via asset sales. Liggett later sold its remaining interest in Western Union Financial Services Inc for $1.2 billion earning it a $300 million profit.[19]
In May 2010, after a $25 million investment, he became a member of the Board of Directors at Borders Group Inc. and was immediately elected Chairman of the Board, replacing Mick McGuire, who resigned.[20] In June 2010, LeBow became CEO of Borders Group Inc.[21] In February 2011, Borders declared bankruptcy.[22][23]
LeBow is also Chairman of the Board of Vector Group, the holding company for Liggett Group, Vector Tobacco, New Valley LLC, and Douglas Elliman.
Philanthropy and political activity[edit]
LeBow is a large supporter of his alma mater, Drexel University. In 1998, Drexel's College of Business and Administration was named the Bennett S. LeBow College of Business in his honor after a contribution of $10 million to the university.[24] Further, he endowed the Bennett S. LeBow Engineering Center, a state-of-the-art facility that houses Drexel's College of Engineering. In November 2010, the 72-year-old West Philadelphia native contributed $45 million for the construction of a new facility for the LeBow College of Business — the 12th largest gift to any US business school, and the biggest ever to Drexel University.[25][26] In 2011, LeBow was named the nation's 23rd largest charitable donor by The Chronicle of Philanthropy for donating more than $49 million to charitable causes.[27]
In 2009, LeBow made a $10,000 campaign contribution to Manhattan District Attorney candidate Leslie Crocker Snyder, whose law firm - Kasowitz, Benson, Torres & Friedman - had represented the Liggett Group in smoking and health litigation since 1996.[28]
Criticism[edit]
LeBow has also been scrutinized a number of times for a variety of decisions and business dealings:

In 2005, LeBow resigned from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Board of Trustees shortly after his appointment over discussions about the propriety of associating with the owner of a company which sells products that are known to cause cancer.[29]
In 1993, Brooke Group Shareholder Frank Gyetvan sued LeBow on behalf of other company shareholders, claiming Brooke had improperly lent Lebow money for luxury personal items, such as a $21 million yacht. The suit was settled the following year, with LeBow repaying $16 million to Brooke's other shareholders and giving up his right to receive 6.25 million in preferred dividends .[30]
In 1989, LeBow was criticized for using $3 million to fly a planeload of friends to a London party for the launch of his 177-foot yacht. The trip came during the time LeBow controlled MAI Systems, an Irvine, Calif.-based computer network company, and Western Union. Both companies filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization in 1993."[31]
In 1984, LeBow completed the sale of Information Displays which subsequently went bankrupt. The buyer sued LeBow and his partners for fraud and misrepresentation.[32]
In the past, LeBow's business associations have come into question. In the book "Red Mafiya: How the Russian Mob Has Invaded America", the author states: "Ukrainian mob boss Vadim Rabinovich attended a Clinton-Gore fund raiser at the Sheraton Bal Harbor Hotel in Miami. Rabinovich came as a guest of Bennett S. LeBow, the Chairman of Brooke Group Ltd, Parent of Liggett, a cigarette manufacturing company (LeBow refused to comment)."[33] According to a spokesman for LeBow, LeBow's Brooke Group and Rabinovich developed a business center and luxury hotel in Kiev.[34]

Personal life[edit]
LeBow was married to Geraldine Cosher[35] whom he met while they were students, he was at Drexel and she attended Temple.[citation needed] They had two daughters.[5][7] Geraldine died in 2011.[35] They were married for 52 years.[citation needed]Bennett LeBow is currently married to Jacqueline Finkelstein-LeBow .

Education and career[edit]
LeBow was born to a Jewish family,[2] the son of Suara and Martin LeBow.[3] His father was a life insurance salesman and his mother a teacher.[4][5] He graduated from West Philadelphia High School[5] and in 1960, earned a degree in electrical engineering from Drexel University.[5] LeBow then went on to graduate school at Princeton University. Before completing his degree, LeBow left Princeton and joined the army where he installed early data systems at the Pentagon.[5] LeBow's first foray into business occurred in the 1960s when he started a computer company to continue his Pentagon project. LeBow eventually sold the business in 1971 for a profit and became a full-time investor.[5] In 1980 he founded the investment holding company Brooke Group Ltd.[6] LeBow went on to purchase many companies including: Western Union, Information Displays, MAI Basic Four, Liggett Group, Brigham's Ice Cream,[5][7] and the trading card company, SkyBox International (which he sold to Marvel).[8][9] In 2000, Brooke Group Ltd. was renamed Vector Group Ltd.[6]
Cigarettes and litigation[edit]
In 1986, he purchased the 5th largest cigarette manufacturer in the United States,[6] the Liggett Group for $140 million.[2] In 1993, Lebow stated under sworn testimony that since cigarettes are a legal product and people choose to use them, whether or not that they cause cancer is irrelevant.[10] In 1996, while under his leadership, Liggett Group broke ranks with the rest of the US tobacco industry, including Philip Morris, Brown and Williamson, RJR Nabisco, Loews and Lorillard, when he announced that Liggett would settle the Medicaid tobacco suits brought by forty state attorneys general.[11] Liggett had previously been accused of being illegally influenced by Philip Morris which allegedly paid some of Liggett's legal bills in order to buy its cooperation in anti-tobacco lawsuits.[12] LeBow stated that the reason for the settlement was to obtain immunity for Liggett from future liabilities[4] and to prevent a future bankruptcy.[13] The settlement entailed that Liggett agree to pay $1 million in damages;[2] publicly announce that smoking is addictive and causes cancer; turn over long-secret tobacco industry documents; disclose ingredients in its cigarettes; and testify against the industry. Liggett was the first cigarette company to voluntarily put the label "Nicotine is Addictive" on their product.[13]
LeBow's actions were pivotal to the government in their signing of the Master Settlement Agreement. In addition to this, LeBow was honored with a proclamation by Florida Governor Lawton Chiles for his "invaluable assistance" in helping Florida achieve its historic $11.3 billion settlement with the tobacco industry.[14] Following this presentation, Lebow and Mr. Chiles addressed a group of students, who "saved their toughest questions for Liggett Group chief Bennett Lebow of Miami". One student asked, "If you want to be a watchdog of the industry, why not get out altogether and stop making cigarettes?" to which he responded that if he did, others would continue.[15] LeBow also developed, through Vector Tobacco Inc., the nicotine-free cigarette Quest (cigarette) which is a cigarette designed to help people quit smoking.[16] Also that year LeBow teamed up with corporate raider Carl Icahn to make a bid for RJR Nabisco. In response to this proposed spin-off of Nabisco from RJR Reynolds, tobacco industry analyst Ellen Barabas stated that "I think there are people who would support a spin-off of Nabisco, but not by Lebow. One of the prime factors was Lebows dubious reputation as a manager. In 1994 his shareholders sued him, claiming he had taken millions of dollars in improper loans; Lebow settled out of court." [17] According to court documents, Liggett, while under LeBow's leadership, "engage(d) in marketing tactics that appeal to youths, such as couponing, sampling, and “buy one get one free” offers for its cigarettes, and advertise(d) in magazines with substantial youth readership."[18]
Notable acquisitions[edit]
In 1987, Liggett bought a majority stake in Western Union which had a negative net worth of $200 million. The company, then renamed New Valley LLC, eventually filed for bankruptcy but was able to pay its bondholders in full via asset sales. Liggett later sold its remaining interest in Western Union Financial Services Inc for $1.2 billion earning it a $300 million profit.[19]
In May 2010, after a $25 million investment, he became a member of the Board of Directors at Borders Group Inc. and was immediately elected Chairman of the Board, replacing Mick McGuire, who resigned.[20] In June 2010, LeBow became CEO of Borders Group Inc.[21] In February 2011, Borders declared bankruptcy.[22][23]
LeBow is also Chairman of the Board of Vector Group, the holding company for Liggett Group, Vector Tobacco, New Valley LLC, and Douglas Elliman.
Philanthropy and political activity[edit]
LeBow is a large supporter of his alma mater, Drexel University. In 1998, Drexel's College of Business and Administration was named the Bennett S. LeBow College of Business in his honor after a contribution of $10 million to the university.[24] Further, he endowed the Bennett S. LeBow Engineering Center, a state-of-the-art facility that houses Drexel's College of Engineering. In November 2010, the 72-year-old West Philadelphia native contributed $45 million for the construction of a new facility for the LeBow College of Business — the 12th largest gift to any US business school, and the biggest ever to Drexel University.[25][26] In 2011, LeBow was named the nation's 23rd largest charitable donor by The Chronicle of Philanthropy for donating more than $49 million to charitable causes.[27]
In 2009, LeBow made a $10,000 campaign contribution to Manhattan District Attorney candidate Leslie Crocker Snyder, whose law firm - Kasowitz, Benson, Torres & Friedman - had represented the Liggett Group in smoking and health litigation since 1996.[28]
Criticism[edit]
LeBow has also been scrutinized a number of times for a variety of decisions and business dealings:

In 2005, LeBow resigned from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Board of Trustees shortly after his appointment over discussions about the propriety of associating with the owner of a company which sells products that are known to cause cancer.[29]
In 1993, Brooke Group Shareholder Frank Gyetvan sued LeBow on behalf of other company shareholders, claiming Brooke had improperly lent Lebow money for luxury personal items, such as a $21 million yacht. The suit was settled the following year, with LeBow repaying $16 million to Brooke's other shareholders and giving up his right to receive 6.25 million in preferred dividends .[30]
In 1989, LeBow was criticized for using $3 million to fly a planeload of friends to a London party for the launch of his 177-foot yacht. The trip came during the time LeBow controlled MAI Systems, an Irvine, Calif.-based computer network company, and Western Union. Both companies filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization in 1993."[31]
In 1984, LeBow completed the sale of Information Displays which subsequently went bankrupt. The buyer sued LeBow and his partners for fraud and misrepresentation.[32]
In the past, LeBow's business associations have come into question. In the book "Red Mafiya: How the Russian Mob Has Invaded America", the author states: "Ukrainian mob boss Vadim Rabinovich attended a Clinton-Gore fund raiser at the Sheraton Bal Harbor Hotel in Miami. Rabinovich came as a guest of Bennett S. LeBow, the Chairman of Brooke Group Ltd, Parent of Liggett, a cigarette manufacturing company (LeBow refused to comment)."[33] According to a spokesman for LeBow, LeBow's Brooke Group and Rabinovich developed a business center and luxury hotel in Kiev.[34]

Personal life[edit]
LeBow was married to Geraldine Cosher[35] whom he met while they were students, he was at Drexel and she attended Temple.[citation needed] They had two daughters.[5][7] Geraldine died in 2011.[35] They were married for 52 years.[citation needed]Bennett LeBow is currently married to Jacqueline Finkelstein-LeBow .

LeBow is also Chairman of the Board of Vector Group, the holding company for Liggett Group, Vector Tobacco, New Valley LLC, and Douglas Elliman.
Philanthropy and political activity[edit]
LeBow is a large supporter of his alma mater, Drexel University. In 1998, Drexel's College of Business and Administration was named the Bennett S. LeBow College of Business in his honor after a contribution of $10 million to the university.[24] Further, he endowed the Bennett S. LeBow Engineering Center, a state-of-the-art facility that houses Drexel's College of Engineering. In November 2010, the 72-year-old West Philadelphia native contributed $45 million for the construction of a new facility for the LeBow College of Business — the 12th largest gift to any US business school, and the biggest ever to Drexel University.[25][26] In 2011, LeBow was named the nation's 23rd largest charitable donor by The Chronicle of Philanthropy for donating more than $49 million to charitable causes.[27]
In 2009, LeBow made a $10,000 campaign contribution to Manhattan District Attorney candidate Leslie Crocker Snyder, whose law firm - Kasowitz, Benson, Torres & Friedman - had represented the Liggett Group in smoking and health litigation since 1996.[28]
Criticism[edit]
LeBow has also been scrutinized a number of times for a variety of decisions and business dealings:

In 2005, LeBow resigned from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Board of Trustees shortly after his appointment over discussions about the propriety of associating with the owner of a company which sells products that are known to cause cancer.[29]
In 1993, Brooke Group Shareholder Frank Gyetvan sued LeBow on behalf of other company shareholders, claiming Brooke had improperly lent Lebow money for luxury personal items, such as a $21 million yacht. The suit was settled the following year, with LeBow repaying $16 million to Brooke's other shareholders and giving up his right to receive 6.25 million in preferred dividends .[30]
In 1989, LeBow was criticized for using $3 million to fly a planeload of friends to a London party for the launch of his 177-foot yacht. The trip came during the time LeBow controlled MAI Systems, an Irvine, Calif.-based computer network company, and Western Union. Both companies filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization in 1993."[31]
In 1984, LeBow completed the sale of Information Displays which subsequently went bankrupt. The buyer sued LeBow and his partners for fraud and misrepresentation.[32]
In the past, LeBow's business associations have come into question. In the book "Red Mafiya: How the Russian Mob Has Invaded America", the author states: "Ukrainian mob boss Vadim Rabinovich attended a Clinton-Gore fund raiser at the Sheraton Bal Harbor Hotel in Miami. Rabinovich came as a guest of Bennett S. LeBow, the Chairman of Brooke Group Ltd, Parent of Liggett, a cigarette manufacturing company (LeBow refused to comment)."[33] According to a spokesman for LeBow, LeBow's Brooke Group and Rabinovich developed a business center and luxury hotel in Kiev.[34]

Personal life[edit]
LeBow was married to Geraldine Cosher[35] whom he met while they were students, he was at Drexel and she attended Temple.[citation needed] They had two daughters.[5][7] Geraldine died in 2011.[35] They were married for 52 years.[citation needed]Bennett LeBow is currently married to Jacqueline Finkelstein-LeBow .

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
