Private Advisors Hits Hard Cap In Seventh Small Company Private Equity Fund









PR Newswire




Jul 25, 2017 10:00 AM EDT













 




























































  RICHMOND, Va., July 25, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Private Advisors, LLC, a leading alternative investment firm, has closed its oversubscribed seventh small company private equity fund ("Fund VII") at a hard cap of $350 million. Fund VII focuses exclusively on the small company market in North America where Private Advisors has been a leading investor for more than 20 years. The Fund primarily invests in lower-middle market buyout, growth and distressed private equity funds (typically less than $750 million in size), along with targeted equity co-investments and opportunistic secondary investments. "We are grateful to our limited partners for their continued support as almost 70 percent of the Fund came from existing investors.  We are also very excited to gain many new investors and further expand our LP base outside the U.S.," said Chris Stringer, President of Private Advisors. The Fund's investor base primarily includes institutional investors such as pension plans, foundations, endowments, insurance, and family offices. Private Advisors' employees and its parent organization, New York Life Insurance Company, made meaningful commitments, underscoring a strong alignment of interests with investors.  Todd Milligan, Partner on the Private Equity team, commented: "We are pleased to have already committed over 50 percent of the Fund to high quality and access constrained investments, and we continue to see compelling opportunities ahead. We believe our broad investment platform and longstanding dedication to the small company market provide distinct sourcing, relationship and diligence advantages for our partners."

		New York —
	


Morgan Stanley Alternative Investment Partners (AIP) has raised over $1 billion in commitments for Private Markets Fund VI (PMF VI). The fund’s strategy is to combine primary funds, co-investments and secondaries in one globally diversified portfolio of private equity investments. The capital raise, which is now complete, exceeded AIP’s initial $750 million target.

“Our PMF private equity fund series is now in its sixth round of investing, which speaks to the value our clients see in the consistent, disciplined investment approach of Morgan Stanley Alternative Investment Partners,” said Ed Moriarty, Head of Alternative Investment Partners, Merchant Banking & Real Estate Investing and Managed Futures. “Over the past fifteen years, we have carefully built a cohesive team of experienced investment professionals who now manage several longstanding programs across the spectrum of alternatives.”

“We are pleased with the success of this fund raise, particularly because we attracted several new limited partners to our program,” said John Wolak, Head of AIP Private Markets. “We believe that our experienced and talented team, strong investment results and deep commitment to our clients helped to attract capital to the fund.”

The objective of PMF VI is to provide investors with superior risk-adjusted returns and exposure to four private equity strategies: buyouts, venture, growth capital, and special situations. AIP’s investment strategy emphasizes less efficient market segments and targets managers who can apply specialized skills to unlock value within the underlying portfolio assets.

“We are focused wholly on generating attractive returns for our investors” said Neil Harper, CIO, AIP Private Markets Team. “We are deeply resourced to search globally for the best opportunities across the private markets. We are looking for opportunities where managers have a clear and sustainable source of competitive advantage, and we seek to back such managers on a primary basis in addition to co-investing directly alongside them, and purchasing secondary interests in their funds.”

Morgan Stanley Alternative Investment Partners (AIP), part of Morgan Stanley Investment Management, specializes in assisting institutional and high net worth investors achieve their goals through the design and management of alternative investment programs. AIP’s multi-disciplinary investment teams thoughtfully combine expertise in fund investing, secondaries and co-investing across hedge fund, private equity, real estate and multi-asset class strategies for the benefit of our clients. Solutions include diversified and opportunistic multi-manager strategies, multi-asset class portfolios, liquid alternatives and fiduciary management. As of June 30, 2015, AIP managed total assets of $38.4 billion, including $10.7 billion in assets in our private equity primary and secondary funds.
