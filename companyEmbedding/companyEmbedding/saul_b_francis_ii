A Brief History of the Company.
In 1892, Washington, D.C. was a small Southern community of less than 30,000 people. Although it played host to the Federal government, Congress was in session only four or five months a year. When it adjourned, the city virtually shut down. On December 1, 1892, B. Francis Saul opened the doors of the Saul Company. He was 19 years old. His father, John Saul, who had died a few years earlier, was a native of County Cork, Ireland, a distinguished horticulturist. Read more...

Operating Divisions




Since its founding in 1892, B. F. Saul Company has been active in land development and construction. Large-scale projects require disciplined managerial, financial, construction and leasing skills over an extended period of time. The task is made even more complex by the many suppliers and subcontractors who must be coordinated to complete development on schedule and on budget. We have met the challenge in an impressive array of office-industrial, hotel and residential projects over the years.
To support the teams in each of our operating divisions, we have a talented group of business professionals in each vital support function: 
• Human Resources
• Information Technology
• Legal and Accounting

The B. F. Saul Company also has an Insurance Agency that represents many of the nation’s leading insurance carriers.

7501 Wisconsin Avenue Awarded EPA's Energy Star


 


Owned by 7501 Wisconsin LLC and managed by B. F. Saul Property Co., 7501 Wisconsin Avenue is a 15-story, 699,246-rentable-square-foot (RSF) office building located in Bethesda, Maryland. The building was designed by Brennan Beer Gorman Monk and completed in 2001. 7501 Wisconsin Avenue is a twin tower office building connected by a four story interior gallery and finished in granite, limestone, pre-cast concrete, and glass. In addition to an exterior landscaped courtyard and fountain, there is a 5-level underground parking garage.
7501 Wisconsin Avenue is equipped with three high efficiency centrifugal chillers and ice storage with a floor-by-floor variable air volume (VAV) system with variable frequency drives (VFDs) on all air handlers, pumps, and cooling towers. The building is equipped with a Trane direct digital controlled (DDC) building automation system and a centralized lighting control panel to control building lighting. 7501 Wisconsin Avenue earned the ENERGY STAR for superior energy performance as a result of proactive energy saving strategies by building management. Some of these strategies included adjusting night setbacks, VAV lockout for heat during summer months, controls on all baseboard heaters, conversion to a dry pipe system in lieu of wet pipe system with electric heat, and continuous evaluation and monitoring of day-to-day building operations.
