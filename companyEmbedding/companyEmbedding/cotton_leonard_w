You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

			Leonard W. Cotton has been a director since 2014. Mr. Cotton is the former vice chairman of Centerline Capital Group (a position he held from 2006 to 2008). He was also on the executive committee of the Commercial Real Estate Finance Council, or CREFC, from 2001 to 2010 and was president of CREFC from 2007 to 2008. Mr. Cotton previously served as chairman and chief executive officer of ARCap REIT (a position he held from 1995 to 2006), a real estate finance company acquired by Centerline Capital Group in 2006, and chairman and chief executive officer of ARCap REIT's predecessor, REMICap. During his tenure at ARCap REIT, Mr. Cotton was instrumental in establishing ARCap REIT as a nationally recognized CMBS investor in subordinated bonds. From 1992 to 2002, Mr. Cotton was a president and partner in Harbour Realty Advisors, a real estate-related special situation investment and commercial property management company. Prior to joining Harbour Realty Advisors, Mr. Cotton was engaged in a number of real estate related entrepreneurial endeavors, including acting as consultant on real estate workout strategies and the development of high-end residential properties. Mr. Cotton also serves on the board of trustees of Bowdoin College. He started his career in 1972 with Citibank, working in commercial real estate lending and workout business units. He also served as an independent director of FundCore Institutional Income Trust Inc., a public unlisted mortgage REIT, from 2010 to 2012 and is a former board member of the Real Estate Roundtable. Mr. Cotton received an M.B.A. in Finance from Columbia University and a B.A. in American History from Bowdoin College. Mr. Cotton has significant experience in various aspects of commercial real estate, including lending, equity investment and development, which we believe gives him unique insight into our investment activities.

Properties and cotton products


Cotton is both a food and fibre crop.
The cotton plant produces fruit, known as bolls.
When mature the crop is picked and ginned - which separates the cotton fibre (or lint) from the seed.
Cotton lint makes up about 42 percent of the picked cotton by weight, and contributes about 85 percent of the total income from a cotton crop. The other 15 percent of income is from cotton seed.
Almost all parts of the cotton plant are used in some way including the lint, cottonseed, linters, stalks and seed hulls.

Natural cotton fibre properties

Cotton is a soft, absorbent and breathable natural fibre, making it the perfect fibre for clothing and undergarments worn close to the skin
Cotton keeps the body cool in summer and warm in winter because it is a good conductor of heat 
Cotton is non-allergenic and, unlike synthetic fibres, cotton fibre is a natural product that contains no chemicals
Cotton, due to its unique fibre structure, breathes better and is more comfortable than oil-based synthetic fabrics
Cotton is one of the easiest fabrics to dye due to its natural whiteness and high rate of absorbency
Australian cotton in particular is perfectly suited to colour application processes as it offers spinners crisp white lint, low breakages and stoppages, good throughput efficiency and uniformity of yarn
Cotton holds up to 27 times its own weight in water and becomes stronger when wet
Cotton can’t hold an electric charge, eliminating static cling

Products made from cotton

The cotton lint from one 227kg bale can produce 215 pairs of denim jeans, 250 single bed sheets, 750 shirts, 1,200 t-shirts, 3000 nappies, 4,300 pairs of socks, 680,000 cotton balls, or 2,100 pairs of boxer shorts
Cotton’s strength and absorbency make it an ideal fabric the production of thousands of useful products from sheets and towels, tarpaulins and tents, pharmaceuticals and medical supplies - even astronauts’ inflight space suits
About 60% of the world’s total cotton harvest is used to make clothing, with the rest used in home furnishings and industrial products 
Cotton lint is spun then woven or knitted into fabrics such as velvet, corduroy, chambray, velour, jersey and flannel
Cotton be used to create dozens of different fabric types for a range of end-uses, including blends with other natural fibres like wool, and synthetic fibres like polyester
More unusual uses of cotton fibre include tents, car tire cord, fishnets and book binding

Products made from cotton linters

Cotton linters are fine, very short fibres that remain on the cottonseed after ginning. They are curly fibres typically less than 3mm long 
Linters are used in the manufacture of paper (such as archival paper and bank notes) and as a raw material in the manufacture of cellulose plastics 
Linters are commonly used for medical supplies such as bandages, cotton buds, cotton balls and x-rays

Products made from cottonseed

Cotton seed, which makes up around half the weight of the picked cotton, is mostly used to make cotton seed oil
One tonne of cotton seed yields approximately 200kg of oil, 500kg of cotton seed meal and 300kg of hulls
Cotton seed oil is cholesterol free, high in polyunsaturated fats and contains high levels of anti-oxidants (vitamin E) which contribute to its long shelf life. It can be used for deep frying, and for some margarines and salad dressings. Cotton seed oil is also used to make products such as soap, emulsifiers, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, rubber, paint, water proofing agents and candles
The by-product of the oil-extraction process is meal, which is used as stock feed. Cotton seed meal is a high protein meal that can be fed to most animals. Cotton seed hulls are also a valuable feed source for livestock
Global cotton seed production can potentially provide protein requirements for half a billion people and many billions of other animals
