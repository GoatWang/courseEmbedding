Corporate Governance | UBS Global topics










































Corporate Governance




Our corporate governance principles are designed to support our objective of sustainable profitability, as well as to create value and protect the interests of our shareholders and other stakeholders.











Overview



UBS is subject to, and acts in compliance with, all relevant Swiss legal and regulatory requirements regarding Corporate governance, including the SIX Swiss Exchange’s (SIX) Directive on Information Relating to Corporate Governance, as well as the standards established in the Swiss Code of Best Practice for Corporate Governance, including the appendix on executive compensation.
In addition, as a foreign company with shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), UBS is in compliance with all relevant corporate governance standards applicable to foreign private issuers.
UBS operates under a strict dual board structure, as mandated by Swiss banking law. The separation of responsibilities between the Board of Directors (BoD) and the Group Executive Board (GEB) is clearly defined in the Organization Regulations. The BoD decides on the strategy of the Group on recommendation by the Group Chief Executive Officer (Group CEO), and supervises and monitors the business, whereas the GEB, headed by the Group CEO, has executive management responsibility. The functions of Chairman of the BoD and Group CEO are assigned to two different people, ensuring a separation of power. This structure establishes checks and balances and preserves the institutional independence of the BoD from the day-to-day management of the Group, for which responsibility is delegated to the GEB under the leadership of the Group CEO. No member of one board may simultaneously be a member of the other.

Board of Directors of UBS Group AG








The Board of Directors (BoD) has ultimate responsibility for the success of the Group and for delivering sustainable shareholder value within a framework of prudent and effective controls. The BoD decides on the strategy of the Group upon recommendation of the Group Chief Executive Officer (Group CEO) and is responsible for the overall direction, supervision and control of the Group and its management, as well as for supervising compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations.  Shareholders elect each member of the BoD individually, as well as the members of the Compensation Committee, on an annual basis. The BoD in turn appoints one or more Vice Chairmen, a Senior Independent Director, the members of the BoD committees and their respective Chairpersons, and the Group Company Secretary.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
