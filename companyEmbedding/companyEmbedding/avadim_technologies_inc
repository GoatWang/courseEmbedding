Avadim Technologies, Inc. Announces National Launch of Patented New Paradigm Muscle Performance Formulation | Business Wire


























































      Avadim Technologies, Inc. Announces National Launch of Patented New 
      Paradigm Muscle Performance Formulation
    



      Release of Innergy Sport™ Products to Top Athletic Trainers scheduled 
      for the National Athletic Trainers Association (“NATA”) Conference in 
      St. Louis, Missouri June 24 – 26, 2015
    





June 24, 2015 11:41 AM Eastern Daylight Time



ASHEVILLE, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Avadim Technologies Inc., a life sciences company, will complete the 
      national launch of its newest product line, Innergy Sport™, June 24, 
      2015 at the National Athletic Trainers Association Conference.
    

      The Innergy Sport™ topical product line was developed with the athlete 
      in mind to optimize endurance and performance levels. Lowering local 
      tissue pH levels results in increased oxygen availability, uptake, and 
      improved recovery. Innergy Sport™ super normalizes the athlete’s 
      integumentary system, thus increasing muscle performance, decreasing 
      muscle recovery time, as well as, providing immediate cramp relief.
    

      A recent Phase 1 field trial at the University of South Carolina 
      demonstrated the potential of Innergy Sport for relief of cramps in 
      elite athletes. The use of Innergy Sport in treating acute cramps in 
      fifty Division 1 athletes showed an 82% success rate in relieving the 
      cramp within two minutes, with only one repeat cramping episode. Of the 
      fifty athletes, forty-nine were able to return to competition without a 
      rebound cramping episode or report of muscle tightness.
    

      Currently, the Innergy product line is being utilized and evaluated by 
      professional, university and high school athletic teams throughout the 
      United States.
    

      For more information on Innergy Sport visit the website at www.innergysport.com 
      or email info@innergysport.com. 
      In addition, athletic trainers are encouraged to visit the Innergy Sport 
      booth number 2609 at this years NATA conference.
