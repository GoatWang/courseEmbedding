DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)--KRG Capital Partners (“KRG”) today announced that Daniel E. Greenleaf 
      will become President and Chief Executive Officer of Home Solutions, one 
      of the nation’s leading specialty infusion companies, effective 
      immediately.
    


      Mr. Greenleaf, who most recently served as President and Chief Executive 
      Officer for Coram Specialty Infusion Services as well as Chief Operating 
      Officer for Apria Healthcare, will, as President and Chief Executive 
      Officer of Home Solutions, be responsible for leading the 
      rapidly-growing home infusion portfolio company of KRG.
    

      “We are extremely pleased to bring Dan on as the President and CEO of 
      Home Solutions,” said Steve Neumann, Managing Director of KRG. “There is 
      no better leader in the home infusion industry than Dan. His strong 
      executive skills and commercial and operations background bring the 
      crucial elements to achieve significant growth, operational 
      efficiencies, and continued success for Home Solutions.”

      to become the industry leader in home infusion and one of the 
      top-performing healthcare companies in the U.S. with a double-digit 
      compounded annual growth rate and an EBITDA increase of more than 250%. 
      Coram recently agreed to be acquired by CVS Caremark for $2.1 billion 
      after having been purchased by Apria Healthcare in late 2007 for $350 
      million, attesting to the value created through Mr. Greenleaf’s nearly 
      five years at the helm. In addition to his role as President and CEO of 
      Coram, Mr. Greenleaf also served as Chief Operating Officer for Apria

      November 2010 to March 2012. In this role he reorganized and revitalized 
      the company with significant progress made on the business priorities 
      and objectives, including improvements made in sales performance, 
      revenue management, ancillary services, patient census, and customer 
      service. Since his departure from Coram, Mr. Greenleaf has provided 
      expertise through consulting and advisory services to several blue chip 
      private equity firms in healthcare services.
    

      Mr. Greenleaf has over 21 years of relevant experience in senior 
      leadership positions in the healthcare industry. Prior to joining Coram 
      and Apria, Mr. Greenleaf served as President and CEO for VioQuest 
      Pharmaceuticals Inc., a publically traded biopharmaceutical company. 
      Additionally, he was the President of U.S. Operations for Celltech 
      Biopharmaceuticals, which sold for $2.7 billion. Mr. Greenleaf was also 
      held senior leadership roles with Nabi Pharmaceuticals and 
      Schering-Plough Corporation.
    

      Mr. Greenleaf serves on the University of Miami’s Health Sector 
      Management and Policy Board, and is a past board member for the National 
      Home Infusion Association (NHIA). He has also been a member of the 
      international group, Young President’s Organization (YPO), since 2004.
    

      A graduate of Denison University with a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in 
      Economics, Mr. Greenleaf also holds a Master of Business Administration 
      (M.B.A.) in Health Administration from the University of Miami. A 
      military veteran, Mr. Greenleaf was a captain and navigator in the 
      United States Air Force and served in Operation Desert Storm.

We believe Mr. Greenleaf's significant experience in the healthcare and home infusion industries, and in particular his experience as Chief Executive Officer of Home Solutions and Coram, are particularly relevant to Mr. Greenleaf's service on the Board. Further, as the only Board member who is also a member of the Company's management team, Mr. Greenleaf provides management's perspective in Board discussions about the operations and strategic direction of the Company.

The Greenleaf family, which runs sprawling Memphis megachurch Calvary Fellowship World Ministries, seems, by all accounts, to be an adoring and minding group. Underneath the surface, however, exists outrageous mysteries and untruths. Eagerness, infidelity and kin competition are among the issues that undermine to test the familys confidence and destroy the gathering. The shameful happenings are revealed by Grace, the repelled girl of chapel pioneer Bishop James Greenleaf, when she returns home following a 20-year nonappearance. Oprah Winfrey has a normal part on the show as Mavis, Graces close relative.
