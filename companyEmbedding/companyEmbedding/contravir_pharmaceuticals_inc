 Valnivudine™




  





We are developing Valnivudine™ as a fast-acting, low-dose, once-daily, oral antiviral therapy for the treatment of herpes zoster, or shingles, an infection caused by the reactivation of the varicella zoster (chicken pox) virus. In addition to its potent antiviral activity, Valnivudine™ has demonstrated an ability to reduce the incidence and severity of debilitating shingles-associated pain, known as post-herpetic neuralgia, or PHN.
We are currently conducting a pivotal Phase 3 trial that will compare Valnivudine™ to valacyclovir (Valtrex®) with shingles pain reduction as a primary endpoint.










Examples of Shingles Lesions











  







  





Shingles
Driven primarily by the aging adult population, the rate of shingles is increasing steadily. Recent research estimates there are more than four million cases of singles each year in the major markets of the U.S., Europe, and Japan, of which more than half occur in the U.S. Further, approximately two-thirds of shingles patients suffer from pain for 30 days or longer. Learn more about shingles and shingles pain >>
The pain associated with an episode of shingles is attributed to both the damage caused to the affected nerves by the replication of varicella zoster virus and the inflammatory response associated with the infection.
For many patients, shingles-associated pain does not resolve when the lesions heal and the inflammation subsides, but, rather, continues for months, or possibly years. Shingles-associated pain, or PHN, is the most common and clinically relevant complication of shingles.





Post-herpetic Neuralgia (PHN)




Mild to excruciating pain long after shingles rash resolves
>65-70% of shingles patients suffer from PHN for 30 days or more; can last for 2-3 years
Disrupts sleep, mood, work, and activities of daily living

Opportunity




Rapid onset of action for quick pain relief
Higher potency vs. approved agents against herpes zoster
Efficacy profile superior to valacyclovir
Potential for QD dosing vs. 3-5x daily for valacyclovir
No dose adjustments needed for patients with renal insufficiency










Potential Advantages of Valnivudine™ over Currently Marketed Shingles Therapies

Clinical Data
Phase 1 and 2 trials of Valnivudine™ were successfully completed. We are currently conducting a pivotal Phase 3 trial in patients with shingles to further explore Valnivudine’s™ potential ability to reduce shingles pain.
Demonstrated Safety and Efficacy




>350 patients treated with Valnivudine™
Clinically meaningful reduction in PHN occurrence versus valacyclovir
Meaningful reduction in time to resolution of clinically significant pain
8-10% fewer patients required narcotics for pain control
Safety similar to other antivirals










Reduction in PHN at 90 days vs. Valacyclovir





In Phase 2 trials, Valnivudine™ demonstrated a clinically meaningful 37% reduction in the incidence of PHN versus valacyclovir (Valtrex®).






  







  





Phase 3 Study





ContraVir’s pivotal Phase 3 study seeks to compare Valnivudine™ to valacyclovir (Valtrex®) with shingles pain reduction as a primary endpoint.





Learn about the Valnivudine™ Clinical Trial at GotShingles.com >>










Phase 3 Study Design




Multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, comparative study (Valnivudine™ vs. valacyclovir)
Up to 200 centers (U.S. only)
Three-arm study: Valnivudine™ 400mg QD, Valnivudine™ 400mg BID, Valacyclovir 1000mg TID
985 patients estimated with 275 patients per arm
Patients aged 30 years and older
Seven day treatment period; follow up through day 120






  







  





Scientific Research
Pharmacokinetic data from completed Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials suggest that Valnivudine™ has the potential to demonstrate antiviral activity when dosed orally once-a-day at significantly lower blood levels than acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir, the FDA-approved drugs used for the treatment of shingles.

	Oral Presentation at EASL Highlights ContraVirs Tenofovir Exalidex (TXL) Antiviral Activity in Hepatitis B (HBV) Patients





	 





	Edison, NJ, April 20, 2017


	 ContraVir Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: CTRV), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of targeted antiviral therapies, today announced new data demonstrating clinical antiviral activity, as well as safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) data of tenofovir exalidex (TXL). TXL is the Companys proprietary liver targeting prodrug of the antiviral agent tenofovir for treating chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV), designed to offer equal or better HBV viral load reductions at doses lower than Viread

	®

	 (TDF), a commercially available tenofovir prodrug. ContraVir is also focusing on optimizing drug delivery of TXL to improve bioavailability and enhance its pharmacological activity.



	 




	The data were presented today at The International Liver Congress (ILC) 2017, the annual meeting of the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Notably, data from the presentation, Pharmacokinetics, Safety and Antiviral Activity of TXL, a Novel Prodrug of Tenofovir, Administered as Ascending Multiple Doses to Healthy Volunteers and HBV-Infected Subjects, was chosen to be included in the best of viral hepatitis at ILC2017 debrief recording, where Professor Fabien Zoulim and Professor Heiner Wedemeyer will provide overviews on the latest in viral hepatitis research and patient management.




	 




	Dr. Tawesak Tanwandee, Associate Professor of Medicine and Head of the Division of Gastroenterology in the Department of Medicine at Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University in Bangkok, Thailand and colleagues, conducted a trial in which they evaluated the effects of multiple ascending oral doses of TXL in healthy volunteers, as well as a second trial performed in HBV patients.




	 




	The first trial, a Phase 1b study, enrolled 50 healthy volunteers assigned to one of five sequential, ascending TXL dosing cohorts (5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 mg) where participants were randomized 8:2 to receive either TXL or placebo for 14 days.




	 




	The second Phase 2a trial evaluated the effects of multiple ascending oral doses of TXL (10, 25, 50, and 100 mg) in a proof-of-concept (POC) trial involving four cohorts of 12 HBV-infected subjects randomized 10:2 to receive either TXL or Viread


	®

	 for 28 days.



	 




	Interim data in the POC study have demonstrated that a 100-mg dose of TXL resulted in a mean HBV viral load (Log


	10

	 IU/mL, 3.63

	+

	1.68) (mean

	+

	SD) compared to the mean viral load from a 300-mg dose of Viread

	®

	 (Log

	10

	 IU/mL, 3.75

	+

	1.17) after 21 days of treatment. The reduction in viral load persisted for up to one month after cessation of treatment.



	 




	These observed reductions in HBV viral load in patients support the further development of TXL as a promising new treatment for managing patients with chronic hepatitis B virus, said Dr. Tanwandee, the lead investigator of both trials. Continued development of TXL is also supported by the wide safety margin observed, as well as by its pharmacokinetic profile indicating dose linearity.




	 



	1













	 




	The data demonstrated that TXL, at all doses tested, resulted in substantially lower systemic circulating levels of tenofovir in the blood compared to Viread


	®

	. These results demonstrate the potential for TXL to reduce the risk of bone- and kidney-related toxicities associated with Viread

	®

	.



	 




	There were no serious adverse events (AEs) or discontinuations due to AEs, and other safety parameters (e.g., electrocardiograms, vital signs, safety laboratory results) showed no patterns, clusters, or relationship to the TXL dose.




	 




	We now have clinical evidence that demonstrates 25 - 100 mg of TXL achieves viral load reductions that are similar to Viread


	®

	 that is dosed at 300 mg. These reductions in viral load were accomplished with our first-generation formulation. We continue to enhance TXL by optimizing this first-generation product to further enhance drug delivery, commented James Sapirstein, Chief Executive Officer at ContraVir. With our early proof-of-concept principle now complete, we believe that our second-generation formulated TXL will give comparable reduction in viral load at lower doses compared to the doses of TXL reported in the present study.



	 





	About TXL





	 




	Tenofovir exalidex (TXL) is a highly potent prodrug of the successful antiviral drug tenofovir. Its novel liver-targeting structure results in decreased circulating levels of tenofovir, lowering systemic exposure and thereby reducing the potential for renal side effects. ContraVir previously completed a Phase 1b dose-escalation trial of TXL in healthy volunteers, in which participants were treated at doses up to 100 mg per day for 14 days; in this trial, TXL displayed an excellent safety, tolerability, and drug distribution profile. Based on the agents best-in-class potential, ContraVir believes TXL can become the cornerstone of a curative combination therapy for hepatitis B.

	About ContraVir Pharmaceuticals





	 




	ContraVir is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of targeted antiviral therapies with a specific focus on developing a potentially curative therapy for hepatitis B virus (HBV). The Company is developing two novel anti-HBV compounds with complementary mechanisms of action. One compound, TXL is an analog of the antiviral drug Viread


	®

	 (tenofovir disoproxil fumerate), and is currently in Phase 2a of development. TXL has demonstrated the potential for low, once-daily dosing and a low systemic exposure, thereby potentially reducing renal and bone side effects. CRV431, the other anti-HBV compound, is a next-generation cyclophilin inhibitor with a unique structure that increases its potency and selective index against HBV. ContraVir is also developing Valnivudine, an orally available nucleoside analogue prodrug; Valnivudine is currently in Phase 3 for the treatment of herpes zoster. In addition to direct antiviral activity, Phase 2 data suggest that Valnivudine has the potential to reduce the incidence of debilitating shingles-associated pain known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). For more information visit www.contravir.com.

 Herpes Zoster (Shingles)




  





Shingles Overview
Herpes zoster, also commonly known as shingles, is a neurological disorder caused by the reactivation of varicella zoster virus (VZV), the same virus that causes chickenpox.
Based on recent research and publications, we estimate that there are over four million cases of shingles in the U.S., Europe and Japan each year, of which more than half occur in the U.S.
The symptoms associated with shingles generally include localized lesions and pain. In many cases the patient may first notice localized prodomal pain; however, the first recognizable symptom of shingles is generally lesions that will continue to form for a week or two. These lesions generally follow the path of nerves that emanate from the spinal cord around the torso (thoracic); however, the infection is also commonly found on the face, neck, lower back and in certain cases, systemically.
Within several weeks, the lesions in the infected areas will typically begin to heal, and these dermatological symptoms generally will resolve within a month or less. In rare instances, lesions may never appear, but pain will be present.










Reactivation of varicella zoster virus (VZV)







  





Shingles Pain
The pain associated with an episode of shingles is attributed to both the damage caused to the affected nerves by the replication of VZV and the inflammatory response associated with the infection.
Pain symptoms are commonly described as a burning sensation, with bouts of stabbing and shooting pain, often set off by contact with the infected area. The majority of shingles patients experience such pain for several weeks in connection with their active infection, referred to as acute pain. For many patients, shingles-associated pain does not resolve when the lesions heal and the inflammation subsides, but, rather, continues for months, or possibly years.
Persistent shingles-associated pain that lasts more than three to four weeks is referred to as sub-acute pain or neuralgia. Shingles-associated pain that persists more than three months is generally referred to as PHN, which is the most common and clinically relevant complication of shingles.
Approximately 15-20% of all shingles patients experience PHN, although the incidence of PHN is more prevalent in patients over 50 years of age. Previous studies have established that additional risk factors for PHN include greater acute pain intensity, severity of the dermatological symptoms or lesions, and the presence and greater severity of a painful prodromal preceding the lesions or rash.

ContraVir Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (CTRV), the biopharmaceutical company, recently presented data demonstrating the synergistic antiviral activity by two drug candidates for treatment of hepatitis B viral (HBV) infection. This news created such expectation in the investment community and the financial forums that the company could successfully close an underwritten public offering. In this piece, we will provide some information about this offering and its price reaction as well as some information about the products.

Source
Drug Candidates
The company has three candidates: TXL, Valnivudine, and CRV431. TXL is an oral drug made of tenofovir. It is considered a product, which “is developed to improve the characteristics of  drugs, like better efficacy, lower pill burden, improved safety…“. This drug is in a Phase 2a proof concept study. The company licensed TXL from Chimerix in exchange of 120,000 preferred shares valued at $1.2 million in 2014. During September 2016, the seller decided to convert them and obtained $1.0 million shares. We appreciate this decision since Chimerix, with deep knowledge of the candidate, still believes in the future of the product.

Tenofovir disoproxil
CRV431 is a drug candidate under development for the treatment of HBV infection. The company acquired the drug through a merger with Ciclofilin Pharmaceuticals Inc. The product targets enzymes called “cyclophilins” that play a key role in the HBV life cycle. Additionally, the other candidate, Valnivudine, which is an oral drug for the treatment of herpes zoster, has completed the phase 2 already and is waiting for the next and last trial with the FDA.
Recent Developments
The most recent development was announced on April 22, 2017. The company presented data demonstrating the synergistic antiviral activity of the two products, TXL and CRV431, at The International Liver Congress® 2017; the annual meeting of the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Robert Foster, ContraVir’s Chief Scientific Officer, stated the following in the congress:
“The two EASL posters support ContraVir’s strategy of combining two drug candidates with distinct and complementary modes of action, an approach that may halt or slow the progression of chronic hepatitis B virus. We are especially gratified to be included in one of the EASL poster tours, as the selection reflects the EASL Scientific Programme Committee’s recognition of CRV431 as an antiviral compound with a promising clinical profile and a novel mode of action.” Source
This news seems to be very important for the company as just two days later, it could announce a public offering of securities. The book-running manager was Canaccord Genuity Inc., and the offering was closed very rapidly.
” ContraVir is offering 12,000,000 shares of its common stock and warrants to purchase 6,000,000 shares of its common stock at a combined offering price of $1.00. All the shares and warrants are being offered by ContraVir. The warrants will be exercisable for a period of five years from the issuance date at an exercise price of $1.25 per share.” Source
The demand for the stock seems to be high because the offering was rapidly closed. This is very positive. In addition, the share price did not fall, while the book-runner was working on the sale. The share price maintained the price level of $0.8 before and after the closing of the offering. Thus, investors seem to like the stock and believe on the commercialization of its candidates.

We identified several major brokers such as JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley as well as some hedge funds and mutual funds like Vanguard, HighTower,  TIAA-CREF, Geode and Teachers Advisors. The fact that the big boys invested in this company means that the company passed the due diligence of the funds and its managers believe that the company offers an interesting risk-reward ratio. Our subscribers know it very well since we always say it in internal mails: always follow the big firms!
In this case, we also saw that insiders bought at prices above the current share price. This is very positive because if we buy now, we may be hitting a price close to bottom:

Conclusion
CTRV is achieving new milestones in the development of its three candidate drugs. It is true that the company’s share price lost some value in the process due to share dilution, but the company is still able to obtain funds from investors with new offerings. In our opinion, some of its candidates are close to Phase 3, so the time will come soon if the drugs can be commercialized. If the trials are positive, the shareholders who believed in the company, will make interesting returns thanks to their patience. Finally, the fact that some of these patient shareholders are insiders and institutional money manager is definitely a good sign. To sum up, the company is sending good messages to the investment community, thus we encourage investors to stay alert. We will be updating our subscribers as soon as we know more.

 CRV431




  





ContraVir is developing CRV431 for treating hepatitis B and is currently preparing to enter IND-enabling studies based on strong preclinical data. CRV431 belongs to a known drug class of cyclophilin inhibitors derived from cyclosporine A, and was designed specifically to optimize potency and selectivity against HBV.
CRV431 works by disrupting certain host mechanisms that are “hijacked” by HBV as it replicates within liver cells. It is expected to be effective against all HBV genotypes due to the fact that it interrupts more than one point in the viral life cycle that are common in all HBV sub-types.










Potential Advantages of CRV431




Best-in-class potency and selective index against HBV
Interrupts HBV at multiple points, limiting replication and potential resistance
Blocks HBV entry into liver cells and suppresses HBsAg and HBeAg in vitro
Reduces HBV DNA without toxicity; prevents liver fibrosis in vivo 






  







  





Hepatitis B
Hepatitis B, an infectious disease caused by the hepatitis B virus (“HBV”), affects the liver and occurs in both acute and chronic modalities. Patients who test positive for HBsAg, an HBV surface protein antigen, for more than six months are said to be chronic and are at risk of developing liver disease. The virus is transmitted by exposure to infectious blood or bodily fluid but is preventable by vaccination.
Currently there are about 350 million chronic HBV patients worldwide and 786,000 reported HBV-related deaths in 2010. The United States is the largest individual market with the highest absolute growth rate of HBV patients at around 15.4% through 2033 and around 9% growth in much of Europe.
Individuals with chronic hepatitis B are significantly more prone to developing cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer. 20%-30% of all chronic hepatitis B patients develop these complications, and individuals with chronic hepatitis B are 100 times more likely to develop liver cancer than non-infected individuals. The limited efficacy of treatments for liver cancer and low survival rate (15%) mean that any treatment targeted at suppressing HBV replication before these complications arise is important to increase longevity.

Opportunity
The safety and antiviral activity of CRV431 is built on a robust set of clinical data from chemically-related cyclophilin inhibitors. Naturally occurring cyclosporine A has been used for more than 30 years in the field of organ transplant due to its immunosuppressive properties, and cyclophilin inhibitors such as alisporovir (developed by DebioPharm and acquired by Novartis) achieved clinical safety and efficacy against hepatitis C virus. CRV431 has undergone extensive medicinal chemistry to shed its immunosuppressive activity and optimize its potency and target selectivity, which dramatically increases its therapeutic window for treating hepatitis B.
CRV431 inhibits HBV replication by simultaneously blocking several specific interactions of HBV proteins with host cell cyclophilins, which the virus uses to propagate infection and avoid detection by the cell’s natural antiviral mechanisms. There is also evidence that it blocks the entry of HBV into cells, stimulates an interferon-mediated antiviral immune response, and directly reduces inflammation and fibrosis, a major contributor to cirrhosis and development of liver cancer in chronic hepatitis B patients.
CRV431 has a clearly distinct and complementary mechanism of action, as compared to ContraVir’s clinical stage HBV drug TXL™, which the company believes can act as a cornerstone molecule for a future combination HBV curative treatment.

Preclinical Study Data
In vitro and in vivo studies showed that CRV431 has good oral bioavailability and a significant first pass effect, which concentrates the drug in the liver. It was shown to effectively inhibit entry of HBV into liver cells via direct interaction with the NTCP receptor (cyclophilin-independent), which may represent another mechanism by which CRV431 may reduce chronic infection. Within cells, it significantly reduced or eliminated the production/secretion of hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg) and envelope antigen (HbeAg) as well as HBV DNA and cccDNA. CRV431 also reduced liver HBV DNA in a transgenic mouse model of viral replication without significant toxicity. Further animal studies confirmed a strong safety profile for CRV431, and highlighted the ability of CRV431 to reduce liver damage, preventing the development of fibrosis by ~55% in a mouse model of NASH (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis). This result is important considering that long-term liver damage resulting from chronic HBV infection is what ultimately drives mortality for many patients.

James Sapirstein, CEO of ContraVir Pharmaceuticals, Inc.



March 20, 2014 


NEW YORK – March 20, 2014 – ContraVir Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (OTCBB:CTRV), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of antiviral technologies, today announced the appointment of James Sapirstein as Chief Executive Officer, and a member of the ContraVir Board of Directors. Mr. Sapirstein will lead the Company's strategic growth plan for the future, and, in particular, the clinical development of FV-100 to treat shingles (herpes zoster) patients.
“ContraVir’s recent emergence as a public company requires a unique individual who combines leadership skills with extensive experience in antivirals to spearhead ContraVir’s future development," said Gary S. Jacob, Board Chairman of ContraVir. “James Sapirstein is just that individual. James has actively led and participated in more than 20 product launches in the U.S. and abroad, including product development, clinical development, strategic planning and global marketing. Add to this James’ considerable experience in biotechnology startup companies and we have the perfect individual to lead ContraVir moving forward.”
"I am very excited to take the helm of ContraVir,” said James Sapirstein. “ContraVir’s drug candidate FV-100 for treating patients with shingles is an exciting opportunity which has the potential to provide clinical benefits to patients who suffer the debilitating nerve pain associated with this condition. We are eager to further develop this exciting candidate, and I am confident that we are in the right place at the right time to build ContraVir into an elite biopharmaceutical enterprise with the express goal of creating value for our stakeholders."
Mr. Sapirstein, a graduate of the Rutgers University Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy, brings over thirty years of pharmaceutical industry experience to Contravir ranging from start-up situations to some of the largest companies in the world. After beginning his career in 1984 as a sales representative with Eli Lilly, he accepted a position at Hoffmann-LaRoche in 1987, where he served for almost a decade as part of its sales and marketing teams.

About ContraVir Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
ContraVir is a biopharmaceutical company focused primarily on the development of drugs to treat herpes zoster, or shingles, which is an infection caused by the reactivation of varicella zoster virus or VZV. ContraVir’s lead candidate, FV-100, is an orally available nucleoside analogue prodrug that is being developed for the treatment of shingles. Published preclinical studies demonstrate that FV-100 is significantly more potent against VZV than acyclovir, famcyclovir, and valacyclovir, the FDA approved drug for treating shingles. Moreover, FV-100 has been shown to have a more rapid onset of antiviral activity in preclinical models, and may fully inhibit the replication of VZV more rapidly than these drugs at significantly lower concentration levels. Phase 1 trials of FV-100 in volunteers were successfully completed, as well as a phase 2 clinical trial in shingles patients. ContraVir plans to open a phase 2b trial in shingles patients to further explore FV-100’s potential to treat the long-lasting nerve pain typically associated with shingles.

ContraVir’s Cyclophilin Inhibitor CRV431 Targets Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg)



April 4, 2017 


HBsAg is a key protein produced by the hepatitis B virus
High levels of HBsAg are predictive of disease progression
CRV431 potently inhibits the interaction between cyclophilin and HBsAg
EDISON, N.J., April 04, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ContraVir Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:CTRV), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of targeted antiviral therapies, today provided new insights into the mechanism of action (MOA) of its hepatitis B virus (HBV)-optimized cyclophilin inhibitor CRV431. New studies show that CRV431 potently blocks the interaction between hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), a key HBV protein, and cyclophilin A, an important cellular protein. This new information could explain previous findings that CRV431 reduces HBsAg in many experimental systems. High levels of HBsAg in HBV-infected patients is a predictor for progression of disease, including liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and cancer.
The findings further elucidate the MOA of CRV431, and support ContraVir’s strategy of providing a “functional cure,” where HBV remains suppressed following the completion of drug treatment. ContraVir’s approach to achieving this goal is to combine drugs with complementary MOAs.  TXL™ (tenofovir exalidex prodrug), the backbone of the company’s drug portfolio, works by lowering infectious virus in the blood. CRV431 complements the activity of TXL by targeting HBsAg, which may enhance the likelihood that the patient’s immune system will disable HBV or its viral products.
“The goal of HBV drug research is to eradicate the virus, so that patients no longer have to worry about the long-term consequences of infection,” commented Robert Foster, Pharm.D., Ph.D., ContraVir’s Chief Scientific Officer. “Our finding that CRV431 targets hepatitis B surface antigen is promising because reducing or eradicating surface antigen is considered an important step in combating HBV. Combination therapy with CRV431 and tenofovir exalidex, with their distinct and complementary modes of action, may halt or slow the progression of chronic hepatitis B virus, and may bring us closer to a functional cure of this devastating disease.”
The current studies, conducted by Philippe Gallay, Ph.D., at the Scripps Research Institute, expand upon the previously reported findings that CRV431 also targets the interaction between cyclophilin and another key HBV protein called HBx. Together these results highlight the central role of cyclophilins in HBV infection and the potential of CRV431 to disrupt key viral activities.
About ContraVir Pharmaceuticals
ContraVir is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of targeted antiviral therapies with a specific focus on developing a potentially curative therapy for hepatitis B virus (HBV). The Company is developing two novel anti-HBV compounds with complementary mechanisms of action. One compound, TXL™ (formerly CMX157), is a highly potent analog of the successful antiviral drug Viread® (tenofovir disoproxil fumerate), and is currently in Phase 2a of development. TXL™ has demonstrated the potential for low, once-daily dosing and decreased systemic exposure compared to tenofovir, thereby potentially reducing renal and bone side effects. CRV431, the other anti-HBV compound, is a next-generation cyclophilin inhibitor with a unique structure that increases its potency and selective index against HBV. ContraVir is also developing FV-100, an orally available nucleoside analogue prodrug; FV-100 is currently in Phase 3 for the treatment of herpes zoster. In addition to direct antiviral activity, Phase 2 data suggest that FV-100 has the potential to reduce the incidence of debilitating shingles-associated pain known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). For more information visit www.contravir.com.

These factors include, but are not limited to, substantial competition; our ability to continue as a going concern; our need for additional financing; uncertainties of patent protection and litigation; uncertainties with respect to lengthy and expensive clinical trials, that results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results; uncertainties of government or third party payer reimbursement; limited sales and marketing efforts and dependence upon third parties; and risks related to failure to obtain FDA clearances or approvals and noncompliance with FDA regulations. As with any drug candidates under development, there are significant risks in the development, regulatory approval, and commercialization of new products. There are no guarantees that future clinical trials discussed in this press release will be completed or successful, or that any product will receive regulatory approval for any indication or prove to be commercially successful. ContraVir does not undertake an obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement. Investors should read the risk factors set forth in ContraVir's Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2015 and other periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
