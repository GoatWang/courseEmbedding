Northern 
		Trust Global Investments Sets Growth Course Around Multi-Manager, Quant 
		and Alternative Products
Originally published June 9, 2008

Northern 
		Trust Global Investments (NTGI), with $778 billion in assets under 
		management, emphasizes a quantitative approach to money management, with 
		over $280 billion of assets under management focused on the quant space. 
		Its investment strategies include using an array of internally managed 
		products and multiple manager solutions to expose clients to 
		well-researched work by boutique “alpha generators.” At the same time, 
		NTGI is widening the cross-border aspect of its investment approach, 
		portraying itself more as a global company that “just happens to be 
		headquartered in Chicago,” rather than a Chicago-based firm that invests 
		worldwide. Global Investment 
		Technology spoke with Stephen N. Potter who recently took over the 
		helm as President of Northern Trust Global Investments.
GIT: What are some of the key 
		trends shaping the asset management business worldwide which as yet are 
		not widely noticed?
SP: Markets are difficult, and the 
		liabilities for pension funds and demands for countries to be able to 
		maintain or develop wealth are key drivers of change. We see risk 
		avoidance being a key part of the business and therefore a series of 
		strategies are unfolding. We see pension funds being sold into new 
		entities that are financed solely for that purpose. We see pension funds 
		merging with one another in the Netherlands and we see a trend 
		toward liability driven investment. In the Netherlands, several large 
		established pension funds are converting into commercial enterprises, 
		either by leveraging their core competencies or buying other pension 
		funds to gain scale, essentially turning themselves into multi-manager 
		pension factories. This really says that the way we operated in the past 
		is not the way we will operate in the future. I can’t predict if any of 
		these will truly be successful in the long run, but they all represent 
		dynamic change at an accelerated pace.
GIT: How has the pace of 
		technological change changed money management?
SP: Risks and obligations in the 
		pensions market and the acceleration of capital development and wealth 
		creation have changed the way markets operate. Investors’ needs have 
		changed. The opportunity to invest has been somewhat constrained by 
		supply and expected returns of traditional markets. We have seen a very 
		strong movement toward alternative asset classes, including commodities 
		and infrastructure-type products. 
There’s a need to gain absolute return, not just 
		trundle along with the benchmarks of traditional equity indices, for 
		example. The opportunity set has to broaden and value creation needs to 
		be looked at, both in the assets that are invested and the asset 
		allocation, but also the positions that are taken, whether long or 
		short. Fundamentally, the dramatic change in this universe all goes back 
		to research by Gary Brinson and others on asset allocation, 
		well-constructed investment programs, and the ability to control and 
		monitor risks. The programs that have been successful have those common 
		elements. More simply, just having a good idea of your investment 
		objective allows you to construct portfolios that clearly achieve that 
		objective or can be measured and re-corrected when they need to be.
GIT: What are your biggest 
		challenges and opportunities as president of a leading global asset 
		management firm?
SP: Making sure I stay focused on 
		areas where we excel, such as quantitative management. We’re excellent 
		at short-duration fixed-income and we’re excellent at multi-manager 
		solutions. We will continue to invest significant resources in those. 
		They are the building blocks of the solutions that our clients seek in 
		their investment programs. So again, it’s about focus and truly being a 
		market leader in areas where we seek to compete. On the other hand, it’s 
		very powerful to create product solutions with a broad platform with the 
		kind of integrity, trust and reputation that Northern Trust has. So I 
		expect to continue to support the build-out of our investment businesses 
		off that strong foundation and increasingly stronger global franchise. 
		Our delivery of product and achieving our clients’ objectives does 
		require incredible focus. As we know, even with the best of focus, 
		sometimes the markets can take us into some unusual places.
GIT: Can you comment on your 
		business priorities for 2008?
SP: First and foremost is 
		execution and ensuring that we’re excellent at the areas we are 
		addressing. When we aren’t excellent, we’ll seek to remedy that. Beyond 
		that, we have a clear strategy around multi-manager, quant and 
		short-duration fixed-income. I want to ensure that those products are 
		well-received and continue to be positioned the right way in the 
		marketplace. As part of that, we will enhance our position in 
		alternative assets.
We have a very good capability for hedge fund of 
		funds and private equity products, but I would like those to be of 
		greater scale. I’d like them to have broader market applicability into 
		other jurisdictions. That suggests a build or a buy in that space. The 
		other area, which ties into our existing relationship orientation and 
		platform, is building more quantitative-related products, such as 
		enhanced, quant products. Even though current markets have not been 
		favorable for those strategies, I believe there is a very important 
		place for them. Also, building additional structured products could 
		[create] more customized solutions for wealth management or large 
		additional institutional investors.
GIT: What has been the impact 
		of the  US 
		sub-prime loans crisis on enhanced money market funds that invest in 
		asset-backed securities?
SP: There is a clear mismatch 
		between current valuation and what someone can actually trade at if they 
		can trade at all, and what the models would have told us those assets 
		were worth. This is part of an inevitable cycle of product and market 
		dissonance. This is a correction period for those who are left holding 
		these assets. They have a challenge ensuring that they have proper 
		valuations and proper governance of their funds and can therefore assure 
		their investors that in the long run those products will return to where 
		the models said they were. Many market participants have a bigger 
		problem because of mark-to-market rules. It’s a dynamic problem for the 
		banks and fund managers that have significant fixed income holdings. 
		Fortunately, Northern Trust’s long-term conservative philosophy has let 
		us work through this from a position of strength. We own some 
		asset-backed securities, but they are a small percentage of our total, 
		and much less so than our competitors.
GIT: What are some of the risk 
		management challenges that have been flagged for which IT solutions need 
		to be overhauled or re-engineered?
SP: Asset-backed securities that 
		were marked to model as opposed to marked to market present a challenge. 
		The lesson there is unless something really trades, it’s pretty hard to 
		know what it’s truly valued at, no matter what the model says. So that’s 
		a philosophical question rather than a technology question. But it does 
		instruct us in how we look at the assets that we put into client 
		portfolios or onto our own balance sheet as a bank. We’ve always been 
		skeptical of anything that we can’t really feel, touch and understand, 
		and we have a little more conservative approach. Technology is valuable 
		to properly construct portfolios and manage risk — it hasn’t failed us, 
		or the industry — but some take too much comfort in value-at-risk and 
		other risk management methodologies and the numbers those systems 
		produce. 
Market participants may have become too comfortable 
		given the growth happening at that time, or incentives were improperly 
		established. So I don’t blame technology, but hubris and a lack of 
		attention to classic risk management discipline. Investing based on 
		momentum and fads often leads to this sort of correction.
GIT: What prevents specialized 
		asset managers from executing strategies that work in one market for 
		them and their clients in another market?
SP: The local sub-custody market 
		for us is uneven in the quality that we seek in market settlement and 
		information flows. That’s part of the problem, but the other side of it 
		is the availability of quality equities and supply in those markets, 
		especially in the hot emerging markets, to keep up with demand. In some 
		strategies, we may want to have more supply and more opportunity to go 
		into a market, but suddenly because of supply it’s constrained and 
		therefore you can’t get the right value points in your investment 
		strategy. What might work in the larger, float-type market doesn’t work 
		in the smaller emerging markets.
GIT: Are custodians meeting 
		the needs of asset managers in an increasingly complex investment arena? 
		How much does Northern Trust outsource compared to what it keeps 
		in-house?
SP: I broadly define asset 
		servicing as including fund administration, middle office and 
		back-office outsourcing. Through outsourcing arrangements with Insight 
		Investment Management, Julius Baer and several other notable fund 
		managers, we actually have become the back office and middle office of 
		four top fund managers. We work with them to move products into new 
		markets and create new wrappers. In the past, when Northern Trust Global 
		Investments launched new products, we used quality third-party 
		providers, but often, given the strategies, we then build our own asset 
		services support. For example, we now are doing our own hedge fund 
		administration and private equity administration. We will build our own 
		exchange-traded funds operations over time and are well positioned in 
		that space.
GIT: Five years from now, 
		where do you see the asset management business and where do you see 
		NTGI?
SP: For a well-run business in 
		these markets, the objective is to double every five years, so I 
		envision being at $1.5 trillion in assets under management in five 
		years, with a strong focus on short duration, quant and multi-manager. 
		The beauty of these products is that they are perpetually in demand, and 
		they are flexible platforms that support growth. They can morph with the 
		changing demands of investors with different indices and different 
		domiciles. Both the quant business and the multi-manager business are 
		easily adaptable. We’re increasingly global in outlook and more 
		sophisticated in our portfolio construction. 
I expect us to both listen to the market and react 
		and build product to meet its needs, but also bring more of our own 
		opinions of the markets to bear in how we work with clients to seize the 
		opportunities ahead.

Northern 
		Trust Global Investments Sets Growth Course Around Multi-Manager, Quant 
		and Alternative Products
Originally published June 9, 2008

Northern 
		Trust Global Investments (NTGI), with $778 billion in assets under 
		management, emphasizes a quantitative approach to money management, with 
		over $280 billion of assets under management focused on the quant space. 
		Its investment strategies include using an array of internally managed 
		products and multiple manager solutions to expose clients to 
		well-researched work by boutique “alpha generators.” At the same time, 
		NTGI is widening the cross-border aspect of its investment approach, 
		portraying itself more as a global company that “just happens to be 
		headquartered in Chicago,” rather than a Chicago-based firm that invests 
		worldwide. Global Investment 
		Technology spoke with Stephen N. Potter who recently took over the 
		helm as President of Northern Trust Global Investments.
GIT: What are some of the key 
		trends shaping the asset management business worldwide which as yet are 
		not widely noticed?
SP: Markets are difficult, and the 
		liabilities for pension funds and demands for countries to be able to 
		maintain or develop wealth are key drivers of change. We see risk 
		avoidance being a key part of the business and therefore a series of 
		strategies are unfolding. We see pension funds being sold into new 
		entities that are financed solely for that purpose. We see pension funds 
		merging with one another in the Netherlands and we see a trend 
		toward liability driven investment. In the Netherlands, several large 
		established pension funds are converting into commercial enterprises, 
		either by leveraging their core competencies or buying other pension 
		funds to gain scale, essentially turning themselves into multi-manager 
		pension factories. This really says that the way we operated in the past 
		is not the way we will operate in the future. I can’t predict if any of 
		these will truly be successful in the long run, but they all represent 
		dynamic change at an accelerated pace.
GIT: How has the pace of 
		technological change changed money management?
SP: Risks and obligations in the 
		pensions market and the acceleration of capital development and wealth 
		creation have changed the way markets operate. Investors’ needs have 
		changed. The opportunity to invest has been somewhat constrained by 
		supply and expected returns of traditional markets. We have seen a very 
		strong movement toward alternative asset classes, including commodities 
		and infrastructure-type products. 
There’s a need to gain absolute return, not just 
		trundle along with the benchmarks of traditional equity indices, for 
		example. The opportunity set has to broaden and value creation needs to

		years, with a strong focus on short duration, quant and multi-manager. 
		The beauty of these products is that they are perpetually in demand, and 
		they are flexible platforms that support growth. They can morph with the 
		changing demands of investors with different indices and different 
		domiciles. Both the quant business and the multi-manager business are 
		easily adaptable. We’re increasingly global in outlook and more 
		sophisticated in our portfolio construction. 
I expect us to both listen to the market and react 
		and build product to meet its needs, but also bring more of our own 
		opinions of the markets to bear in how we work with clients to seize the 
		opportunities ahead.

Potter, Stephen N
Rmi Owner


















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Oregon:













Does Stephen N Potter carry a valid contracting license?



Oregon requires anyone who receives compensation for construction activity (including alterations to real estate) to be licensed by the Oregon Construction Contractors Board.
Stephen N Potter currently holds license 94848 , which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Oregon?



The Oregon Board maintains high standards for contractor licensing. Although they do not require contractors (other than plumbers, electricians and other specialty trades) to have construction training, contractors are required to pass a Board exam prior to receiving their license.











Your liability risk when hiring Stephen N Potter



Licensed contractors in Oregon are required to carry general liability insurance. The exact amount is determined by the type of work they do.











Financial recourse when hiring Stephen N Potter



Licensed contractors in Oregon are required to carry a surety bond (ranging from $10k up to $75k based on their trade), which provides you with financial recourse in case they perform defective work or violate license regulations.
Stephen N Potter has a $15,000 bond with 429 Developers Surety And Indemnity Company. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



In Oregon, it is generally recommended to collect at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

Po Box 8460 Medford, Medford is where our clients will be able to find us. Employing landscapers is costly, which means why throw away even more than is called for?

DD 538 Stephen Potter Embroidered Hat
$29.95





Authentic 5 panel custom US Navy destroyer DD 538 USS Stephen Potter embroidered hat. For an additional small charge, our hats can be personalized with two lines of custom text if desired, such as with a veteran’s name and rate and rank, and years of service. See sample personalization photo for an example. NOTE THAT OUR HATS ARE “DIRECT EMBROIDERY” (DESIGN IS EMBROIDERED DIRECTLY ON THE HAT), AND NOT THE CHEAP (AND IN OUR VIEW UNATTRACTIVE) HEAT TRANSFER “PATCH HATS”.

Additional Information



Product Description
We are happy to offer an authentic 5 panel custom US Navy destroyer DD 538 USS Stephen Potter embroidered hat.
For an additional (and optional) charge of $7.00, our hats can be personalized with up to 2 lines of text of 14 characters each (including spaces), such as with a veteran’s last name and rate and rank on the first line, and years of service on the second line.
Our DD 538 Stephen Potter hat comes in two styles for your choosing. A traditional “high profile” flat bill snap back style (with an authentic green under visor on the bottom of the flat bill), or a modern “medium profile” curved bill velcro back “baseball cap” style. Both styles are “one size fits all”. Our hats are made of durable 100% cotton for breathability and comfort.
Given high embroidery demands on these “made to order” hats, please allow 4 weeks for shipment.

 If you have any questions about our hat offerings, please contact us at 904-425-1204 or e-mail us at [email protected], and we will be happy to speak to you!
