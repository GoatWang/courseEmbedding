Reviews




“In Chemical Control, Michael Crowley sets out a three-stage holistic approach to arms control, and illustrates it by applying it to the regulation of incapacitating chemical agents and riot control agents and their means of delivery. … Here is a strategy in which biologists can apply their expertise and, as the book demonstrates, it has a good chance of working.” (Professor Malcolm Dando, The Biologist, Vol. 64 (1), February, 2017)“His thoroughly-researched book examines in detail ICA weapons, riot control agents (RCAs) and their means of delivery … . Crowley has not only provided a reference work for policymakers and academics alike, but also a solid framework for structuring debates on the future of disarmament and arms control given that science and technology are evolving at a greater speed than the international community can regulate, and that existing treaty regimes can be updated.” (Noel Stott, African Security Review, August, 2016)“Michael Crowley’s Chemical Control is an impressive piece of scholarship and a valuable addition to the literature surrounding use of chemical weapons and riot control agents and their regulation under international law. … this is an excellent book, and … an authoritative reference in the regulation of RCAs and incapacitating chemical agent weapons. It deserves to be widely read and assimilated by lawyers, diplomats, medical professionals, non-governmental organisations, as well as by weapons developers and manufacturers.” (Stuart Maslen, International Journal of Human Rights, Vol. 20 (4), March, 2016)“The monograph offers highly technical and detailed information on the nature of riot control and incapacitating agents and their delivery systems, the research and development behind them, where they are being manufactured and how they are traded … . commend him for offering a solid framework for structuring that particular debate on the future of disarmament and arms control and identifying the fundamental assumptions underlying both concepts.” (Jean Pascal Zanders, The Trench, the-trench.org, March, 2016)“Michael Crowley makes a compelling argument that ambiguities surrounding riot-control and incapacitating chemical agents as well as their means of delivery present a threat to both human and international security. … The pragmatic and authoritative approach adopted within this work means that this book will undoubtedly become a reference work for policy shapers and academics for years to come.” (Dr. Brett Edwards, Contemporary Security Policy, contemporarysecuritypolicy.org, February, 2016)“For anyone considering the evolution of the use of chemical substances in different circumstances along with current regulation, Michael Crowley´s book is a must! He tackles the complicated subject of incapacitating chemical agent (ICA) weapons and riot control agents (RCAs). … I recommend this book not just to people interested in the topic professionally, but most importantly to politicians, diplomats and law enforcement institutions. It is also a must for students of international relations and political sciences … .” (CBRNe World, cbrne.com, February, 2016)“Crowley does a good job of structuring his research in a way that helps the reader make sense of the technical aspects of these weapons as well as the complex array of applicable international law. … Crowley’s book is both an invaluable reference and a useful source of new ideas for addressing two problems stemming from the decision by States to prohibit toxicity as a weapon of war while leaving open its use for law enforcement.” (Neil Davison, International Review of the Red Cross, 2016)“This is a timely book, part of a series looking at governance and regulation issues. It provides an unusual case study in what is deemed ‘holistic arms control’: a three-stage process that is systematically explained here. … The power of this essential book is in the detail, and the same painstaking work will be necessary in the months and years ahead to demonstrate how these sub-lethal chemical weapons are being increasingly used to contain inequality and injustice.” (Steve Wright, Medicine, Conflict and Survival, 2016)“Crowley’s new book and analysis is to be highly recommended to all who are interested in building a world free of a whole class of weapons of mass destruction—chemical weapons—and to those seeking to prevent the re-emergence of deadly chemicals. With almost 100 pages of footnotes and sources, Chemical Control is meticulously documented, making it an excellent reference volume for those interested in arms control, disarmament, relevant multilateral treaties and agreements, as well as national and international enforcement.” (Paul F. Walker, Nonproliferation Review, Vol. 22 (3-4), 2015)'Here is a beautiful and meticulously researched text that needs to be read by everyone working for a world finally free of chemical weapons. It is constructed as a case study in 'holistic' arms control, which is a novel and rich approach that calls for a still wider readership.' Professor Julian Perry Robinson, Harvard Sussex Program on Chemical and Biological Weapons, UK'Michael Crowley's book is an important contribution to the debate about whether law enforcement use of riot control and incapacitating agents would undermine the prohibition of poison weapons. He places a complicated arms control issue into a broader legal and institutional context, and discusses strategies for dealing with these evolving technologies. A much needed book.' Dr Ralf Trapp, International Disarmament Consultant and former senior official at the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), The Netherlands'The development of incapacitating chemical agent based weapons presents a serious threat to the Chemical Weapons Convention. This book explains the importance of transparency on these chemicals, as well as on riot control agents and their means of delivery, and suggests how both types of weapon could be brought under effective international control. This is a pressing task for the OPCW especially in light of recent and repeated use of chemical weapons in the Syrian conflict.' Stefan Mogl, Head of Chemistry Division, Spiez Laboratory, Switzerland, and former Chair, OPCW Scientific Advisory Board

Oakland A's: Executive Profiles









Front Office


Michael Crowley
President

Michael Crowley, one of the rising executives in professional sports today, enters his 12th year with the Athletics' organization and his 11th as team president.  He was named to his current position Sept. 28, 1998 and his tenure as president ranks second longest in Oakland history (since 1968). 
A limited partner in the Athletics ownership group, Crowley is responsible for the overall day-to-day functioning of the Athletics' organization both on the business and baseball sides of the operation, working directly with owner and managing partner Lew Wolff.
In a dual role, Crowley also serves as president of the Major League Soccer's San Jose Earthquakes.  He oversaw the Earthquakes' first-year launch in 2008, and he continues to spearhead the team's efforts to build a new state-of-the-art, soccer-only stadium in San Jose.
After spending three years in the San Jose office of Price Waterhouse and nine years with I.C.I./Fuller O'Brien Paints, Crowley joined the Athletics organization in July 1997 as vice president and chief financial officer. Considered a key figure in the A's resurgence as one of baseball's elite franchises, Crowley has been committed to fielding a championship caliber team with homegrown talent. He works closely with General Manager Billy Beane on key player decisions and issues relating to the baseball operations' overall objectives and philosophies.
Crowley has developed a business model with goals and objectives designed to provide an affordable entertainment product on the field, as well as delivering the absolute highest levels of customer service to fans attending games at the Oakland-Alameda Coliseum. While Crowley stays involved with all aspects of the organization's business affairs, including finance, sales, marketing, public relations and community affairs, he has been at the forefront of building an outstanding team that continues to deliver premium value.
Crowley's leadership skills and business acumen were evident, playing an instrumental role in the negotiations surrounding the team's acquisition of a 143-acre parcel of land in Fremont, the future home of Cisco Field. He continues to take a lead role in the development of the ballpark and surrounding village.
The A's president also perpetuates the Athletics' tradition of commitment to the greater community. Under his leadership, the A's organization continues to be active in the Oakland community and surrounding areas. The Oakland A's Community Fund supports charitable organizations in their efforts to improve educational programs, aid the underprivileged, assist in crime prevention, service children, seniors and those who work to improve the quality of life throughout the Bay Area.
In 1999, Crowley and his wife, Kathy, played a key role in implementing Breast Cancer Awareness Day, which has raised over $1 million for the American Cancer Society over the last 10 years. Crowley currently serves on the Board of Trustees of the Knowledge is Power Program (KIPP), which aims to create a respected, influential and nationwide family of schools that are successful in helping educationally underserved students develop the knowledge, skills and character to succeed in college and the competitive world beyond. He also served on the board of top business executives and community leaders which attempted to land the 2012 Summer Olympic Games in the Bay Area.
A native Californian, the 45-year old Crowley graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 1985 with a degree in business administration with an emphasis in accounting. He earned his MBA from Duke's Fuqua School of Business in 1992. In November of 2002, Crowley was named one of Street & Smith's Sports Business Journal's "40 Under 40", honoring the nation's top sport executives under the age of 40.
Michael resides in Cupertino, Calif., with his wife, Kathy, and their three children.

Michael Crowley
Principal Scientist Computational Biophysics
Michael.Crowley@nrel.gov |
                           								
                              									303-384-6345
                              								



Research Interests
Dr. Michael F. Crowley is a principal scientist in the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's
                  (NREL's) Biosciences Center, having joined the laboratory in 2007 to develop a simulation
                  and theory team. He leads the theory, modeling, and simulation efforts for biofuels
                  research. He is the principal investigator for the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE's)
                  Bioenergy Technologies Office (BETO) project "Biochemical Process Modeling and Simulation,"
                  in which enzyme digestion, metabolic modeling, and reactor and process design are
                  the main thrusts. He is co-principal investigator and leads the modeling thrust of
                  C3Bio, the Energy Frontier Research Center, in which NREL is a partner with Purdue,
                  and multiple other collaborative projects in biofuels and computational chemistry
                  research. He and his team maintain a level of productivity that produces on the order
                  of 15 peer-reviewed articles a year and as many presentations, and they are regarded
                  internationally as arguably the most productive and authoritative center for biofuel
                  and biomass simulation and theory.
               
Crowley is a developer of both CHARMM and Amber molecular dynamics software for biological
                  macromolecular simulation and has contributed significant advances to highly parallel,
                  high-performance scientific software for use on supercomputers. Until recently his
                  team included Antti-Pekka Hynninen, who is pushing the frontier of scientific simulation
                  using the most up-to-date computer hardware available in preparation for future computer
                  architectures. Crowlely's group has designed and implemented new methods and algorithms
                  specifically for biomass and biofuel-related questions.
               
An author on more than 130 peer-reviewed scientific articles, Crowley has given more
                  than 200 presentations, more than 50 of those being by invitation.
               
Crowley received his B.S. in chemistry from Fordham University, and his M.S. and Ph.D.
                  in physical chemistry from the University of Montana, with a short period of study
                  at the University of Alberta. His postdoctoral fellowship was at Brandeis University
                  with Dr. Irving Epstein. His doctoral and post-doctoral research was studying coupled
                  chemical oscillators and coupled nonlinear differential equations, and it was the
                  only study to date of nonforced coupled chemical reactions showing synchronization,
                  locking, and chaotic behaviors. In his time as assistant professor at Penn State University,
                  Crowley moved to studies of semiconductor surfaces. At West Virginia University, he
                  applied the nonlinear dynamical theories to controlling chaos in chemical oscillators
                  and flame fronts. In addition, at Carnegie Mellon University and the Pittsburgh Supercomputing
                  Center, and at The Scripps Research Institute with David Case and Charles Brooks,
                  Crowley developed highly parallel methods for simulations of bio-macromolecules.

Areas of Expertise
Biomass Degrading Enzyme Biophysics and Design
Cellulases and other biomass-active enzymes are used in the industrial conversion
                  of biomass to its components for further upgrading to fuels and products. Research
                  on these enzymes is focused on determining the mechanism of action, thermodynamics,
                  and barriers in the enzymatic digestion of plant cell walls. Using molecular mechanics
                  and dynamics with advanced sampling methods, Crowley and his team determine free energies
                  such as binding of substrates, conformational changes, reaction profiles, and barriers,
                  with the aim of gaining basic understanding of how the enzymes work and how they can
                  be engineered to work more efficiently for better fuel production. The team has had
                  successes with many cellulases and lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases, uncovering
                  the mechanisms of their CBMs, linkers, active sites, and binding sites, and predicting
                  mutational changes for better performance.

                        face of cellulose.

                        amino acids (yellow), which are present all the way until their product is expelled.
                     


Cellulose, Hemicellulose, Other Plant Cell Wall Materials
Cellulose is the most plentiful biopolymer on Earth. The research of Crowley and his
                  team discovers the intricacies of cell-wall polymer structure and function and their
                  interactions to form cell wall architecture. The aim has traditionally been to understand
                  the substrate of the enzymes studied in order to improve both the enzymes and the
                  pretreatment methods, with the long-term goal of possibly changing the cellulose that
                  has been produced by plants. The team is expanding research to study material properties.
                  Strong publications in cellulose structure including force field analysis, polymorph
                  studies, decrystallization thermodynamics, and structural understanding such as how
                  twist occurs in cellulose are being published. The team's efforts are also directed
                  toward understanding the production of cell wall materials through synthase, transferase,
                  and assembly modeling and simulation.

Cellulose fibril twist studied to determine source of twisting in hydrogen bonding
                  patterns. This modeling will help to understand the interactions that are important
                  in cell walls and in breaking them down to component sugars to be upgraded to fuels.
               
Cellulosomes
In BESC, the computational modeling has centered on the mechanisms of recalcitrance
                  and bacterial conversion of cell wall material. One of the most fascinating and effective
                  mechanisms found in bacteria is the cellulosome approach in which anywhere from a
                  few to tens of enzymes and other cell-wall-active components are assembled on scaffolds,
                  which may be tethered to the bacterium bind and act on plant cell walls to depolymerize
                  cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin to oligomers that can be upgraded within the
                  bacterial cell.

                        its enzyme components have many cellulose-binding domains that result in the binding
                        behavior viewed here.

Sugar Upgrading Enzyme Biophysics and Design
In the Biochemical Platform of the BETO, Crowley leads the Biochemical Process Modeling
                  and Simulation Project, which partners with experimental approaches to producing fuels
                  and high-value products from sugars and lignin. The modeling is directed at bottlenecks
                  in the molecular and metabolic processes involved in transport and upgrading. This
                  includes enzyme design for selectivity, activity, pH and temperature optimization,
                  and prediction of mutations and heterologous pathway design.
               

Thioesterase is a key enzyme in producing fatty acids from sugars in the pathway from
                  sugars to diesel and aviation fuels by microbes.
               
Molecular Dynamics and Simulation Code Development
CHARMM and Amber code development is an integral part of Crowley's work. He has been
                  a developer of Amber and CHARMM since 1995 and has contributed to the high-performance
                  aspects of both and he has led efforts to modernize them. The development of the fast
                  DOMDEC code in CHARMM was led by Crowley through the heroic efforts of Antti-Pekka
                  Hynninen at NREL and has brought CHARMM to the level of performance of other high-performing
                  codes carrying with it the vast and unparalleled scientific functionality and the
                  introduction of parallel GPU implementations. This work continues with new methods
                  of sampling that harness the immense computational power of the leadership-class machines
                  in DOE and the XSEDE centers.

I had 2 dogs and 3 cats and friends with allergies. I now have 1 dog left. My allergy filled friends can now come over and have very few problems. I saw what they pulled out of the ducts, GROSS! This past Friday, I had another company come because I had a coupon. They were late, dumped the dirty water in my street, and didn't get the carpets all clean despite cleaning 5-6 mos earlier. My dog got horribly sick on the carpet on Sunday. Extreme Steam was here at 1130 on Monday. The new stains are gone, and the spots that "won't ever get clean" now look brand new again. And it'll be dry in 6 hours instead of some of the spots took 36 hours to dry. My mom's socks were black on the carpet after the previous company. I'll never call anyone else again.Extreme Steam Carpet Cleaningloree.bourbon ratedvery happy with the service, c...very happy with the service, carpet cleaning.
