Penumbra Is Where...





Your Work Has Meaning


Your Ideas Matter


Learning and Growth Are Constant


Your Efforts Are Rewarded




Penumbra's products are transforming health care. Whether you are monitoring a clinical trial, designing the next breakthrough medical device, or building prototypes in the lab, saving lives is our top priority.






At Penumbra, we are changing the paradigm of treatment for stroke, and continuing to expand our technologies and portfolios, such that they touch the entire vascular system.

Don
Quality Engineering Manager








From the get-go, I decided I wanted to make with my hands. I wanted to do the magic that makes medical devices happen. And at the end of the day, what are we doing? We are saving lives.

Raymond
Inventory & Logistics Specialist






At Penumbra, finding ways to improve what we do is an important part of everyone's job. Cross-functional teams identify challenges and cooperate to drive solutions every day. We learn from our challenges and move forward as a stronger team because of the problems we have solved.






Everyone gets in a room and figures things out as a team.  The ability to collaborate, to see the bigger picture and our role in it, is a huge part of what makes people successful here.

Holly
R&D Manager








I have the freedom and flexibility to be really creative to find solutions for our customers. I thrive in an environment that is solution-oriented to ensure we are truly being a partner to our customers.

Collette
Director of Strategic Accounts






We encourage people to take on tasks they may never have imagined doing. We have learned that our best investment is the one we make in each employee, helping to grow their skills and knowledge, and empowering them to take the lead in the future.






I took the initiative to let my supervisor and lead know that I wanted to learn more, and always asked how I could help. They immediately took me up on my offer, and got me engaged with more than just building the product.  I wouldn’t be here as a supervisor at this moment if it wasn’t for that supervisor who said, ‘Hey, you’re ready, go for it.'

Cheryl
Production Supervisor








The future of Penumbra excites me because of the incredible innovation that happens here. The product is constantly evolving, and as a company we are always growing. I wonder…what will they think of next? What will I be working on next?

Aicha
QA Product Surveillance Specialist






Penumbra offers top-tier benefits that enable our employees to provide what's best for their families and build for the future. In addition to medical, dental, vision, and life insurance, full-time Penumbra employees can take advantage of a 401(k) match and an Employee Stock Purchase Plan.






Even as a relatively new engineer, I’m doing work that I’m really excited about and I have a lot of responsibility. I get to run a project taking a product from R&D to commercialization with an R&D counterpart. It’s not something people would get to do elsewhere.

Nisha
Manufacturing Engineer








We take every opportunity to celebrate wins. When new products are launched, everyone involved, across multiple departments, gets together to celebrate. That in itself goes a long way, not just to say thank you, but to inspire people to say, ‘let’s do it again!’

Ervion
Production Manager

Alex
Principal R&D Engineer
















Stephanie
Customer Service Supervisor
















Ian
Manufacturing Engineering Manager

Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresIn addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company uses results on constant currency as a non-GAAP financial measure in this press release.
Our constant currency revenue disclosures estimate the impact of changes in foreign currency rates on the translation of the Company's current period revenue as compared to the applicable comparable period in the prior year. This impact is derived by taking the current local currency revenue and translating it into U.S. dollars based upon the foreign currency exchange rates used to translate the local currency revenue for the applicable comparable period in the prior year, rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the current period. It does not include any other effect of changes in foreign currency rates on the Company's results or business.
Full reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is set forth in the tables below.
Our management believes the non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this press release are useful to investors in assessing the operating performance of our business and provide meaningful comparisons to prior periods and thus a more complete understanding of our business than could be obtained absent this disclosure. Specifically, we consider the change in constant currency revenue as a useful metric as it provides an alternative framework for assessing how our underlying business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations.
The non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release may be different from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to GAAP measures. We urge investors to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures included in this press release, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.
Forward-Looking StatementsExcept for historical information, certain statements in this press release are forward-looking in nature and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about us. Our business and operations are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties and, consequently, actual results may differ materially from those projected by any forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from those projected include, but are not limited to: failure to sustain or grow profitability or generate positive cash flows; failure to effectively introduce and market new products; delays in product introductions; significant competition; inability to further penetrate our current customer base, expand our user base and increase the frequency of use of our products by our customers; inability to achieve or maintain satisfactory pricing and margins; manufacturing difficulties; permanent write-downs or write-offs of our inventory; product defects or failures; unfavorable outcomes in clinical trials; inability to maintain our culture as we grow; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; and potential adverse regulatory actions. These risks and uncertainties, as well as others, are discussed in greater detail in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 filed with the SEC on February 28, 2017. There may be additional risks of which we are not presently aware or that we currently believe are immaterial which could have an adverse impact on our business. Any forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations, estimates and assumptions regarding future events and are applicable only as of the dates of such statements. We make no commitment to revise or update any forward-looking statements in order to reflect events or circumstances that may change.











 1 Constant currency results are non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below for important information about our use of constant currency results (including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures).

Penumbra Inc. Recalls 3D Revascularization Device Due to Wire Material That May Break or Separate During Use

The FDA has identified this as a Class I recall, the most serious type of recall. Use of these devices may cause serious injuries or death. 
Recalled Product

Penumbra 3D Revascularization Device
Lot Numbers: C00644, C00645, C00646, C00717
Distribution Dates: May 15, 2017 to June 7, 2017
Manufacturing Dates: March 31, 2017 to April 28, 2017
Devices Recalled in the U.S.: 155 nationwide


Device Use
As part of the Penumbra System, the Penumbra 3D Revascularization device is intended to restore blood flow or remove thrombus (blood clot) within a blood vessel in the brain during an acute ischemic stroke in patients who are ineligible for or fail intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV t-PA) therapy.
Reason for Recall
Penumbra Inc. is recalling the Penumbra 3D Revascularization device because there is a risk of the delivery wire breaking or separating during use. Fractured pieces of the delivery wire could be left inside the patient’s brain bloodstream, and this or the attempts made to retrieve the fractured pieces, can make the stroke worse. This can also cause other serious adverse health consequences such as continued blockage of blood vessels, completion of the stroke, and death.
Who May be Affected

Health care providers using this device during revascularization procedures
All patient groups undergoing procedures involving the Penumbra 3D Revascularization device

What to Do
On June 9, 2017, Penumbra Inc. sent an Urgent Voluntary Removal notice to all affected customers. The notice asked customers to:

Identify and remove any affected 3D Revascularization devices from inventory and quarantine.
Complete and return the Penumbra Product Identification/Return Notification by fax at 1-510-217-6414 or email at RAQA@penumbrainc.com.

Penumbra Inc. will contact customers directly to arrange return of affected units and replacement of returned product, free of charge.
Contact Information
Health care professionals and customers may contact their Penumbra sales representative or Penumbra Customer Service at 1-888-272-4606, between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Pacific Standard Time or by email at RAQA@penumbrainc.com with any questions related to this recall.
Date Recall Initiated
June 8, 2017  
How do I report a problem?
Health care professionals and consumers may report adverse reactions or quality problems they experienced using these devices to MedWatch: The FDA Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting Program either online, by regular mail or by FAX to 1-800-FDA-0178.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
