February 24, 1937 - October 4, 2016 Angus Murdoch McBryde, Jr. of Columbia, South Carolina passed away unexpectedly on October 4, 2016. Born in Durham, North Carolina on February 24, 1937, he was the oldest child of Dr. Angus Murdoch McBryde, Sr. and Priscilla Gregory McBryde. Dr. McBryde received his undergraduate degree from Davidson College where he excelled in both academics and sports. His love and support of Davidson continued throughout his lifetime whether as team physician, Board of Trustees member or general support of Wildcat activities. As a runner, he held numerous records, including being named the 1958 Southern Conference Mile Champion and served as captain of both cross country and track teams. Dr. McBryde was subsequently inducted into the Davidson College Sports Hall of Fame in 2007. After Davidson, Dr. McBryde went to Duke Medical School and soon discovered medicine was his true calling as it was for his father, a Durham pediatrician and member of the original faculty at Duke Medical School. At Duke, he was Senior Class President and also served as National Vice President of the Student American Medical Association. After medical school, Dr. McBryde conducted his internship and residency in general surgery at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. He then spent the following two years in the U.S. Navy as a medical officer on the U.S.S. St. Paul and at Balboa Naval Hospital in San Diego during the Vietnam War. Dr. McBryde then went on to complete his orthopaedic residency at Duke in the ensuing years and in 1971 was appointed Clinical Assistance Professor of Orthopaedics at Duke and later that year joined the orthopaedic teaching program at Charlotte Memorial Hospital (now Carolinas Medical Center). Dr. McBryde, in his long and distinguished medical career that followed, earned numerous accolades and awards, including Alabama Sports Person of the Year, 2012 Distinguished Southern Orthopaedist and 2013 Distinguished Alumnus of Duke Medical School. Dr. McBryde led as Chair of the Departments of Orthopaedic Surgery for the University of South Alabama at Mobile and the University of South Carolina in Charleston. He was team doctor for the Gamecocks in Columbia and served as medical director for the USC athletic department. While in Birmingham he was team doctor for Alabama, Auburn and Troy. He also directed the Ankle and Foot Fellowship Program at the American Sports Medicine Institute in Birmingham, AL where he practiced at the Andrews Sports Medicine and Orthopaedic Center. He co-founded and was president of the Southern Orthopaedic Association and president of the Southern Medical Association. He was currently serving as chairman of the Senior Physician Section of the AMA. He enjoyed serving in other leadership positions in his specialty field. He also served on 11 editorial boards and published more than 70 scholarly publications including 2 books. A noted academician and skilled surgeon with nationally-recognized expertise in sports medicine, Dr. McBryde served as team physician for the World Games in Yugoslavia in 1987 and for the U.S. National Team for both the Seoul and Atlanta summer Olympics. Dr. McBryde's love of medicine was constantly on display in the extraordinary and generous care he showed his patients and all those in need of orthopaedic advice over the length of his career. Dr. McBryde took the adage, "Time waits for no man," to heart, living each day of his life quite literally to its fullest. Angus was a loving husband, father and friend and will be missed by all who had the privilege to know him. Dr. McBryde is survived by his loving wife of 27 years, Kay McBryde of Columbia, South Carolina; his sister Read M. Spence and her husband Jim of Greensboro, NC and his brother Neill G. McBryde and his wife Peggy of Charlotte, NC; children of his first marriage to Jane Rostan McBryde: sons, Angus M. McBryde III and his wife Margaret of Charlotte, NC and Dr. JP McBryde and his wife Karen of Abu Dhabi, UAE; daughters, Dr. Holly McBryde Mason and her husband Dr. John Mason of Charlottesville, VA and Mary McBryde and her husband George Newcomb of Norwich, VT; ten grandchildren: Grace McBryde, Jane McBryde, Lea McBryde, Rostan McBryde, Gillie McBryde, John Mason, Mary Holland Mason, Mac Mason, Maddie Newcomb, and Angus Newcomb; the children and grandchildren of Kay McBryde who he embraced, Mary Beth O'Briant and Sam of John's Creek, GA and their children John, Will and Charlie; Peter Joseph Brennan, Jr. of Charlotte, NC and his children Kelli and Britani; Catherine Parker Brennan of Charleston, SC and her children Parker and Vann; and Anna Kelly Brennan of Birmingham, AL and her children Elizabeth and Jacob. In addition, Dr. McBryde leaves behind numerous nieces and nephews who loved him greatly. A memorial service will be held to celebrate Dr. McBryde's life in Charlotte, NC at Christ Episcopal Church, 1412 Providence Road, on Tuesday, October 11, 2016 at 2:00 pm. Visitation for family and close friends will be held at 6PM on Monday, October 10 at 6-8PM at the home of his son Angus McBryde III, 1932 Dilworth Rd. West, Charlotte, NC. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations be made to Davidson College for The McBryde Family Scholarship Fund, P.O. Box 7170, Davidson, NC 28035 or to the Southern Orthopaedic Association for the Angus M. McBryde, JR MD Memorial Fund c/o Chuck Freitag 110 West Rd. Ste.227 Towson MD 21204.
