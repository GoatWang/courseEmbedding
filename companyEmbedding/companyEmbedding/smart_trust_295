Discover the five trust actions that will help individuals minimize risk while maximizing possibilities.

















THE CHALLENGE
We live in a low-trust world surrounded by crises and challenges. Who can you trust? How can you trust? 

Choosing Smart Trust will enable you to operate with high-trust in a low-trust and unpredictable marketplace. The more unpredictable it becomes, the more your sound judgment and ability to trust in this low-trust world will give you a tremendous competitive advantage—and the capacity to navigate the uncertainty low trust creates.
 
Based on the book, Smart Trust, by Stephen M. R. Covey and Greg Link, this LiveClicks on-demand workshop will help you understand how trust issues impact every situation in life. In fact, trusted people are more likely to get hired or promoted, get the best projects and bigger budgets, and are last to be laid off. In Smart Trust, you will learn the five trust actions that will help you minimize risk while maximizing possibilities. This course will teach you the tools you need to extend Smart Trust, which will help you enjoy greater prosperity, energy, and joy—both personally and professionally.

Product Details  Description  Specification  Q&A DescriptionSeries 295 Compact Rotary Smart Positioner  Low Cost, Rotary OperationItem are a compact, high performance unit with a low price. Series 295 models accurately control the valve stroke of rotary motion valves, such as W.E. Anderson ball or butterfly valves, according to an input signal of 4 to 20 mA from the controller. Its rugged, durable design makes it ideal for harsh environments. The NEMA 4X (IP66) enclosure rating protects the highly efficient microprocessing unit inside the Smart Positioner. An analog feedback signal is outputted to stabilize any valve system and easy to use functions such as auto calibration ensure the accuracy of the unit. Low air consumption reduces operating cost, but does not sacrifice the performance of the Smart Positioner. The handheld size of this unit makes it easy to use with any size actuator, and can be used in applications where a larger positioner may not fit. Series 295 Smart Positioners feature a LCD screen attached to the outer surface of the unit, allowing for an easy inspection of the positioner condition while in the field.SpecificationInput Signal  4 to 20 mA DCInput Impedance  460 Ω max @ 20 mA DCEnclosure  AluminumAir Supply  35 to 116 psi Air Connection  1/4" NPTGage Connection  1/8" NPTConduit Connection  1/2" NPTLinearity  ±0.5% FSHysteresis  ±0.5% FSSensitivity  ±0.2% FSRepeatability  ±0.3% FSAir Consumption  .0004 scfm (.01 LPM) at 20 psig supplyFlow Capacity  .32 scfm (9 LPM) at 20 psig supplyStroke  0 to 90°Enclosure Rating  NEMA 4X (IP66)Operating Temperature  -22 to 185°FModel Weight  1.8 lb Question And Answer×Send an InquiryPlease complete this contact form to have a member of our team contact you to complete this transaction.

Frequently Asked Questions






             Installation and configuration



I get an error during installation.


















To solve errors like:


"Unrecognized USB device"

"Device driver software was not successfully installed"

"Can not find driver"

Please follow the installation trouble shooting guide.







         Usage



The characters on the keyboard don't correspond to the characters that I type on the TV. How can I change the lay-out?


















Make sure that the keyboard is supporting this layout (e.g. you have a keyboard with a UK layout and you would like to use it on your TV with a German (DE) layout. In this case, the characters on the screen will not correspond with the keyboard.) 
your TV is supporting this language and language is selected in your smart TV as an input language(s). 

The steps to change the language layout vary per TV brand / model.
You can usually find this in the settings on your TV, such as:
Menu -System > Device Manager > Keyboard settings > Options Keyboard > Keyboard Language
However, per brand / model, the above naming can be different.


See an example of how to set the input language layout correctly for a Samsung Smart TV on 
YouTube.




Is it required to turn off the product to save power?


















This product has advanced power saving features.
Turning off the product by removing the batteries is not required, but optional.







         Solving problems



I get the wrong letters and/or symbols when typing on my computer.


















Set the correct language as explained in the keyboard settings page




Sometimes letters are missing when typing.



















Clean your keyboard from dust and crumbles.
If you are using it with a TV, make sure that your TV and/or the app, supports all symbols and characters of the keyboard.

Improve wireless performance.
See wireless troubleshooting page






I have lost/broken the USB-receiver. How do I receive a new USB-receiver?


















It's not possible to provide a replacement receiver for this product.
This is due to the fact that during production the product and receiver receive a unique code, so the product can only communicate with the bundled original receiver.




When I use the YouTube or Netflix app the keyboard is not working properly.


















This keyboard should work with different apps. 

However, there is a known issue with Samsung TV's and keyboards from different brands, and the non-functioning of apps such as YouTube and Netflix

We suggest to contact Samsung for more information and possible solutions. 





My touchpad is not working. What do I do?


















Please make sure that your TV supporting HID mouse and keyboard is recognised by the TV also as HID mouse. 

Please check the properties of your TV to verify how the keyboard is recognised. 




Where is your service center? Or where can I send my product to be repaired?


















Unfortunately, we do not have service centers to repair products.
A defective product should be replaced by your point of purchase during the warranty period.




My Trust product is not working.


















Follow the steps in the trouble shooting guide.




My product is faulty. What do I do?


















We offer a 'return to retailer' warranty on our products.
In case of a defect, you can return the product to your retailer with failure description, proof of purchase and all accessories.
During the warranty period you will receive a replacement product from the retailer if available.

For full warranty conditions you can consult:
http://www.trust.com/support/warranty







         Compatibility



Is my Smart TV compatible with this product?


















The keyboard is compatible with all models of SmartTV/devices that support the mouse and keyboard function.

The documentation of your TV should mention this bit of information.

Otherwise the manufacturer of the TV should be able to verify if the TV has this type of support.

*Estimated Net Annual First Year Distribution per unit is computed by dividing the estimated annual income of the underlying securities less the expense per unit by the number of units outstanding. The estimated net annual distributions for subsequent years are expected to be less than estimated distributions for the first year because a portion of the securities included in the trust portfolio will be sold during the  first year to pay for organization costs, the creation and development fee and the deferred sales charge. The actual net annual distributions will vary with changes in the trust’s fees and expenses and income of the underlying securities.

*Estimated Net Annual First Year Distribution per unit is computed by dividing the estimated annual income of the underlying securities less the expense per unit by the number of units outstanding. The estimated net annual distributions for subsequent years are expected to be less than estimated distributions for the first year because a portion of the securities included in the trust portfolio will be sold during the  first year to pay for organization costs, the creation and development fee and the deferred sales charge. The actual net annual distributions will vary with changes in the trust’s fees and expenses and income of the underlying securities.
