MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATION.
This section of this annual report includes a number of forward-looking
statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and
financial performance. Forward-looking statements are often identified by words
like: believe, expect, estimate, anticipate, intend, project and similar
expressions, or words which, by their nature, refer to future events. You should
not place undue certainty on these forward-looking statements, which apply only
as of the date of this report. These forward-looking statements are subject to
certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ
materially from historical results or our predictions.
We are a start-up stage corporation and have not started operations or generated
or realized any revenues from our business operations.



                                       8



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion.  This means that our auditors
believe there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business
for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills.
 This is because we have not generated any revenues and no revenues are
anticipated.  Accordingly, we must raise cash from sources other than
operations.  Our only other source for cash at this time is investments by
others in our company.



Plan of Operation



All of the information following is based upon estimates. We are a start-up
company, or in other words, a company with a limited operating history, since
our operations have been limited to incorporating Lotus Bio-Technology
Development Corp. (formerly known as Starflick.com); issuing stock to Zoltan
Nagy, our former sole officer and director; developing our business plan and
began developing our website. After much consideration the Company began to
explore lucrative opportunities in other sectors and decided to focus on the
refining and marketing of organic materials. Management has changed as Zoltan
Nagy resigned and Michael Palethorpe was announced as new President and CEO. The
Company also moved offices to Cave Creek Arizona from Point Roberts in
Washington. Lotus Bio-Technology is an Arizona based bio-technology Development
Company that intends to specialize in the refining of organic materials and the
production of natural consumer related products. Our mandate is to grow various
plants under strict organic standards and produce organic based consumer related
products which completely natural. The hope the products will strike a balance
between affordability and produced from an environmentally responsible way and
not be grown with pesticides, synthetic fertilizers, antibiotics, growth
hormones or other dangerous chemicals while ensuring a solid financial return
for our shareholders.



Milestones



Over the next six months, we plan to update and increase our sales and marketing
strategy to sell an increased variety of products in the Asian market.
Limited operating history; need for additional capital
There is no historical financial information about us upon which to base an
evaluation of our performance.  We are in a start-up stage operations and have
not generated any revenues. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our
business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the
establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources
and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services and
products.
We have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable
terms.  If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to
continue, develop or expand our operations. Equity financing could result in
additional dilution to existing shareholders.
Results of operations
During the period June 30, 2016 through March 30, 2017, we have been continuing
our pursuit of potential Organic business partnerships both local and abroad.



                                       9



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Liquidity and capital resources
As of March 31, 2017, our total assets were $5,463 and our total liabilities
were $66,771 including $51,458 owing to Zoltan Nagy, our majority shareholder
for advances made by him on our behalf.  As of March 31, 2017, we had cash and
cash equivalents of $5.



Stock Dividend



During the year ended March 31, 2015, we declared a 29 for 1 stock dividend.

Lotus Biotechnology Development Corporation/Lotus Medical CBD Moves to Enhance Product Line with New Premium Organic CBD MerchandiseBack to LBTD Snapshot

Share Story8:45AM ET 11/11/2016 PRNewswire

Lotus Technologies Moves into Position to Meet Bolstering Industry Demand with Next Week's Release of Products on the Company's Website, LotusMedicalCBD.com, as California's Proposition 64 Brings Legalization to the Most Populated State in the U.S., and Other States Follow Suit


PHOENIX, Nov. 11, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- (OTC Pink: LBTD) Lotus Biotechnology Development, Corp. is pleased to announce that the Company prepares to release its premium organic Cannabinoid derived products, enabling the Lotus Biotechnologies to aggressively compete in the CBD sector of the ever-strengthening legal US market. These movements now position the Company to bring exclusive premium organic CBD products to a greatly widened marketplace, bolstering the Company's already remarkable growth potential.
The Company has formulated a line of top quality blends by enhancing its premium organic products with the integration of pharmaceutical marijuana. Management is strategizing the branding, marketing, and sales, finalizing product development, and preparing to conclude manufacturing on the Company's first line of exclusive organic CBD products to hit the retail market.
"We are excited to be at the threshold of a new age in the cannabis industry, and having built our operation to the point at which we currently stand, we are delighted to be so well positioned as lucrative new venues open and demands rise," stated Michael Palethorpe, Chief Executive Officer and President, Lotus Biotechnologies.
As a growing number of states have recently legalized medical and recreational distribution, the demand for quality CBD products is expected to experience a sharp incline. On November the 8th, the industry achieved a notable victory expanding the legal marketplace to include Florida, Arkansas, Montana, and North Dakota on a medical level, while Massachusetts, Nevada, and California legalized recreational marijuana. 
In a recent article featured in the Washington Post it was stated: "This is the most momentous Election Day in history for the movement to end marijuana prohibition," Rob Kampia of the Marijuana Policy Project, a group that supported a number of the legalization initiatives, said in a statement. "The end of prohibition is near…" 
Mr. Palethorpe concluded: "As we continue to fortify our top quality line of organic CBD enhanced merchandise, we maintain a focus driven toward the continual strengthening of our position. There is so much room for profitability in this continually growing market, and we intend to capitalize on the amazing opportunity to lead with premium organics in the emergent CBD markets. As details on these products are finalized and prepared for release, we will be prompt to update the investment community."
Lotus Biotechnologies has formed a strong team to produce and process the Company's Organic materials in new strands of CBD that are slated for sales in four states with licensing in place. With the Company's newly formed group and processing plant, Lotus Biotechnologies has launched its first subsidiary. Details can be found at http://lotusmedicalcbd.com/#products. 
The size of the market for legal marijuana in the United States is projected to grow to $7.1 billion in 2016, according to a report by New Frontier and ArcView Market Research. That represents 26% growth over the previous year, driven largely by adult recreational sales of marijuana, according to research cited on Forbes.com website.

These statements are any statements that are not of historical fact and may be deemed to be forward-looking statements made by management that express their belief at the time they are made regarding the Company's results of operations, possible profits, financial developments business activities, and potential for success in various aspects of our operations.
