Recommendations 
“I have known Jim since he recruited me out of Abbott Laboratories in 1990. Since then I have used Jim almost exclusively when recruiting key talent into many R/D organizations. Over the years I have hired at least 30 R/D professionals using Jim into various companies including J&J LifeScan, Aradigm Corporation, Smith and Nephew and OmniSonics Medical Technologies.  
I have never had a placement that did not work out. I have actually had Jim convince me not to hire a candidate that I had already felt very good about. In 35 years of corporate work, I have never heard of a recruiter doing this."

Max Fiore, Sr. VP R&D


 

 
“If you’re just starting your career or if it’s been a while since you were job hunting, this is the place to start. Jim has decades of solid experience in helping candidates find the right position. More importantly, he really thinks about it and understands what it takes to find the right match. I also really enjoy his mystery books!”



Rick Thompson, CEO ReShape Medical

 

 
Jim is one of the premiere technical recruiters in the medical device/diagnostics industry. He has wide connections within the industry, and can quickly match quality candidates to the right opportunity. Jim delivers on his promises, and as you can tell from his website, he is also an interesting and fun person to work with!


Robert Dodge, Ph.D., Vice President R&D, Idexx Laboratories
