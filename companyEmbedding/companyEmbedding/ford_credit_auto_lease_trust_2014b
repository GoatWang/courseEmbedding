Fitch Affirms Ford Credit Auto Lease Trust 2014-B | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms Ford Credit Auto Lease Trust 2014-B
    





July 13, 2015 02:07 PM Eastern Daylight Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings for Ford Credit Auto Lease Trust 
      2014-B and revised the Rating Outlook to Positive on one class. A full 
      list of rating actions follows at the end of this press release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The affirmation of the class A and B notes reflects loss coverage levels 
      consistent with their current rating. Hard credit enhancement (CE) has 
      grown for all classes since close, and residual performance is 
      consistent with Fitch's initial expectations. The Outlook revision of 
      the class B notes to Positive from Stable reflects a potential upgrade 
      in the next one to two years.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults or deterioration in 
      vehicle values could produce loss levels higher than the current 
      expectations, and impact available loss coverage. Lower loss coverage 
      could impact ratings and Rating Outlooks, depending on the extent of the 
      decline in coverage.
    

      To date, the transaction has exhibited strong credit and residual 
      performance, inside Fitch's initial expectations with rising loss 
      coverage. Due to the growing credit enhancement levels and increased 
      loss coverage afforded to the notes, a substantial deterioration in used 
      vehicle values would have to occur to have a negative impact on the 
      updated ratings.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      No third party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.
    

      For Fitch's initial Key Rating Drivers, Rating Sensitivities and the 
      full detail analysis for this transaction, please see the New Issue 
      report dated July 22, 2014. Fitch's analysis of the Representations and 
      Warranties (R&W) of this transaction can be found in 'Ford Credit Auto 
      Least Trust 2014-B - Appendix'. These R&W are compared to those of 
      typical R&W for the asset class as detailed in the special report 
      'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in Global 
      Structured Finance Transactions' dated March 26, 2015.
    

      Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:
    

      --Class A-2a affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-2b affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-3 notes affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-4 notes affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable
    

      --Class B notes affirmed at 'AAsf'; Outlook revised to Positive from 
      Stable.

Key Rating Drivers Strong Credit Quality: Credit quality for the pool is consistent with that of  recent pools. The weighted average (WA) Fair Isaac Corp. (FICO) score is 746 and  WA original term is 34.1 months, with 79.14% of the leases with terms of 36  months or more. The pool is geographically diverse with approximately 10 months  of seasoning and comprises 100% new vehicles. Adequate Credit Enhancement Structure: 2014-B is a sequential-pay structure.  Initial hard credit enhancement (CE) for the class A notes totals 20.40% (8.70%  subordinated class B and C notes, 11.20% initial overcollateralization, and  0.50% reserve). Consistent Lease Maturities: 2014-B consists of 71.73% undiscounted base  residual value (RV), which is in line with prior pools. The lease maturities are  well distributed. However, there are six months that represent more than 5% of  the total base RV with a highest single-month period in February 2017 accounting  for 7.41% and 56.63% of the pool maturing two years following close. Evolving Wholesale Market: The U.S. wholesale vehicle market has remained strong  in recent years. However, increasing off-lease vehicle supply and pressure from  increased production levels could lead to decreased residual realization during  the life of the transaction. Stable Corporate Health: Fitch currently rates the long-term IDR of Ford (the  parent of Ford Credit) and Ford Credit 'BBB-' with a Positive Rating Outlook.  Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: Ford Credit demonstrates good  capabilities as originator, underwriter and servicer. This is evidenced by  historical delinquency, credit, and residual value loss performance of its  managed portfolio and securitizations. Fitch deems Ford Credit capable of  adequately servicing 2014-B. Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should provide  that a bankruptcy of Ford Credit would not impair the timeliness of payments on  the securities. Rating Sensitivities Unanticipated decreases in the value of returned vehicles and/or increases in  the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could  produce loss levels higher than the base case. This in turn could result in  negative rating actions on the notes. Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the  ratings assigned to Ford Credit Auto Lease Trust 2014-B to increased credit and  residual losses over the life of the transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the transaction displays some sensitivity to  increased defaults and credit losses, showing downgrades of one rating category  under Fitch's 1.5x base case loss scenario. Additionally, downgrades of one or  two rating categories were seen under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss)  scenario.  The transaction shows significantly more sensitivity to residual loss  volatility. As such, under its severe residual loss scenario, Fitch would expect  to downgrade the class of notes by two or more rating categories.

The pool is geographically diverse with approximately 10 months of seasoning and comprises 100% new vehicles.Adequate Credit Enhancement Structure: 2014-B is a sequential-pay structure. Initial hard credit enhancement (CE) for the class A notes totals 20.40% (8.70% subordinated class B and C notes, 11.20% initial overcollateralization, and 0.50% reserve).Consistent Lease Maturities: 2014-B consists of 71.73% undiscounted base residual value (RV), which is in line with prior pools. The lease maturities are well distributed. However, there are six months that represent more than 5% of the total base RV with a highest single-month period in February 2017 accounting for 7.41% and 56.63% of the pool maturing two years following close.Evolving Wholesale Market: The U.S. wholesale vehicle market has remained strong in recent years. However, increasing off-lease vehicle supply and pressure from increased production levels could lead to decreased residual realization during the life of the transaction.Stable Corporate Health: Fitch currently rates the long-term IDR of Ford (the parent of Ford Credit) and Ford Credit 'BBB-' with a Positive Rating Outlook. Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: Ford Credit demonstrates good capabilities as originator, underwriter and servicer. This is evidenced by historical delinquency, credit, and residual value loss performance of its managed portfolio and securitizations. Fitch deems Ford Credit capable of adequately servicing 2014-B.Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should provide that a bankruptcy of Ford Credit would not impair the timeliness of payments on the securities.RATING SENSITIVITIESUnanticipated decreases in the value of returned vehicles and/or increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case. This in turn could result in negative rating actions on the notes. Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to Ford Credit Auto Lease Trust 2014-B to increased credit and residual losses over the life of the transaction.Fitch's analysis found that the transaction displays some sensitivity to increased defaults and credit losses, showing downgrades of one rating category under Fitch's 1.5x base case loss scenario. Additionally, downgrades of one or two rating categories were seen under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario. The transaction shows significantly more sensitivity to residual loss volatility. As such, under its severe residual loss scenario, Fitch would expect to downgrade the class of notes by two or more rating categories.The presale report is available at 'www.fitchratings.com' or by clicking on the below link.Link to Fitch Ratings' Report: Ford Credit Auto Lease Trust 2014-B (US ABS)http://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=752565ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextSpanish Economy Expands at Fastest Pace in Almost Two YearsBloombergEngineer Finds Pattern; Makes Millions in StocksMoney MorningSponsoredThe 'two pizza rule' is a secret to productive meetings that helped Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos become one of the world's richest menBusiness InsiderThe real reason overseas manufacturing is coming to AmericaYahoo FinanceTax cuts just got more likelyYahoo FinanceZuckerberg Wife's Ambitious Secret Finally ExposedUNewz.MeSponsoredAll the companies in Jeff Bezos’s empire, in one (large) chartMarketWatchChevron and Exxon Mobil have a tough path ahead: NYSE traderYahoo Finance VideoStocks mixed after heavy earnings weekYahoo FinanceTrunk Club.
