Performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Due to market volatility, current performance may be less or higher than the figures shown. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that upon redemption, shares may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance figures for all Funds reflect contractual waivers and/or expense limitations, without which total returns may have been lower. These limitations may be modified or terminated only with Board approval.

Investment Definitions
POP (Public Offering Price) is the NAV (Net Asset Value) plus a sales charge. All POPs are subject to revision and include the maximum sales charge.
Distribution Yield: The distribution yield measures the percentage return in the form of dividends. It is calculated daily by annualizing the most recent dividend distribution and dividing by the daily share price (NAV or POP). If the Fund did not make a distribution as of the latest scheduled distribution date, "N/A" will be displayed.
12-month Yield: The 12-month yield measures the percentage return in the form of dividends. It is calculated monthly by taking the sum of the trailing 12-month dividend payments divided by the last month's ending share price (NAV or POP) plus any capital gains distributed over previous 12 months. If the Fund did not make any distributions over the previous 12 months, "N/A" will be displayed.
The SEC 30-day Yield is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share for the first 30 days of the month by the offering price per share at the end of that period. The yield reflects the dividends and interest earned during the period, after the deduction of the Fund's expenses.

Disclosure
Dividend distributions are the distribution of a dividend to mutual fund shareholders as of a certain date. The following Funds declare daily dividends: MainStay California Tax Free Opportunities, MainStay Floating Rate, MainStay High Yield Municipal Bond, MainStay Money Market, MainStay New York Tax Free Opportunities, MainStay Tax Advantaged Short Term Bond, and MainStay Tax Free Bond.
Capital gains distributions are a distribution a mutual fund makes out of profits from selling stocks or bonds that is subject to capital gains taxes for the shareholders. The ex-date is when a distribution of dividends and capital gains is deducted from a mutual fund's assets. It is then set aside for payment to the shareholders. The payable date is the date when the declared dividend or capital gain distribution is scheduled to be paid to shareholders who elected to receive cash payments.
Short-term capital gains are a gain on an investment that has been held for one year or less.
Long-term capital gains are a gain on an investment that has been held for more than one year.

Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that upon redemption, shares may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance figures for all Funds reflect contractual waivers and/or expense limitations, without which total returns may have been lower.

Investment Definitions
POP (Public Offering Price) is the NAV (Net Asset Value) plus a sales charge. All POPs are subject to revision and include the maximum sales charge.
Distribution Yield: The distribution yield measures the percentage return in the form of dividends. It is calculated daily by annualizing the most recent dividend distribution and dividing by the daily share price (NAV or POP). If the Fund did not make a distribution as of the latest scheduled distribution date, "N/A" will be displayed.
12-month Yield: The 12-month yield measures the percentage return in the form of dividends. It is calculated monthly by taking the sum of the trailing 12-month dividend payments divided by the last month's ending share price (NAV or POP) plus any capital gains distributed over previous 12 months. If the Fund did not make any distributions over the previous 12 months, "N/A" will be displayed.
The SEC 30-day Yield is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share for the first 30 days of the month by the offering price per share at the end of that period. The yield reflects the dividends and interest earned during the period, after the deduction of the Fund's expenses.

Disclosure
Dividend distributions are the distribution of a dividend to mutual fund shareholders as of a certain date. The following Funds declare daily dividends: MainStay California Tax Free Opportunities, MainStay Floating Rate, MainStay High Yield Municipal Bond, MainStay Money Market, MainStay New York Tax Free Opportunities, MainStay Tax Advantaged Short Term Bond, and MainStay Tax Free Bond.
Capital gains distributions are a distribution a mutual fund makes out of profits from selling stocks or bonds that is subject to capital gains taxes for the shareholders. The ex-date is when a distribution of dividends and capital gains is deducted from a mutual fund's assets. It is then set aside for payment to the shareholders. The payable date is the date when the declared dividend or capital gain distribution is scheduled to be paid to shareholders who elected to receive cash payments.
Short-term capital gains are a gain on an investment that has been held for one year or less.
Long-term capital gains are a gain on an investment that has been held for more than one year.

GET STARTED










Mutual funds can help diversify your investments, without the need to handpick stocks and bonds yourself. Instead, MainStay Investments provides you with access to the funds and insights of our specialists, each with expertise in different markets, to help meet your investment objectives.




Build Long-Term Wealth to Meet Your Goals 
Use our international, domestic, equity, and commodities mutual funds to help achieve long-term goals.





Increase Your Income Potential
Consider bond funds and funds that invest in dividend-paying equities to help achieve your goal of increased income potential.





Mix Your Assets to Manage Market Risk
Seek to meet investment goals through a mix of traditional and non-traditional products.










Unlike Many Firms...










...our MainStay Investments is actually a “fund family” made up of 10 independent investment boutiques. What does this mean for our clients?

“Multi-boutique” investments: Investors can access independent and highly specialized investment managers through MainStay Investments, an affiliate . We offer one closed-end fund, non-traditional strategies, and separately managed accounts.

Long-term perspective: While MainStay’s investment boutiques are autonomous and independent, they all share a long-term perspective, a focus on quality, and a commitment to excellence. To receive e-mail insights directly in your inbox, subscribe to MainStay Insights.
Thought leadership: We provide investment insights and unique perspectives on economic conditions, emerging market trends, and portfolio construction concepts, as well as wealth-building and  wealth-preservation educational tools.



First the basics: What is a mutual fund?
Instead of buying individual stocks or bonds, you buy into a collection of investments. Depending on its specific investment strategy, a mutual fund may invest in stocks, bonds, options, futures, currencies, money markets, or just about any other security that exists. 
When you buy a mutual fund, your money is pooled with that of others, and usually managed by a professional fund manager. This manager executes the fund’s investment strategy and oversees its day-to-day operations. Professional fund managers have a full-time commitment to their investment responsibilities, a wealth of financial research, economic information from various resources, and the experience and skill to identify, select, and manage their portfolios. The manager gets paid a management fee, which is part of the expense ratio.
What’s different about MainStay Mutual Funds?
As a MainStay client, you can take advantage of the thought leadership we offer to both investors and financial advisors. So you know our investment insights and perspectives on economic conditions, emerging market trends, and portfolio construction concepts. There are many ways you can access our specialized guidance:

Wealth Matters Program: These are tools designed to help you organize your financial life, as well as resources to help raise your awareness of important issues. Programs are also designed to help financial professionals gain a deeper understanding of their clients’ needs over time, in order to create a comprehensive investment strategy.  
Investment Insights: These are white papers on portfolio construction concepts, as well as opportunities within investment styles and asset classes. We also provide market commentaries and economic reports from our portfolio managers that provide unique investment insights and perspectives. 

And because MainStay Investments is a part of New York Life, many of our licensed registered representatives have the flexibility to help you with financial planning decisions that go beyond mutual funds, adding insurance and other investment products from New York Life to help you achieve your specific goals. For instance, many people purchase a Whole Life Insurance policy in addition to their MainStay Investments mutual funds. Whole life insurance provides important financial protection for the whole family, while also building up tax-deferred cash value, which can later help fund their retirement if their needs change down the road.†

There are risks inherent in any investment, including market risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and the possible loss of principal. There can be no assurance that the Fund's investment objectives will be achieved. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount from their net asset value, which may increase investor risk.

When you decide it's time to choose new pieces for your home, Walmart can help with Every Day Low Prices. To get things started, make sure you have an idea of what you need, such as how much space you have and where you want the pieces to go. You might want to consider if you want a particular style of furniture or mix-and-match pieces based on what you see available. Save money while you're at it with our low prices, every day, on everything, including big-ticket items like living room furniture.Sofas, loveseats, sectionals and futonsDepending on the size of your living room, the sofa you choose will likely be the biggest piece of furniture in the room, especially if you choose a sectional. If you have a smaller living room, such as in a condominium or apartment, you may only have room for a loveseat or futon.Sofa   Depending on the size, sofas allow seating for two to four people. Sofas can range between around 30 inches and more than 110 inches wide   with most being between 50 and 80 inches wide   and are upholstered in materials like leather, faux leather, linen or microfiber. If you have frequent overnight guests or just want to have another sleeping option, you can choose a sofa sleeperLoveseat   For large living rooms, you can have both a sofa and a loveseat in the room. However, if your space is smaller, you may want to consider a loveseat as your primary piece. These are made from the same types of material as sofas. Loveseats seat two average-size people or three smaller people, such as kids, and are usually between 30 and 89 inches long in a multitude of colors.Sectional   If you have a lot of space in your living room, a sectional can be a great piece to have. Sectionals seat four people, six or more, and some even double as recliners on one end or both. Most recliners are in an "L" shape, but some have rounded backs in more of a "C" shape. Sectionals also come in a variety of coverings, such as linen, leather, faux leather, bonded leather or microfiber. The minimum size for a sectional is 60 inches, and these can be more than 100 inches too.Futon   These are like smaller versions of sleeper sofas, serving as a loveseat or bed depending on your needs. A futon has a single twin-size mattress that turns into the bottom and back of the futon when rearranged.Recliners and chairsIn conjunction with a loveseat or sofa, you may want to add a chair or two into the mix. These can be recliners or accent chairs.Recliners   These are deep, usually plush chairs that have backs that recline and legs that extend out, allowing you to lay almost flat in the chair. The materials are the same as the other furniture you can choose for the living room to allow you to match pieces or choose your favorite upholstery, and some have heating and massaging capabilities. There are even recliners that have power lift technology, which assists people who have difficulty getting up or sitting down.Accent chairs   These chairs run the gamut of styles, including armchairs and armless chairs in many styles like contemporary, modern and mid-century. Chairs, including recliners, are typically categorized by how wide the seating area is, and living room chairs range from 15 inches or less (ideal for little ones) to 36 inches or more.Accent tablesTo go with the seating choices you have made, you also need a table or two in your living room as well. These can be coffee tables, end tables and console tables.Coffee tables   These tables do more than allow you to rest coffee cups on them. They're usually set in front of a sofa or sectional and have storage area   open, closed or both   beneath the top. These tables take many shapes but are usually rectangular.End tables   End tables sit next to sofas, loveseats and chairs and are good places for table lamps to rest. End tables also have storage space and some also have a drawer for storage.Console tables   These are tall narrow tables that go behind a sofa or along a wall. Some just have a tabletop, and some have shelving underneath.Other living room furnitureOnce you have the main pieces, there are peripheral pieces you may want to add to complete your living room layout. ottomans   These are square, circular or rectangular pieces of furniture that you can use as an extra seat or as a footrest. Many also have storage space that you access through a lid on the top.bookcases   Bookcases allow you to store books or other media like DVDs and Blu-ray discs or items that you want to display like knickknacks.TV stands and entertainment centers   If you have a television or stereo system you want to have in the living room, you can place these appliances in an entertainment center or TV stand in a central location and arrange your seating around it.Show moreElectrode, Comp-167700716, DC-prod-dfw1, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-

That's why you should replace it every few years with a new mattress. Fortunately, technology has made it so that you have many mattress types to choose from, and these are available for all bed sizes. You can save money on your new mattress purchase because we have low prices, every day, on everything. You can even buy new bedding to go with the mattress as well.Mattresses and box springsThere are six basic sizes for mattresses: twin (30 inches by 75 inches), full (54 inches by 75 inches), twin XL (39 inches by 80 inches), queen (60 inches by 80 inches), king (76 inches by 80 inches) and California king (72 inches by 84 inches). This is important to know if you're buying a different-sized bed for your home. Once you know what size mattress you need, you can decide what type to purchase.Innerspring mattresses   One of the oldest and most popular styles of mattress, this type of mattress uses a wrapped steel support system. The style of the coils and how they're wrapped, padded and connected, differ by brand. Many innerspring mattresses have pillow tops on one side or both, although less expensive ones don't.Gel mattresses   Gel mattresses feature a foam material that contains gel to form the mattress's support, and that material provides varying levels of comfort and heat dissipation.Latex foam mattresses   Latex mattresses feature foam that comes from petroleum-based or plant-based materials, and they feature foam as part of the support system and in the outer layers.Memory foam mattresses   Also known as visco elastic foam, these mattresses include high-density polyurethane foam that's used as part of the support system and on the outer layers, which adapts to the shape of the sleepers.Hybrid mattresses   Hybrid mattresses combine the best parts of both innerspring and foam mattresses. Innerspring coils are interspersed with one or more kinds of foam support. This foam takes many forms, including latex, visco elastic or polyurethane. Some even combine innersprings with gel-filled foam for support.Pillow top mattresses   Pillow top mattresses are available on all types of bed mattresses, with the pillow top on one side or both, especially on higher-end mattresses. The thickness of the pillow top varies by mattress and can be made from fiber or foam materials.air mattresses   Although some air mattresses are only filled with a single pocket of air, some have multiple chambers to allow for more flexibility and are usually covered in a cloth or foam material that has padding underneath.Box springs are available for all sizes of mattresses and work best on mattresses that you flip every so often to keep the springs or foam from becoming weak. It also helps even the mattress out if the surface is uneven for any reason. If you have a platform bed or a one-sided mattress, you generally have no need for a box spring. However, if you have a warranty on your mattress, check your information. Some mattresses require the use of a box spring or the warranty is null and void. Waterbed mattressesAlthough the heyday of their popularity was back in the 1970s, some people still prefer to sleep on a waterbed. The gentle motion of the mattress helps some people sleep better than a traditional mattress can. Mattresses for waterbeds are available in all traditional sizes and feature an inner bladder that fills with water. Most waterbeds come with a low-wattage heater for those cold nights. Waterbeds have vinyl coverings that must be used specifically with waterbed frames. Some come with double-walled surfaces and reinforced corners for more leak protection.Mattress pads and toppersFor those who have a mattress without exterior padding or want additional padding to sleep, mattress pads and toppers are the answer. Mattress pads use many of the same materials as the mattresses themselves, including memory form and gel-filled foam. Some have fillings that are more like pillows and have down or down alternative as the padding. The thickness of mattress pads varies from 1 inch to 4 inches or more. mattress toppers are similar to mattress pads, but these sometimes go onto the fitted sheet covering the mattress rather than encasing it. These offer temperature control properties as well, especially the gel-filled ones.Show moreElectrode, Comp-167700713, DC-prod-dfw1, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-
