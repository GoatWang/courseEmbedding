Japan Post Bank Co., Ltd. (株式会社ゆうちょ銀行, Kabushiki-gaisha Yū-cho Ginkō, commonly abbreviated to ゆうちょ銀行 (Yū-cho Ginkō), or just ゆうちょ (Yū-cho)), is a Japanese bank headquartered in Tokyo which is part of the Japan Post Holdings postal and financial services group.[3]
As of November 2008 it was reported as being the world's biggest deposit holder.[4] It is one of only two banks to have branches in every prefecture in Japan, the other being Mizuho Bank.

History[edit]
Postal savings was introduced to Japan in 1875 and operated as a government department until privatization of the postal service was passed under the government of Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi.
The bank was established on 1 September 2006,[5] as part of the reorganisation of Japan Post into Japan Post Holdings.
Prior to 2009, Japan Post was not connected to the Japanese Bankers Association (Zenginkyo) payment processing network, making it impossible to wire money directly between Japan Post and most other Japanese banks. Japan Post Bank joined the network in January 2009 and became a full JBA member in October 2011.
Products[edit]
Unlike most commercial banks, Japan Post Bank is primarily a savings institution. Its only loan products are overdraft lines secured by time deposits and Japanese government bonds on deposit with the bank.
Japan Post Bank offers a nationwide ATM network which can be used to withdraw money with international bank cards and credit cards.[6] Japan Post Bank has a contract with Standard Chartered Bank to facilitate wire-transfer remittances of funds internationally.

Japan Post Bank Co., Ltd. Key Developments

Japan Post Bank Reportedly Considers Joining The Consortium To Acquire A Stake In The Toshiba Unit
Jul 7 17
SK Hynix Inc. (KOSE:A000660) has demanded voting interest in Toshiba Memory Corporation in the future, stalling talks between Toshiba Corporation (TSE:6502) and a Japanese-U.S.-South Korean consortium including SK Hynix on a contract for the planned sale of the Toshiba unit, informed source said on July 7, 2017. Meanwhile, Japan Post Bank Co., Ltd. (TSE:7182) is considering joining the consortium to acquire a stake in the Toshiba unit for tens of billions of yen, according to the sources. The move is believed to be backed by the Japanese government. With the government concerned about possible leaks of Toshiba's flash memory technology, the company has defended the planned sale to the consortium by stressing that technology leaks are unlikely as SK Hynix will not have voting rights in the Toshiba unit. But the South Korean member of the consortium now wants to own voting shares in Toshiba Memory in the future, although it is ready initially to provide funds in the form of lending. The future acquisition of voting shares in Toshiba Memory by SK Hynix could prolong antitrust screenings of the unit sale, possibly derailing Toshiba's plan to complete the sale by the March 2018 end of fiscal 2017 to resolve its negative net worth, observers said.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
