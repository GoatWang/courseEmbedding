PatrickNorguet







A passion for technology, functionality and lightness are the values shared by the designer Patrick Norguet and Alias. Kobi has taken shape as a result of this affinity. Norguet has developed a new type of chair, inspired by the tradition of iron wire chairs, coming up with an elegant and light-weight structure:  highly contemporary suspended architecture.
The body is a sort of rigorous and enveloping basket, created by woven soldered round steel wire. The support belt, made from cast aluminium embraces the seat elegantly, totally enveloping the form.
The leather or fabric cushions are available for the seat only, seat plus back and full shell option. They are shaped to adhere perfectly to the shell and to form a visual whole with the structure. 
Two different structures are available: support and legs in stove-enamelled aluminium with coloured or chromed shell; stove enamelled support and aluminium legs in oak-veneered aluminium with shell lacquered in different colours. 


Armchair with shell in enamelled or chromed steel; support belt and legs in stove enamelled aluminium.

Company Profile
Technological lightness, versatility, innovation. Since 1979 these have been the overriding values of Alias, one of the most consolidated names of Italian design. Values that have driven the firm’s close association with some renowned designer signatures. Collaborations that have developed and grown through the years, and in the course of which, Alias has managed to reveal the peculiar talent of each designer. Conducted in an ongoing exchange of suggestions and ideas, and a constantly open-minded approach to the use of new materials and technological experimentation. Of particular significance is the solid industrial structure of a firm that controls each phase of the process, from design, to production and distribution. Alias, located in Grumello del Monte, close to Bergamo, can now count on a distribution network of around 1000 stores in 50 countries throughout the world. In 2008, the first Alias flagship store was opened in Milan on corso Monforte 19; it is a striking two-storey structure that houses the company’s entire production and its design research. All Alias products, with their highly expressive minimal style, offer solutions to the various requirements of residential, contract and outdoor applications. Products offering constant evolution to meet the real needs of contemporary living and working environments.

Product Catalog
New Product







The distinctive Italian furniture of Alias is sold in fifty countries. This avant-garde brand offers an open-minded approach to creative uses of new materials and of technological experimentation that results in expressive but also durable products. 
Since 1979, Alias has attracted a team of renowned designers with its enviable creative culture. These include Giandomenico Belotti, Michele De Lucchi, Riccardo Blumer, Pio Manzù, Paolo Rizzatto, James Irvine, Jasper Morrison, Alfredo Häberli, Mario Botta, Alberto Meda, Philippe Starck, PearsonLloyd, Dante Bonuccelli, Patrick Norguet and Eugeni Quitllet. It is no idle boast that the firm Alias brands itself with the phrase: “I Feel It.” Alias enables each designer to find his unique expression of what modern Italian design can be.


Should you be near San Francisco, or wish to spend time in this remarkable city, the Arkitektura Showrooms is the best salon to acquaint you with the remarkable modern furniture Alias provides. Known for its innovative, light and versatile Italian furniture designs, Alias offers a broad portfolio of products for residential and outdoor environments that must be felt as well as seen.
Inaugurated with a clear and determined vision for the future of Italian furniture design, Alias’ story began in 1979 with Giandomenico Belotti’s “spaghetti chair,” one of Alias’ first creations to become part of the MoMA collection in New York.
 
To quote the company: “The poetics of lightness find expression in Riccardo Blumer’s ‘laleggera chair,” winner of the Design Preis Schweiz in 1997 and theCompasso d’Oro in 1998. Alias added further solutions for the home and office environments with “SEC,” a modular shelf system designed by Alfredo Häberli to create practically an endless array of different configurations.
 
Alias boldly strode into the 21st Century with “flexus” by Paolo Rizzatto, which re-imagined traditional upholstery by introducing holes in the back to lighten the visual presentation of this visually arresting yet comfortable couch. The design of wheeled armchairs for the modern office was reborn in the partnership with Alberto Meda to produce the “rollingframe” and “meetingframe”, while his “frametable” continues the theme of advanced thinking around a delicate appearing presentation supported by elegant yet sturdy leg supports.
 
In 2004, designer Michele De Lucchi further lightened the concept of the modern office a system of containers named “layout.” The year 2007 saw an important expansion of Alias outdoor furniture with “plein air” by Alfredo Häberli, “teak” by Alberto Meda, and “open system” by James Irvine. Eye-catching group seating in line or arranged as an elegant curve appeared as “ghisa” designed by Riccardo Blumer. 
 
What was needed, in Alias’ judgment, was a collection of upholstered armchairs and sofas that would create an inviting and airy comfort center indoors but with the weather resistance to also offer living room elegance in a garden or on a patio, as well. Thus appeared the “dehors” collection of armchairs and sofas by Michele De Lucchi. 
 
“These are just a few of the stunning Italian designs we can unveil for you in our Arkitektura Showrooms in San Francisco or at our Birmingham, Michigan location near Detroit,” explains Andrew Fisher.
 
Fisher has just completed a sizable expansion of his floor space to accommodate the growing interest by architects, landscapers, interior designers and private customers in modern furniture designs. His San Francisco and Detroit salons now represent over seventy Italian, Scandinavian, German, Austrian, French, Spanish and U.K. and modern furniture brands. 
 
To further understand the ongoing innovation of the company that may be reviewed, discussed and ordered within the Arkitektura Showrooms, we quote Alias itself: 
 
“In 2009, Alias extended its range of tables with the ‘biplane’ collection by Alberto Meda and the ‘stabiles’ collection by Alfredo Häberli. Furthermore the research of new design for chairs continues with the office chair ‘norma’ by Michele De Lucchi…. The 2010 year is characterized by new projects: the ‘sandal’ collection by Jakob Timpe, the ‘green pvc’ outdoor collection by Giandomenico Belotti, the ‘cross’ tables by Alfredo Häberli and the ergonomic seat ‘dinamica’ by Riccardo Blumer and Matteo Borghi.”
 
To enter Arkitektura’s showroom in San Francisco or Birmingham, Michigan is appreciate Alias' remarkable sense of Italian furniture aesthetics and say for yourself, “I feel it.”

Kobi has taken shape as a result of this affinity. Norguet has developed a new type of chair, inspired by the tradition of iron wire chairs, coming up with an elegant and light-weight structure: highly contemporary suspended architecture.

The body is a sort of rigorous and enveloping basket, created by woven soldered round steel wire. The support belt, made from cast aluminium embraces the seat elegantly, totally enveloping the form.
The leather or fabric cushions are available for the seat only, seat plus back and full shell option. They are shaped to adhere perfectly to the shell and to form a visual whole with the structure.

Two different structures are available: support, legs and shell in stove-enamelled aluminum in various colors or support and shell in stove enameled aluminum with legs in oak-veneered aluminum. The seat shell can also be specified in chromed steel (please call to order).								 																	25.4" w | 22" d | 29.3" h | seat: 16.5" h									 																																			$1,322.00 + free shipping in the continental U.S.										(usually ships in 12-14 weeks)																								  reviews     there are no reviews of this product yet.     write a review      Patrick Norguet Patrick Norguet (b. 1969) was educated at the Superior School of Industrial Design in Paris, where he is still based, and is fast becoming a noted name in his field. He has collaborated with Louis Vuitton as a decorator, designing concepts for display windows and events. He more recently designed the showrooms for Renault Cars in Paris and Tokyo and has designed furniture pieces for Cappellini and Artifort. In Paris, where McDonald�s restaurants can often have lavish modern interiors, Norguet has designed many, proving that he can adapt and create something unique in almost any surrounding. Today he creates products for Cappellini, Fasem, Poltrona Frau, Lapalma, Offecct, Crassevig, GlasItalia, Flaminia, Thonnet Vienna, Modus, Watsberg, Artifort, and Accor.
    Technological lightness, versatility, innovation. Since 1979 these have been the overriding values of Alias, one of the most consolidated names of Italian design. Values that have driven the firm�s close association with some renowned designer signatures.  All Alias products, with their highly expressive minimal style, offer solutions to the various requirements of residential, contract and outdoor applications. Products offering constant evolution to meet the real needs of contemporary living and working environments.
