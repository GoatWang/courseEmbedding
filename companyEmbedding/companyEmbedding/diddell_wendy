Richardson Electronics Promotes Wendy Diddell to Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer




Richardson Electronics, Ltd. (NASDAQ: RELL) today announced Wendy Diddell has been promoted to Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. The Richardson Electronics’ Board of Directors approved this promotion on December 23, 2015.
Wendy joined RELL in June 2003 as its Vice President and General Manager of the Security Systems Division (“SSD”). Under Wendy’s management, operating performance of SSD improved dramatically which positioned the division to be sold to Honeywell for $80 million in June 2007. Wendy was then promoted to Executive Vice President of Corporate Development and General Manager of Canvys. In her corporate development role, Wendy was instrumental in helping with the sale of RFPD to Arrow Electronics in March 2011 for $238 million. Since that time she shared responsibility for the administration of EDG, Manufacturing, Supply Chain, Marketing Communications, Healthcare and Product Development. Wendy has also been a key contributor in the acquisitions of IMES, WVS, D&C Electronics and Powerlink.
“I am extremely pleased that the Board of Directors has agreed to recognize Wendy’s many contributions to Richardson Electronics by promoting her to Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer,” said Edward Richardson, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board.

This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.
