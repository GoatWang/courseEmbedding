The Gores Holdings, Inc. Acquisition Of Hostess Is More Expensive Than It Looks - Hostess Brands, Inc. (NASDAQ:TWNK) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGOÂ»The Gores Holdings, Inc. Acquisition Of Hostess Is More Expensive Than It LooksOct. 3.16 | About: Hostess Brands, (TWNK) Investor Gator Alternative energy, industrials, long/short equity, special situationsSummaryThe Gores Holdings, Inc. (GRSH) acquisition of Hostess is complicated and deserves a close look at the mechanics.Correcting for a set of cherry-picked comparable companies moves the reference valuation range down from 13.4x EBITDA to between 9.2x EBITDA and 10.1x EBITDA.Including in the purchase price a tax savings sharing obligation estimated at $165M and a highly probably 2016 earn out adds 0.8x EBITDA to the acquisition price of Hostess.After these adjustments, Hostess appears to be valued at or above the top end of the comparable trading range at the current GRHS price of $10.80 per share.Note: while the current price of GRSH is $10.80, the company uses a reference price of $10.00 in its most recent September investor presentation. I use $10.00 per share from here on to maintain consistency across comparisons. Introduction As far as most special purpose acquisition company ("SPAC") transactions go, the Hostess acquisition by Gores Holdings (GRSH) looks like a winner. A proven brand, a proven management team staying on-board after the sale and an easy-to-understand story all suggest good things to come for those considering a long position. The transaction mechanics are complicated, though. So a further look at the purchase of Hostess by Gores Holdings makes sense as a matter of diligence and, in particular, to verify the sponsor's claim on page 20 of the most recent investor presentation that "Gore's acquisition of Hostess will occur at a meaningful discount to peers' TEV/EBITDA trading levels" Transaction Mechanics Before I could drill down on valuation, I wanted to understand better both a) the net impact of the changes in common stock and warrants arising from the transaction; and b) the cash and non-cash sources and uses required to complete the transaction An initial look through the supporting information in the investor presentation and press releases left me frustrated. While there was a lot of good information contained therein, I found it necessary to comb through the various merger filings to put together what I consider a complete look.
 Fully Diluted Ownership The presentation includes some essential information on capitalization, but it is far from complete. The dilutive impact of over 56M warrants is not accounted for and the sources and uses are not adequately detailed. Pulling together information from the company's periodic filings as well as the transaction filings allows for a more complete picture: 

 The presentation does a good job of providing the detailed shareholdings for the sponsors and seller post-transaction, indicating that Metropolous will own a very incentivizing 25.1%, Gores will retain 8% and original SPAC shareholders will retain 29% (down from 80%). But those ownership levels do not take into account potential impact from the exercise of the warrants and other dilutive events. The table above takes into account the potential dilution from the 56.5M outstanding warrants (exercisable for one-half share each) issued to the public and in connection with the private placement. Exercise of the warrants would take public shareholder ownership down nearly 18% from 28.9% to 23.8%. It's also worth noting the potential dilutive impact from another 8.25M shares to be issued if certain earn out targets are achieved is excluded from the table above. Sources and Uses Required to Complete the Transaction The pro forma valuation and sources and uses are also lacking some detail that would be very helpful to prospective investors. In particular I was curious as to the 'de-levering amount'. It turns out that embedded in that number is $40M of target cash that is hinted at but not clearly accounted for in the presentation. Again, going through the filings we can fill in some of those essential details: 


 Now that we've supplemented the investor presentation with some essential details from the filings on the mechanics of the transaction such as shareholding pre and post transaction and the specific cash and non-cash sources and uses, it's time to dig a little deeper on valuation. Valuation Hostess is an iconic brand with an emotional connection to U.S. consumers. However, it seems most of the company's products (Twinkies, cupcakes, extended shelf life bread) are on the very wrong side of a powerful secular trend toward fresh, local, healthy and organic eating. Hostess products will certainly maintain an esteemed place within the 'indulgent snacks' category, but once the accelerated growth from the company's re-introduction to the marketplace wears off this year, I am skeptical of long-term growth due to secular trends and general competition within the food category. As such, buying Hostess at a discount to peers, as the investor presentation claims it is being offered, is all the more important. Page 20 of the investor presentation shows a group of seven mid-cap food companies that seem to anchor the relative valuation and shows a median EV/2016E EBITDA multiple of 13.4x versus the presented Hostess multiple of 10.4x. Trading Comps Looking at the seven specific mid-cap trading comps selected by the company to justify the valuation versus the broader fifty or so diversified food companies of which they are a subset reveals a cherry-picked data set. 

 The seven companies chosen by the company to support the valuation are highlighted in yellow. You can see that while Hostess (represented by the box of Twinkies) is in the bottom 20%-25% by market cap at an estimated $1.3B, the company-selected comps are all substantially larger, with six of the seven being in the top half for market cap. Many of the company-chosen comps are broader and more diversified than Hostess. One comp, McCormick, is really in a different business altogether - spices.
 The impact of the cherry picking is made clear in the table below. It resulted in a much higher multiple for the comparable group. Since I don't have access to the forward EBITDA estimates used by the company in preparing the presentation, I used trailing EBITDA multiples for this exercise. This is reasonable in light of the steady growth of the sector and the higher accuracy from historical versus projected data. Since we're comparing the relative difference between big and small companies, whether we use historical or projected EBITDA does not matter because of the steady state nature of the industry. As the top part of the table below shows, the comparable multiple decreases significantly when a more appropriate group of comparables is chosen.  

 The seven larger, more diversified and sometimes altogether different comparable companies chosen by the company have a median market cap of $5B and a median EV/TTM EBITDA multiple 15.8x. Choosing a more appropriate comp group for Hostess, which is anticipated to have a $1.3B market cap when it debuts (according to the company's assumed price of $10.00 per share in the presentation), reduces the comp group multiple to:  12.3x EBITDA for all fifty food companies, including the largest one; or 10.1x EBITDA for a more appropriate comp group with market caps between $900M and $2B; or 9.2x EBITDA when an even more appropriate comp group with market caps between $900M and $2B is chosen  It's worth pausing here to note again that the presentation, in using the seven chosen mid-cap food companies, shows a median multiple of 13.4x, not the 15.8x I show above. That's because whereas I use trailing EBITDA, the presentation uses a more opaque estimated forward EBITDA. The critical point is that the *relative* difference in multiples between the large and small food companies is meaningful and completely changes the nature of the comparison. This would hold true whether trailing or forward numbers are used since the industry is characterized by mature, steady growth.
 Hostess Valuation There is a bit of work to be done on the Hostess multiple too. In looking at the Hostess multiple, I choose to use the company's 2016 estimated EBITDA instead of the trailing EBITDA as I have for the comps. Why? 2016 represents the first year of steady state operations for Hostess after significant, transformative changes and its subsequent re-introduction to the marketplace. Although it would help my argument to use a lower trailing EBITDA number, using forward EBITDA is actually a better apples-to-apples comparison versus the comp group. As the data at the bottom of the previous table shows, doing so results in a 10.5x EV/EBITDA multiple for Hostess assuming, as the company has done in its own presentation, a share price of $10.00 for GRSH. However, the presentation valuation excludes the obligation arising from a binding tax savings sharing agreement with the seller. While the exact amount of the obligation is unknown, the accountants estimate the liability at over $165M in the merger filings. Given the profitability of Hostess, it seems highly probable such payments will be made. In addition to the tax savings sharing obligation, the sellers are entitled to 8.25M additional shares via earn outs. The first of these, based on a 2016 EBITDA target of $225.4M also seems highly probable. Adding the additional cost of both of these obligations in moves the multiple from 10.5x to 11.3x (note, that excludes the additional 2017 and 2018 earnouts). Conclusion While the purchase of Hostess by Gores Holdings has several positive aspects to it, a closer look at the numbers reveals it appears to be coming to market at no discount. Whereas at a GRHS price per share of $10.00 Hostess will be valued at an EV/EBITDA multiple of between 10.5x and 11.3x, an appropriate set of food comps is currently trading at a multiple of between 9.2x and 10.1x EBITDA. Given that operational improvements will be difficult to obtain after the excellent restructuring work of the prior owners, and that the company's products likely face a stiff growth headwind from secular trends, the apparent lack of discount to trading peers is a red flag.

Gores Holdings, a blank check company formed by The Gores Group,
filed and set terms for an upcoming IPO on Friday.



The Beverly Hills, CA-based company plans to raise $400 million by
offering 40 million units for $10 each. At that price, the SPAC
would command a market value of $500 million.Â IPO timing has
not been determined.



Units consist of one share of its ClassÂ A common stock and one
warrant. Each warrant entitles the holder to purchase one-half of
one share of ClassÂ A common stock at a price of $5.75 per half
share.Â It has 24 months to complete its acquisition or it will
will redeem 100% of the public shares at a per-share price.



The Gores Group will own a 20% post-IPO stake in the company. It
has committed to purchase 20 million warrants for $10 million in a
concurrent private placement. The company notes that it may pursue
an acquisition in a diverse group of industries,
includingÂ industrials, technology, telecommunications, media
and entertainment, business services, healthcare and consumer
products. It highlights several of The Gore Group's carve-out
acquisitions: The LearningÂ The Learning Company from Mattel
Corporation; VeriFone from Hewlett-Packard; Micron PC from Micron
Electronics; Sagem Communications from the Safran Group; Stock
Building Supply from Wolseley; the broadcast communications
division from Harris Corporation; the electronics power systems
business from TE Connectivity; Elo Touch Solutions from TE
Connectivity; Therakos from JohnsonÂ & Johnson and
Brand-Rex from Honeywell International.



The company's management consists of senior members at The Gores
Group, including the private equity firm's Chairman and CEO, Alec
Gores, and its President of Operations, Mark Stone.



Gores Holdings, which was formed in 2015, plans to list its units
on the NASDAQ under the symbol GRSHU. Deutsche Bank is the sole
bookrunner on the deal.

Our History










Investment Strategy
        Our investment strategy has remained consistent for over 25 years: we specialize in acquiring businesses that are undergoing change in capital structure, strategy, operations or growth and can benefit from Goresâ operational and strategic approach.  We target companies with a defensible core business, mature products or services, sustainable revenues, established customer relationships, and that have reached a transition point in their lifecycle presenting an opportunity for transformation.

Our financial expertise and significant in-house resources allow us to be flexible in investment structure, type and size. Since our founding, we have carved out divisional assets through corporate-divestitures, partnered with family-owned businesses and management teams, grown companies through industry consolidation strategies, and have taken public companies private. This flexibility allows us to be opportunistic so we can uncover optimal investments for the benefit of the companies we invest in as well as our investment partners.

Additionally, operational transformation is key to the value we create. Our in-house Gores Operations Group works exclusively with our portfolio companies and collaborates closely with management teams to establish viable operational blueprints, launch marketing and product initiatives, determine areas to invest for growth, and build stronger and better companies.

We apply a consistent investment approach across North America and Europe. The ability to invest in multiple geographies provides Gores with an effective platform to deploy capital across a diverse set of businesses, capture opportunities in a variety of geographic regions, and create measurable value for our investment partners and portfolio companies.

Origination
    	Gores' Origination team is responsible for sourcing investment opportunities, building relationships, and expanding the Gores network worldwide. The Origination professionals work in tandem with the M&A team, enabling Gores to concurrently identify and develop multiple investment opportunities.

The size and structure of the Origination team facilitates relationships with companies, investment banks and professional advisors across diverse industry verticals, including technology, telecommunications, business services, industrial, healthcare, media & entertainment, and consumer products. The Origination team also monitors deals in the market including corporate bankruptcies and auctions. As a result of these relationships, they regularly receive inbound calls from companies and advisors looking for a buyer with the firm's capabilities. Gores' outbound relationship efforts have also resulted in invitations to participate in company-managed limited auctions and to look at corporate divestitures on an exclusive or semi-exclusive basis.

Completes Acquisition of Hostess Brands, LLC, Maker of TwinkiesÂ®Business WireNovember 4, 2016ReblogShareTweetShareLOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Gores Holdings, Inc. (âGores Holdingsâ) (NASDAQ CM: GRSHU, GRSH, GRSHW), a special purpose acquisition company sponsored by an affiliate of The Gores Group, LLC (âThe Gores Groupâ or âGoresâ), today announced that it completed the acquisition of Hostess Brands, LLC (âHostess Brandsâ), the maker of HostessÂ® TwinkiesÂ®, Ding DongsÂ® and CupCakes. The transaction has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both Gores Holdings and the indirect parent of Hostess Brands, and was approved at a special meeting of Gores Holdingsâ shareholders on November 3, 2016. In connection with the transaction, Gores Holdings has been renamed Hostess Brands, Inc. (âHostessâ or âthe Companyâ), and its common stock and warrants will trade on NASDAQ under the symbols âTWNKâ and âTWNKWâ, respectively.As previously announced, along with the $375 million of Gores Holdingsâ shareholder equity, additional investors comprising large institutional investors, C. Dean Metropoulos (through $50 million of additional rollover contribution) and Gores affiliates participated in a $350 million private placement, led by Alec Gores, Chairman and CEO of The Gores Group. Additionally, funds managed by affiliates of Apollo Global Management, LLC (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, âApolloâ) (APO) and C. Dean Metropoulos and family, the prior majority owners of Hostess, will continue to hold an approximately 42% combined stake in the Company. Dean Metropoulos and William Toler continue to lead Hostess as Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, respectively.Dean Metropoulos, Executive Chairman of Hostess, stated, âWe are excited to introduce Hostess as a public company and I am extremely proud of the job our team has done in repositioning and growing Hostess during the past four years. I believe the Company has strong growth potential and can think of no one better to partner with in this next journey than Alec Gores and the Gores team who have a well-earned reputation for not only identifying, but adding value to the businesses with which they affiliate.âAlec Gores, Chairman and CEO of The Gores Group, said, âHostess and its best-known product are the epitome of American icons. Dean, Bill and their team have done an outstanding job of positioning the Company for future, profitable growth. We are thrilled to be part of the next stage in this Companyâs life and look forward to helping create value for our shareholders.âAndrew Jhawar, Senior Partner and Head of the Consumer & Retail Group at Apollo, added, âHostess has many exciting levers for continued growth going forward, and the Company is well positioned given its strong leadership, dedicated team members and loyal customer base. Becoming a public company is the next evolution in the revitalization of Hostess. Our team at Apollo looks forward to working with the Gores team, the Companyâs new Board members and Dean, Bill and the rest of the management team in assisting to drive profitable growth and future shareholder value at Hostess.âIn 2013, C. Dean Metropoulos and certain funds affiliated with Apollo acquired select Hostess assets out of the liquidation of the old Hostess Brands company. That summer, they returned Hostess products to store shelves after a months-long absence in what became one of the biggest news stories of the year. Since that time, the management team has successfully rebuilt the business and the brand through investments to enhance operations, creative product innovation, expanded distribution through a direct-to-warehouse system, targeted acquisitions and a competitive business model. Hostess had revenues for the twelve months ended June 30, 2016 of approximately $658 million and operates five baking facilities located in Emporia, KS, Indianapolis, IN, Columbus, GA and Southbridge, MA.Upon completion of the transaction, the Hostess Board of Directors consists of Dean Metropoulos, Mark Stone, Andrew Jhawar, Larry Bodner, Neil Defeo, Jerry Kaminski and Craig Steeneck.Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. acted as lead capital markets advisor and financial advisor, Moelis & Company and Morgan Stanley acted as joint-capital markets advisors and Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP acted as legal advisor to Gores Holdings.
