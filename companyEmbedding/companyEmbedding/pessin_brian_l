If you do have attorneys you are familiar with, ask who they believe would be best for you. After going through personal references - especially from individuals who had similar needs - you should broaden your search through public information resources. You can call your area's attorney referral service or check legal organizations like Martindale-Hubbell. There are other resources available online, such as yellowpages.com. You can check websites for client reviews and other third-party forms of approval.Why should I hire a lawyer?If you sign documents and you come across a word you don't recognize, or you need help to navigate important employment or real estate paperwork. Also, during times when personal matters intersect with legal proceedings, you might need to have an advocate to prevent your emotions from getting in the way. If you've been accused of a crime or are in a terrible financial situation, you can find an attorney who will work with what you have available.What can I have an attorney do for me?When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time. The more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs, the better.

You need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship.
The attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updates.
You should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust. Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship. Ask as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle.
How much will an attorney cost?You need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney. You should request a list of all costs in advance so you won't be surprised by additional expenses like overhead. Also determine exactly when you will start being billed. You want to inspect paperwork carefully. If the attorney charges you for his or her experience, you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistant. Find out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour. Many civil lawyers work on contingency. Make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performance.Can I ask an attorney about past cases they worked on?You can ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases. You should check their office for the appropriate certifications and diplomas. You can also ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.What does a family lawyer do?Family attorneys deal with personal matters. If you're getting married, a family lawyer can help you prepare a prenuptial agreement or other family planning paperwork, such as adoption or inheritance documents.What does a divorce attorney do?Most people will turn to a lawyer during a divorce to navigate the emotionally charged legal proceedings. A divorce attorney can assist in determining grounds for separation, division of property and custody of children.What does a personal injury lawyer do?When you're hurt by an outside party, and you would like to hold them legally responsible, a personal injury attorney conducts litigation and negotiates settlements to compensate for your pain and suffering. Sometimes many wronged people will join with a single civil lawyer or law office to form a class action lawsuit.What does a civil attorney do?If you are suing someone or being sued, you need a civil lawyer. Civil attorneys argue on your behalf in a courtroom setting. Civil lawyers may represent you on matters of business, finance or a wide variety of other specialized needs.What does a bankruptcy lawyer do?A bankruptcy lawyer can help create strategies to bring you out of debt and speak to your creditors. A lawyer can advise you on which type of bankruptcy you should file for.See more Tips & AdviceLaw Office of Stuart DiMartini1325 Avenue Of The Americas, New York, NY 10019(347) 378-3962PI Law is all we do!

He helped my whole family get together. He was a true blessing for us through the whole extensive immigration process. He is extremely knowledgeable, unbelievably patient and tactful with people and he has an amazing personality. Mr. Weinman deserves not all the 6 rating stars but 7 and I will be very specific with you, as I have been in the position of a person who reads tons of reviews looking for a good lawyer. Lets start with the fact that before hiring Mr. Weinman I personally met with about 15 lawyers, some of them even recommended by friends. The problem was that I wasnt happy with any of them. I worked for 18 years as a Human resource specialist and I have the training to recognize the people that can get the job done. Frankly spoken, some of the lawyers I met at that time were very convincing but I was also very well-prepared for my appointments with them and at the end they didnt seem to me either very competent or honest enough or something else was missing. Then, I was browsing online, reading different reviews and I found Mr. Weinman. There were several nice reviews and I decided to try with an initial appointment. Yet when you open the door you see that his office is organized in a manner that is only possible for someone confident, knowledgeable and honest. The next pleasant surprise was that he doesnt make you wait and he doesnt need to, as he gains immediately the clients respect with his positive and honest approach and his extensive knowledge. We discussed L1 visa, H1 visa, E1 and E2 and I decided to hire him right on the spot. 18 months later, I am so happy with my decision because he helped my mother, then my father and then my best friend. 3 out of 3 absolutely successful cases. Two of them I know were extremely difficult. Thank you, Mr. Weinman, you are a true blessing for me and my family! And for those of you who took the time to read my review, I wish you just a little good luck because I know now that you will be in the hands of a great lawyer.Law Office of Ganesh N. Viswanathan, EsqMaria R. ratedI am a woman from the Caribbean Island and even though I have been living here for a number of years, I have had very little interaction with the court systems and litigation. A person who is from the same Islands, married me a decade and half ago, and we have a child. After many years into the marriage, I was not even aware he went ahead and filed for divorce. Over the years, he has accumulated a lot of savings in pension plans and retirement funds and he is quite smart in understanding how the legal systems work. I was not aware of any of his assets; one day, he filed for a divorce and then pretended as if nothing happened. He never served on me directly, but, was devising a way to fool me by not serving but going ahead and obtaining a default order, with no disclosure and no distribution to me. I was naive but something in my mind was telling me something was not alright, because, my neighbors told me somebody like a process server came to my home in my absence. I went and checked the Court and to my horror I found out my husband filed a divorce action against me more than a year ago; this is the time, when I somehow came into contact Mr. Viswanathan's Office and his Office did a brilliant job in bringing into light everything that happened right on my back and explained everything to me. My Law Office immediately moved the Court and in detail put forth in the papers before the Court everything that happened. Now, my case proceeding very well far beyond my expectations. I shall be entitled to a share in his assets; further, I am going to be entitled to a good spousal support and a child support. I did not even imagine that I would be entitled to a penny from my husband. All because of the great investigative legal work carried out by Mr. Viswanathan and his excellent team. I am now so happy because of their great work. My husband whom I meet every week, is sulking and the nature of his talk completely changed - for the betterThe Law Office of Lance Fletcherkurt-22nyc ratedStop looking around the Internet and just read.  I just got a new job and my coworkers took me out for a celebration. We went out for drinks and to make matters worse, I started drinking shots.  Big mistake because I had several. (I'm done with shots from this point on)  I got into a fight - apparently - I don't remember the details but I woke up in a cell with cuts and bruises. I got charged with assault for hitting a guy and pushing him to the ground and resisting arrest and I thought my life was over because you can't get a good job with a record. I was scared, frustrated, confused, and I started looking around for a good lawyer to take my case. I came across Lance Fletcher's website and it looked pretty good.  You never know if that means it's gonna be a good lawyer so I called him for a consultation.  When I went to see him, I was a nervous reck and couldn't sleep.  I didn't want to lose my job or go to jail.  During the consultation, we discussed similar cases he's had like mine.  Turns out he's a former prosecutor and he really knew what he was talkin about. After I saw him, I had the best nights sleep since the arrest. He looked me in the eye and explained how he was going to keep my record clean and fight the case.  Most of the lawyers I spoke to just wanted money right away but Mr. fletcher was more interested in me and the case.  He took the time to meet and discuss the details. On the first court date, he filed a motion to dismiss. He got a copy of the medical records, saw that the other guy wasn't really hurt, and got the DA to drop the criminal charges.  I had to do a brief anger class but I avoided jail and no criminal record. I got to keep my job and I can't thank him enough. One thing - I wish I saw him sooner because my family tried to set me up with a lawyer but that guy didn't know what he was talking about and had me pretty scared.  Turk, Hugh M, JD1984perry ratedThere was little to no response (not even taking two minutes to send a follow-up email or telephone call) to my many inquiries for help with my case from one of the lawyers and his secretary of this firm. The wheels of justice may move at a very slow pace yet apparently something else was going on here; undoubtedly, they are preoccupied with larger concerns. However, if certain people within this office are unable, unwilling or uninterested in assisting the one who is inexperienced in legal matters (perhaps with unrealistic expectations, yet unfortunately forced into a legal circumstance though small in scope), then simply say so. But please do not ignore an individual for months--especially after promising to help. Initially, you had given hope to this expunged "criminal" and after he pleaded again and again for assistance some action was finally taken. Now, it appears it is all over. The abusive, unchecked and condescending authorities have won. The incurring frustration, seemingly endless wait, as well as the expensive fees were paid by this innocent victim. And despite the adversities and disappointments he will go on, wishing well of authorities, legal professionals and, most of all, hoping to be safeguarded from both professions since he is simply a law-abiding citizen, who probably needs to forget the injustice committed against him, and only wants to make his way in this world. With malice toward none, may there be mutual respect, honesty and compassion among all peoples and our various ways of life.Law Offices of Lauren Goldberg, PLLCEli B. ratedI had lost all hope that I would get through my horrible 5 year of back pay situation at Work, religion discrimination and long harassment; after other lawyers had turned me down and said I had no Case!    From the initial meeting, Lauren Goldberg were responsive to my calls, questions and concerns. All issues were handled professionally and in timely manner.Lauren Goldberg is a team of lawyers in one Brilliant person; she is an outstanding lawyer and person!Lauren is a sharp strategist and truly cares for her many clients. She provided both me, and my wife excellent support and quality service,Lauren was also very responsive via e mail and phone whenever I had questions and compassionate when I was stressed and upset.I always felt that my needs were met and that the firm was invested in my case and me.Lauren was easily accessible, got back to me quickly, worked with me to understand me,although English is my Second language, Lauren understood me and asked many question.Lauren Goldberg Billing rates are VERY fair!

Lauren had helped me with the financial expense beyond my expectation; I would recommend Lauren Goldberg for your case! Lauren was aggressive to our adversaries and got me the results that I wanted.Lauren is concise and very powerful with her words leaving no stone unturned!(And I was Happy to pay my Taxes!)Timothy S. Hart, Tax Attorney and CPASarah V. ratedI came to Tim with a huge tax bill resulting from a foreclosure a few years prior. I procrastinated handling the issue and felt like there was zero hope for me to resolve. At the request of my family, I sought legal counsel. Not knowing where to turn to find a lawyer (it was the first time I had even sought such help), I researched the best tax lawyers online via YELP and other sites. Tim’s reviews were all very positive and some of them reminded me of my problem so I thought maybe he can help me too.I was nervous speaking to him for the first time. Completely intimidated and ashamed. He was totally professional, kind and passed no judgement. He only wanted to help me figure out a solution. He was easy to speak to and any confusing legalese was quickly explained so I could understand.As it turned out in the end, and after Tim’s deep dive into my returns and the tax law, he discovered that my accountant had made an error and the payment was not necessary. I owed nothing. Had I not sought Tim’s help, I can assure you that I would be sitting here still feeling the heavy weight of the IRS looming over me. He truly saved me. If you are desperate, afraid, confused by the IRS and/or owe them money and  feel you have nowhere to turn, you must contact Tim Hart. You will not regret it. Don’t be afraid to make the first contact.Law Office of Paul R. Kenneymissdiatribe ratedAfter over a year of negotiating a real estate agreement, frustrations mounted and I needed to hire an attorney. Around the busy 4th of July season, I reached out to a few referrals from friends and neither of those attorneys got back to me. However, through some online research, I came across great reviews of the Law Offices of Paul Kenney, which is conveniently located on the Upper West Side, in a more serene location than the insanity of Midtown and Wall St. Paul responded to my inquiry right away and was wonderful with follow-up from there on out. His fees were incredibly reasonable and I had no idea how much easier the process would be with him facilitating. Our first meeting took away all the mounting anxiety I had accumulated and the entire process became painless and stress-free. Paul managed to get all that I wanted put into the contract and approved. He has a unique talent for finding the right approach in handling the eccentric and sometimes difficult characters that saturate the real estate market in NYC.  His savvy and pleasant disposition completely disarmed the other party. He made himself available to me for any questions or concerns that popped up and was incredibly diligent in handling all the details.  I would absolutely recommend him to anyone in need of a real estate attorney.Law Office of Paul R. KenneyLara B. ratedI was suddenly thrown into a roommate battle with a friend I had lived with for over a year regarding a sublease and frantically started searching for tenant lawyers. Paul was the very first to get back to me and after hearing my story, he was very straight forward and clear in explaining what my options were. He wasn't intimidating to talk to, and didn't ask for payment before telling me his opinion and advice. This unofficial consultation would have cost over $350 for at the other lawyers I had reached out to. (As quoted in their e-mails!) I told him I'd like to continue working with him until the issue was solved and he became my savior through the whole process. He worked with my roommates lawyer to settle the issues and kept me updated every step of the way. Even when I got nervous and would call him at random times during the day, he took my call and would reassure me that he is on top of the situation and that he would continue to work on any other issues that arose with her. When all the issues were resolved, he stuck to the very reasonable price that he originally quoted me - no surprise fees or over charges. I would recommend him to any and all of my friends and I would go back to him in a heartbeat. I feel very lucky to have found him.  The Law Office of Lance Fletcherscottm75 ratedI hired this lawyer for a Felony A very unfortunate thing happened over the holidays.  While I was on probation for DWI, I got arrested again for the same thing. I was SO SCARED I couldn't sleep at night. The judge let me out on bail and I found the Law Office of Lance Fletcher online. when I called I was able to speak with Mr. Fletcher right away.  He was smart and honest and a good guy. From the moment I first met him, his passion and confidence really impressed me. During the case, he kept in touch about things the DA was trying to do to me, it looked like I was going to jail for a while buy Mr Fletcher said we had to keep fighting and giving them motions and push for better. It was all good in the end because I got off with only a fine some classes and no driving for a while. I even avoided a felony record. I still can't believe I stayed out of jail!!!! Every other lawyer I talked to before hiring Mr. Fletcher told me I was going to jail.  Now Every day I go outside and see the sun I know I made a good decision to hire this lawyer. Did You Know?Types of AttorneysThe legal profession is vast, with each attorney having his or her specialties. Here are some of the most common attorneys individuals seek out when they require legal aid:Criminal Lawyer
A criminal defense lawyer is probably the attorney the average person imagines. Criminal attorneys are the men and women who defend individuals accused of a crime. The lawyer may work pro bono - for the public good - so the accused is certain to have representation, even if he or she cannot afford an attorney.Criminal lawyers are experts in the criminal justice system. They help their clients decide how to plead when first charged by the police and guide them through trial procedures. Defense lawyers must use every bit of their knowledge and resources to get their clients the fairest results from criminal proceedings.Business Lawyer
If you are a small business owner or the head of a larger corporation, you may come into contact with a business lawyer. Many big companies keep a legal staff on payroll to deal with the daily operations of running and maintaining a large enterprise. Business lawyers may have more specific specialties like copyright law, product liability and mergers and acquisitions.Business attorneys may focus their practices on certain industries. There are entertainment lawyers to guide artists through royalties and media contracts, while hospitals employ malpractice attorneys to protect doctors from aggressive litigation.Employment Lawyer
When you work for a company, you may find yourself in need of an employment lawyer - especially if the relationship between you and your employer sours. An employment attorney prevents people from losing their jobs due to unfair reasons. Workers' compensation lawyers help maintain safe employment conditions and ensure workers receive fair compensation after workplace injury or discrimination.Finance Lawyer
A personal finance attorney can protect and manage your investments and securities. You may use a finance lawyer to help you prepare your taxes, but you might be better off working with an accountant. A tax attorney is more commonly contacted after a business or individual runs into trouble with the IRS or state regulators.Real Estate Lawyer
Your family may keep a lawyer on retainer to guide you through the major expenses that come up in life. When buying a home, you could work with a real estate lawyer to make sure you get the best deal and won't get taken advantage of by tricky mortgage agreements or unfair landlords. An estate attorney can help you plan for the worst by creating a will and preparing your finances for after your death.Bankruptcy Lawyer
A bankruptcy lawyer is essential to help you resolve your financial difficulties when they start to spin out of control. Certain attorneys help create strategies to bring you out of debt and speak to your creditors. A lawyer can advise you on which type of bankruptcy you should file for.Civil Lawyer
If you are suing someone or being sued, you need a civil lawyer. Civil attorneys - and criminal lawyers - are the legal representatives who argue on your behalf in a courtroom setting. Civil lawyers may represent you on matters of business, finance or a wide variety of other specialized needs.One of the most common types of civil attorneys is a personal injury lawyer. When you're hurt by an outside party and you would like to hold them legally responsible, a personal injury attorney conducts litigation and negotiates settlements to compensate for your pain and suffering. Sometimes many wronged people will join together with a single civil lawyer or law office to form a class action lawsuit.Family/Divorce Lawyer
Most people will turn to a lawyer during a divorce to navigate the emotionally charged legal proceedings. A divorce attorney can assist in determining grounds for separation, division of property and custody of children.Family attorneys deal with much more personal matters. If you're getting married, a family lawyer can help you prepare a prenuptial agreement or other family planning paperwork such as adoption or inheritance documents.Questions One Should Ask a Lawyer Before Hiring ThemTo ensure you find a competent attorney who won't abuse your trust or drain your finances, you have to make the proper inquiries. There are several questions you should ask, but the majority will fall under three general topics:Training and Experience Questions
One of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorney's history. When you first step into a lawyer's office, you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas. You have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.Once you inquire about the broad details of their legal career, you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue. You should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases.Financial Questions
You need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney. You should request a list of all costs in advance so you won't be surprised by additional expenses like overhead. Also determine exactly when you will start being billed. You want to inspect paperwork carefully. If the attorney charges you for his or her experience, you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistant.Find out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour. Many civil lawyers work on contingency. Whatever the payment plan, make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performance.Lawyer/Client Relationship Questions
When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time. You need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship. The attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updates.You should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust. Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship. Great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier, such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle. The more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs, the better.Top Reasons to Hire a LawyerYou may keep a lawyer on retainer or you could turn to an attorney during specific situations. Here are some common reasons people begin seeking legal representation or advice:You Know Your Limitations
If you sign documents and you come across a word you don't recognize, you need assistance. You may need a third party to help you navigate important employment or real estate paperwork. It's essential you fully understand the terms of any legally binding documentation or activity you become a part of. If you are not an expert in a given field, you'll want to hire an attorney who is.A lawyer may find legal implications or opportunities you might miss. If you find yourself in a civil or criminal matter, a proper attorney ensures you don't receive a harsh punishment for a small mistake.You're Facing an Important Event/Decision
When making decisions critical to your financial stability or personal life, you may want a lawyer with expertise in your situation to make sure you do everything you can to arrive at the proper resolution. This is especially true when you become involved in a criminal case and your freedom is on the line.It's not just a matter of legal knowledge; lawyer's have access to numerous resources you do not. They have staff ready to work around the clock and experts in a variety of fields to give your important issues the attention they deserve.You Can't Be Impartial
During times when personal matters intersect with legal proceedings, you may need to have an advocate to prevent your emotions from getting in the way of level-headed thinking. For example, divorce lawyers can mediate a heated argument and help both partners get on with their lives.Emotional investment could be subtle. You may want to have a lawyer look over an investment opportunity that looks too good to be true or investigate the merits of a possible civil suit when you feel wronged.You're Out of Options
Many people turn to lawyers when they are in trouble. If you've been accused of a crime or are in a terrible financial situation, you can find an attorney who will work with what you have available to assist you as you deal with your problems.Personal injury lawyers find solutions for people who can no longer work under their own power and bankruptcy attorneys prevent people from giving in to debt. If you find yourself in a situation where you can't find a solution, a lawyer may be able to offer the counsel you need.How to Choose a LawyerWhen it comes time to choose a lawyer, you should start by searching close to home. While you probably don't want the conflict of interest that comes from being represented by a family member, friends and loved ones can recommend lawyers who served them well in the past. If you do have attorneys you are familiar with, ask who they believe would be best for you.After going through personal references - especially from individuals who had similar needs - you should broaden your search through public information resources. You can call your area's attorney referral service or check legal organizations like Martindale-Hubbell. There are other resources available online. You should check websites for client reviews and other third-party forms of approval.When you build a list of possible candidates, perform a background check on each one. See if you can find information on their history and success record. Once you find a possible lawyer, you should call to arrange a consultation so you can ask your important questions in person.By performing the necessary research and taking every available precaution, you can narrow your search to the attorney most suited to your needs.
