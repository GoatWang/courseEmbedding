Net Medical Xpress Letter to Shareholders
15 November 2016 -  Net Medical Xpress Solutions, Inc. (OTCQB SYMBOL: NMXS),  released the yearly Letter to Shareholders, which follows in total.
Letter to Shareholders November, 2016
As we begin to wrap up 2016 at Net Medical, I wanted to provide everyone with some perspective on the state of affairs at the company.
A Transition Year
We’ve been dealing with numerous technology and market disruptions. Our engineering team needed to replace outdated legacy software. We worked to complete our Telemedicine software, which we announced last December. We introduced the Telemed Building Blocks to most of our current customers. We outsourced our FDA viewer for radiologists and other physicians who interpret plain films, CTs, Ultrasounds, etc. This effort is ongoing as we are adding yet another third party FDA cleared viewer to offer our physicians more choices.
We are striving for future cost savings by moving our data storage to third party vendors. The engineering team is adopting the Amazon cloud to handle our cloud services and interact with our video conferencing products. We have nearly completed this massive undertaking that required additional engineering efforts. We completed the transition from our DFC3 (Digital Filing Cabinet) to outsource our product to The Box. Initially this resulted in revenue losses but the decision to retire a technology that was over 10 years old was the right choice.
In operations, it takes about six months for an employee to develop the expertise to deal with the multitude of telemedicine issues. We have added to our operations staff and created an Office of Program Management. A former employee returned in October to assist the team in preparing for an influx of new programs that will drive our growth during 2017. The department works with engineering to develop and coordinate new customers and train operations staff in the complex world of telemedicine.
During the year as we opted out of older legacy customers, we experienced a loss in our radiology business. However, in September, we began to rebuild our customer network including a return of customers who had left because of lower commodity pricing. We are adding an expert sales professional from the teleradiology industry who will join us after the first of the year. We expect our radiology business to rebound during 2017.
Serving Rural Hospitals with Telemedicine Services
Our Specialists Division, which handles patient cases in rural hospitals, is also picking up. We’ve added several new customers and expect that to accelerate during 2017. We forecast that we can double our business in neurology and neuro surgery cases. As an example of the success, one hospital reported to us that their October caseload rose to 56 cases from an average of 35 - 40 cases per month. Of the 56 cases, 31 patients were admitted instead of being transferred and 16 were discharged home safely. There were three neurosurgery consults and seven inpatient consults. The good news is only two patients needed to be transferred, which resulted in multiple benefits for the patient, the patient’s family and the rural hospital. The CEO of one rural hospital customer told us that prior to our telemedicine program as many as ten times the number of patients would have had to be transferred at great expense to the patient and insurance companies. The cost of our service to the hospital was about $30,000 but the additional revenue for the hospital was about $1.9 million. We’re getting this type of feedback from many of our rural hospitals.
Our Expertise is Growing
Our neurology staff is also growing. Radiology staff has been reduced about 10% due to increased efficiencies among current staff. Other case studies including primary care (our largest group of providers) is our biggest area of growth and we expect that to continue in 2017.
In our staffing division, we have brought our permanent database of physicians to nearly one million professionals. We invested in a huge program of communications by both email and direct recruiting for both our customers and Net Medical. We’ll see multiple programs in 2017 including new insurance companies, international customers and physicians who will be providing service for LGBT, HIV and Dermatology patients. In one company alone, we will be providing doctors for over 250,000 patients. Currently, the division is in the process of recruiting an additional 175 physicians. The staffing company which we purchased four years ago will be very busy during the coming year.
Promising New Initiatives
Net Medical Xpress has just collaborated with an emerging domestic and international Telehealth and Telemedicine company (TelePlus Health Care). TelePlus is a complete Telehealth solution that addresses all the major health care issues. Net Medical and TelePlus have partnered with the top specialists in the country that specialize in Chronic Care, Diabetes, Primary Care, Mental Health, substance abuse and follow up care all integrated on a single secure portable electronic medical record. Net Medical Xpress and TelePlus Health Care have partnered with the largest hospital system in New Jersey as well as three other world class Universities. Both Net Medical Xpress and TelePlus are expected to be one of the largest telemedicine companies in China, USA, Ireland and Taiwan in the next year.
The program involves some six affiliated telemedicine companies. Net Medical will provide recruiting services, pharmacy prescription software, Quest Care 360 lab software and video conferencing software for all services. We plan to provide video conferencing equipment for all companies involved in the program. In addition we will provide neurology, cardiology, endocrinology, pulmonology, and dermatology specialists for all states using the specialist portion of the program.
We are also in talks with a multinational company headquartered in Australia that plan to integrate our video conferencing product for sale in Asia, Australia, New Zealand and eventually the U.S.
Healthy Cash Flow and the Look Ahead
On the financial side, we remain healthy with good cash flow. While we suffered losses in 2016, we are building and upgrading our products in anticipation of future revenue increases. We have been financing these investments from internal cash flow, which alleviates the need to go outside the company for financing. No financing is planned although we have access to multiple lines of credit from two banking facilities.
We had to call on our malpractice insurance company twice this year, first, to assist with a suit in an alleged wrongful death at a hospital in 2012 and secondly after a jailed illegal brought charges against one of our radiologists. We expect both of these suits to be dismissed since the suits in our opinion have no merit. However, in a medical lawsuit nearly everyone involved in providing care for a patient is brought into a suit. Since we began offering telemedicine ten years ago, we have had three lawsuits against us all of which have been dismissed. Still, we are faced with a high deductible payment in our malpractice insurance that we carry to defend our company in the event of litigation.
While we have been making major investments in our infrastructure and staffing, our goal is to return to profitability as quickly as possible. Some of the anticipated sales we previously forecast for this year have been delayed until 2017. Our sales goals depend on finding customers who fit our service capabilities. Net Medical is now poised to bring on five major customers. We’ve been in contract discussions with these customers for over seven months. It takes a lengthy amount of time to transition out of total dependency on radiology medical services to our more profitable specialist programs. Those goals are now being realized.
Net Medical is not currently planning any acquisitions during the coming year. However, if opportunities present themselves, we will certainly evaluate any merger activity.
Our staff is looking forward to the coming year and the opportunities that it presents. I greatly appreciate the support that so many of you have given us. This was not an easy year by any means, but our pipeline of new business has never looked more promising.
Dick Govatski
Chairman, President & CEO

No fractional shares of common stock will be issued as a result of the reverse stock split. Stockholders with at least one who share will have their fractional shares rounded up.  There is no need to submit certificates for exchange; however, to receive a new certificate the pre-split certificate must be submitted to the Company’s transfer agent.  Stockholders with only a fractional share will be paid for their pre-split shares at the closing price on June 20, 2016, upon delivery of the pre-split stock certificate to the Company’s transfer agent.  Proportional adjustments will be made to Net Medical’s outstanding warrants and stock options. The Company’s authorized shares and the par value per share of $0.001 will remain unchanged.
Trading of the Company’s common stock on the OTC QB market will continue, on a split-adjusted basis, with the opening of the markets on Tuesday, June 21, 2016, under the existing trading symbol “NMXS” and under a new CUSIP number 64111U204.  The reverse stock split reduces the number of shares of the Company’s common stock outstanding from 174,622,470 million pre-reverse split shares to 19,402,796 million post-reverse split shares.
Richard Govatski, the Company’s chief executive officer, stated:  “This move by the Company is expected to improve earnings per share which, when coupled with our continually improving operating performance, is expected to position the Company to achieve a listing on the NASDAQ Small Cap Market.”
Information for Stockholders
The Company has retained its transfer agent, Interwest Transfer, to act as its exchange agent for the reverse stock split. Interwest will provide stockholders of record as of the Effective Time a letter of transmittal providing instructions for the exchange of their stock certificates. Stockholders owning shares via a broker or other nominee will have their positions automatically adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split, subject to such brokers' particular processes, and will not be required to take any action in connection with the reverse stock split.

Net Medical Xpress Reports Q1 2016 Continued Profitability in Rapidly Changing Telemedicine Environment
15 May 2016 -  Net Medical Xpress Solutions, Inc. (OTCQB SYMBOL: NMXS),  continued profitability in a rapidly changing telemedicine environment with 2016 first quarter revenue of $918,000 and net income of $20,000 or
$0.00 per share.
CEO Dick Govatski said, “We have entered a period of significant transition away from our legacy businesses in radiology and cardiology. Excellent gains in our Specialists segment were boosted by our Access grant with the University of New Mexico as well as our ability to add new customers and new customers in our Primary Care segment.
“During the quarter we held down costs, which enabled us to record another profitable quarter. Loss of customers in our legacy Radiology and Cardiology services segments due to industry consolidations offset gains in the Neurological and Primary Care
services of our Specialists Division and Staffing services. Losses in our legacy Radiological services reflected smaller customers using multiple providers to meet their budgets and larger customers running their own in-house radiological programs. New providers that have entered the cardiology market also have negatively impacted pricing.
“Looking forward, we have multiple initiatives underway, some of which we expect to announce in the second quarter. Net Medical has emerged as a full service telemedicine company with the capability to recruit, credential and support physicians in
a variety of medical disciplines. We support telemedicine operations with a 24/7/365 call center while providing web based patient and doctor portals and the ability to administer and manage those programs.
“The telemedicine industry is changing rapidly. Here at Net Medical we are changing with it. We believe we are ahead of the curve in multiple telemedicine disciplines including service, software, hardware and staffing. Our business is transforming dramatically for the better as legacy segments are phased out and we enter exciting new areas that we expect to be profitable. This will be reflected in our results for the year,” Govatski said.

Net Medical Xpress Turns Profitable in 2015 With Positive Cash Flow Reflecting Tele-Medicine Services Growth
30 March 2016 -  Net Medical Xpress Solutions, Inc. (OTCQB SYMBOL: NMXS), announced today 2015 revenue of $4,220,000 vs. revenue of $4,583,000 in 2014. The company reported net income of $151,000 or $0.00 per share versus a net loss of ($482,000) or $0.00 per share last year.
CEO Dick Govatski said, “We were pleased to report a profitable year in 2015 with positive cash flows that reflected the strong gains in our Specialist program and the growth of our Primary Care Services. We recorded exceptionally strong growth in our higher margin Neurology Services that included our share of the grant from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to the University of New Mexico to establish a 30-hospital telehealth system in New Mexico over a three-year period.
“The project is helping CMS study the impact of providing telemedicine for critical care services in rural areas. By delivering critical cerebral emergency support services, we enable hospitals to provide patient care in a local facility without needing patient transport to larger distant hospitals. We also realized important gains in associated hardware sales.
“The strong gains in our Specialist Services segment partially offset revenue declines in our Radiological and Cardiological services that reflected pricing pressures and customer losses in 2015 in a highly competitive market place. Indications are the two segments will remain reasonably stable in 2016. We began offering behavioral medicine services in April 2015 and we expect revenues in this category will increase moderately during 2016.
“Our debt free balance sheet is an indication of our commitment to be self-funding. We worked diligently during the year to trim costs wherever possible in our effort to achieve profitability. We recorded reductions in spending almost across the board, reflecting to some degree reduced physician fees in our radiology segment and a corresponding reduction in administrative and sales staffing.
“Our confidence in the growing importance of tele-medicine as a critical element in a successful national health care system is as strong as ever. We continue to design and develop new techniques and applications that have national relevance. Our developmental pipeline is strong and we have in place steps in 2016 that we believe will be beneficial to our shareholders,“ Govatski said.

Net Medical Xpress Announces New Wi-Fi Enhancements To Its Telemedicine Video Conferencing System
22 February 2016 -  Net Medical Xpress Solutions, Inc. (OTCQB SYMBOL: NMXS), a provider of a wide range of telemedicine services, has now developed a major improvement to its WebRTC Conference Switch technology.
Rafael Rubio, Chief Technology Officer, Net Medical said, “We have extended the feature set of our video conferencing cart to activate the built in Wi-Fi capabilities for connecting to WPA networks. Previously, we only supported wireless through the use of a customer supplied bridge which, in theory, would provide the best integration possible to various networks. In practice, the wireless bridges were often unreliable or too slow to connect for a telemedicine application.”
Dick Govatski, CEO, Net Medical, said “Due to customer demand, we combined the Dell OptiPlex 9030 All-in-One desktop with our custom Linux operating system to connect to Wi-Fi networks directly and to act as a signal strength meter for identifying the strong and weak areas of coverage.”

Net Medical Xpress Announces Comprehensive New Telemedicine Building Blocks
Expected to be Released to Over 100 Hospitals in 2016
15 December 2015 -  Net Medical Xpress Solutions, Inc. (OTCQB SYMBOL: NMXS), a provider of a wide range of telemedicine services, announced today the release of its new Telemed Building Blocks technology that enables healthcare facilities to set up their own customized Telemedicine infrastructure platforms.
In announcing the new technology, Net Medical, CEO Dick Govatski said, “When a perfect application can’t be found and nothing seems to fit specific processes and procedures, we provide the building blocks that will enable companies to assemble a fully-integrated custom platform to handle all their telemedicine requirements in a way that will work for them and will specifically fit their needs.
“Think of it as an Erector Set, Lincoln logs or Legos. Each module, based on our proprietary digital paper system, builds upon other modules to craft a smoothly-functioning, easy to manage telemedicine platform. Our robust browser-based system is capable of supporting everything from a small medical operation to the very largest company with fully integrated video conferencing, IT engineering, device integration, EMR setup, digital signatures and digital paper.
“With our system, a facility can use and translate their current paper forms to full digital for electronic signatures from remote locations. Couple that with video conferencing, cloud technology and integration with Electronic Medical Records and you’ve got the idea of how our Telemed Building Blocks are ideal for setting up a telemedicine platform with a myriad of custom combinations specific to the needs of any organization,” Govatski said.

Telemed Building Blocks has a low cost entry licensing subscription price of $5,000. Customers are then eligible for the purchase of Net Medical’s additional products including custom programming, call center access, program team management, Amazon HIPAA Cloud servers, telemedicine doctor network and WebRTC video conferencing between providers and patients.  Net Medical uses custom Dell hardware for telemedicine while providing the necessary technology for customers to program their own telemedicine systems.
Govatski said, “We initially expect approximately 100 domestic and international customers will begin using the technology in 2016. This will give us a strong head start toward another profitable year in our growing telemedicine business.”

For the first nine months of 2015, Net Medical reported revenue of $3,379,000 vs. revenue of $3,536,000 in the first nine months of 2014. The company reported net income of $212,000 or $0.00 per share versus a net loss of ($173,000) or $0.00 per share in the first nine months of last year.
CEO Dick Govatski said, “Our ongoing transformation to profitability and financial health continued in the third quarter of 2015 with reported net income through the first nine months of $205,000. The quarter benefited from gains in our Specialist segment reflecting gains in neurological and primary care services as well as the CMS (Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services) grant with the University of New Mexico. We also had important gains in program hardware sales in our Specialists programs
“Our revenue was lower than last year due to decreased revenue in our radiological services because of the loss of three customers in 2014 and 2015. The market has become increasingly competitive with corresponding impacts on pricing and margins. As a result, we are concentrating our efforts to grow our specialist division to offset the slowdown in our radiology and cardiological services where we face increasing competition resulting in pricing pressure.
“Our debt-free balance sheet reflects ongoing gains in assets and decreases in liabilities. For the first nine months we generated over $330,000 in cash from operating activities. We are excited about the future of telemedicine and our role in the industry. There are numerous opportunities to expand our telemedicine efforts and we are working on those initiatives now,” Govatski said.

Net Medical to Offer Telemedicine Stroke Program to Rural Hospitals
Company Installing First Integration of CEREBROS™ in Arizona
28 July 2015 -  Net Medical Xpress Solutions, Inc. (OTCQB SYMBOL: NMXS), a leader in the telemedicine field, announced today the introduction of a new stroke program for rural hospitals. The company is installing its first integration of the CEREBROS™ stroke management program from Corazon at an Arizona hospital.
CEREBROS™ has a web-based interface that allows staff to input, import, track, monitor, discharge and report on a stroke patient to ensure appropriate care is delivered in a timely manner.
Corazon CEO, Karen Hartman, said, “The launch of this exciting program follows the recently launched Acute Stroke Ready Hospital designation (ASRH) by The Joint Commission. This certification targets rural hospitals that may not have the resources necessary to admit and care for stroke patients. Given that today, half of the U.S. population lives in excess of 60 miles from a primary stroke center, these rural providers are uniquely positioned to provide crucial initial stabilization and treatment for these patients.”
Net Medical CEO Dick Govatski said, “Our telemedicine system is the new enabler of real time stroke care for rural hospitals. We provide on a 24/7 basis qualified medical professionals trained in stroke care to perform rapid diagnostic testing using the CEREBROS™ system. Our physicians, who are trained in administering intravenous clot-busting medication to eligible patients, also can provide care guidance to general physicians in rural hospitals. Our advanced telemedicine technology makes it possible for rural hospitals that don't have full time stroke providers to fulfill the documentation and clinical functions necessary to qualify for the certification. This is another important example of how telemedicine from Net Medical Xpress is helping to improve health care while reducing costs for the providers.”
CEREBROS™ is Corazon's Stroke Patient Management and Navigation System, the first of its kind. It is changing the way hospitals deliver care to stroke patients -- from arrival and critical early timeframes through discharge. CEREBROS™ uses best-practice quality care standards as a driver to ensure the right care is delivered at the right time to the right patient. 24/7/365. CEREBROS™ is built to support certification or accreditation through any of the national organizations including The Joint Commission (TJC), Healthcare Facilities Accreditation Program (HFAP) and Det Norske Veritas (DNV) and is able to integrate information into the Get With the Guidelines (GWTG) stroke data registry.
For more information on CEREBROS™, please contact Karen Hartman, President and CEO of Corazon, at 412-364-8200 or visit www.corazoninc.com/.

Net Medical Xpress to Provide Telemedicine Services for up to 18 Hospitals in Iraq and Saudi Arabia
Consortium Expects Program Will Be Operational in 3-4 Month
22 June 2015 -  Net Medical Xpress Solutions, Inc. (OTCQB SYMBOL: NMXS) a provider of a wide range of telemedicine services, announced today that it has signed an agreement with telehealth consultant group T4 to provide telemedicine services for 7 government hospitals in Iraq and Saudi Arabia.
Net Medical CEO Dick Govatski said, “HealthStar Networks is providing diagnostic equipment and coordinating the construction of modular hospitals for the program. Each hospital will have between 25 and 100 beds. The first two hospitals are expected to be deployed in the next 90 to 120 days. These will be state controlled hospitals targeted for the general population and supported by the government. Net Medical will provide primary care physicians as well as orthopedic surgeons, cardiologists, neurologists, and trauma specialists using our telemedicine technology.
“This is another major international application of telemedicine by Net Medical Xpress. Discussions involving additional countries and regions are currently in progress. We believe the financial and medical benefits of telemedicine will have an enormous positive impact on healthcare in the United States as well as the rest of the world. Telemedicine services are going to be particularly valuable to underdeveloped countries that can quickly and easily access the expertise of American-based physicians,” Govatski said.
Ron Novak, COO, Healthstar Networks, indicated an additional 8 - 11 thirty bed hospitals will be built for military and police for trauma situations.
Terry Boulanger, principal technology consultant of T-4, an Albuquerque-based consultancy, said, “We believe that this consortium created between Healthstar, T-4, and Net Medical will answer the need for many foreign countries to provide affordable access to medical care for their populations through the use of telemedicine technology that has not been previously available. The use of modular buildings for construction allows for the rapid implementation of medical services. We are presently loading the freight containers for shipment to the Middle East.”

Net Medical Physician Demonstrates Successful Use of NMXS Technology from A Remote Corner of the Earth

(OTCQB: NMXS), a provider of a wide range of telemedicine services, announced today that a company physician has successfully provided neurological consultations to US patients while on vacation in the remote region of the Himalayan foothills at Ladakh.
Real time consults from a remote region neighboring Tibet were successful during a visit by one of Net Medical’s leading neurologists.  From mountains on the other side of the world, Dr. Neeraj Dubey took a break during his vacation in northern India to provide expert neurological consults to ER doctors for 10 patients at various hospitals in New Mexico and other states. 
Dr. Dubey said, “It was amazing to be able to offer critical and in some cases life saving clinical consults to ER doctors with vivid images of CT scans and to be able to see and talk with patients using Net Medical’s proprietary Conference Switch. The technology worked flawlessly. It was as if I was right next door to the patient.”
Net Medical CEO Dick Govatski, said, “We have developed and built a sophisticated telemedicine network of specialists and primary care physicians to provide services not only in the U.S. but throughout the world. With encryption and HIPAA rules strictly followed, this shows that our doctors can be reached and provide consultations from virtually anywhere with an Internet connection. These real time, real world tests from one of the most remote locations on the planet are striking examples of the ability of our physicians to offer certain levels of patient care from any distance. It firmly underscores our ability to provide ‘Great Healthcare Everywhere’.”

“This further strengthens our confidence that current discussions with medical professionals in the Caribbean and Asia will lead to new opportunities,” Govatski said.

AccessMD Plus is Net Medical’s first client dedicated to providing wellness services to a large national employer group.
Net Medical CEO Dick Govatski said, “Our staffing arm is ideally positioned to provide qualified physicians to AccessMD Plus, which is positioned to become a leader in non-emergency individual care telemedicine services. There are enormous advantages to individuals covered in the program who will no longer have to make long trips to a physician’s office and wait in the office for a prolonged amount of time for a non-emergency routine consultation.”
Will McNeal, CEO of AccessMD Plus, said, “It is evident that the nation’s healthcare system is in trouble. It has been recently reported that overuse and unnecessary care accounts for anywhere from one-third to one-half of all health care costs, which equal hundreds of billions of dollars. There is an apparent void in the provision of healthcare as we know it. AccessMD Plus has strategically positioned itself to bridge this gap. We are excited about this growth merger and look forward to a long-term relationship with Net Medical. We feel that their telehealth staffing expertise in conjunction with our program model, will generate increased positive outcomes to our clients.”

Net Medical Xpress Announces Q1 Revenue of $1.27 Million. Net Loss of $9k Attributable to Increased Compliance Costs
16 May 2014 -  Net Medical Xpress Solutions, Inc. (OTC Bulletin Board NMXS) a developer of medical IT solutions and services that enable improved and faster communication within the healthcare community, announced today revenue of $1,271,000 vs. revenue of $1,221,000 in the first quarter of 2013. The Company reported a net loss of $9,000 or $0.00 per share versus net income of $53,000 a year earlier.
CEO Dick Govatski said, “Our year is off to a slower start than we originally anticipated as a result of compliance costs related to upgrading our own quality systems based on the Federal Drug Administration's Title 21, the Code of Federal Regulations. Fortunately much of this effort is behind us and we are hopeful costs associated with this effort will recede in the coming quarters.
“Net Medical Xpress Services, our largest operating segment, recorded a small revenue gain to $981,000 and operating income of $130,000. We experienced a net gain in image reads for cardiological services and a small decrease in reads for radiological customers.
“Specialist segment revenues were up on an increased volume of neurological customers offset by a decrease in hardware sales in this segment. Although we were disappointed in this result, we anticipate increases in revenue from this division during the year.
“Our Solutions segment revenues were down slightly but we expect results through the end of the year to be essentially flat against 2013 results. Our Staffing segment, acquired in the third quarter of 2013, produced revenue of $67,000 for the quarter versus no revenue a year ago.”
