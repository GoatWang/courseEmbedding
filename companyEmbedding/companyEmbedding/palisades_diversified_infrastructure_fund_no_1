Source: Morningstar as of 3/31/17.
5. 9 out of 10 fixed income funds. Ranking based on Class Z share fixed income funds with 10-year history. Rankings for Class Z share fixed income funds that rank top 50% or better within their respective Morningstar Categories over the trailing 1-, 3-, & 5-year periods are 12/18 funds, 14/15 funds, and 11/13 funds, respectively. Source: Morningstar as of 3/31/17.

7. Based on U.S. Plan Sponsor rankings in Pensions & Investments as of 12/31/16.
Morningstar rankings are based on total return, do not include the effects of sales charges, and are calculated against all funds in each fund's respective Morningstar category. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Performance by share class may vary.
Star ratings shown are for Class Z shares, which are available to individual investors through certain retirement and wrap fee programs, and to institutions at an investment minimum of $5,000,000. Performance by share class may vary. In addition to the ones shown above, other classes, which contain either a sales load or a contingent deferred sales charge, are also available. These expenses will generally lower total fund return. Please see the prospectus for additional information about fees, expenses and investor eligibility requirements.
The risks associated with investing in these funds include but are not limited to: derivative securities, which may carry market, credit, and liquidity risks; short sales, which involve costs and the risk of potentially unlimited losses; leveraging, which may magnify losses; high yield (“junk”) bonds, which are subject to greater market risks; small/mid cap stocks which may be subject to more erratic market movements than large cap stocks; foreign securities, which are subject to currency fluctuation and political uncertainty; real estate, which poses certain risks related to overall and specific economic conditions as well as risks related to individual property, credit and interest-rate fluctuations; and mortgage-backed securities, which are subject to prepayment and extension risks. Sector funds and Specialty funds may not be suitable for all investors. Such funds are non-diversified, so a loss resulting from a particular security will have greater impact on the Fund's return. Fixed income investments are subject to interest rate risk, and their value will decline as interest rates rise. The risks associated with each fund are explained more fully in each fund's respective prospectus. There is no guarantee a fund's objectives will be achieved.
Some Morningstar Ratings may not be customarily based on adjusted historical returns. If so, an investment's independent Morningstar Rating metric is compared against the retail mutual fund universe breakpoints to determine its hypothetical rating for certain time periods. The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.
For the overall, 3-, 5- and 10-year periods, respectively, as of 3/31/17: Prudential Balanced Fund was rated 5 stars out of 721 funds, 5 stars out of 721 funds, and 5 stars out of 616 funds, and 4 out of 424 funds, respectively; Prudential High Yield Fund was rated 5 stars out of 596 funds, 5 stars out of 596 funds, 4 stars out of 471 funds, and 5 stars out of 318 funds, respectively; Prudential Short-Term Corporate Bond Fund, Inc. was rated 5 stars out of 444 funds, 4 stars out of 444 funds, 4 stars out of 359 funds, and 5 stars out of 257 funds, respectively; Prudential Total Return Bond Fund was rated 5 stars out of 851 funds, 5 stars out of 851 funds, 5 stars out of 750 funds, and 5 stars out of 538 funds, respectively; Prudential California Municipal Income Fund was rated 5 stars out of 69 funds, 5 stars out of 69 funds, 5 stars out of 65 funds, and 5 stars out of 52 funds, respectively; Prudential National Muni Fund was rated 5 stars out of 256 funds, 5 stars out of 256 funds, 5 stars out of 224 funds, and 5 stars out of 150 funds, respectively; Prudential QMA Small-Cap Value Fund was rated 5 stars out of 353 funds, 5 stars out of 353 funds, 4 stars out of 309 funds, and 5 stars out of 199 funds, respectively; Prudential Short Duration Multi-Sector Bond Fund was rated 5 stars out of 444 funds, and 5 stars out of 444 funds, respectively.

Palisade storming social infrastructure


By I & T News 
| 21/08/2012



By I & T News21/08/2012 Palisade Investment Partners is seeing increasing interest from large funds in social infrastructure, with director Roger Lloyd saying that the assets’ steady yielding, lower risk characteristics are attractive diversifiers.This bullish outlook for mid-market infrastructure-asset demand comes as Palisade announces it had reached financial closure with the Plenary Group on an equity acquisition in the second stage of its Living Environment Accommodation Project (LEAP) through Palisade’s Australian Social Infrastructure Fund (PASIF).The acquisition represents a 49.9-per-cent investment in the project and follows PASIF’s 49.9-per-cent investment in the first stage of LEAP in June 2011.LEAP 1 was a $23.1-million fund, with its second incarnation topping $38 million. Despite the small size of the funds, Lloyd says that larger investors are looking more closely at social infrastructure linked to long-term government contracts.“We have had a bit of contact with some of Australia’s larger funds and there is a feeling of ‘why haven’t we been doing this before?’ – it is like a watershed, and the light has gone on,” he says.The latest social infrastructure fund is invested in 3000 accommodation units being built on 14 defence bases across Australia.

Capital costs are in excess of $800 million and the investors have a 30-year concession from the Australian Government.The majority of debt finance is provided by Australian banks and superannuation funds.Lloyd says that a long-term CPI-linked revenue stream is attractive to investors, with a typical yield as much as 600 to 700 basis points above Australian Government bonds. The great LEAP forward
Palisade has set itself ambitious expansion plans and is adding new staff with the goal of reaching between $1.75 and $2 billion in assets over the next few years.“I see no reason why over the next two to three years we wouldn’t have $500 million in social infrastructure assets, and at the same time they will be a balanced portfolio of green and brownfield assets,” he says.LEAP 1 included investments includes the 229-bed Casey Hospital in Melbourne and the operation of nine police and courthouse complexes in six locations across regional South Australia.Lloyd predicts that the size of social infrastructure assets will grow in the coming years, as it becomes a more mainstream part of the infrastructure holdings of institutional investors.“Assets will get bigger, and more equity will be required and will get out of bed for it,” he says.“I think there will be a huge demand for social infrastructure like this that is at the lower end of the risk spectrum for infrastructure.” Attractive opportunities
Opportunities in the space are already being realised by overseas investors. Palisade co-invested in both LEAP projects with Canada’s Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (Caisse), the country’s second largest pension fund, and Plenary Group. The three players struck an agreement and governance structure that lays the foundation for a long-term investment partnership.Plenary Group recently announced that it has reached an agreement with Caisse to invest in five public-private partnerships in Australia, including the Melbourne Convention Centre.The Canadian fund’s investments total $139.2 million across the five projects, according to the Plenary Group.Lloyd says that foreign investors such as Caisse are seeing a number of attractive opportunities.“There is more offshore money buying Australian infrastructure assets than there is Australian money,” he notes.The strategic agreement with Palisade, Caisse and Plenary Group provides Palisade with first right of refusal for equity in Plenary originated projects. Since Palisade acquired the management rights to two infrastructure funds from Perpetual in 2008, the business has enjoyed exponential growth, with assets under management growing from $200 million to more than $700 million.Assets are split between three funds covering core, social and regional infrastructure.Its diversified infrastructure fund has core assets including airports in the Northern Territory, a power station in Western Australia and a wind farm in South Australia.The regional infrastructure fund focuses on food, water, waste and energy assets, and includes regional livestock yards and a waste-treatment plant.

Media Release: Palisade Investment Partners awarded long term lease of Sunshine Coast Airport

09/02/2017









Palisade Investment Partners Limited (Palisade) has entered into a binding agreement for a 99-year lease of Sunshine Coast Airport (SCA) from the Sunshine Coast Regional Council (Council) for $82m.
SCA was the fastest growing airport in Australia for the FY 2016 by scheduled passenger volumes, and sits at the centre of one of Australia’s most dynamic regions. The Sunshine Coast is forecast to achieve population growth significantly above the national average, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, along with robust economic growth.
“We are very excited about this investment, which expands our decade-long involvement in the regional airport sector through investments in the Darwin, Alice Springs and Tennant Creek airports,” said Palisade Managing Director & CEO Roger Lloyd. “We intend forging a long-term partnership with Sunshine Coast Regional Council to enhance the value of this strategic Australian infrastructure asset.”
Palisade has also made arrangements with Council for the construction of a new 2.45km runway, apron expansion and related infrastructure, in return for a fixed payment from Palisade of $290m following project completion. The runway project will reduce operational constraints at the airport, facilitate new route opportunities, increased passenger growth and economic development of the region by providing capacity to accommodate larger, more fuel-efficient aircraft and enabling more direct flights.

“I am also delighted to announce that Dennis Chant has been appointed to assist in the transition of SCA into private ownership and ongoing governance of the business,” said Mr Lloyd. “Dennis is the former CEO of Queensland Airports Limited, and is one of Australia’s most experienced regional airport managers through his role in growing Gold Coast, Townsville and other regional airports.”
The SCA transaction will be funded through equity commitments from Palisade’s Diversified Infrastructure Fund (PDIF), together with investments from two of Palisade’s institutional clients, LGIAsuper and VicSuper. PDIF has generated total gross returns of 14.3% pa over the five years to 31 December 2016.
Palisade will be actively seeking opportunities to deploy further capital into the Airport precinct and the broader Sunshine Coast region.
Gresham Partners and Gilbert & Tobin acted for Palisade as financial and legal advisers respectively.

FUM and commitments managed by Palisade have grown from $700m in 2012 to $2.3bn at 31 December 2016.
The SCA transaction continues Palisade’s 10+ year involvement in the regional airport sector, through its successful investment in the Darwin, Alice Springs and Tennant Creek airports.
It follows Palisade’s investment activity over the past year, which has included:

acquiring an interest in the Gold Coast University Hospital and Private Hospital Car Parks project;
investing in the Gold Coast Light Rail Stage 2 expansion project and acquiring a further 2.1% equity stake in Stage 1;
acquiring a 50% interest in the 142MW Ross River Solar Farm development project underpinned by a long-term power purchase agreement.

7. Based on U.S. Plan Sponsor rankings in Pensions & Investments as of 12/31/16.
Morningstar rankings are based on total return, do not include the effects of sales charges, and are calculated against all funds in each fund's respective Morningstar category. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Performance by share class may vary.
Star ratings shown are for Class Z shares, which are available to individual investors through certain retirement and wrap fee programs, and to institutions at an investment minimum of $5,000,000. Performance by share class may vary. In addition to the ones shown above, other classes, which contain either a sales load or a contingent deferred sales charge, are also available. These expenses will generally lower total fund return. Please see the prospectus for additional information about fees, expenses and investor eligibility requirements.
The risks associated with investing in these funds include but are not limited to: derivative securities, which may carry market, credit, and liquidity risks; short sales, which involve costs and the risk of potentially unlimited losses; leveraging, which may magnify losses; high yield (“junk”) bonds, which are subject to greater market risks; small/mid cap stocks which may be subject to more erratic market movements than large cap stocks; foreign securities, which are subject to currency fluctuation and political uncertainty; real estate, which poses certain risks related to overall and specific economic conditions as well as risks related to individual property, credit and interest-rate fluctuations; and mortgage-backed securities, which are subject to prepayment and extension risks. Sector funds and Specialty funds may not be suitable for all investors. Such funds are non-diversified, so a loss resulting from a particular security will have greater impact on the Fund's return. Fixed income investments are subject to interest rate risk, and their value will decline as interest rates rise. The risks associated with each fund are explained more fully in each fund's respective prospectus. There is no guarantee a fund's objectives will be achieved.
Some Morningstar Ratings may not be customarily based on adjusted historical returns. If so, an investment's independent Morningstar Rating metric is compared against the retail mutual fund universe breakpoints to determine its hypothetical rating for certain time periods. The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.
For the overall, 3-, 5- and 10-year periods, respectively, as of 3/31/17: Prudential Balanced Fund was rated 5 stars out of 721 funds, 5 stars out of 721 funds, and 5 stars out of 616 funds, and 4 out of 424 funds, respectively; Prudential High Yield Fund was rated 5 stars out of 596 funds, 5 stars out of 596 funds, 4 stars out of 471 funds, and 5 stars out of 318 funds, respectively; Prudential Short-Term Corporate Bond Fund, Inc. was rated 5 stars out of 444 funds, 4 stars out of 444 funds, 4 stars out of 359 funds, and 5 stars out of 257 funds, respectively; Prudential Total Return Bond Fund was rated 5 stars out of 851 funds, 5 stars out of 851 funds, 5 stars out of 750 funds, and 5 stars out of 538 funds, respectively; Prudential California Municipal Income Fund was rated 5 stars out of 69 funds, 5 stars out of 69 funds, 5 stars out of 65 funds, and 5 stars out of 52 funds, respectively; Prudential National Muni Fund was rated 5 stars out of 256 funds, 5 stars out of 256 funds, 5 stars out of 224 funds, and 5 stars out of 150 funds, respectively; Prudential QMA Small-Cap Value Fund was rated 5 stars out of 353 funds, 5 stars out of 353 funds, 4 stars out of 309 funds, and 5 stars out of 199 funds, respectively; Prudential Short Duration Multi-Sector Bond Fund was rated 5 stars out of 444 funds, and 5 stars out of 444 funds, respectively.
