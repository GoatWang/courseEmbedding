A smart product management hub for retailthat streamlines digital content and data sharing






 





















Our mission
 
We have made it our mission to provide brands and retailers simple and affordable tools that tackle many challenges in digital product management and distribution by:













Solving the practical challenge of organizing, sourcing, and sharing product content.









Giving brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed ecommerce data and analytics
















Take control of your products with Plytix
 









Our Story
 
The idea for Plytix evolved from our time at Google, when we were working with some of the biggest companies in the e-commerce space. At the time, technology allowed tracking user behaviour on individual websites, but we wanted to give brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed data, bringing them a better understanding of their products through 3rd party product analytics. 
 
Since then Plytix has evolved into an end-to-end product management eco-system where brands and retailers can organize, analyze, and share product content and performance in a user-friendly and efficient way without breaking the bank. 
 




























Our Team
 
We're a diverse, international team passionate about creating extraordinary client experiences and serious about revolutionizing e-commerce. We are growing rapidly and we're always on the look out for smart, driven people to join our team. 
 
Get a closer look on  LinkedIn and Instagram.

Benchmark name change for Aberdeen Australian fixed income funds
Bloomberg Indexes, the independent, global index provider, has acquired all UBS Australia bond indexes. The index family is renamed the “Bloomberg AusBond Indexes” and will be independently calculated, maintained and licensed by Bloomberg.
Some Aberdeen fixed income funds benchmark fund performance against UBS Australian bond indexes.
On 29 September 2014 the benchmark names for these funds changed as detailed in the table below.
Aberdeen understands that there will be minimal impact for funds as a result of the change. The main change is that index pricing will move from UBS prices to BVAL (Bloomberg pricing system).
The benchmark names in the Product Disclosure Statements will be updated when they next roll.

Equities Funds

Aberdeen's equity process applies consistently across all our equity portfolios, irrespective of market conditions.
From the company visits and analysis carried out regionally, through to portfolio construction decisions, we adopt a team approach. Cross-coverage of securities locally ensures objectivity and we avoid cultivating 'star' managers. Diversification at the stock level is our main control of risk.
We aim to add value by capitalising on original research.

Our mission
 
We have made it our mission to provide brands and retailers simple and affordable tools that tackle many challenges in digital product management and distribution by:













Solving the practical challenge of organizing, sourcing, and sharing product content.









Giving brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed ecommerce data and analytics

Our Story
 
The idea for Plytix evolved from our time at Google, when we were working with some of the biggest companies in the e-commerce space. At the time, technology allowed tracking user behaviour on individual websites, but we wanted to give brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed data, bringing them a better understanding of their products through 3rd party product analytics. 
 
Since then Plytix has evolved into an end-to-end product management eco-system where brands and retailers can organize, analyze, and share product content and performance in a user-friendly and efficient way without breaking the bank. 
 




























Our Team
 
We're a diverse, international team passionate about creating extraordinary client experiences and serious about revolutionizing e-commerce. We are growing rapidly and we're always on the look out for smart, driven people to join our team.

History[edit]
The company was established in 1983 through a management buy-out of an investment trust.[2] It was then listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1991.[2] In recent years, it has seen significant growth from acquisitions. In 2000 it acquired Murray Johnstone, followed by Edinburgh Fund Managers in 2003, parts of Deutsche Asset Management in 2005 and 2007,[3][4] Glasgow Investment Managers in 2007, Goodman Property Investors in 2008, certain investment businesses of Credit Suisse Asset Management in 2009, and certain contracts and assets from RBS Asset Management in 2010.[2]
In November 2013, Lloyds Banking Group sold Scottish Widows Investment Partnership (SWIP) to Aberdeen Asset Management in a £660m deal.[5] The deal made Aberdeen Asset Management the second largest listed fund manager in Europe after Schroders, currently managing £308.1bn [6] In May 2015, the firm agreed to acquire its US counterpart Flag Capital Management for an undisclosed deal that would double the private equity assets under the company’s control.[7]
The Company sponsored The Boat Race between 1999 and 2001.[8] In 2010 it signed a four-year sponsorship agreement with the Dad Vail Regatta to be title sponsor until 2013, the event’s 75th Anniversary. The agreement has helped to keep the famous college rowing regatta in Philadelphia, the Group's North American headquarters.[9] In March 2012 it took over sponsorship of golf's Scottish Open for the following three years. Other sponsorships include the Cowes Week sailing regatta, Aberdeen Brunei Senior Masters Golf Tournament,[10] Edinburgh Rugby club,[11] professional golfers Colin Montgomerie and Paul Lawrie,[12] and Formula One driver Paul di Resta.[13]
In March 2017, Aberdeen Asset Management reached an agreement to merge with Standard Life, in an all-share merger.[14]
Operations[edit]

Its headquarters are in the city of Aberdeen, where Group functions including legal, group information and human resources are located, and has its major investment desks in London, Philadelphia and Singapore.[15]

History[edit]
The company was established in 1983 through a management buy-out of an investment trust.[2] It was then listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1991.[2] In recent years, it has seen significant growth from acquisitions. In 2000 it acquired Murray Johnstone, followed by Edinburgh Fund Managers in 2003, parts of Deutsche Asset Management in 2005 and 2007,[3][4] Glasgow Investment Managers in 2007, Goodman Property Investors in 2008, certain investment businesses of Credit Suisse Asset Management in 2009, and certain contracts and assets from RBS Asset Management in 2010.[2]
In November 2013, Lloyds Banking Group sold Scottish Widows Investment Partnership (SWIP) to Aberdeen Asset Management in a £660m deal.[5] The deal made Aberdeen Asset Management the second largest listed fund manager in Europe after Schroders, currently managing £308.1bn [6] In May 2015, the firm agreed to acquire its US counterpart Flag Capital Management for an undisclosed deal that would double the private equity assets under the company’s control.[7]
The Company sponsored The Boat Race between 1999 and 2001.[8] In 2010 it signed a four-year sponsorship agreement with the Dad Vail Regatta to be title sponsor until 2013, the event’s 75th Anniversary. The agreement has helped to keep the famous college rowing regatta in Philadelphia, the Group's North American headquarters.[9] In March 2012 it took over sponsorship of golf's Scottish Open for the following three years. Other sponsorships include the Cowes Week sailing regatta, Aberdeen Brunei Senior Masters Golf Tournament,[10] Edinburgh Rugby club,[11] professional golfers Colin Montgomerie and Paul Lawrie,[12] and Formula One driver Paul di Resta.[13]
In March 2017, Aberdeen Asset Management reached an agreement to merge with Standard Life, in an all-share merger.[14]
Operations[edit]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
