The Future Value Of Ternium's Value-Added Steel Products - Ternium S.A. (NYSE:TX) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGOÂ»The Future Value Of Ternium's Value-Added Steel ProductsFeb.19.13 | About: Ternium S.A. (TX) DC Capital Long/short equity, special situations, event-driven, arbitrageTernium (NYSE:TX) is one of the leading Latin America companies operating in the steel and iron industry. Ternium is a foreign company, and therefore its security is traded over the NYSE as an American Depositary Receipt (ADR). The nature of this security is unique. It enables investors to purchase shares in a foreign company while realizing dividends as well as capital gains in US dollars. Following the 2008 to 2009 credit crisis, the combination of acquisitions and a relatively stable demand for steel allowed Ternium to make a quick recovery. However, due to the implementation of new projects and increased equity investments in outside firms, Ternium's growth has slowed and its security market price has fell for the wrong reasons. As a firm, Ternium provides investors with far more value than what the current market prices in.
Investment Thesis
Ternium's operations are strategically positioned in Mexico as well as Argentina. Due to the fact that Argentina is a developing country, Argentina reveals an extremely low correlation coefficient with respect to economic fundamentals that prompt downturns in the US economy. On the other hand, Mexico is not a developing country, and unfortunately is closely knit to the fundamentals that impact US markets. Consumers in Mexico tend to be more elastic and sensitive to changes in price. Ultimately, high levels of elasticity in demand have impacted profit margins for operations in Mexico. Therefore, with the US economy improving it is highly likely we will see a positive impact on Ternium's profit margins as consumption levels increase.
On a global scale, Ternium is positioned to benefit from China's rapidly expanding population. According to recent projections released by the United States Census Bureau, it is estimated China's population will exceed 1.4 billion by 2026. A small percentage of Ternium's sales currently derive from its iron ore exports to China. Given the rate of economic development in China, there is a favorable probability this will play out to be a lucrative growth option for Ternium. I recommend buying Ternium, with an anticipated price target of $29.73 in one year. This implies an upside of roughly 27% from its current market value per share, which is shown below in figure 1. Note my price target is based on the consensus of multiple valuation models, which I will explain in further detail in the valuation portion of this analysis.

Figure 1: Ternium's Five Year Price Graph

What Does Ternium Do?
Ternium is a steel manufacturing company that serves its customers with a broad spectrum of so called "value-added" steel products. These products include tinplate, galvanized and electro-galvanized sheets, pre-painted sheets, as well as various custom steel products designed to customer specifications. These custom products are manufactured and designed on a job-cost basis through Ternium's service centers. In addition, Ternium produces long steel products such as bars and wire rods. Ternium's customer base is quite extensive. Its customers range from large companies operating across the globe to small enterprises operating in industries such as construction, home appliances, capital goods, containers, as well as food and automotive. Ternium's operations are divided among three segments:


Flat Steel Products- This segment comprises the manufacturing and marketing of flat steel products including hot rolled coils and sheets, cold rolled coils, tin plates, welded pipes, hot dipped galvanized, and electro-galvanized sheets, and pre-painted sheets.

Long Steel Products - This segment is comprised of the manufacturing and marketing of long steel products, which include billets, wire rod, and wire bars.

Other & Custom Products - This segment includes all other products Ternium manufacturers and products, such as pig iron and pellets.

Ternium has established a large footprint across Latin America through its highly integrated operations. Ternium's current annual production capacity for pellet and flat steel is approximately 5.9 million tons and 0.4 million respectively. Its in-house manufacturing process is spread throughout 15 production centers. In addition, Ternium's distribution network is even more extensive than its production process. It has a total of 42 service and distribution centers that are located in the following countries, including Argentina, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, and Panama. The processes and services range from iron ore extraction to the delivery of high-end steel products to the market. As you are beginning to understand, Ternium's value chain is highly integrated.

Figure 2: Ternium's Distribution Network
Ternium has made significant progress towards incorporating sustainable practices within the last decade. Ternium's management has implemented an integrated health, safety, and environment (HSE) management system. The system comprises a set of processes and practices that serve as an aid in helping Ternium constantly improve its environmental performance to adhere with the guidelines of international standards.

Financial Analysis
Currently, among top investment banks and capital management firms, there are thirteen analysts actively covering this security. Broadly speaking, there is relatively little variation among these analysts' estimates. The only differences in analysts consensus seem to lie beneath a particular analysts' opinion in regards to economic recover in 2013. In effort to provide an accurate forecast, I computed the average of these analysts estimates.
The average consensus of the final year in revenue figure for FY 2012 is $8.57 billion. Looking forward into FY 2013, I used the same method and projected to grow to $9.54 billion. This implies a year over year growth rate of approximately 11%. Taking the historical averages of Ternium's gross margins and assuming there will be small increases in operating costs, the earnings per share estimates are highly favorable for FY 2013. The mean EPS estimate for FY 2013 is $2.94, which implies gross and operating margins of 23% and 14%, respectively.

To understand why these margins will improve, it is important investors realize the full extent of Ternium's recent expansion. These margin improvements are a result of high capital expenditures in previous years. The capital expenditures were allotted to new facilities and fixed assets, which have ultimately provided Ternium with excess capacity. This excess capacity is going to allow for increased production and will aid in the reduction of Ternium's input costs for raw materials. Going forward into FY 2013, we should see very little accumulation of new fixed assets, which implies a reduction in capital expenditures. Also, one more factor that will impact margins is the price of steel. Analysts are projecting that in commodity markets the price of steel will increase significantly over the next two years. As we have seen before, when there is an influx in the price of steel Ternium's market price per share has the ability to increase fast with improving margins.
As you are beginning to understand, Ternium's balance sheet is loaded with fixed assets. Its attractive assets in both Argentina and Mexico amount to over $11 billion. But how much debt financing does Ternium engage in to fund its expansion? From an accounting perspective, Ternium has an extremely clean balance sheet. Its total liabilities equate to roughly $3.9 billion. Of that total, only half comprises Ternium's long-term debt outstanding. This suggests Ternium's long-term debt to equity ratio is only 22%, and historically this level remained relatively the same.
Valuation
Ternium's extensive product lines and varying streams of revenue can make valuation some what difficult. To compute the fair value of Ternium's equity, I used a variation of the corporate valuation model. Principally, this model is identical to the traditional discounted free cash flow model. However, it also incorporates a modification of the Gordon Growth Model that uses free cash flows to project a discrete value for the approximated value of the firms operations. Finally, to arrive at the value of equity, short-term investments in non-operating assets are added to the value of operations.

In this model, I used a free cash flow estimate of $145 million for FY 2013 in order to project the value of Ternium's operations. As I previously mentioned, Ternium is in its final stages of several expansionary projects including a new slab, hot strip, and galvanized lines in both Argentina as well as Mexico. Therefore, Ternium's capital expenditures are projected to decline by as much as 25%, which has been taken into account in my free cash flow estimate. Also, as a result of expansionary measures I anticipate Ternium will consistently display an EBITDA margin of roughly 24%. The additional underlying assumptions include a constant growth rate of 3% and Ternium's weighted average cost of capital of 4.5%. Also, you will notice I have provided a sensitivity analysts revealing the variation in Ternium's security price with respect to the changes in the constant growth rate.
Figure 4: Ternium's Intrinsic Valuation

As you will see above, the price estimates change significantly with changes in the constant growth rate. In terms of Ternium's operations, I feel the most suitable growth rate to apply is 3%. Using a constant growth rate of 3%, I arrived at an intrinsic price per share of $33.69 and $57.31 for FY 2013 and FY 2014, respectively. In computing the intrinsic value of Ternium, one of the distinct differences between Ternium compared to other firms is the weighted average cost of capital. Its clear Ternium's weighted average cost of capital is significantly low, and while this is not a bad thing it makes valuation slightly more complex.
Given the fact that Ternium's historical levels of free cash flows have been low and considering its extremely low cost of capital, there is an alternative method I would like to illustrate to further support the valuation of this company. This method is highly feasible for companies anticipating low levels of free cash flows and is conducted by using a "sum-of-the-parts" analysis by incorporating a variety of different EV/EBITDA multiples. This valuation technique "STOPS" or does what some called "Breaks-up" the analysis by providing a range of values for a company's equity by summing the value of its individual business segments to arrive at the total enterprise value. I am only using a variation of the"sum-of-the-parts" analysis in order to project a price target.

Historically speaking, Ternium carries a forward EV/EBITDA premium 5.5 to 7.5 times. Due to substantial investments towards fixed assets as well as several associated sunk costs with expansion in Brazil, I am going to value Ternium on the more conservative side. The implied exit multiple I am using is approximately 6.5 times. This is directly in line with the FY 2013 EPS projection of $2.94. Applying a forward multiple of roughly 9.5 times to this earnings per share estimate reveals a price target of roughly $27.93. Although this price target varies from the intrinsic valuation estimate for FY 2013 by 20%, I have concluded this price target is far more accurate and should be investors objective for the end of FY 2013.
Conclusion
It is clear Ternium's operations are highly impacted by the economic conditions in the US as well as the economic conditions in other countries where Ternium operates. As the US economy continues to recover, the correlated impact between prospering economies and Ternium's global business will yield a positive impact on its profit margins. In addition, Ternium's recent expansion has not only provided cost reduction benefits to the firm, but have provided perfect placement through new operating facilities to profit off an economic recovery. Based on Ternium's current financial position and conservative growth estimates, my one year price target implies an upside of roughly 27% for investors who initiate a position today. In conclusion, Ternium is undervalued and provides an investment catered to those seeking value and expecting a US economic recovery in FY 2013.

Ternium is a manufacturer of flat and long steel products with production centers in Argentina, Mexico, Guatemala, Colombia and the United States. It is the leading steel company in Latin America with highly integrated processes to manufacture steel and value-added products. Along with Nippon Steel and Companhia Siderurgica Nacional, Ternium owns Usiminas of Brazil.
The company takes it name from the Latin words Ter (three) and Eternium (eternal) in reference to the integration of the three steel mills.
History[edit]
Ternium was formed in 2005 by the consolidation of three companies: Siderar of Argentina, Sidor of Venezuela and Hylsa of Mexico. Siderar was established by Argentine-based industrial conglomerate Techint in 1992 following the privatization of Somisa.
In 2007, Ternium acquired Grupo IMSA, thereby expanding its operations into Guatemala and the United States.[2]
Ternium was listed on the NYSE on February 1, 2006.[3]
Nationalization of Sidor by Venezuelan government[edit]
Ternium's Venezuelan subsidiary, Sidor, was nationalized by the Venezuelan government following an April 2008 resolution of the National Assembly of Venezuela.[4] This move followed a series of worker disputes over pay which had paralyzed the company.[5] In early 2009, compensation of US$1.65 billion was agreed on for the nationalization of Ternium's 59.7% stake, with Ternium keeping a 10% stake in the company.[6]

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Ternium S.A. (NYSE:TX) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Hold Rating, 4 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.80)Consensus Price Target: $30.13 (0.71% downside)

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Where applicable, a project is considered as such until the end of construction and ramp-up to full capacity (with the exception of mining projects, where the date of commissioning signifies the end of the project). Projects must have a:  a) Start date b) Estimate for completion c) Initial investment estimate  Data For state-owned projects, initial information about the start date and estimates for completion and investment are taken from original signed contracts, along with addendums and annexes. If original contracts cannot be obtained, information is taken from public documents, presentations, news articles from BNamericas archives, and external sources. In cases where contracts are subject to approval by legislators, the start date is the date of the law or legislative approval. In the case of private projects, information is taken from public sources, such as stock exchange filings, annual reports, company presentations, third party research and press releases. In judging the timing of investment decisions for private projects, great care was taken to differentiate between large projects receiving environmental approval and proceeding directly to construction, and smaller projects where the investment decision hinges on securing financing. Best care is taken to ensure that recorded data is correct at the time of entry and that each entry is backed with a relevant source. The greatest care possible was taken to ensure consistency of information in order make a like-for-like comparison in project costs. Insofar as the figures rely on disclosure by the organization or company responsible, the figures can be considered to be conservative in nature. No attempt was made to adjust figures for inflation during the course of research or for consideration of the time value of money. Validation In the case of state-owned projects, validation is carried out where possible with either a member of the consortium, EPC contractor, a relevant state agency or advisors to either party. Currency Projects costs are measured in US dollars. Where project costs are measured in a local currency, amounts are converted to US dollars at the date of the relevant announcement, signature or report.

Timing    Status Condition     Ahead of time 95% of original estimate or below (measured in months)   On time 95% to 105% of original estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original estimate   Medium changes 120% to 160% of original estimate   Major changes Over 160% of original estimate    Budget    Status Condition     Ahead of budget 95% of original budget estimate or below   To budget 95% to 105% of original budget estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original budget estimate   Medium changes 120% to 140% of original budget estimate   Major changes Over 140% of original budget estimate    Changes in Scope Changes in scope beyond the start date are not accounted for.
