Armbrester to Oversee Development of Emerging Cloud-based Services; Support Company's Leadership in Strategic Partnerships, R&D, and Inpatient/Hospital Space

Current Chief Product Officer Jeremy Delinsky to join Wayfair as Chief Technology Officer

	WATERTOWN, Mass., May 29, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- athenahealth, Inc. (Nasdaq:ATHN), a leading provider of cloud-based services and mobile applications for medical groups and health systems, today announced the appointment of Kyle Armbrester, currently athenahealth's vice president of business development and creator of the company's More Disruption Please (MDP) innovation and partnership program, to the position of acting chief product officer (CPO), effective immediately. Jeremy Delinsky will step down as CPO after serving in the position for five months and with the company for more than ten years. Delinsky will join Boston-based online retailer Wayfair as the company's chief technology officer.

	With a background in web services, web development, IT strategy and IT implementation, Armbrester has played a critical role in creating athenahealth's strategy for the continuum of care roadmap, including the acquisition and integration of RazorInsights. As acting CPO, Armbrester will be responsible for leading teams associated with business development, the More Disruption Please program, and all emerging products, which are currently characterized as inpatient/hospital solutions, mobile/Epocrates, and services such as athenaCoordinator® Enterprise, which deals with patient access and coordination. athenahealth's core products, which include athenaCollector® (revenue cycle management), athenaClinicals® (electronic health record), athenaCommunicator® (patient engagement service) and population health management, will stay under the direction of Ed Park, chief operating officer. Armbrester will report directly to CEO Jonathan Bush.

	"Kyle has made a tremendous impact on athenahealth thus far. He built the MDP program and in doing so, we architected athenaNet as an open platform and therefore created the first genuine, marketplace of partners and innovations for health care," said athenahealth CEO Jonathan Bush. "Kyle brings a wonderful combination of technology chops and product vision that will be a terrific help in extending the value of athenahealth services across the full care delivery cycle."

	"Since joining athenahealth, I have been privileged to work across a number of high priority and high opportunity areas for the company – from strategic partnerships and M&A to technology road mapping and product differentiation. I am excited to continue to champion openness, collaboration and innovation as a means to deliver value across the care continuum," said Kyle Armbrester, athenahealth, CPO.

	"It was a difficult decision to leave one of health care's breakthrough companies at a point where its impact is only gaining momentum," said departing CPO Jeremy Delinsky. "I feel confident that the athenahealth team is well-positioned to fulfill its vision and revolutionize health care. Wayfair provides me an incredibly unique opportunity to work with one of the most dynamic online retailers in the business and gain deeper expertise related to the consumer."
