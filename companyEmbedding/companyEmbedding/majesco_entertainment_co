History[edit]
Majesco was first known as a reissuer of old titles that had been abandoned by their original publisher. By cutting the prices and eventually arranging the rights to self-manufacture games for both Nintendo and Sega systems, the company found a sustainable market niche.[citation needed]
Later, Majesco arranged with Sega to manufacture a version of its Genesis (known as Mega Drive outside North America) 16-bit console, which had been superseded by the 32-bit Saturn. It released this in 1998 as the Genesis 3 and followed up with a version of the handheld Game Gear called the Game Gear Core System.
The company's focus shifted to in-house game development, initially under the brand Pipe-Dream Interactive since few believed they could make the transition successfully.[citation needed] Majesco focused on developing for then-current generation systems, such as Nintendo's GameCube and Game Boy Advance, Microsoft's Xbox, and Sony's PlayStation 2. A few of the titles it released, involving popular characters, included a few Bomberman titles for the Gamecube and Game Boy Advance. Majesco also published PC games with Terminal Reality as the developer, such as BloodRayne and BloodRayne 2.
In 2003, Majesco was slated to publish Black9, but producers forced the developers, Taldren, Inc., to shut down when the game was about 85% complete.[4] The publisher had reached financial trouble with its larger-budget games, such as Psychonauts, which sold poorly although receiving several awards and critical acclaim, and Advent Rising, which generated intense hype but was ultimately panned by critics for being released prematurely and without adequate bug testing. Its best-selling titles in the last few years have been the series of GBA Videos for the Game Boy Advance. It also published the game Jaws Unleashed.
On January 19, 2006, the company's financial situation worsened to the degree that it had to cancel two games it was going to publish: Demonik, developed by Terminal Reality, and Taxi Driver, a sequel to the movie. Majesco's president, Jesse Sutton, said that in the future the company would "focus primarily on publishing value and handheld video games."[5] Since that announcement, the company has followed through with publishing successful budget titles in North America like Cooking Mama for the DS.
On September 14, 2006, Majesco released Advent Rising and re-released BloodRayne and BloodRayne 2 on Steam.
On November 6, 2007, Majesco announced the opening of a new development facility in the Los Angeles area dedicated to the development of casual game products and properties.[6]
On December 10, 2007, Majesco announced that they would be publishing a rhythm-based game, Major Minor's Majestic March, exclusively for the Wii developed by NanaOn-Sha.
Majesco has announced that it will be launching an internet version of Bananagrams on August 18, 2008 that will be available on Facebook, a social networking website.[7]
On November 4, 2009, Majesco released BloodRayne and BloodRayne 2 on GOG.com.
On June 6, 2011, Majesco announced that it was acquiring the assets of social game developer Quick Hit and Quick Hit Football to build out its social gaming strategy.[8]
In August 2013, Majesco announced the creation of an indie publishing label, Midnight City, in order to bring various indie games to consoles.[9]
After a disastrous fiscal year of 2013, the company was expected to enjoy a recovering growth in 2014.[10] However, this proved incorrect, as they continued to lose large amounts of money in 2014, resulting in the closure of Midnight City and the cancellation of the console port of Gone Home.[11]
In August 2015, Majesco announced that they had appointed a new CEO, and that only five employees would remain in the company. The company's focus also shifted to develop mobile and downloadable titles. Two new titles, Glue and a new installment in the A Boy and His Blob franchise, were announced after the reconstruction.[12]
In December 2016, Majesco announced it was ceasing operations in the entertainment industry, and merged with biotech firm PolarityTE. Polarity will obtain Majesco's NASDAQ symbol name, COOL.[13]

Majesco Entertainment Company (formerly Majesco Sales Inc.) was an American video game publisher and distributor based in South Plainfield, New Jersey. The company was founded as Majesco Sales in Edison, New Jersey in 1986, and was a privately held company until acquiring operation-less company ConnectivCorp in a reverse takeover, becomings its subsidiary and thus a public company, on December 5, 2003.[1] ConnectivCorp later changed its name to Majesco Holdings Inc. on April 13, 2004.[2] On December 1, 2016, Majesco Entertainment was acquired by PolarityTE, Inc., a biotech company, in a reverse takeover, because of which it formally ceased all video game operations on December 8, 2016.[3]

History[edit]
Majesco was first known as a reissuer of old titles that had been abandoned by their original publisher. By cutting the prices and eventually arranging the rights to self-manufacture games for both Nintendo and Sega systems, the company found a sustainable market niche.[citation needed]
Later, Majesco arranged with Sega to manufacture a version of its Genesis (known as Mega Drive outside North America) 16-bit console, which had been superseded by the 32-bit Saturn. It released this in 1998 as the Genesis 3 and followed up with a version of the handheld Game Gear called the Game Gear Core System.
The company's focus shifted to in-house game development, initially under the brand Pipe-Dream Interactive since few believed they could make the transition successfully.[citation needed] Majesco focused on developing for then-current generation systems, such as Nintendo's GameCube and Game Boy Advance, Microsoft's Xbox, and Sony's PlayStation 2. A few of the titles it released, involving popular characters, included a few Bomberman titles for the Gamecube and Game Boy Advance. Majesco also published PC games with Terminal Reality as the developer, such as BloodRayne and BloodRayne 2.
In 2003, Majesco was slated to publish Black9, but producers forced the developers, Taldren, Inc., to shut down when the game was about 85% complete.[4] The publisher had reached financial trouble with its larger-budget games, such as Psychonauts, which sold poorly although receiving several awards and critical acclaim, and Advent Rising, which generated intense hype but was ultimately panned by critics for being released prematurely and without adequate bug testing. Its best-selling titles in the last few years have been the series of GBA Videos for the Game Boy Advance. It also published the game Jaws Unleashed.
On January 19, 2006, the company's financial situation worsened to the degree that it had to cancel two games it was going to publish: Demonik, developed by Terminal Reality, and Taxi Driver, a sequel to the movie. Majesco's president, Jesse Sutton, said that in the future the company would "focus primarily on publishing value and handheld video games."[5] Since that announcement, the company has followed through with publishing successful budget titles in North America like Cooking Mama for the DS.
On September 14, 2006, Majesco released Advent Rising and re-released BloodRayne and BloodRayne 2 on Steam.
On November 6, 2007, Majesco announced the opening of a new development facility in the Los Angeles area dedicated to the development of casual game products and properties.[6]
On December 10, 2007, Majesco announced that they would be publishing a rhythm-based game, Major Minor's Majestic March, exclusively for the Wii developed by NanaOn-Sha.
Majesco has announced that it will be launching an internet version of Bananagrams on August 18, 2008 that will be available on Facebook, a social networking website.[7]
On November 4, 2009, Majesco released BloodRayne and BloodRayne 2 on GOG.com.
On June 6, 2011, Majesco announced that it was acquiring the assets of social game developer Quick Hit and Quick Hit Football to build out its social gaming strategy.[8]
In August 2013, Majesco announced the creation of an indie publishing label, Midnight City, in order to bring various indie games to consoles.[9]
After a disastrous fiscal year of 2013, the company was expected to enjoy a recovering growth in 2014.[10] However, this proved incorrect, as they continued to lose large amounts of money in 2014, resulting in the closure of Midnight City and the cancellation of the console port of Gone Home.[11]

Majesco Entertainment Company (formerly Majesco Sales Inc.) was an American video game publisher and distributor based in South Plainfield, New Jersey. The company was founded as Majesco Sales in Edison, New Jersey in 1986, and was a privately held company until acquiring operation-less company ConnectivCorp in a reverse takeover, becomings its subsidiary and thus a public company, on December 5, 2003.[1] ConnectivCorp later changed its name to Majesco Holdings Inc. on April 13, 2004.[2] On December 1, 2016, Majesco Entertainment was acquired by PolarityTE, Inc., a biotech company, in a reverse takeover, because of which it formally ceased all video game operations on December 8, 2016.[3]

History[edit]
Majesco was first known as a reissuer of old titles that had been abandoned by their original publisher. By cutting the prices and eventually arranging the rights to self-manufacture games for both Nintendo and Sega systems, the company found a sustainable market niche.[citation needed]
Later, Majesco arranged with Sega to manufacture a version of its Genesis (known as Mega Drive outside North America) 16-bit console, which had been superseded by the 32-bit Saturn. It released this in 1998 as the Genesis 3 and followed up with a version of the handheld Game Gear called the Game Gear Core System.
The company's focus shifted to in-house game development, initially under the brand Pipe-Dream Interactive since few believed they could make the transition successfully.[citation needed] Majesco focused on developing for then-current generation systems, such as Nintendo's GameCube and Game Boy Advance, Microsoft's Xbox, and Sony's PlayStation 2. A few of the titles it released, involving popular characters, included a few Bomberman titles for the Gamecube and Game Boy Advance. Majesco also published PC games with Terminal Reality as the developer, such as BloodRayne and BloodRayne 2.
In 2003, Majesco was slated to publish Black9, but producers forced the developers, Taldren, Inc., to shut down when the game was about 85% complete.[4] The publisher had reached financial trouble with its larger-budget games, such as Psychonauts, which sold poorly although receiving several awards and critical acclaim, and Advent Rising, which generated intense hype but was ultimately panned by critics for being released prematurely and without adequate bug testing. Its best-selling titles in the last few years have been the series of GBA Videos for the Game Boy Advance. It also published the game Jaws Unleashed.
On January 19, 2006, the company's financial situation worsened to the degree that it had to cancel two games it was going to publish: Demonik, developed by Terminal Reality, and Taxi Driver, a sequel to the movie. Majesco's president, Jesse Sutton, said that in the future the company would "focus primarily on publishing value and handheld video games."[5] Since that announcement, the company has followed through with publishing successful budget titles in North America like Cooking Mama for the DS.
On September 14, 2006, Majesco released Advent Rising and re-released BloodRayne and BloodRayne 2 on Steam.
On November 6, 2007, Majesco announced the opening of a new development facility in the Los Angeles area dedicated to the development of casual game products and properties.[6]
On December 10, 2007, Majesco announced that they would be publishing a rhythm-based game, Major Minor's Majestic March, exclusively for the Wii developed by NanaOn-Sha.
Majesco has announced that it will be launching an internet version of Bananagrams on August 18, 2008 that will be available on Facebook, a social networking website.[7]
On November 4, 2009, Majesco released BloodRayne and BloodRayne 2 on GOG.com.
On June 6, 2011, Majesco announced that it was acquiring the assets of social game developer Quick Hit and Quick Hit Football to build out its social gaming strategy.[8]
In August 2013, Majesco announced the creation of an indie publishing label, Midnight City, in order to bring various indie games to consoles.[9]
After a disastrous fiscal year of 2013, the company was expected to enjoy a recovering growth in 2014.[10] However, this proved incorrect, as they continued to lose large amounts of money in 2014, resulting in the closure of Midnight City and the cancellation of the console port of Gone Home.[11]
In August 2015, Majesco announced that they had appointed a new CEO, and that only five employees would remain in the company. The company's focus also shifted to develop mobile and downloadable titles. Two new titles, Glue and a new installment in the A Boy and His Blob franchise, were announced after the reconstruction.[12]
In December 2016, Majesco announced it was ceasing operations in the entertainment industry, and merged with biotech firm PolarityTE. Polarity will obtain Majesco's NASDAQ symbol name, COOL.[13]

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Statements in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q that are not historical facts constitute forward-looking statements that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our or our industry's actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Those factors include, among other things, those listed under "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2014 and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as "may," "will," "should," "expects," "plans," "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "predicts," "potential" or "continue" or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions. Actual events or results may differ materially. Moreover, neither we nor any other person assume responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of these statements. We are under no duty to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform these statements to actual results. References herein to "we," "us," "our," and the "Company" are to Majesco Entertainment Company.  Overview  We are a provider of video game products primarily for the, casual-game consumer. We sell our products primarily to large retail chains, specialty retail stores, video game rental outlets and distributors. We publish video games for almost all major current generation interactive entertainment hardware platforms, including Nintendo's DS, 3DS, Wii and WiiU, Sony's PlayStation 3 and 4, or PS3 and PS4, Microsoft's Xbox 360 and Xbox One and the personal computer, or PC. We also publish games for numerous digital platforms such as Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, or PSN and Steam, and, prior to 2014, iOS and Android mobile devices and online platforms.  Our video game titles are targeted at various demographics at a range of price points. Due to the larger budget requirements for developing and marketing premium console titles for core gamers, we have focused on publishing more lower-cost games targeting casual-game consumers. In some instances, our titles are based on licenses of well-known properties and, in other cases, original properties. We enter into agreements with content providers and video game development studios for the creation of our video games.  Our operations involve similar products and customers worldwide. These products are developed and sold domestically and internationally. The Company is centrally managed and our chief operating decision makers, the chief executive and other officers, use consolidated and other financial information supplemented by sales information by product category, major product title and platform for making operational decisions and assessing financial performance. Accordingly, we operate in a single segment.  Since October 2014, we have implemented reductions of our workforce to reduce our fixed costs. The reductions include development and game-testing, selling and marketing, and support personnel. We are currently not developing any significant new games for release in fiscal 2015 and are evaluating strategic alternatives to maximize Company value, including the merger with or acquisition of a new business, which may be in a different business than our current and historical operations.  On December 17, 2014, we completed a private placement of up to $6.0 million of Units at a purchase price of $0.68 per Unit. Each Unit consists of one share of the Company's 0% Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and a five year warrant to purchase one share of the Company's common stock at an initial exercise price of $0.68 per share. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below. We have received $1.0 million of proceeds from the private placement. The release from escrow of an additional $5.0 million of proceeds is subject to approval of our shareholders for the full conversion of the preferred shares and conversion of the warrants and satisfaction of certain other conditions, including, the completion of a "Qualified Transaction" or approval of the lead investor in the private placement. A Qualified Transaction may involve the acquisition of a business that is not related to our current operations described in this report (See "Liquidity and Capital Resources - Private Placement").  Video Game Products  Net Revenues. Our revenues are principally derived from sales of our video games. We provide video games primarily for the mass market and casual-game player. Our revenues are recognized net of estimated provisions for price protection and other allowances. When we act as an agent in the distribution of games developed by others, we recognize revenue net of the share of revenue due to the developer in the form of wholesale price, royalties and/or distribution fees.  Cost of Sales. Cost of sales consists of product costs and amortization and impairment of software development costs and license fees. A significant component of our cost of sales of packaged games is product costs. Product costs are comprised primarily of manufacturing and packaging costs of the disc or cartridge media, royalties to the platform manufacturer and manufacturing and packaging costs of peripherals. Commencing upon the related product's release, capitalized software development and intellectual property license costs are amortized to cost of sales.  Gross Profit. Gross profit is the excess of net revenues over product costs and amortization and impairment of software development and license fees. Development and license fees incurred to produce video games are generally incurred up front and amortized to cost of sales. The recovery of these costs and total gross profit is dependent upon achieving a certain sales volume, which varies by title.  Product Research and Development Expenses. Product research and development expenses have historically related principally to our cost of supervision of third party video game developers, testing new products, development of social games and conducting quality assurance evaluations during the development cycle that are not allocated to games for which technological feasibility has been established. Costs incurred have been primarily employee-related, may include equipment, and are not allocated to cost of sales. Ongoing research and development activities have been substantially reduced since fiscal 2014.  Selling and Marketing Expenses. Selling and marketing expenses consist of marketing and promotion expenses, sometimes including television advertising, the cost of shipping products to customers and related employee costs. Credits to retailers for trade advertising are a component of these expenses.  General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses primarily represent employee related costs, including stock compensation, for corporate executive and support staff, general office expenses, professional fees and various other overhead charges. Professional fees, including legal and accounting expenses, typically represent one of the largest components of our general and administrative expenses. These fees are partially attributable to our required activities as a publicly traded company, such as SEC filings, and corporate- and business-development initiatives.  Interest and Financing Costs. Interest and financing costs are directly attributable to our factoring and our purchase-order financing arrangements. Such costs include commitment fees and fees based upon the value of customer invoices factored.  Income Taxes. Income taxes consists of our provision/(benefit) for income taxes, as affected by our net operating loss carryforwards. Future utilization of our net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the "change in ownership" provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of NOL carryforwards before utilization. Due to our history of losses, a valuation allowance sufficient to fully offset our NOL and other deferred tax assets has been established under current accounting pronouncements, and this valuation allowance will be maintained unless sufficient positive evidence develops to support its reversal.  Seasonality and Variations in Interim Quarterly Results  Our quarterly net revenues, gross profit and operating income from sales of packaged software are impacted significantly by the seasonality of the retail selling season, and the timing of the release of new titles. Sales of our catalog and other products are generally higher in the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year (ending January 31 and October 31, respectively) due to increased retail sales during the holiday season. Sales and gross profit as a percentage of sales also generally increase in quarters in which we release significant new titles because of increased sales volume as retailers make purchases to stock their shelves and meet initial demand for the new release. These quarters also benefit from the higher selling prices that we are able to achieve early in the product's life cycle. Therefore, sales results in any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of expected results for subsequent quarters during the fiscal year.  Critical Accounting Estimates  Our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP.  The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  We have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and to the understanding of our financial results. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations when such policies affect our reported and expected financial results.  Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue upon the shipment of our product when:  When we enter into license or distribution agreements that provide for multiple copies of games in exchange for guaranteed amounts, revenue is recognized in accordance with the terms of the agreements, generally upon delivery of a master copy, assuming our performance obligations are complete and all other recognition criteria are met, or as per-copy royalties are earned on sales of games.  Price Protection and Other Allowances. We generally sell our products on a no-return basis, although in certain instances, we provide price protection or other allowances on certain unsold products in accordance with industry practices. Price protection, when granted and applicable, allows customers a partial credit with respect to merchandise unsold by them. Revenue is recognized net of estimates of these allowances. Sales incentives and other consideration that represent costs incurred by us for benefits received, such as the appearance of our products in a customer's national circular advertisement, are generally reflected as selling and marketing expenses. We estimate potential future product price protection and other discounts related to current period product revenue. In addition, some of our software products are sold exclusively as downloads of digital content for which the consumer takes possession of the digital content for a fee. Revenue from product downloads is generally recognized when the download is made available (assuming all other recognition criteria are met).  Our provisions for price protection and other allowances fluctuate over periods as a result of a number of factors including analysis of historical experience, current sell-through of retailer inventory of our products, current trends in the interactive entertainment market, the overall economy, changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products and other related factors. Significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for returns and price protection in any accounting period. However, actual allowances granted could materially exceed our estimates as unsold products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences, market conditions, technological obsolescence due to new platforms, product updates or competing products. For example, the risk of requests for allowances may increase as consoles pass the midpoint of their lifecycle and an increasing number of competitive products heighten pricing and competitive pressures. Additionally, the reduction in the scope of our game operations and elimination of games in development for future release could have an impact on our relationship with retailers. While management believes it can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. Accordingly, if our estimates change, this will result in a change in our provisions, which would impact the net revenues and/or selling and marketing expenses we report. Fluctuations in the provisions reflected our estimates of future price protection based on the factors discussed above. We limit our exposure to credit risk by factoring a portion of our receivables to a third party that buys without recourse. For receivables that are not sold without recourse, we analyze our aged accounts receivables, payment history and other factors to make a determination if collection of receivables is likely, or a provision for uncollectible accounts is necessary.  Capitalized Software Development Costs and License Fees. Software development costs include development fees, primarily in the form of milestone payments made to independent software developers. Software development costs are capitalized once technological feasibility of a product is established and management expects such costs to be recoverable against future revenues. For products where proven game engine technology exists, this may occur early in the development cycle. Technological feasibility is evaluated on a product-by-product basis. Amounts related to software development that are not capitalized are charged immediately to product research and development costs. Commencing upon a related product's release capitalized software development costs are amortized to cost of sales based upon the higher of (i) the ratio of current revenue to total projected revenue or (ii) straight-line charges over the expected marketable life of the product.  Prepaid license fees represent license fees to holders for the use of their intellectual property rights in the development of our products. Minimum guaranteed royalty payments for intellectual property licenses are initially recorded as an asset (capitalized license fees) and a current liability (accrued royalties payable) at the contractual amount upon execution of the contract or when specified milestones or events occur and when no significant performance commitment remains with the licensor. Licenses are expensed to cost of sales at the higher of (i) the contractual royalty rate based on actual sales or (ii) an effective rate based upon total projected revenue related to such license. Capitalized software development costs are classified as non-current if they relate to titles for which we estimate the release date to be more than one year from the balance sheet date.  The amortization period for capitalized software development costs and license fees is usually no longer than one year from the initial release of the product. If actual revenues or revised forecasted revenues fall below the initial forecasted revenue for a particular license, the charge to cost of sales may be larger than anticipated in any given quarter. The recoverability of capitalized software development costs and license fees is evaluated quarterly based on the expected performance of the specific products to which the costs relate.  When, in management's estimate, future cash flows will not be sufficient to recover previously capitalized costs, we expense these capitalized costs to cost of sales - loss on impairment of capitalized software development costs and license fees - future releases, in the period such a determination is made. These expenses may be incurred prior to a game's release. If a game is cancelled and never released to market, the amount is expensed to operating costs and expenses - loss on impairment of capitalized software development costs and license fees - cancelled games. If we were required to write off licenses or capitalized software development costs, due to changes in market conditions or product acceptance, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.  License fees and milestone payments made to our third party developers are typically considered non-refundable advances against the total compensation they can earn based upon the sales performance of the products. Any additional royalty or other compensation earned beyond the milestone payments is expensed to cost of sales as incurred.  We expense as research and development costs associated with the development of mobile and social games when we cannot reliably project that future net cash flows from developed games will exceed related development costs. These games have not earned significant revenues to date and we are continuing to evaluate alternatives for future development and monetization.  Inventory. Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out method. We estimate the net realizable value of slow-moving inventory on a title-by-title basis and charge the excess of cost over net realizable value to cost of sales. Some of our inventory items are packaged with accessories. The purchase of these accessories involves longer lead times and minimum purchase amounts, which may require us to maintain higher levels of inventory than for other games. Therefore, these items have a higher risk of obsolescence, which we review periodically based on inventory and sales levels.  Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. Stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including, in the case of stock option awards, estimating expected stock volatility. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted.  Commitments and Contingencies. We record a liability for commitments and contingencies when the amount is both probable and reasonably estimable. We record associated legal fees as incurred.  Results of Operations  Three months ended January 31, 2015 versus three months ended January 31, 2014  Net Revenues.Net revenues for the three months ended January 31, 2015 decreased approximately 84% to $3.5 million from $21.9 million in the comparable quarter last year. The decrease was due to lower sales of Zumba titles, including a decrease in Zumba revenue from Europe. In the prior-year period, we released Zumba World Party and Zumba Kids. We did not release a new Zumba title in the current-year period. Overall Zumba sales accounted for 72% of revenues in the prior-year period. In addition, since January 31, 2014, we have substantially reduced development and distribution activities for packaged software generally and released fewer titles in the current period. Revenues from games distributed digitally increased to $1,002 compared to $544 the same period last year primarily due to the release of Costume Quest 2 and Slender: The Arrival, on various digital platforms including Steam, Sony Playstation Network and Microsoft XBLA.  Gross Profit. Gross profit for the three months ended January 31, 2015 was $1.4 million compared to a gross profit of $3.4 million in the same period last year. The decrease in gross profit reflects lower Zumba and other sales as discussed above. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 39% for the three months ended January 31, 2015, compared to 15% for the three months ended January 31, 2014. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the portion of total revenues represented by revenues from digital distribution, which has a higher gross margin relative to sales due to the lack of cost of physical goods distribution. Such distribution fee revenue in the prior year period was not significant. In the prior year, costs of sales included significant higher amortization of software development costs of Zumba.  Product Research and Development Expenses. Product research and development expenses were less than $0.1 million for the three months ended January 31, 2015, compared to $1.2 million of expenses for the same period in 2014, reflecting the effects of workforce reductions in 2014 and limited spending on third-party development projects.  Selling and Marketing Expenses. Total selling and marketing expenses were approximately $0.4 million for the three months ended January 31, 2015, compared to $4.1 million for the three months ended January 31, 2014. Decreases primarily due to lower personnel costs and other marketing and distribution activities related to the Company's games generally. In addition, the prior-year period included advertising costs related to the release of Zumba games.  General and Administrative Expenses. For the three-month period ended January 31, 2015, general and administrative expenses amounted to $1.7 million, compared to $2.1 million for the three months ended January 31, 2014. The decrease reflects lower compensation costs, consulting and professional fees and related support expenses.  Operating loss. Operating loss for the three months ended January 31, 2015 was approximately $1.0 million, compared to an operating loss of $4.1 million in the comparable period in 2014, primarily reflecting expense reductions in development and marketing activities.  Loss from equity method investment. We recorded a loss of approximately $0.2 million in the three months ended January 31, 2014 for our 50% share of losses incurred by our GMS joint venture in the period. We sold our investment in GMS in November 2014. Accordingly, there was no effect of GMS operations on the current-year period.  Extinguishment of liabilities. During the three months ended January 31, 2015, the Company recognized a gain on extinguishment of liabilities of $0.5 million. The Company determined that certain accounts payable balances and claims for license fees and services would never be paid because they were no longer being pursued for payment and had passed the statute of limitations. There was no such activity in the prior-year period.  Net Gains on asset sales. During the three months ended January 31, 2015, the Company recognized a $0.1 million net gain from the sale of certain game rights and from the sale of office furniture and equipment upon the move to a smaller office. There was no such activity in the prior-year period.  Change in fair value of warrant liability. In our December 2014 private placement of units consisting of preferred stock and warrants, we issued warrants containing certain contingent settlement terms not indexed to our own stock.. We account for the warrants as derivative liabilities and will re-measure their fair value on a quarterly basis and recognize on a current basis any gains or losses. In the three months ended January 31, 2015, we recognized a loss of $0.8 million reflecting an increase in our stock price from the issuance date of the warrant to January 31, 2015.  Income Taxes. In the three months ended January 31, 2015 and 2014, our income tax expense was not significant, representing primarily minimum state income taxes.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  As of January 31, 2015, our cash and cash equivalents balance was $10.5 million and our working capital was approximately $6.2 million, compared to cash and equivalents of $7.2 million and working capital of $5.4 million at October 31, 2014. The increase in cash primarily reflects the sale of inventory and collection of accounts receivable in the three months ended January 31, 2015. In addition, we received approximately $0.8 million of net proceeds from our December 2014 private placement of units and received cash proceeds from the sale of certain games in development and the sale of our interest in GMS.  In recent quarters, we have generally used cash and working capital balances to fund periodic operating losses due to declining revenues which we attribute to three factors: 1) the introduction of competing "freemium" games on competing handheld devices such as the Apple iphone or itouch, and Android powered devices; 2) a shift in game distribution from retail to digital downloads; and  Mar 17, 2015  (c) 1995-2015 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc.
