P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Shares Sold Short The total number of shares of a security that have been sold short and not yet repurchased. Change from Last Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report. Exchanges report short interest twice a month. Percent of Float Total short positions relative to the number of shares available to trade.      Short Interest ()   N/A      ?    Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.

History[edit]
Telkom is one of the world's oldest telecommunication companies. The company can be traced to an establishment of the first electromagnetic telegraph service in Indonesia on 23 October 1856, by the Dutch Colonial Government to connecting Batavia (Jakarta) and Buitenzorg (Bogor).[7] In 1884, the Dutch Colonial Government founded a private company to provide postal and domestic telegraph services and, later on, international telegraph services.[8]
Early years[edit]
Telephony services had been introduced to Indonesia in 1882 by privately owned companies under a 25-year government license. In 1906, all postal and telegraph services in Indonesia were taken over by the government as single, unified government agency named Posts Telegraafend Telefoon Diensts (PTT).[7][9] In September 1945, roughly a month after Indonesian proclamation of independence, the agency headquarters in Bandung were taken over by Indonesian nationalists.[9] In December 1949, after years of national revolution war, the PTT was nationalised by Indonesian Government as part of Indonesian effort to oust the remaining Dutch and nationalise Dutch corporate assets.[10][11]
State-owned company[edit]
In 1961, PTT was converted from an official government agency into a newly established state-owned company, the Postal and Telecommunications Services company. Four year later, in 1965, Indonesian Government separated this company into two state-owned companies, PN Pos Giro responsible for providing mail services and PN Telekomunikasi as telecommunications services.[12] The mail services PN Pos Giro developed over year, to become the Pos Indonesia in 1995, which is still state-owned today and the official postal carrier for Indonesia's 230 million people.[9][12]
In 1974, PN Telekomunikasi was further divided into two state-owned companies. Perusahaan Umum Telekomunikasi (Perumtel) provided domestic and international telecommunications services, while PT Industri Telekomunikasi Indonesia (PT INTI) manufactured telecommunications equipment. A further division in 1980 saw the international telecommunications business taken over by the newly established PT Indonesian Satellite Corporation (Indosat).[7]
In 1991, Perumtel became a state-owened limited liability corporation and renamed to what is now Perusahaan Perseroan (Persero) PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia or Telkom. Until 1995, Telkom's operations were organised along twelve regional operating units known as Wilayah Telekomunikasi or Witel. Each Witel had full responsibility for all aspects of business and operations in their respective regions, such as telephone services, property management and security.[7] In 1995, Telkom reorganised the twelve Witels into seven regional divisions and one network division. Under a series of Cooperation (KSO) Agreements, Telkom transferred the right to operate five of its seven regional divisions (I, III, IV, VI and VII) to private sector consortia. Under these agreements, the KSO partners manage and operate the regional division concerned for a fixed term, build a specified number of fixed lines and, at the end of the term, transfer the telecommunications facilities to Telkom for an agreed amount in compensation. Revenues from the KSO operations were shared between Telkom and the KSO partners.[7]
Privatization[edit]
On 14 November 1995, Telkom became a privatised company when shares went on sale through an initial public offering on the Jakarta Stock Exchange and the Surabaya Stock Exchange (which merged in December 2007 to become the Indonesia Stock Exchange). Telkom's shares are also listed on the NYSE and the LSE in the form of American Depositary Shares (ADSs), and were publicly offered without listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Telkom is now the largest company by market capitalisation in Indonesia, with a market capitalisation of approximately IDR 190,512 trillion as of 31 December 2009.[7][13] The Government retains an aggregate interest of 51.19% of the issued and outstanding shares of Telkom. The Government also holds one Dwiwarna share, which has special voting and veto rights over certain matters.[7][14]
In mid-1997, Indonesia was badly affected by the Asian economic crisis.[7][15] Among those impacted were certain KSO partners, who experienced difficulties in fulfilling their obligations to Telkom. Telkom eventually acquired control of its KSO partners in Regions I, III, and VI, and amended the terms of the KSO agreements with its KSO partners in Regions IV and VII to obtain legal rights to control the financial and operating decisions of those regions.[7]
Since 5 June 2014, Telkom shares are no longer traded on the London Stock Exchange ("LSE"), and since 16 May 2014, they cease to be registered on the Tokyo Stock Exchange ("TSE") in Japan.[16]
Telecommunication deregulation[edit]
In 1999, Indonesia passed a deregulating telecommunication law that set in motion a sweeping array of reforms and enlivened competition policy, private investment, and long term industry direction.[15] Among the proposed reforms was the progressive elimination of the joint ownership, by Telkom and Indosat, of most of the telecommunications companies in Indonesia. This was intended to promote a more competitive market. As a result, in 2001, Telkom acquired Indosat's 35.0% stake in Telkomsel, resulting in Telkom owning 77.7% of the shares of Telkomsel, while Indosat acquired Telkom's 22.5% interest in Satelindo and its 37.7% stake in Lintasarta. In 2002, Telkom sold 12.7% of Telkomsel to Singapore Telecom Mobile Pte Ltd (SingTel Mobile), reducing Telkom's ownership of Telkomsel to 65.0%.[7]
On 1 August 2001, the Government terminated Telkom's exclusive right to provide fixed line services in Indonesia and Indosat's right to provide international direct dial services. Subsequently, Telkom's exclusive rights to provide domestic and long-distance services were terminated in August 2002 and August 2003, respectively.[7][17]
On 7 June 2004, Telkom began to provide their own international direct dial fixed line services. On 16 November 2005, the Telkom-2 satellite was launched to replace all satellite transmission services that have been served by previous satellite, Palapa B-4.[7][18]
Transformations[edit]
In 2009, Telkom started doing the business transformation of the only company in the field of telecommunications to broader range of business, the company expanded to the telecommunications, information technology services, media and edutainment.[19] Telkom's decision to transform its business was prompted by the shift in customer lifestyles, and supported by advances in technology and regulatory changes that enabled service providers to deliver enhanced service to customers.[20] With this new business transformation, Telkom also plans to conduct the acquisition of several companies that are in line with Telkom's transformation of the new business.[19][21][22]
In August 2012, the Telkom-3 satellite was lost in a launch failure; being placed into an unusably low orbit following the failure of the Briz-M upper stage of the Proton-M rocket that had launched it. It's replacement, Telkom-3S successfully launched aboard an Ariane 5 rocket on 14 February 2017, 21:39 UTC.
Operations[edit]
Telkom Indonesia is a dominant and largest provider of fixed line services due to owning most of Indonesia's copper network.[4] Telkom also runs telephone exchanges, trunk network and local loop connections for its fixed-line telephones. Currently Telkom is responsible for approximately 8.3 million telephone lines in Indonesia.[4] And like most of the other state-ownership telecommunication company in the world, Telkom is obliged to provide public services such as public call boxes.
Telkom Indonesia businesses are operated under government regulation by the Indonesian Ministry of Communication and Information. Telkom, as government-owned company, is required to comply with additional obligations such as provide telecommunication services and not to discriminate. As well as providing service in those regulated areas, Telkom has expanded into more profitable products and services where there is less government-owned-related regulation.[23]
Telkom Indonesia is the parent company of the Telkom Group, which is engaged in a wide range of businesses that consist of telecommunication, information, multimedia, property and finance services.[4] Telkom mainly operates in fixed line telephony, internet and data communications business, while other businesses are run by subsidiaries.

History[edit]
Telkom is one of the world's oldest telecommunication companies. The company can be traced to an establishment of the first electromagnetic telegraph service in Indonesia on 23 October 1856, by the Dutch Colonial Government to connecting Batavia (Jakarta) and Buitenzorg (Bogor).[7] In 1884, the Dutch Colonial Government founded a private company to provide postal and domestic telegraph services and, later on, international telegraph services.[8]
Early years[edit]
Telephony services had been introduced to Indonesia in 1882 by privately owned companies under a 25-year government license. In 1906, all postal and telegraph services in Indonesia were taken over by the government as single, unified government agency named Posts Telegraafend Telefoon Diensts (PTT).[7][9] In September 1945, roughly a month after Indonesian proclamation of independence, the agency headquarters in Bandung were taken over by Indonesian nationalists.[9] In December 1949, after years of national revolution war, the PTT was nationalised by Indonesian Government as part of Indonesian effort to oust the remaining Dutch and nationalise Dutch corporate assets.[10][11]
State-owned company[edit]
In 1961, PTT was converted from an official government agency into a newly established state-owned company, the Postal and Telecommunications Services company. Four year later, in 1965, Indonesian Government separated this company into two state-owned companies, PN Pos Giro responsible for providing mail services and PN Telekomunikasi as telecommunications services.[12] The mail services PN Pos Giro developed over year, to become the Pos Indonesia in 1995, which is still state-owned today and the official postal carrier for Indonesia's 230 million people.[9][12]
In 1974, PN Telekomunikasi was further divided into two state-owned companies. Perusahaan Umum Telekomunikasi (Perumtel) provided domestic and international telecommunications services, while PT Industri Telekomunikasi Indonesia (PT INTI) manufactured telecommunications equipment. A further division in 1980 saw the international telecommunications business taken over by the newly established PT Indonesian Satellite Corporation (Indosat).[7]
In 1991, Perumtel became a state-owened limited liability corporation and renamed to what is now Perusahaan Perseroan (Persero) PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia or Telkom. Until 1995, Telkom's operations were organised along twelve regional operating units known as Wilayah Telekomunikasi or Witel. Each Witel had full responsibility for all aspects of business and operations in their respective regions, such as telephone services, property management and security.[7] In 1995, Telkom reorganised the twelve Witels into seven regional divisions and one network division. Under a series of Cooperation (KSO) Agreements, Telkom transferred the right to operate five of its seven regional divisions (I, III, IV, VI and VII) to private sector consortia. Under these agreements, the KSO partners manage and operate the regional division concerned for a fixed term, build a specified number of fixed lines and, at the end of the term, transfer the telecommunications facilities to Telkom for an agreed amount in compensation. Revenues from the KSO operations were shared between Telkom and the KSO partners.[7]

Telkom's shares are also listed on the NYSE and the LSE in the form of American Depositary Shares (ADSs), and were publicly offered without listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Telkom is now the largest company by market capitalisation in Indonesia, with a market capitalisation of approximately IDR 190,512 trillion as of 31 December 2009.[7][13] The Government retains an aggregate interest of 51.19% of the issued and outstanding shares of Telkom. The Government also holds one Dwiwarna share, which has special voting and veto rights over certain matters.[7][14]

Telkom eventually acquired control of its KSO partners in Regions I, III, and VI, and amended the terms of the KSO agreements with its KSO partners in Regions IV and VII to obtain legal rights to control the financial and operating decisions of those regions.[7]
Since 5 June 2014, Telkom shares are no longer traded on the London Stock Exchange ("LSE"), and since 16 May 2014, they cease to be registered on the Tokyo Stock Exchange ("TSE") in Japan.[16]

History[edit]
Telkom is one of the world's oldest telecommunication companies. The company can be traced to an establishment of the first electromagnetic telegraph service in Indonesia on 23 October 1856, by the Dutch Colonial Government to connecting Batavia (Jakarta) and Buitenzorg (Bogor).[7] In 1884, the Dutch Colonial Government founded a private company to provide postal and domestic telegraph services and, later on, international telegraph services.[8]
Early years[edit]
Telephony services had been introduced to Indonesia in 1882 by privately owned companies under a 25-year government license. In 1906, all postal and telegraph services in Indonesia were taken over by the government as single, unified government agency named Posts Telegraafend Telefoon Diensts (PTT).[7][9] In September 1945, roughly a month after Indonesian proclamation of independence, the agency headquarters in Bandung were taken over by Indonesian nationalists.[9] In December 1949, after years of national revolution war, the PTT was nationalised by Indonesian Government as part of Indonesian effort to oust the remaining Dutch and nationalise Dutch corporate assets.[10][11]
State-owned company[edit]
In 1961, PTT was converted from an official government agency into a newly established state-owned company, the Postal and Telecommunications Services company. Four year later, in 1965, Indonesian Government separated this company into two state-owned companies, PN Pos Giro responsible for providing mail services and PN Telekomunikasi as telecommunications services.[12] The mail services PN Pos Giro developed over year, to become the Pos Indonesia in 1995, which is still state-owned today and the official postal carrier for Indonesia's 230 million people.[9][12]
In 1974, PN Telekomunikasi was further divided into two state-owned companies. Perusahaan Umum Telekomunikasi (Perumtel) provided domestic and international telecommunications services, while PT Industri Telekomunikasi Indonesia (PT INTI) manufactured telecommunications equipment. A further division in 1980 saw the international telecommunications business taken over by the newly established PT Indonesian Satellite Corporation (Indosat).[7]
In 1991, Perumtel became a state-owened limited liability corporation and renamed to what is now Perusahaan Perseroan (Persero) PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia or Telkom. Until 1995, Telkom's operations were organised along twelve regional operating units known as Wilayah Telekomunikasi or Witel. Each Witel had full responsibility for all aspects of business and operations in their respective regions, such as telephone services, property management and security.[7] In 1995, Telkom reorganised the twelve Witels into seven regional divisions and one network division. Under a series of Cooperation (KSO) Agreements, Telkom transferred the right to operate five of its seven regional divisions (I, III, IV, VI and VII) to private sector consortia. Under these agreements, the KSO partners manage and operate the regional division concerned for a fixed term, build a specified number of fixed lines and, at the end of the term, transfer the telecommunications facilities to Telkom for an agreed amount in compensation. Revenues from the KSO operations were shared between Telkom and the KSO partners.[7]
Privatization[edit]
On 14 November 1995, Telkom became a privatised company when shares went on sale through an initial public offering on the Jakarta Stock Exchange and the Surabaya Stock Exchange (which merged in December 2007 to become the Indonesia Stock Exchange). Telkom's shares are also listed on the NYSE and the LSE in the form of American Depositary Shares (ADSs), and were publicly offered without listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Telkom is now the largest company by market capitalisation in Indonesia, with a market capitalisation of approximately IDR 190,512 trillion as of 31 December 2009.[7][13] The Government retains an aggregate interest of 51.19% of the issued and outstanding shares of Telkom. The Government also holds one Dwiwarna share, which has special voting and veto rights over certain matters.[7][14]
In mid-1997, Indonesia was badly affected by the Asian economic crisis.[7][15] Among those impacted were certain KSO partners, who experienced difficulties in fulfilling their obligations to Telkom. Telkom eventually acquired control of its KSO partners in Regions I, III, and VI, and amended the terms of the KSO agreements with its KSO partners in Regions IV and VII to obtain legal rights to control the financial and operating decisions of those regions.[7]
Since 5 June 2014, Telkom shares are no longer traded on the London Stock Exchange ("LSE"), and since 16 May 2014, they cease to be registered on the Tokyo Stock Exchange ("TSE") in Japan.[16]
Telecommunication deregulation[edit]
In 1999, Indonesia passed a deregulating telecommunication law that set in motion a sweeping array of reforms and enlivened competition policy, private investment, and long term industry direction.[15] Among the proposed reforms was the progressive elimination of the joint ownership, by Telkom and Indosat, of most of the telecommunications companies in Indonesia. This was intended to promote a more competitive market. As a result, in 2001, Telkom acquired Indosat's 35.0% stake in Telkomsel, resulting in Telkom owning 77.7% of the shares of Telkomsel, while Indosat acquired Telkom's 22.5% interest in Satelindo and its 37.7% stake in Lintasarta. In 2002, Telkom sold 12.7% of Telkomsel to Singapore Telecom Mobile Pte Ltd (SingTel Mobile), reducing Telkom's ownership of Telkomsel to 65.0%.[7]
On 1 August 2001, the Government terminated Telkom's exclusive right to provide fixed line services in Indonesia and Indosat's right to provide international direct dial services. Subsequently, Telkom's exclusive rights to provide domestic and long-distance services were terminated in August 2002 and August 2003, respectively.[7][17]
On 7 June 2004, Telkom began to provide their own international direct dial fixed line services. On 16 November 2005, the Telkom-2 satellite was launched to replace all satellite transmission services that have been served by previous satellite, Palapa B-4.[7][18]
Transformations[edit]
In 2009, Telkom started doing the business transformation of the only company in the field of telecommunications to broader range of business, the company expanded to the telecommunications, information technology services, media and edutainment.[19] Telkom's decision to transform its business was prompted by the shift in customer lifestyles, and supported by advances in technology and regulatory changes that enabled service providers to deliver enhanced service to customers.[20] With this new business transformation, Telkom also plans to conduct the acquisition of several companies that are in line with Telkom's transformation of the new business.[19][21][22]
In August 2012, the Telkom-3 satellite was lost in a launch failure; being placed into an unusably low orbit following the failure of the Briz-M upper stage of the Proton-M rocket that had launched it. It's replacement, Telkom-3S successfully launched aboard an Ariane 5 rocket on 14 February 2017, 21:39 UTC.
Operations[edit]
Telkom Indonesia is a dominant and largest provider of fixed line services due to owning most of Indonesia's copper network.[4] Telkom also runs telephone exchanges, trunk network and local loop connections for its fixed-line telephones. Currently Telkom is responsible for approximately 8.3 million telephone lines in Indonesia.[4] And like most of the other state-ownership telecommunication company in the world, Telkom is obliged to provide public services such as public call boxes.
Telkom Indonesia businesses are operated under government regulation by the Indonesian Ministry of Communication and Information. Telkom, as government-owned company, is required to comply with additional obligations such as provide telecommunication services and not to discriminate. As well as providing service in those regulated areas, Telkom has expanded into more profitable products and services where there is less government-owned-related regulation.[23]
Telkom Indonesia is the parent company of the Telkom Group, which is engaged in a wide range of businesses that consist of telecommunication, information, multimedia, property and finance services.[4] Telkom mainly operates in fixed line telephony, internet and data communications business, while other businesses are run by subsidiaries.
Business divisions[edit]
Telkom akses is organised into following business divisions:

Consumer Division: Retail telecoms services to consumers
Carrier and Interconnection Services Division: Telecoms services partnership
Enterprise Division: Telecoms services to enterprises
Business Services Division: Telecoms services to small-medium businesses
Telkom Flexi Division: telephone and data services based on fixed wireless CDMA protocol, concerning with new government frequency management, Telkom has spun off Telkom Flexi since 1 October 2014 and has received payment (consideration) from Telkomsel 25 percent of Rp 2.828 trillion and the rest will be paid on 31 December 2014. Because it received payment from Telkomsel, all Flexi's cellular communications are transferred into Kartu As, Telkomsel's subsidiary.[24]

Four year later, in 1965, Indonesian Government separated this company into two state-owned companies, PN Pos Giro responsible for providing mail services and PN Telekomunikasi as telecommunications services.[12] The mail services PN Pos Giro developed over year, to become the Pos Indonesia in 1995, which is still state-owned today and the official postal carrier for Indonesia's 230 million people.[9][12]
In 1974, PN Telekomunikasi was further divided into two state-owned companies. Perusahaan Umum Telekomunikasi (Perumtel) provided domestic and international telecommunications services, while PT Industri Telekomunikasi Indonesia (PT INTI) manufactured telecommunications equipment. A further division in 1980 saw the international telecommunications business taken over by the newly established PT Indonesian Satellite Corporation (Indosat).[7]
In 1991, Perumtel became a state-owened limited liability corporation and renamed to what is now Perusahaan Perseroan (Persero) PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia or Telkom. Until 1995, Telkom's operations were organised along twelve regional operating units known as Wilayah Telekomunikasi or Witel. Each Witel had full responsibility for all aspects of business and operations in their respective regions, such as telephone services, property management and security.[7] In 1995, Telkom reorganised the twelve Witels into seven regional divisions and one network division. Under a series of Cooperation (KSO) Agreements, Telkom transferred the right to operate five of its seven regional divisions (I, III, IV, VI and VII) to private sector consortia. Under these agreements, the KSO partners manage and operate the regional division concerned for a fixed term, build a specified number of fixed lines and, at the end of the term, transfer the telecommunications facilities to Telkom for an agreed amount in compensation. Revenues from the KSO operations were shared between Telkom and the KSO partners.[7]
Privatization[edit]
On 14 November 1995, Telkom became a privatised company when shares went on sale through an initial public offering on the Jakarta Stock Exchange and the Surabaya Stock Exchange (which merged in December 2007 to become the Indonesia Stock Exchange). Telkom's shares are also listed on the NYSE and the LSE in the form of American Depositary Shares (ADSs), and were publicly offered without listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Telkom is now the largest company by market capitalisation in Indonesia, with a market capitalisation of approximately IDR 190,512 trillion as of 31 December 2009.[7][13] The Government retains an aggregate interest of 51.19% of the issued and outstanding shares of Telkom. The Government also holds one Dwiwarna share, which has special voting and veto rights over certain matters.[7][14]
In mid-1997, Indonesia was badly affected by the Asian economic crisis.[7][15] Among those impacted were certain KSO partners, who experienced difficulties in fulfilling their obligations to Telkom. Telkom eventually acquired control of its KSO partners in Regions I, III, and VI, and amended the terms of the KSO agreements with its KSO partners in Regions IV and VII to obtain legal rights to control the financial and operating decisions of those regions.[7]
Since 5 June 2014, Telkom shares are no longer traded on the London Stock Exchange ("LSE"), and since 16 May 2014, they cease to be registered on the Tokyo Stock Exchange ("TSE") in Japan.[16]
Telecommunication deregulation[edit]
In 1999, Indonesia passed a deregulating telecommunication law that set in motion a sweeping array of reforms and enlivened competition policy, private investment, and long term industry direction.[15] Among the proposed reforms was the progressive elimination of the joint ownership, by Telkom and Indosat, of most of the telecommunications companies in Indonesia. This was intended to promote a more competitive market. As a result, in 2001, Telkom acquired Indosat's 35.0% stake in Telkomsel, resulting in Telkom owning 77.7% of the shares of Telkomsel, while Indosat acquired Telkom's 22.5% interest in Satelindo and its 37.7% stake in Lintasarta. In 2002, Telkom sold 12.7% of Telkomsel to Singapore Telecom Mobile Pte Ltd (SingTel Mobile), reducing Telkom's ownership of Telkomsel to 65.0%.[7]
On 1 August 2001, the Government terminated Telkom's exclusive right to provide fixed line services in Indonesia and Indosat's right to provide international direct dial services. Subsequently, Telkom's exclusive rights to provide domestic and long-distance services were terminated in August 2002 and August 2003, respectively.[7][17]
On 7 June 2004, Telkom began to provide their own international direct dial fixed line services. On 16 November 2005, the Telkom-2 satellite was launched to replace all satellite transmission services that have been served by previous satellite, Palapa B-4.[7][18]
Transformations[edit]
In 2009, Telkom started doing the business transformation of the only company in the field of telecommunications to broader range of business, the company expanded to the telecommunications, information technology services, media and edutainment.[19] Telkom's decision to transform its business was prompted by the shift in customer lifestyles, and supported by advances in technology and regulatory changes that enabled service providers to deliver enhanced service to customers.[20] With this new business transformation, Telkom also plans to conduct the acquisition of several companies that are in line with Telkom's transformation of the new business.[19][21][22]
In August 2012, the Telkom-3 satellite was lost in a launch failure; being placed into an unusably low orbit following the failure of the Briz-M upper stage of the Proton-M rocket that had launched it. It's replacement, Telkom-3S successfully launched aboard an Ariane 5 rocket on 14 February 2017, 21:39 UTC.
Operations[edit]
Telkom Indonesia is a dominant and largest provider of fixed line services due to owning most of Indonesia's copper network.[4] Telkom also runs telephone exchanges, trunk network and local loop connections for its fixed-line telephones. Currently Telkom is responsible for approximately 8.3 million telephone lines in Indonesia.[4] And like most of the other state-ownership telecommunication company in the world, Telkom is obliged to provide public services such as public call boxes.
Telkom Indonesia businesses are operated under government regulation by the Indonesian Ministry of Communication and Information. Telkom, as government-owned company, is required to comply with additional obligations such as provide telecommunication services and not to discriminate. As well as providing service in those regulated areas, Telkom has expanded into more profitable products and services where there is less government-owned-related regulation.[23]
Telkom Indonesia is the parent company of the Telkom Group, which is engaged in a wide range of businesses that consist of telecommunication, information, multimedia, property and finance services.[4] Telkom mainly operates in fixed line telephony, internet and data communications business, while other businesses are run by subsidiaries.

Telkom akses is organised into following business divisions:

Consumer Division: Retail telecoms services to consumers
Carrier and Interconnection Services Division: Telecoms services partnership
Enterprise Division: Telecoms services to enterprises

History[edit]
Telkom is one of the world's oldest telecommunication companies. The company can be traced to an establishment of the first electromagnetic telegraph service in Indonesia on 23 October 1856, by the Dutch Colonial Government to connecting Batavia (Jakarta) and Buitenzorg (Bogor).[7] In 1884, the Dutch Colonial Government founded a private company to provide postal and domestic telegraph services and, later on, international telegraph services.[8]
Early years[edit]
Telephony services had been introduced to Indonesia in 1882 by privately owned companies under a 25-year government license. In 1906, all postal and telegraph services in Indonesia were taken over by the government as single, unified government agency named Posts Telegraafend Telefoon Diensts (PTT).[7][9] In September 1945, roughly a month after Indonesian proclamation of independence, the agency headquarters in Bandung were taken over by Indonesian nationalists.[9] In December 1949, after years of national revolution war, the PTT was nationalised by Indonesian Government as part of Indonesian effort to oust the remaining Dutch and nationalise Dutch corporate assets.[10][11]
State-owned company[edit]
In 1961, PTT was converted from an official government agency into a newly established state-owned company, the Postal and Telecommunications Services company. Four year later, in 1965, Indonesian Government separated this company into two state-owned companies, PN Pos Giro responsible for providing mail services and PN Telekomunikasi as telecommunications services.[12] The mail services PN Pos Giro developed over year, to become the Pos Indonesia in 1995, which is still state-owned today and the official postal carrier for Indonesia's 230 million people.[9][12]
In 1974, PN Telekomunikasi was further divided into two state-owned companies. Perusahaan Umum Telekomunikasi (Perumtel) provided domestic and international telecommunications services, while PT Industri Telekomunikasi Indonesia (PT INTI) manufactured telecommunications equipment. A further division in 1980 saw the international telecommunications business taken over by the newly established PT Indonesian Satellite Corporation (Indosat).[7]
In 1991, Perumtel became a state-owened limited liability corporation and renamed to what is now Perusahaan Perseroan (Persero) PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia or Telkom. Until 1995, Telkom's operations were organised along twelve regional operating units known as Wilayah Telekomunikasi or Witel. Each Witel had full responsibility for all aspects of business and operations in their respective regions, such as telephone services, property management and security.[7] In 1995, Telkom reorganised the twelve Witels into seven regional divisions and one network division. Under a series of Cooperation (KSO) Agreements, Telkom transferred the right to operate five of its seven regional divisions (I, III, IV, VI and VII) to private sector consortia. Under these agreements, the KSO partners manage and operate the regional division concerned for a fixed term, build a specified number of fixed lines and, at the end of the term, transfer the telecommunications facilities to Telkom for an agreed amount in compensation. Revenues from the KSO operations were shared between Telkom and the KSO partners.[7]

The Government also holds one Dwiwarna share, which has special voting and veto rights over certain matters.[7][14]

History[edit]
Telkom is one of the world's oldest telecommunication companies. The company can be traced to an establishment of the first electromagnetic telegraph service in Indonesia on 23 October 1856, by the Dutch Colonial Government to connecting Batavia (Jakarta) and Buitenzorg (Bogor).[7] In 1884, the Dutch Colonial Government founded a private company to provide postal and domestic telegraph services and, later on, international telegraph services.[8]
Early years[edit]
Telephony services had been introduced to Indonesia in 1882 by privately owned companies under a 25-year government license. In 1906, all postal and telegraph services in Indonesia were taken over by the government as single, unified government agency named Posts Telegraafend Telefoon Diensts (PTT).[7][9] In September 1945, roughly a month after Indonesian proclamation of independence, the agency headquarters in Bandung were taken over by Indonesian nationalists.[9] In December 1949, after years of national revolution war, the PTT was nationalised by Indonesian Government as part of Indonesian effort to oust the remaining Dutch and nationalise Dutch corporate assets.[10][11]
State-owned company[edit]
In 1961, PTT was converted from an official government agency into a newly established state-owned company, the Postal and Telecommunications Services company. Four year later, in 1965, Indonesian Government separated this company into two state-owned companies, PN Pos Giro responsible for providing mail services and PN Telekomunikasi as telecommunications services.[12] The mail services PN Pos Giro developed over year, to become the Pos Indonesia in 1995, which is still state-owned today and the official postal carrier for Indonesia's 230 million people.[9][12]
In 1974, PN Telekomunikasi was further divided into two state-owned companies. Perusahaan Umum Telekomunikasi (Perumtel) provided domestic and international telecommunications services, while PT Industri Telekomunikasi Indonesia (PT INTI) manufactured telecommunications equipment. A further division in 1980 saw the international telecommunications business taken over by the newly established PT Indonesian Satellite Corporation (Indosat).[7]
In 1991, Perumtel became a state-owened limited liability corporation and renamed to what is now Perusahaan Perseroan (Persero) PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia or Telkom. Until 1995, Telkom's operations were organised along twelve regional operating units known as Wilayah Telekomunikasi or Witel. Each Witel had full responsibility for all aspects of business and operations in their respective regions, such as telephone services, property management and security.[7] In 1995, Telkom reorganised the twelve Witels into seven regional divisions and one network division. Under a series of Cooperation (KSO) Agreements, Telkom transferred the right to operate five of its seven regional divisions (I, III, IV, VI and VII) to private sector consortia. Under these agreements, the KSO partners manage and operate the regional division concerned for a fixed term, build a specified number of fixed lines and, at the end of the term, transfer the telecommunications facilities to Telkom for an agreed amount in compensation. Revenues from the KSO operations were shared between Telkom and the KSO partners.[7]
Privatization[edit]
On 14 November 1995, Telkom became a privatised company when shares went on sale through an initial public offering on the Jakarta Stock Exchange and the Surabaya Stock Exchange (which merged in December 2007 to become the Indonesia Stock Exchange). Telkom's shares are also listed on the NYSE and the LSE in the form of American Depositary Shares (ADSs), and were publicly offered without listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Telkom is now the largest company by market capitalisation in Indonesia, with a market capitalisation of approximately IDR 190,512 trillion as of 31 December 2009.[7][13] The Government retains an aggregate interest of 51.19% of the issued and outstanding shares of Telkom. The Government also holds one Dwiwarna share, which has special voting and veto rights over certain matters.[7][14]
In mid-1997, Indonesia was badly affected by the Asian economic crisis.[7][15] Among those impacted were certain KSO partners, who experienced difficulties in fulfilling their obligations to Telkom. Telkom eventually acquired control of its KSO partners in Regions I, III, and VI, and amended the terms of the KSO agreements with its KSO partners in Regions IV and VII to obtain legal rights to control the financial and operating decisions of those regions.[7]
Since 5 June 2014, Telkom shares are no longer traded on the London Stock Exchange ("LSE"), and since 16 May 2014, they cease to be registered on the Tokyo Stock Exchange ("TSE") in Japan.[16]
Telecommunication deregulation[edit]
In 1999, Indonesia passed a deregulating telecommunication law that set in motion a sweeping array of reforms and enlivened competition policy, private investment, and long term industry direction.[15] Among the proposed reforms was the progressive elimination of the joint ownership, by Telkom and Indosat, of most of the telecommunications companies in Indonesia. This was intended to promote a more competitive market. As a result, in 2001, Telkom acquired Indosat's 35.0% stake in Telkomsel, resulting in Telkom owning 77.7% of the shares of Telkomsel, while Indosat acquired Telkom's 22.5% interest in Satelindo and its 37.7% stake in Lintasarta. In 2002, Telkom sold 12.7% of Telkomsel to Singapore Telecom Mobile Pte Ltd (SingTel Mobile), reducing Telkom's ownership of Telkomsel to 65.0%.[7]
On 1 August 2001, the Government terminated Telkom's exclusive right to provide fixed line services in Indonesia and Indosat's right to provide international direct dial services. Subsequently, Telkom's exclusive rights to provide domestic and long-distance services were terminated in August 2002 and August 2003, respectively.[7][17]
On 7 June 2004, Telkom began to provide their own international direct dial fixed line services. On 16 November 2005, the Telkom-2 satellite was launched to replace all satellite transmission services that have been served by previous satellite, Palapa B-4.[7][18]
Transformations[edit]
In 2009, Telkom started doing the business transformation of the only company in the field of telecommunications to broader range of business, the company expanded to the telecommunications, information technology services, media and edutainment.[19] Telkom's decision to transform its business was prompted by the shift in customer lifestyles, and supported by advances in technology and regulatory changes that enabled service providers to deliver enhanced service to customers.[20] With this new business transformation, Telkom also plans to conduct the acquisition of several companies that are in line with Telkom's transformation of the new business.[19][21][22]
In August 2012, the Telkom-3 satellite was lost in a launch failure; being placed into an unusably low orbit following the failure of the Briz-M upper stage of the Proton-M rocket that had launched it. It's replacement, Telkom-3S successfully launched aboard an Ariane 5 rocket on 14 February 2017, 21:39 UTC.
Operations[edit]
Telkom Indonesia is a dominant and largest provider of fixed line services due to owning most of Indonesia's copper network.[4] Telkom also runs telephone exchanges, trunk network and local loop connections for its fixed-line telephones. Currently Telkom is responsible for approximately 8.3 million telephone lines in Indonesia.[4] And like most of the other state-ownership telecommunication company in the world, Telkom is obliged to provide public services such as public call boxes.
Telkom Indonesia businesses are operated under government regulation by the Indonesian Ministry of Communication and Information. Telkom, as government-owned company, is required to comply with additional obligations such as provide telecommunication services and not to discriminate. As well as providing service in those regulated areas, Telkom has expanded into more profitable products and services where there is less government-owned-related regulation.[23]
Telkom Indonesia is the parent company of the Telkom Group, which is engaged in a wide range of businesses that consist of telecommunication, information, multimedia, property and finance services.[4] Telkom mainly operates in fixed line telephony, internet and data communications business, while other businesses are run by subsidiaries.
Business divisions[edit]
Telkom akses is organised into following business divisions:

Consumer Division: Retail telecoms services to consumers
Carrier and Interconnection Services Division: Telecoms services partnership
Enterprise Division: Telecoms services to enterprises
Business Services Division: Telecoms services to small-medium businesses
Telkom Flexi Division: telephone and data services based on fixed wireless CDMA protocol, concerning with new government frequency management, Telkom has spun off Telkom Flexi since 1 October 2014 and has received payment (consideration) from Telkomsel 25 percent of Rp 2.828 trillion and the rest will be paid on 31 December 2014. Because it received payment from Telkomsel, all Flexi's cellular communications are transferred into Kartu As, Telkomsel's subsidiary.[24]

Telecommunications in Indonesia: Telkom, Indosat & XL Axiata

Despite sharp competition, slowing profit margins and a saturating voice and SMS services market, Indonesia’s telecommunications industry still has lucrative prospects as there is still room for growth in data services, value-added services and still relatively low smartphone penetration (as well as low Internet penetration). However, of the big three Indonesian telecommunication network and services providers - Telekomunikasi Indonesia (Telkom), XL Axiata and Indosat - only Telkom managed to post net profit over 2014. 






Together, these three companies control an 85 percent market share in Indonesia’s mobile phone market. Although the country has a population that numbers 250 million, about 308.2 million mobile phones are in use in Indonesia, implying that some people use two or more mobile phones.
However, smartphone and Internet penetration are still low. At the end of 2013, only 28 percent of the Indonesian population had Internet access, while smartphone penetration stood at 23 percent in the urban areas of Indonesia. Therefore, Indonesian telecommunication providers have increasingly shifted their focus to data services, for example the development of 4G long term evolution.

Meanwhile, the Indonesian government is also eager to develop the country’s broadband network in an effort to enhance Indonesia’s infrastructure. The government created the ‘Indonesia Broadband Plan’ (Rencana Pita Lebar Indonesia) through which it aims to provide broadband Internet to 30 percent of the total Indonesian population by 2019. Other targets set in this plan include raising the ratio of Indonesian households connected to broadband (20 Mbps) to 71 percent by 2019, and fixed broadband (1 Gbps) penetration in buildings to 100 percent. Meanwhile, mobile broadband penetration is targeted to be raised to 100 percent as well.
As the government is eager to enhance Internet connectivity throughout the country, Indonesia’s telecommunication providers will benefit from these efforts.
Telekomunikasi Indonesia (Telkom)
Indonesia’s largest telecommunications network and services provider Telekomunikasi Indonesia (Telkom) recorded 8.1 percent (y/y) growth in revenue to IDR 89.7 trillion (USD $7.0 billion) over 2014. However, net profit only grew 3.1 percent (y/y) to IDR 14.6 trillion (USD $1.1 billion) over the same period.
The company’s net profit growth was supported by an increase in number of broadband services subscribers from 27.8 million in 2013 to 40.5 million in 2014 (+45.3 percent year-on-year). Particularly mobile broadband services experienced good growth. The number of Telkomsel Flash (an Internet package) subscribers grew from 17.3 million in 2013 to 31.2 million in 2014. Meanwhile, the number of fixed broadband (Telkom Speedy) subscribers grew 12.8 percent (y/y) to 3.4 million. As expected, the number of Blackberry package users fell from 7.6 million in 2013 to 5.8 million in 2014.
That Telkom is Indonesia’s largest telecommunications provider is also apparent from data traffic. Over 2014, the company’s data traffic expanded 143 percent to 235 petabytes, primarily caused by the rise in number of smartphone users.
At 38.2 percent, the mobile phone business segment (particularly prepaid) still accounts for the largest share of Telkom’s revenues. Telkom offers KartuHalo, Simpati (both are prepaid) and Kartu As (postpaid) to mobile subscribers. Although this market has saturated to a considerable degree, the number of mobile phone subscribers still grew 6.9 percent (y/y) to 140.6 million people.
Compared to its rivals, Telkom (which is for 51 percent owned by the Indonesian government) has a competitive edge as it is not affected by limited cash reserves (the company has no US dollar-denominated debt and is therefore not hurt by sharp rupiah depreciation). Telkom is also known for having a good reputation and brand in Indonesia, and has a better developed network across Indonesia (therefore it is expected to benefit most from the government’s 4G long term evolution program). At the end of 2014, Telkom owned a total of 85,420 base transceiver stations (BTS). About 45 percent of these are 3G BTS. However, the company already owns 200 BTS 4G.
Stock Quote Telekomunikasi Indonesia - TLKM:
The graph below shows a steep decline as Telkom conducted a stock split with a ratio of 1:5 in August 2013. This measure was taken to increase the company’s share liquidity.

Indosat
The financial results of Indosat are mixed. Although the company - known for its Mentari brand - still recorded a net loss over 2014, this net loss improved significantly from the preceding year. In 2014 Indosat’s net loss was IDR 2.0 billion (USD $156,250), better than the IDR 2.8 billion net loss in 2013. Meanwhile, the company’s revenues only increased 1 percent (y/y) to IDR 24.1 trillion (USD $1.9 billion).
The company was hurt by the legal case of its subsidiary Indosat Mega Media (IM2), an Internet service provider. Indonesia’s Supreme Court found both IM2 and former President Director Indar Atmanto guilty of misusing a 2.1 gigahertz frequency band. In late March 2015, Atmanto filed a judicial review over the Supreme Court’s ruling.
Indosat’s financial performance was also negatively impacted by rupiah depreciation (against the US dollar). The company has a US dollar-denominated debt of USD $650 million (bonds that are due in 2020). Given that it is highly likely that the rupiah is to depreciate further in 2015 ahead of looming higher US interest rates, the financial performance of Indosat will need to absorb this factor.
However, the company expects that it will post net profit in 2015. This optimistic view is based on the completion of a network upgrade (which contributed to net loss in the past two years), debt refinancing, hedging and hope that the IM2 legal case will finish soon.
The company has focused on development of its network. As of 31 December 2014, Indosat operated 40,229 BTS, including 22,166 2G and 18,063 3G BTS.

XL Axiata
Over 2014, XL Axiata posted a 10.3 percentage point growth (y/y) in revenues to IDR 23.5 trillion (USD $1.8 billion). However, it posted net loss of IDR 891.1 billion (USD $69.6 million) over the same period. XL Axiata was also victim of rupiah depreciation hence increasing costs for the company. The net loss was also caused by the acquisition of Axis Telekom Indonesia for USD $865 million in 2014.
XL Axiata also posted a 4 percent decline (y/y) to 58.9 million subscribers over 2014. On a positive note, however, the company’s EBITDA margin improved to 38.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014 from 34.3 percent in the previous quarter primarily due to cost control management.

DOING BUSINESS IN INDONESIA

Indonesia is not the easiest place to start an enterprise or, generally, to conduct business. This is reflected by the World Bank's Doing Business 2016 index in which the country ranks 109th. One of the major obstacles of doing business in Indonesia concerns obtaining the necessary permits and licenses; this can become a time-consuming and expensive affair. In order to successfully start and expand a business it is also important to establish a good network in Indonesian business and government circles. Foreign entrepreneurs should realize the importance of these networks and make efforts to develop them as well as to maintain them. 






Luckily, it is not difficult to establish these networks as foreign businessmen are also interesting parties for Indonesians. It is highly recommended to become acquainted with cultural values beforehand in order to know how to socialize with Indonesian business partners and Indonesian employees as well as to grasp Indonesia's business culture. This will make your business more efficient and effective, especially in the long term.
This section aims to provide an accurate overview of the Indonesian business environment by sharing detailed information on Indonesian companies and commodities. At the same time it will also discuss obstacles to the business environment that are hampering efficiency and effectiveness for economic and social development. Moreover, this section can function as a reference point for those wanting to start a business and/or planning to live in Jakarta as it contains detailed information about certain legal issues such as obtaining the necessary permits for establishing a company or another legal entity. Of course Indonesia Investments can connect you to agencies specialized in these matters and act as a mediator.
Our Business section also provides suggestions concerning strategic living or office accommodations and gives some tips for behavioral patterns when socializing with Indonesians. Enterprises or individuals that want to start doing business in Indonesia and offer services or goods globally (or are in search for specific services or goods) are welcome to advertise on our Business Platform.
Business Columns
The Business Columns section contains articles with an in-depth analysis of subjects at the heart of the Indonesian business world. Together, these columns should provide a clear and detailed image of a wide scope of subjects in Indonesia's business sector and inform about developments within this field. It can serve as a source for investment ideas but it also deals with the negative aspects of (doing) business in Indonesia in order to obtain an objective view.

Commodities
Indonesia contains an abundance of commodities such as coal, gold and gas. A negative side effect in the case of Indonesia, however, is the country's over-dependency on the export of (raw) commodities. Downstream processing industries still lag behind although the government is making efforts to push for the development of such downstream industries. This section discusses the diverse and high traded Indonesian commodities separately, and in detail.

Industries & Sectors
This section on our website presents detailed analyses and overviews of specific industries and sectors within the Indonesian economy, including the automotive industry, tourism, (Islamic) banking, property, as well as the tobacco industry. These analyses will give you insight into the sector: what is the historic background? What are the latest developments? Who are the main players? What are the risks? What is Indonesia's position in the broader world perspective?
Visit Indonesia's industries & sectors page
Risks
Indonesia is a promising country from a macroeconomic perspective but also entails more risks than investing in a developed country due to a number of specific political, social and cultural dynamics of the country. This section aims to provide some insight into these country-specific obstacles to successful investments and hopes to contribute to a better understanding of the country, thereby reducing chances of failure.
Read about the risks when doing business in Indonesia
Foreign Investment
This section is devoted to foreign direct investment in Indonesia, specifically the establishment of the necessary legal entities to start doing business or market your products/services in Indonesia. We focus on the process to set up a foreign investment limited liability company (in Indonesian: Perseroan Terbatas Penanaman Modal Asing, PT PMA) and a representative office (Kantor Perwakilan Perusahaan Asing, or, KPPA).
Visit our foreign investment in Indonesia section
Working & Living
For someone who is not or barely acquainted with Indonesia it can be difficult to find his or her way. It will take perseverance to arrange organizational matters (such as arranging a work permit, establishing a company or finding a place to live) while adjusting to a new culture that differs markedly from his own. This section deals with Indonesia's regulatory framework and other (cultural) information needed to ease the process of settling in Indonesia for business or private purposes.
