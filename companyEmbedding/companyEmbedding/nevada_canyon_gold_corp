“We are pleased to present Canyon Gold as a tightly structured, well-managed exploration company with one goal: to develop and sell assets much like our neighbors did in Newmont Mining’s acquisition of Fronteer Gold for $2.3 billion USD in 2011. Our company is fortunate to hold claims in the now well-known Spruce Ridge - Long Canyon Trend area with mineral formations and rock outcroppings similar to those found at the original discovery site in the Pequop Newmont Mining Claim area. We intend to both expand and explore these areas aggressively in the coming months.”

Spruce Ridge Gold Project

TECHNICAL REPORT on the SPRUCE RIDGE, Carlin Style Gold Project NEVADA U.S.A.
For LONG CANYON
(Canyon Gold)
Written according to National Instrument (NI) 43.101 Technical Report requirements.
By Alex Burton, P. Eng., P. Geo.
Chief Geologist


The Spruce Ridge, Nevada project is on the adjacent range immediately west of the recent Pequop Mountains, Long Canyon Trend major discovery by Fronteer Gold of a substantial Carlin-type gold deposit. The Long Canyon deposit was acquired in February 2011 by Newmont Mining Corporation USA for a reported $2.3 billion.
As of January 12, 2011, published ore resources at Long Canyon were 1,396,000 oz. of gold at an average grade of 2.36 grams per gold per ton contained in 18,371,000 tons of ore. Inferred resources were 803,000 oz. of gold at average grade of 2.24 grams gold per ton contained in 11,170,000 tons of rock.
Through continued exploration, Newmont has since announced additional increased tonnage. Long Canyon intends to explore its claims for the same type of geologic target, a large tonnage gold deposit similar to the West Pequop Mountain Long Canyon type of gold deposit. Long Canyon will use similar exploration techniques modified to fit the characteristics of the Spruce Ridge property which have fracturing/alteration similar to that of Long Canyon.
Spin-off companies from the original explorers of the Long Canyon discovery are exploring in the Wood Ridge range north of the Long Canyon claims, and south of the Long Canyon claims in the Spruce Ridge range. These spin-off companies are tied on or -adjacent to the northern and southern boundaries of the Long Canyon claims.
The southern company is Renaissance Gold Inc. which has an exploration agreement with Summit Mining Exploration 11, Inc. which is a US subsidiary of Sumitomo Corporation. A recent press release (06/11/2012) said they have already spent US $ 1.8 million on Spruce Mountain exploration and announced a second round budget US $ 1.7 m in additional expenditures for the project.
Miranda Gold has the east Spruce property which is to the southeast of the CanyonGold property and is immediately east of the RenGold/Sumitomo JV project.

The company to the north is NuLegacy Gold Corporation exploring their Wood Ridge South property optioned from RenaissanceGold Inc. They completed a series of geochemical and gravity surveys to guide two sets of drilling. NuLegacy's southern boundary is contiguous to CanyonGold's northern boundary. To the east of the NuLegacy ground between their holdings and the Long Canyon project is Agnico- Eagle.
Typical exploration methodology deployed for the Long Canyon variety of a Carlin type gold deposit is to identify major break in the shelf type Paleozoic carbonate sediments similar to Long Canyon that developed the complex fracturing and extensive faulting and semi Karsting dissolution channels and openings that are the conduits for the gold mineralization.
A combination of soil geochemistry, plus gravity, and Induced Polarization geophysical surveys is used to define highly fractured areas below the major faults where gold deposition occurs such as at Long Canyon.
The project is in northeastern Nevada in the basin and range topography where tensional displacement has caused large blocks of bedrock to be slightly pulled apart along northerly trending fault lines so that the blocks have been tilted to the east or the west thus forming longitudinal mountains separated by parallel valleys that have become filled with eroded sediments from the mountains. The Wood Ridge and the Spruce Mountain Ridge are the range immediately west of the Pequop Mountains. They are separated by the Independence Valley, and are construed by geologists to be part of the same Palaeozoic sediments that make up the Pequops where the major Long CanyonGold deposit was recently discovered.

The exploration philosophy used by the northern and southern gold exploration companies adjacent to the CanyonGold project is that they are looking for a similar set of geologic circumstances as found controlling the major Long Canyon discovery. The Long Canyon discovery is related to vertical faults that cut the shelf type sediments to allow ingress of surface water to lower layers of the Palaeozoic sequence to more soluble horizons where the water dissolved the more permeable layers causing a Karst type of collapse of the blocks that extended upwards through the sequence. Then hydrothermal fluids gained access to this complex of slump fault structures and deposited the precious metal mineralization. Often a deep seated intrusive is postulated as the source of the hydrothermal ore bearing fluids. In the case of the Long Canyon discovery Newmont Mines USA reports there is validity to explore for tens of millions of ounces of gold.
CanyonGold intends to use a similar exploration methodology and approach to explore their extensive claims. Preliminary rock samples have been collected and initial testing of drainage geochemical samples has occurred. Signs of mineralization, alteration and faulting with similar characteristics to the type of fracturing and alteration seen at the Long Canyon deposit have been discovered on the CanyonGold claims, but to this time have not yet been substantially explored.
CanyonGold plans to execute its Phase Two Exploration Program in Spring/Summer of 2015. This program may include geological mapping, geochemistry and geophysics in the form of Induced Polarization using Resistivity Mode, and selected areas of gravity surveys. This will be followed by selection of diamond drilling targets deploying reverse circulation technology.

Quoteboard data fields include:  Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session. Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram. Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session. Bid: The last bid price and bid size. Ask: The last ask price and ask size. Volume: The total number of shares or contracts traded in the current trading session. Average Volume: The average number of shares traded over the last 20 days. Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.  Chart Snapshot A thumbnail of a daily chart is provided, with a link to open and customize a full-sized chart.Barchart Technical Opinion The Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overally Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal." If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal." Business Summary Provides a general description of the business conducted by this company. Price Performance This section shows the Highs and Lows over the past 1, 3 and 12-Month periods. Click the "See More" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.Fundamentals For US Stocks, the Overview page includes key statistics on the stock's fundamentals, with a link to see more. Most Recent Earnings figures are based on Non-GAAP income from continuing operations. Market Cap: capitalization or market value of a stock is simply the market value of all outstanding shares. It is computed by multiplying the market price by the number of outstanding shares. For example, a publicly held company with 10 million shares outstanding that trade at $10 each would have a market capitalization of $100 million. Shares Outstanding: Common shares outstanding as reported by the company on the 10-Q or 10-K. P/E Ratio: Latest closing price divided by the earnings-per-share based on the Latest 12-Month EPS Change (LTM) of earnings. Companies with negative earnings receive an "NE." EPS: The basic annual EPS from total operations is the bottom line income after all expenses, divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. For example, if a company has $10 million in net income and 10 million in outstanding shares, then its EPS is $1. Beta: 36 Month Beta: Coefficient that measures the volatility of a stock's returns relative to the market (S&P 500). It is based on a 36-month historical regression of the return on the stock onto the return on the S&P 500. Earnings: The amount of latest Earnings Per Share (EPS) paid out to shareholders. Dividend Yield: A portion of a company's profit paid to shareholders, quoted as the dollar amount each share receives (dividends per share). Yield is the amount of dividends paid per share, divided by the closing price. Sectors: Links to the Industry Groups and/or SIC codes in which the stock is found.Support and Resistance This section shows a snapshot view of the Trader's Cheat Sheet with the Last Price, and four separate pivot points (2 Support Levels, and 2 Resistance Points). The Last Price shown is the last trade price at the time the quote page was displayed, and will not update every 10 seconds (as the Last Price at the top of the Quote page does). The Last Price will update only when the page is refreshed. Pivot points are used to identify intraday support, resistance and target levels. The pivot point and its support and resistance pairs are defined as follows, where H, L, C are the current day's high, low and close, respectively. Support and Resistance points are based on end-of-day prices and are intended for the current trading session if the market is open, or the next trading session if the market is closed.   Pivot Point: (P) = (H + L + C) / 3 First Resistance Level: (R1) = (2 * P) - L First Support Level: (S1) = (2 * P) - H Second Resistance Level: (R2) = P + (R1 - S1) Second Support Level: (S2) = P - (R1 - S1) Related ETFs Find exchange traded funds (ETFs) whose sector aligns with the same commodity grouping as the symbol you are viewing.

Corpkit always stays on the forefront of our industry.  From      Stocktracer, our corporate manager program, to our new E-Corpkit,      a corporate kit sent by email in an hour,  we give you the ability to      maximize your time and costs.  We offer complete corporate and LLC      kits by email, or you can order stock or member certificates,      corporate or LLC seals, or by-laws and operating agreements.  All      orders are processed promptly and you will be emailed with your      files "in an hour".  On the certificates we give you options, like      the ability to issue the shares to the investors, add corporate      seals, or office electronic signatures to the certificates to give      your certificates the "big board look" for a fraction of the price.       The best part about an E-Corpkit is that since we do not ship      anything there are no shipping costs.  If you still want the physical      parts of the kit, binder, seal etc., we can email what you want and      ship the balance. Please remember that if we do ship any of the kit,      regular kit and shipping prices would apply. 
 DISCLAIMER:
              Corpkit’s      intent in sending these files to you is to print the files once, and      not to print them multiple times. By agreeing, you will not print      these files more than once, and you must follow the rules governing      the issuing of these ownership certificates.  If you do not know the      legality or rules of issuing the enclosed files, please contact a      legal professional or anyone who is qualified to give you guidance      in the state that the company was formed.

Corpkit's 2 hour processing time is an estimate and no guarantee.      Processing time is based on orders received by us during normal work      hours. Due to the nature of the product, all E-Products are not      returnable for credit or refund.
ATTENTION:
All CorpKit emails are encrypted with SSL/TLS, the  same security used by all banks and online retailers.  All of our messages and products are  encrypted from our office to our email server using the best security available  during transmission. We cannot ensure that all email servers will deliver our  messages or products fully encrypted.  To  be sure your email is encrypted you should contact your email service provider  or systems administrator.  If your email  server is not encrypted, all messages and attachments will be in clear text  during transmission.  If you have any  concerns about security or do not feel comfortable about receiving  products through email, please order the products to be shipped on CD.

              Disclaimer: The 2 hour processing time is limited to the Basic E-Corpkit and  only during normal work hours:
              Monday - Friday: 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM EST. (Except closed holidays) 
              If the order is placed after 5:00PM, it will be processed next business day.
To print the E-Certificate, you will need a color printer to  get the full effect. For longevity we recommend using a color laser printer.
