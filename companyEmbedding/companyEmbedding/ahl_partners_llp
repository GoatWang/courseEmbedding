Man AHL – Unconventional and Unconstrained Thinking | Man AHL



















































SCIENCE. APPLIED TO FINANCE.

                                Just one example of our holistic approach to investing; allowing us to spot opportunities that others may overlook.                            



























Clients come first









We actively engage with our clients in a strategic partnership. We fundamentally believe that the risks of not sharing significantly exceed the risks of sharing.
As such, we establish an on-going dialogue with our investors and strive to exceed expectations by providing outstanding levels of client service and transparency.
We are passionate about our strategies and believe they can provide significant value to our clients over the long-term.
We are dedicated to delivering the optimal solution in everything we do, whether it is research, technology or trading based. 

















Any market, any model














We believe that no data-set, market or model is out of bounds. We are constantly looking for systematic trading opportunities across the globe and actively encourage our people to find alpha in new places.
The process that turns an idea into a trading strategy is a very systematic and measured one. We start with a large number of ideas and we need to work out which of these has the potential to produce sustainable returns for our investors.
We do that in a two-stage process. The first is simulation, where we take ideas, build strategies out of these ideas, and see how they would have behaved over a long period of time and through many different environments. If we are satisfied with this, we move to the second stage of the process where we paper trade the idea. We trade it live but on paper, so no money is used in the trading but we simulate live trading through the process of time to make sure that this strategy is robust during this live period.











Unconventional and unconstrained thinking







 

We bring a scientific, empirical mind-set to investing. We only trade ideas and theories that we can test and prove. We act on evidence and strive to model and understand all aspects of the investment universe. But we are not academic theorists. We are practical scientists who apply our knowledge to producing something of financial value.
Our unique partnership with the University of Oxford, the Oxford-Man Institute, highlights this.




The Oxford-Man Institute is a research institute which brings together faculty, post-docs and students who are interested in quantitative finance, particularly machine learning techniques and data analytics. Man AHL’s researchers work alongside OMI academics and this collaborative approach yields deep academic insight into practical commercial research.


 




 








State-of-the-art technology









We truly believe that state-of-the art quantitative trading strategies necessitate state-of-the art technology at all stages; from market data acquisition and initial research through to model implementation and trade execution. This primary focus enables our scientific models to move from concept through back-testing and into production trading with minimum overhead and maximum efficiency.
Having a common programming language and unified codebase promotes collaborative and stimulating working practices, where researchers and technologists naturally exchange ideas in an open environment. Our best-of-breed hardware, tools and software engineering practices ensure high levels of productivity, quality and the necessary agility to quickly meet the needs of a dynamic business.
In Execution technology, our core goal is to ensure best execution for our clients.  As we fundamentally consider that competition is key to this, we have multiple trading routes; AHL-developed algorithms, best-of-breed third-party algorithms and a manual trading desk.  We continually enforce rigorous competition between these routes to ensure we are always trading optimally.

Oxford-Man Institute









The Oxford-Man Institute ('OMI') is our unique collaboration with the University of Oxford. Over the last decade, the OMI, part of the university’s Department of Engineering Science, has been conducting pioneering research into quantitative finance, and now focuses primarily on machine learning techniques and data analytics.


We believe this initiative is strongly supportive of the ongoing evolution of our quantitative investment strategies. We are constantly being presented with new and expanding datasets and machine learning has a huge amount to offer in interpreting this information.
The OMI is part of the University of Oxford’s Department of Engineering Science. Located in the same building as Man AHL’s Oxford Research Lab, it provides us with a direct connection to cutting-edge machine learning research and allows for the fruitful cross-pollination of ideas between the investment and academic communities. Work done at the OMI in areas as seemingly unrelated to investment as galaxy classification and measurement of the height of tides, has directly contributed to our investment methodologies. We actively use machine learning techniques in our trading programmes and these have become a genuine value-adding approach for Man AHL’s clients.

Meet Our People









Many members of our team have experience in technology, mathematics, economics and science. However, these are not pre-requisites for building a fulfilling career at Man AHL. We have employees with backgrounds ranging from business to psychology, philosophy and literature as well as interests spanning martial arts, astrophysics, photography and graphic design.



CHARLIE, ASTROPHYSICIST
Junior Quantitative Developer, Msc in Astrophysics, Harvard-Smithsonian centre for Astrophysics, Asteroid: 5231 Beeson
“My interest in astrophysics began when I attended a ‘Space Camp’ at the age of 15. I went on to study the subject at university and took part in a scholarship exchange program at Harvard, where I had the opportunity to present at the 221st American Astrophysical Society. The discipline is more relevant to my work at Man AHL than people think. In both the astrophysics and financial worlds, coding can be used to apply automated statistical techniques to vast datasets, to produce conclusions that the human brain would struggle to compute."




PAUL-JAMES, ANIMATOR
Quantitative Analyst, Post-Doctoral Research Fellow, All Souls College, University of Oxford, PhD University of Paris 7, Part III Cambridge
“During university, I worked as an intern at Pixar, where I was part of a team developing monster animations involving plastic fluids and gels. You could definitely say that this work had similarities to my current role at Man AHL, where I use maths and computer science to model. Fundamentally, it’s the same type of problem, just with a different underlying object.”




DOMINIK, KENDO CHAMPION
Quantitative Developer, Doctorate in Engineering, RWTH Aachen University
"I have been practicing the Japanese martial art of Kendo since 1998 and have won first place in the 2016 and 2015 Bowden Cup (teams) and 2014 British Open (individuals). The fundamental skill behind the sport is being able to project future outcomes, selecting the most likely option based on this analysis. In a sense the sport has many parallels to my work at Man AHL, where I use similar practices to model risk scenarios. The analogy is not perfect; bamboo swords are obviously not part of my day job."





FRANCESCA, PART-TIME HISTORY OF ART STUDENT
Investment Specialist, Bsc (Hons) Mathematics, University of Edinburgh 
"I am currently studying part-time for a degree in History of Art, concentrating on European Art. My first degree was in Mathematics, so I wanted to explore something different, but the disciplines have more in common than I first expected. Evaluating facts from various sources of information, alongside the more quantitative training I received while studying maths, has been very applicable to my work at Man AHL."





GIULIANA, ROCK CLIMBER
Head of AHL Fixed Income, PhD in Mathematics, Politecnico di Milano, Recipient of Financial News “40 under 40” award
"I started rock climbing in 2009. There are three elements of the sport which hold particular appeal for me. The first is how the hard graft of the climb is rewarded with the ability to experience nature in a completely different way. Second, you are completely dependent on your team members to keep you safe, so it’s an incredible way to develop trust. Finally, climbing allows me to completely relax, as it demands so much concentration that I am unable to focus on anything else but the challenge in front of me."

Backtesting | Research | AHL


































































Backtesting

When evaluating a trading strategy, it is routine to discount the Sharpe ratio from a historical backtest. The reason is simple: there is inevitable data mining by both the researcher and by other researchers in the past. Our paper provides a statistical framework that systematically accounts for these multiple tests. We propose a method to determine the appropriate haircut for any given reported Sharpe ratio. We also provide a profit hurdle that any strategy needs to achieve in order to be deemed "significant".


                                    28 JUNE 2015

Introduction
A common practice in evaluating backtests of trading strategies is to discount the reported Sharpe ratios by 50%. There are good economic and statistical reasons for reducing the Sharpe ratios. The discount is a result of data mining. This mining may manifest itself by academic researchers searching for asset pricing factors to explain the behavior of equity returns or by researchers at firms that specialize in quantitative equity strategies trying to develop protable systematic strategies.
The 50% haircut is only a rule of thumb. The goal of our paper is to develop an analytical way to determine the magnitude of the haircut.
Our framework relies on the statistical concept of multiple testing. Suppose you have some new data, Y, and you propose that variable X explains Y. Your statistical analysis finds a significant relation between Y and X with a t-ratio of 2.0 which has a probability value of 0.05. We refer to this as a single test. Now consider the same researcher trying to explain Y with variables X1;X2,.....,X100. In this case, you cannot use the same criteria for significance. You expect by chance that some of these variables will produce t-ratios of 2.0 or higher. What is an appropriate cut-o for statistical significance?
In Harvey and Liu (HL, 2015), we present three approaches to multiple testing. We answer the question in the above example. The t-ratio is generally higher as the number of tests (or X variables) increases. Consider a summary of our method. Any given strategy produces a Sharpe ratio. We transform the Sharpe ratio into a t -ratio. Suppose that t-ratio is 3.0. While a t-ratio of 3.0 is highly significant in a single test, it may not be if we take multiple tests into account. We proceed to calculate a p-value that appropriately reflects multiple testing. To do this, we need to make an assumption on the number of previous tests.
For example, Harvey, Liu and Zhu (HLZ, 2015) document that at least 316 factors have been tested in the quest to explain the cross-sectional patterns in equity returns. Suppose the adjusted p-value is 0.05. We then calculate an adjusted t-ratio which, in this case, is 2.0. With this new t -ratio, we determine a new Sharpe ratio. The percentage difference between the original Sharpe ratio and the new Sharpe ratio is the "haircut".
The haircut Sharpe ratio that obtains as a result of multiple testing has the following interpretation. It is the Sharpe ratio that would have resulted from a single test, that is, a single measured correlation of Y and X.
We argue that it is a serious mistake to use the rule of thumb 50% haircut. Our results show that the multiple testing haircut is nonlinear. The highest Sharpe ratios are only moderately penalized while the marginal Sharpe ratios are heavily penalized.
This makes economic sense. The marginal Sharpe ratio strategies should be thrown out. The strategies with very high Sharpe ratios are probably true discoveries. In these cases, a 50% haircut is too punitive.
Our method does have a number of caveats { some of which apply to any use of the Sharpe ratio. First, high observed Sharpe ratios could be the results of non-normal returns, for instance an option-like strategy with high ex ante negative skew.
In this case, Sharpe ratios need to be viewed in the context of the skew. Dealing with these non-normalities is the subject of future research. Second, Sharpe ratios do not necessarily control for risk. That is, the volatility of the strategy may not reflect the true risk. Importantly, our method also applies to Information ratios which use residuals from factor models. Third, it is necessary in the multiple testing framework to take a stand on what qualifies as the appropriate significance level, e.g., is it 0.10 or 0.05? Fourth, a choice needs to made on the multiple testing method. We present results for three methods as well as the average of the methods. Finally, some judgment is needed specifying the number of tests.
Given choices (3)-(5), it is important to determine the robustness of the haircuts to changes in these inputs. We provide a program at: http://faculty.fuqua.duke.edu/charvey/backtesting that allows the user to vary the key parameters to investigate the impact on the haircuts. We also provide a program that determines the minimal level of protability for a trading strategy to be considered "significant".
