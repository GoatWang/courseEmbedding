Our History
 



 

Originated in 1925 by Raymond S. Mowery, the company began as a local residential and commercial construction company in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. The company’s ability to consistently deliver quality work quickly earned the organization a reputation for reliability.
By the late 1940s, Raymond Mowery was constructing large commercial projects throughout the state. In 1953, the company officially incorporated as R. S. Mowery & Sons, Inc. By 1963, Donald V. Mowery, Raymond’s son, was named president. After many years of successful leadership, he retired in 1989.
In 1984, Donald V.’s son, Donald H., became president of the company. David Cross, who joined the Mowery team in 2015 as President and COO, is now the current owner and President of Mowery.
Today, R. S. Mowery & Sons, Inc. offers construction management, general construction, design-build and special project services for major institutional, industrial and commercial projects. Specialties include industrial and distribution facilities, buildings for colleges and universities, senior care communities, office complexes and medical facilities, among others.
