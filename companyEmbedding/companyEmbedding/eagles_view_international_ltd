EagleView Technologies and Pictometry International Announce MergerJanuary 7, 2013Increased Scale, Diversification and Synergies in Imaging & Analytic Capabilities 
Expected to Drive Continuing Growth and Accelerate Innovation
BOTHELL, Wash., and ROCHESTER, NY, Jan. 7, 2013—EagleView® Technologies, the leading provider of automated 3D measurement technologies and analysis solutions and Pictometry® International, the leader in geo-referenced aerial image capture and visual-centric data analytics, jointly announced today that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement under which EagleView and Pictometry have combined their businesses into a single entity.  EagleView and Pictometry closed the transaction on January 7, 2013.
The merger creates a global leader providing unparalleled geo-referenced aerial imagery and analytical software solutions servicing both government and commercial customers.  The new entity will offer comprehensive and robust capabilities in aerial imagery collections, geospatial analytics and 3D measurement technologies. A more diversified revenue base, greater financial resources, advanced product capabilities and significant growth opportunities will reach across current industry segments – including local and regional government, insurance, energy and utilities and construction – as well as additional verticals.
Chris Barrow, EagleView’s chief executive officer, will lead the management team of the combined company as its president and chief executive officer, while Pictometry’s chief executive officer, Rick Hurwitz, will exit the business having worked closely with both companies in support of this transaction.  This fulfills his vision to develop Pictometry into an end-to-end solutions provider that derives actionable information from aerial images. The management team of the new company will draw on a talented group of executive leaders from both companies with the six-member board of directors comprised of three EagleView directors and three Pictometry directors.  The company will operate with offices in Bothell, Wash. and Rochester, NY while also maintaining satellite offices in other locations.
“Pictometry and EagleView each offer a highly valued set of solutions, which are excellent complements in the geo-referenced aerial imaging industry,” said Barrow. “In combining Pictometry’s world-class data and aerial image capture assets with EagleView’s remote measurement and analysis solutions, we are leveraging a portfolio of incredible technologies and world-class insights. This will create a compelling platform for continued strong growth and accelerating innovation. Now, with an even larger set of high-resolution imagery and unmatched data reports and services, we can offer more data, more compelling solutions and more value to our respective government and commercial clients, while also creating additional opportunities across multiple new market segments and geographic areas.”
“Bringing together the complementary talents and capabilities of these two category-defining companies represents a crowning step in Pictometry’s strategic evolution,” said Hurwitz.  “This merger creates an integrated company with greater scale and diversification that will afford tremendous upside to customers and shareholders.”
The two companies have combined pro forma revenues of over $100 million for calendar year 2012 and have experienced significant historical growth.  Given the highly complementary nature of each respective business, the new company expects the integration process to be seamless for customers as well as the vast majority of the employees of both companies.
Under the terms of the merger agreement, EagleView and Pictometry merged in a stock-for-stock merger-of-equals transaction pursuant to which both EagleView and Pictometry became wholly owned subsidiaries of a new entity.  As a result of this transaction, the former shareholders of EagleView and Pictometry will each hold approximately 50% of the outstanding capital stock of the combined company on a fully-diluted basis.  The merger was unanimously approved by the boards of directors of EagleView and Pictometry and was approved by the shareholders of both companies.  Allen & Company LLC acted as EagleView’s financial advisor, and DLA Piper acted as EagleView’s legal counsel.  Barnes & Thornburg LLP served as legal counsel to Pictometry.

Actual results may differ materially from historical results or those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of factors. For example, the merger involves the integration of two companies that have previously operated independently with principal offices in two distinct locations.  EagleView and Pictometry have conducted only limited planning regarding the integration of the two companies.  The combined company will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the two companies.  Delays in this process could adversely affect the combined company’s business, operations financial results and financial condition.  Even if EagleView and Pictometry were able to integrate our business operations successfully, there can be no assurance that this integration will result in the realization of the full benefits of synergies, cost savings, innovation and operational efficiencies that may be possible from this integration or that these benefits will be achieved witw4hin a reasonable period of time.  Some other factors include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties associated with our financial condition, our ability to sell our products and services, our ability to compete with competitors and the growth of the existing aerial imagery and analytical software solutions markets as well as the development and growth of new markets and geographic areas for the combined company’s products and services.

The EagleView PremiumReport™ delivers critical measurements, derived from high-resolution aerial imagery, for residential and commercial structures.
EagleView Reports benefit both residential and commercial roofing contractors, and there are EagleView products available for insurance claims adjusters as well.
Where other aerial roof measurement services rely on low-grade satellite imagery, our roof measurement products includes georeferenced, high-resolution aerial imagery captured at low altitudes from a top-down perspective as well as views from the north, south, east, and west.
EagleView PremiumReports include measurements for:

Roof length
Roof area
Roof pitch
Hips
Ridges
Valleys
Rakes
Eaves
Drip edges
Flashing
Step flashing
Parapet walls



EagleView creates 3D diagrams of the roof facets, giving contractors a much-needed top-down view of the job. 
With trusted EagleView measurements, roofers can quickly estimate the most profitable margins and reduce waste on each bid without ever having to climb onto a roof. The PremiumReport also includes a summary page with a waste calculation table, to give roofers all the information in one place. Fast, precise estimating helps roofing contractors save time and bid on more jobs, which can potentially lead to increases in sales revenue.
With a typical delivery time of 48 hours or fewer, the EagleView PremiumReport is a must-have resource on any residential or commercial roofing job.


 




How to order a PremiumReport:

PremiumReports for Residential Roofing Projects

 Sample Report
 



PremiumReports for Commercial Roofing Projects
In addition to the measurements for residential structures, PremiumReports for commercial multi-family homes and commercial buildings also include penetration measurements. The diagrams in the report are also available as DXF files for commercial contractor workflows using CAD systems.

ClaimsReady™ Reports
ClaimsReady™ Reports help insurance carriers and adjusters prepare precise estimates, drastically reduce supplementals, and close claims faster for increased customer satisfaction.
ClaimsReady Reports feature the information found in our PremiumReport, including aerial images of the property from the top down, north, south, east, and west; a 3D diagram of the roof; length, area, pitch, and notes diagrams, and a summary page with a waste calculation table. The included length diagram shows color-coded details and total line lengths for rafters, ridges, hips, valleys, rakes, eaves, flashing, and step flashing. Adding wall measurements is an option for this report as well.
 Sample Report
 


Additional reports available to supplement PremiumReport
WallReport™
For a residential roofing job, wall measurements are a helpful addition to purchase with the PremiumReport. The standard WallReport™ shows cutouts for windows and doors and can be ordered on its own.
WallsLite™ Report
The measurements in WallsLite™ Report only cover walls on residential structures, with no cutouts. WallsLite Reports can also be ordered as a standalone report.
GutterReport™
Available for both residential and commercial properties, GutterReport™ measurements are a useful add-on to PremiumReports to capture another layer of detail for more accuracy. Using the same imagery from our roof reports, we provide images of the property, eave measurements, and downspouts and miter counts. The GutterReport can also be ordered as a standalone report.
