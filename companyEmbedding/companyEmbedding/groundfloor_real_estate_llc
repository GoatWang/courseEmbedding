Groundfloor (styled all caps as GROUNDFLOOR) is an American real estate lending marketplace. It was the first real estate crowdfunding company to achieve SEC qualification utilizing Regulation A+ since the regulation became operable through the JOBS Act,[1][2] becoming the only such marketplace open to non-accredited investors.[3]
GROUNDFLOOR was purposely built to serve self-directed investors instead of institutional ones. Its marketplace provides short-term, high-yield returns backed by real estate. Typical loans return 12 percent annually on a six-to-12-month term. The minimum investment is $10.[1][4] By December 2015, the company had funded 54 loans and sold more than $3 million in securities. It also closed a $5 million Series A round, bringing its total financing to $7.5 million.[4]

History[edit]
GROUNDFLOOR was founded in Raleigh, North Carolina, in February 2013 by Brian Dally (who launched Republic Wireless) and Nick Bhargava (contributor to the JOBS Act).[5] In March 2014, the company raised $300,000 from angel investors in the region.[6] After raising $1 million in seed funding, GROUNDFLOOR moved its headquarters to Atlanta because of the Invest Georgia Exemption (IGE)[7] which allows state residents to invest in crowdfunded projects regardless of their investor accreditation status.[8][9]
A crucial breakthrough for the company came on 31 August 2015, when it became the first real estate crowdfunding company to achieve SEC qualification utilizing an amended Tier 1 Regulation A offering, better known as Regulation A+, since the regulation became operable through the JOBS Act on 19 June,[1] becoming the only such marketplace open to non-accredited investors.[3] The company opened investing in California, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Texas, Virginia, Washington, Georgia and the District of Columbia as a result of their SEC qualification in the fall of 2015.[10]
By late October, GROUNDFLOOR tripled daily investing volume and sold out every loan originally listed.[11] By December, the company had funded 54 loans and sold more than $3 million in Limited Recourse Obligation securities. It also closed a $5 million Series A round, bringing its total financing to $7.5 million.[4] The round was led by Fintech Ventures, a $100 million venture capital investment fund focused on innovation in non-bank lending, savings and smart payments, managed by Serguei Kouzmine.[3] GROUNDFLOOR announced it would use the money to expand its business beyond the present nine states where it operates.[12]
Platform[edit]
GROUNDFLOOR was purposely built to serve self-directed investors instead of institutional ones.[1] Its marketplace provides short-term, high-yield returns backed by real estate. Typical loans return 12 percent annually on a six-to-12-month term.[4] While investments on other platforms require a minimum investment of $5,000, with Groundfloor, the original minimum investment was $100.[6] In November 2015, GROUNDFLOOR 2.0 was introduced, reducing the minimum investment even further, to $10.[1]
The website enables borrowers to showcase their projects. There is an aggressive pre-screening process for borrowers. The site targets small residential-development projects.[13] If the project is selected for funding, community members can make loans to the borrowers. Groundfloor uses a proprietary loan grading algorithm in addition to application review to assign a loan a letter grade and corresponding rate. Loan terms generally range from six to 12 months and financing can be in a senior or junior position. At the loan maturation, the borrower repays GROUNDFLOOR, which in turn repays the investors their principal investment plus earned interest.[8][14]
Interest rates, which vary between 7 and 26 percent, are determined by an algorithm, based on criteria such as property valuation, location, the borrower’s experience and how much of their own capital the borrower is investing in the project.[15] The note structure is similar to Lending Club and Prosper. However, GROUNDFLOOR loans generally have shorter terms, higher interest rates and are secured by real estate.[1]
In October 2015, GROUNDFLOOR introduced two new tools that expand peer-to-peer lending of real estate: quick comparison of loans and in-depth analysis of loan grading factors. An automated investing tool, pending further development and SEC review and approval, will be the first automated tool available in peer-to-peer real estate lending.[11]

Groundfloor unveils 'Lending Club for real-estate' so you can get richer, faster (exclusive)

Rebecca Grant May 30, 2013 1:14 PM







Groundfloor wants to take power away from banks and put it in the hands of the people.
The startup is building a peer-to-peer platform that gives regular people opportunities to invest in real estate projects. It is emerging out of stealth mode today and opening up to private beta.
Founder Brian Dally describes it as a ‘Lending Club for real-estate.” Lending Club is an online community that connects people who need to borrow money with people to lend it to them, instead of going to a bank. It is on track to originate $2 billion in loans this year and Dally saw an opportunity to apply the same online model to larger asset classes. Real estate is a $3.5 trillion market and Groundfloor wants to help people of all wealth classes get their ‘financial dessert’ (hence the baking-a-pie picture above).
“If you are a big rich private equity investor, you can loan money to real estate projects and receive a high rate of interest, and when the project cashes out you get to share the upside of that,” he said in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat “This plays a role in the wealth disparity in this country — its part of the reason why the rich get richer. They can make investments in larger assets for higher returns. We want to give the average person the same chance.”
Real estate projects require a large amount of money to get off the ground. Ordinarily a developer will borrow money from a bank and seek out wealthy investors to bankroll the project. The developers then pay the money back with a high rate of interest and the investors get a share of the profits. Groundfloor crowd sources this investment by allowing anyone to contribute money, even as little as $100, to a project and receive higher interest than they would through low-yield savings accounts, 401k plans, CD’s etc…Developers can use Groundfloor to avoid dealing with bank requirements and jumping through hoops.
“Nobody likes banks,” Dally said. “They are driven by centuries of inertia and regulatory infrastructure. Banks behave the way they do because they have all this power and can do what they want, but the web is changing all that. It adds a layer of democracy and transparency in way that banks just can’t, and consumers are responding with their wallets. People are showing that they want alternative ways to use and grow their money.”
Many of those regulations are in place to safeguard investors from fraud and provide some insurance that they will be repaid. Groundfloor will address concerns over trust and security by running extensive background checks on every developer and verifying that they have the experience necessary to execute. The first project is for a multi-tenant building of lofts in a college town. The developer has 20 years of experience and has completed over 60 projects. Dally said once they see how this first campaign goes, they have a range of other projects queued up. Groundfloor will make money from the borrowers who will pay to use the platform for putting their offering together, market it, and manage repayment.
Dally previously worked at Republic Wireless, a company that challenged traditional wireless carriers with with “hybrid calling” that offered no-contract talk, text, and web access for just $19 a month. His cofounder Nick Bhargava founded crowd funding Motaavi and played a significant role in getting the JOBS Act signed. The two wanted to build a company together that would take power away from incumbents who weren’t using it well, and give it to the “average Joe.” Groundfloor is bootstrapped and based in Raleigh, North Carolina.

The Latest From Our Blog



























Announcing IRAs


June 16, 2017



The past few months have been busy for the team here at Groundfloor. We’ve been focused on improving the investor experience.  And we are pleased to announce the launch of the #1 most-requested product feature from Groundfloor investors - IRA investing.--- IRAs ---We are coming out of our alpha testing phase and are now rolling out the self-directed retirement accounts more broadly. The regulation of IRAs and 401k accounts can be complex, so it’s taken us some time to work out compliance kinks with our custodial account provider, IRA Services Trust. Based on our first round of learning with a handful of early adopters, our software team has now soft-launched a new, integrated IRA account setup wizard. To access it, click the new person icon that appears in the top right of your screen once you log in (or click the image below).









So far, we think it’s working pretty well for most people and for most account setup scenarios. Let us know what you think. You can click here for IRA FAQs, and we have specialized customer support to help and want to make sure all your questions are answered for what can be a complex process--but also a rewarding tax-advantaged one.IRA Special Offer:  As with most IRAs, there will be fees for IRA account maintenance.  We will waive these fees for life for our initial IRA investors who transfer and invest more than $10,000 in their IRA accounts by July 31, 2017.--- Other Developments ---More Loans.  Lots More.After a temporary slowdown, our legal team finally caught up with the lending team. We’re now offering more loans than ever. In May, for example, we were able to offer as many loans in one month (20) as we had year to date. That’s great news for investors. An internal analysis we recently produced shows how much increasing the number of loans in your portfolio can substantially reduce variations in expected returns and timely repayments. We’ll have that data ready to share soon. 

LOG IN & INVEST
Improved ReportingBased on investor feedback, we’re improving our bi-weekly loan updates and monthly statements. Loan updates now include a reminder of when you invested in each loan and when the loan is due for repayment, along with the most recent information on project progress. While you may notice we’ve also made a few tweaks to our monthly statements, a significant overhaul and redesign is underway. When it’s done, that will provide even more information about your Groundfloor portfolio and how it is performing.   We hope you will take advantage of these improvements and those to come. Our team thrives on customer feedback--positive and constructive alike. Feel free to comment here or email us at founders@groundfloor.us and we’ll be sure to respond and pass it along.All the best,Brian & NickGroundfloor Co-Founders





























Resolution of our Loan for 4626 Brooks St NE


June 12, 2017



Groundfloor aims to offer investors a full spectrum of risk adjusted returns; from 5.5% to almost 25%. As basic finance theory instructs, investment returns should increase as the risk of a given investment increases. This post illustrates the risk, and the results, of investing at the upper end of the yield spectrum by describing the performance of the loan on 4626 Brooks St., NE in Washington, DC. Priced to yield in excess of 23%, we are now reporting that we expect this loan to experience a significant principal loss. This is just our second loss out of over 100 loans repaid since we began lending over three years ago. While some losses are to be expected in any portfolio, we think losses are opportunities for self-examination on the part of our lending team, as well as our community of investors who build portfolios of loans with us. This loss, which is expected to total $65,900, will upon realization represent a 0.22% reduction in our overall portfolio performance since inception.We know most startups in the "real estate crowdfunding" market have shied away from this kind of transparency. Not at Groundfloor. We are still the first and only issuer of a direct real estate debt security that is publicly regulated by the Securities & Exchange Commission (public filings are available here), and the only one that is open to the non-accredited 95% of U.S. investors. We submit to a higher standard of public disclosure. When something goes wrong, we go beyond what we're required to disclose to share the details behind the numbers presented in our monthly performance filings.THE LOANGroundfloor’s $97,000 loan for 4626 Brooks St., NE was originated on January 11, 2016 to finance the on-going renovation and expansion of a single-family house. It is subordinate to a first mortgage loan from F & N Enterprises, LLC. The $145,000 first mortgage loan closed on January 27, 2015 to fund acquisition and renovation of the property. Repayment was expected through a sale of the property upon completion of construction.Groundfloor’s $97,000 was comprised of the following elements:Settlement Charges: $9,725.01Borrower Cash Out: $1,774.99Renovation Escrow: $85,000.00The total project capitalization ($254,000) consisted of:Borrower Equity: $12,000 (4.7%)First Mortgage: $145,000 (57.1%)Groundfloor Mortgage: $97,000 (38.2%)The $360,000 estimated After Repair Value (ARV) yielded an estimated leverage of 95.3% Loan-to-Cost (LTC) and 67.2% Loan-to-Value (LTV). Given the extremely high LTC, the loan was considered very high risk and was accordingly rated “F” on Groundfloor’s “A – G” scale.  The speculative nature of the loan was reflected in the 23.8% interest rate.OUR ASSET MANAGEMENT ACTIONS TO PREVENT LOSSOver the course of the project, Groundfloor disbursed 9 draws totaling $53,400, leaving a balance of $32,100 in escrow. We subsequently received notice that the borrower had encountered problems with structural systems and related permitting. Groundfloor promptly terminated further draw disbursements, met with the borrower and inspected the property. Subsequently, the borrower defaulted on the first mortgage. Groundfloor consulted local Washington, DC counsel to advise on various workout options and strategies to engage the first lien holder in a cooperative resolution. Groundfloor and the first lien holder engaged in negotiations to structure a resolution that could yield the maximum recovery. Valuation information obtained by Groundfloor, as well as the first mortgage holder, indicate there is insufficient value in the property to pay off both loans in full. In fact, there is insufficient value to satisfy the first mortgage holder’s full legal balance. Given the senior lien holder has first claim on the collateral until a full payoff is realized, it is clear Groundfloor has virtually no negotiating leverage.Ultimately, the lenders did not reach agreement, and the first lien holder notified Groundfloor this month of their intent to foreclose.  The foreclosure is scheduled for June 19, 2017. Groundfloor expects its second lien to be extinguished upon foreclosure by the first lien holder. The remaining escrow funds which we held pending completion of the construction will be returned to investors, net of our costs incurred to recover additional balances.SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONProjected Loan PerformanceLoan Amount: $97,000Undrawn funds in escrow (LIP): ($32,100)Recovery expenses: ($1,000)Net Recovery: $31,100Principal Loss: $65,900 (67.94%) Groundfloor was aware of the risks in the transaction and priced the loan accordingly. The risks were disclosed to investors. Nevertheless, we continuously strive to utilize negative experiences to improve our product. For example, we decided last year, well in advance of any problems with this loan, to discontinue offerings of junior lien loans. We hope to reintroduce them as we continue building loan volume. A larger number of available loans facilitates greater diversification of investor loan portfolios. It also makes concentration in higher risk offerings such as 4626 Brooks St less likely.Despite this loss, Groundfloor continues to deliver an outstanding value for investors. As the only path for non-accredited and accredited investors alike to participate directly in loans backed by real estate, we’re especially proud of the 12.78% annualized net return (including this loss) that we have generated for our investors on average through over 100 loans repaid to date. That's the net rate of return overall -- for all of our loans that have repaid so far, assuming an equal amount of investment in every one. How about second lien loans like 4626 Brooks? We've made 11 other loans in junior lien position. All of the others have already returned principal and interest in full. This loan is the only second lien loan that did not. That will be of little solace to investors who concentrated their investments with us in the one that didn't repay in full. But investors who diversified by investing an equal amount in all 12 of our second lien loans earned a net annualized return of 14.19% on that group of loans taken together. If there's a silver lining in this news, that is it. Second lien loans as a group delivered 1.41% more yield than the overall portfolio. That's a quantification of the reward for the additional risk.We appreciate the trust and faith of those who have been with us since the early days of our national expansion over 18 months ago. And we look forward to growing and welcoming many more investors in the year ahead. As always, whether you invest with us yet or not, we welcome your feedback, critical commentary and suggestions about this loan or any other topic below in the comments, or by email directly to me at rich@groundfloor.us or Brian and Nick at founders@groundfloor.us.





























Say Hello to Tax-Advantaged Real Estate Investing


March 21, 2017



We recently announced the availability of one of our most frequently requested features, the ability to invest in Groundfloor loans via self-directed Individual Retirement Accounts (“IRAs”). That’s exciting for two reasons.Reason #1: The ImpactFirst and foremost, opening up investing with Groundfloor via Individual Retirement Accounts is an important milestone toward fulfilling our purpose. Merrill Lynch and AgeWave recently found that one-third of Americans have nothing set aside for retirement, and another 23% have less than $10,000. You don’t have to be a financial advisor to know that's not enough.Why don’t people have more? It certainly isn’t for a lack of options. Many just don’t have the expertise to navigate public markets and don’t trust the intermediaries who would do it for them. Developing the discipline to save your money is hard, but it’s even harder for those who feel that investing is too complex or that the system is rigged against them.We started Groundfloor to solve those problems by taking private lending public. Our unique offering, the only one of its kind in real estate to be qualified by the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission, allows everyone to invest directly in private loans with attractive returns. For the first time ever, with Groundfloor you don’t need to be a wealthy accredited investor to participate and earn high yields on favorable terms. Accredited investors also appreciate that we offer the only publicly accessible and regulated way to participate with full disclosures and compliance behind it. There’s no fund manager taking a big chunk of your profits here. Our investors build their own portfolios. We make that as simple and fast (and profitable) as possible.Now, with the launch of our IRA investing, all of that goodness is available with the benefit of tax-advantaged retirement investing. We hope that for millions of people this will be refreshing, motivating and encouraging — enough to kick their retirement savings into high gear. This also means we can start solving a critical societal problem together, one do-it-yourself retirement portfolio of private real estate micro loans at a time.Reason #2: The ImplicationsSecond, we’re excited about this news today because of what it represents. Groundfloor has come a long way. Back when we started in 2014, we offered just 20 loans for $1 million over that first year. Two years later, in just one month (December), capping off a momentous 2016, we offered 40 loans for $4.5 million (that’s over four times as much in one twelfth the time).This is important because we didn’t build Groundfloor to funnel big dollar investments into meeting a funding goal for any particular loan, but to enable investors to build well-diversified portfolios within a given asset class. Our product and our operations have always been designed with this end in mind, and it’s working.Since increasing available loan volume, we’ve seen the average investment per loan decrease to $450 from over $1,000, but the average total investment per investor increase to $2,500 per month. We’ve cheered this development. Our original vision is well on its way to being realized. The volume of loans we’re now offering is ready to support retirement investing, with the bigger account balances and broader allocation that comes with it.How To Take PartThe administration of self-directed retirement accounts is complex. To help manage the process, we’ve partnered with IRA Services Trust Company as our first supported custodian. With 35 years of experience and the most advanced technology of all the alternatives we considered over the past year, we trust them to provide a reliable backbone for administering our investors’ most important assets.Starting today, we are gradually extending invitations to existing Groundfloor investors who complete this survey to indicate interest. Within 24 hours of announcing it, we already have hundreds of responses indicating many millions of dollars of interest. As expected, self-directed retirement investing is in high demand!Our first wave of participants will receive invitations this week. We’ll expand in the coming weeks as we continue to refine the investor experience and make process efficiencies to serve you well. We’re also working on increasing loan volume to accommodate the additional demand.In the meantime, we welcome questions, comments or feedback via the comments below or via email at founders@groundfloor.us. Whether you’re new to retirement investing and looking for a way to start, or eager to reallocate a portion of your existing holdings, we’re here to serve you. 





























Company Progress Report - February 2017


February 16, 2017



We’re often asked, “How’s Groundfloor doing as a company?” Looking back on 2016, we’ve prepared an infographic to answer that and provide some additional commentary that will help put the data into context. There’s never been a better time to be an investor or a borrower with Groundfloor. Having delivered on our promise of more loans in more places in 2016, we have big plans for 2017.





























Behind The Curtain - A Case Study Of How We Choose Our Loans And Principals


February 11, 2017



We go behind the curtain at Groundfloor, showing you how we decide on the two most important factors when making a loan decision: How we choose the principal ( the person behind the project) and how we choose the property. Let’s take a deeper look at both.

Groundfloor (styled all caps as GROUNDFLOOR) is an American real estate lending marketplace. It was the first real estate crowdfunding company to achieve SEC qualification utilizing Regulation A+ since the regulation became operable through the JOBS Act,[1][2] becoming the only such marketplace open to non-accredited investors.[3]
GROUNDFLOOR was purposely built to serve self-directed investors instead of institutional ones. Its marketplace provides short-term, high-yield returns backed by real estate. Typical loans return 12 percent annually on a six-to-12-month term. The minimum investment is $10.[1][4] By December 2015, the company had funded 54 loans and sold more than $3 million in securities. It also closed a $5 million Series A round, bringing its total financing to $7.5 million.[4]

History[edit]
GROUNDFLOOR was founded in Raleigh, North Carolina, in February 2013 by Brian Dally (who launched Republic Wireless) and Nick Bhargava (contributor to the JOBS Act).[5] In March 2014, the company raised $300,000 from angel investors in the region.[6] After raising $1 million in seed funding, GROUNDFLOOR moved its headquarters to Atlanta because of the Invest Georgia Exemption (IGE)[7] which allows state residents to invest in crowdfunded projects regardless of their investor accreditation status.[8][9]
A crucial breakthrough for the company came on 31 August 2015, when it became the first real estate crowdfunding company to achieve SEC qualification utilizing an amended Tier 1 Regulation A offering, better known as Regulation A+, since the regulation became operable through the JOBS Act on 19 June,[1] becoming the only such marketplace open to non-accredited investors.[3] The company opened investing in California, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Texas, Virginia, Washington, Georgia and the District of Columbia as a result of their SEC qualification in the fall of 2015.[10]
By late October, GROUNDFLOOR tripled daily investing volume and sold out every loan originally listed.[11] By December, the company had funded 54 loans and sold more than $3 million in Limited Recourse Obligation securities. It also closed a $5 million Series A round, bringing its total financing to $7.5 million.[4] The round was led by Fintech Ventures, a $100 million venture capital investment fund focused on innovation in non-bank lending, savings and smart payments, managed by Serguei Kouzmine.[3] GROUNDFLOOR announced it would use the money to expand its business beyond the present nine states where it operates.[12]
Platform[edit]
GROUNDFLOOR was purposely built to serve self-directed investors instead of institutional ones.[1] Its marketplace provides short-term, high-yield returns backed by real estate. Typical loans return 12 percent annually on a six-to-12-month term.[4] While investments on other platforms require a minimum investment of $5,000, with Groundfloor, the original minimum investment was $100.[6] In November 2015, GROUNDFLOOR 2.0 was introduced, reducing the minimum investment even further, to $10.[1]
The website enables borrowers to showcase their projects. There is an aggressive pre-screening process for borrowers. The site targets small residential-development projects.[13] If the project is selected for funding, community members can make loans to the borrowers. Groundfloor uses a proprietary loan grading algorithm in addition to application review to assign a loan a letter grade and corresponding rate. Loan terms generally range from six to 12 months and financing can be in a senior or junior position. At the loan maturation, the borrower repays GROUNDFLOOR, which in turn repays the investors their principal investment plus earned interest.[8][14]
Interest rates, which vary between 7 and 26 percent, are determined by an algorithm, based on criteria such as property valuation, location, the borrower’s experience and how much of their own capital the borrower is investing in the project.[15] The note structure is similar to Lending Club and Prosper. However, GROUNDFLOOR loans generally have shorter terms, higher interest rates and are secured by real estate.[1]
In October 2015, GROUNDFLOOR introduced two new tools that expand peer-to-peer lending of real estate: quick comparison of loans and in-depth analysis of loan grading factors. An automated investing tool, pending further development and SEC review and approval, will be the first automated tool available in peer-to-peer real estate lending.[11]

Groundfloor (styled all caps as GROUNDFLOOR) is an American real estate lending marketplace. It was the first real estate crowdfunding company to achieve SEC qualification utilizing Regulation A+ since the regulation became operable through the JOBS Act,[1][2] becoming the only such marketplace open to non-accredited investors.[3]
GROUNDFLOOR was purposely built to serve self-directed investors instead of institutional ones. Its marketplace provides short-term, high-yield returns backed by real estate. Typical loans return 12 percent annually on a six-to-12-month term. The minimum investment is $10.[1][4] By December 2015, the company had funded 54 loans and sold more than $3 million in securities. It also closed a $5 million Series A round, bringing its total financing to $7.5 million.[4]

History[edit]
GROUNDFLOOR was founded in Raleigh, North Carolina, in February 2013 by Brian Dally (who launched Republic Wireless) and Nick Bhargava (contributor to the JOBS Act).[5] In March 2014, the company raised $300,000 from angel investors in the region.[6] After raising $1 million in seed funding, GROUNDFLOOR moved its headquarters to Atlanta because of the Invest Georgia Exemption (IGE)[7] which allows state residents to invest in crowdfunded projects regardless of their investor accreditation status.[8][9]
A crucial breakthrough for the company came on 31 August 2015, when it became the first real estate crowdfunding company to achieve SEC qualification utilizing an amended Tier 1 Regulation A offering, better known as Regulation A+, since the regulation became operable through the JOBS Act on 19 June,[1] becoming the only such marketplace open to non-accredited investors.[3] The company opened investing in California, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Texas, Virginia, Washington, Georgia and the District of Columbia as a result of their SEC qualification in the fall of 2015.[10]
By late October, GROUNDFLOOR tripled daily investing volume and sold out every loan originally listed.[11] By December, the company had funded 54 loans and sold more than $3 million in Limited Recourse Obligation securities. It also closed a $5 million Series A round, bringing its total financing to $7.5 million.[4] The round was led by Fintech Ventures, a $100 million venture capital investment fund focused on innovation in non-bank lending, savings and smart payments, managed by Serguei Kouzmine.[3] GROUNDFLOOR announced it would use the money to expand its business beyond the present nine states where it operates.[12]
Platform[edit]
GROUNDFLOOR was purposely built to serve self-directed investors instead of institutional ones.[1] Its marketplace provides short-term, high-yield returns backed by real estate. Typical loans return 12 percent annually on a six-to-12-month term.[4] While investments on other platforms require a minimum investment of $5,000, with Groundfloor, the original minimum investment was $100.[6] In November 2015, GROUNDFLOOR 2.0 was introduced, reducing the minimum investment even further, to $10.[1]
The website enables borrowers to showcase their projects. There is an aggressive pre-screening process for borrowers. The site targets small residential-development projects.[13] If the project is selected for funding, community members can make loans to the borrowers. Groundfloor uses a proprietary loan grading algorithm in addition to application review to assign a loan a letter grade and corresponding rate. Loan terms generally range from six to 12 months and financing can be in a senior or junior position. At the loan maturation, the borrower repays GROUNDFLOOR, which in turn repays the investors their principal investment plus earned interest.[8][14]
Interest rates, which vary between 7 and 26 percent, are determined by an algorithm, based on criteria such as property valuation, location, the borrower’s experience and how much of their own capital the borrower is investing in the project.[15] The note structure is similar to Lending Club and Prosper. However, GROUNDFLOOR loans generally have shorter terms, higher interest rates and are secured by real estate.[1]
In October 2015, GROUNDFLOOR introduced two new tools that expand peer-to-peer lending of real estate: quick comparison of loans and in-depth analysis of loan grading factors. An automated investing tool, pending further development and SEC review and approval, will be the first automated tool available in peer-to-peer real estate lending.[11]

Groundfloor In The News



          "Closing the gap between the real estate investor and borrower through
          crowdfunding is what makes Groundfloor innovative"
          




          "“Developers ... have embraced the opportunity. They see it as a viable way to quickly raise cash for a project"
          







What Other Real Estate Investors Have to Say














Adam Ailion

              "My first GROUNDFLOOR project, which had 100% equity, was denied
              funding from a bank and a credit union since I owned the property
              for less than 6 months; I couldn’t even get a home equity line
              with my 740+ credit score! Thankfully Groundfloor arrived. The
              project funded relatively swiftly and the loan underwriting was
              timely and much smoother than what I’ve experienced at large
              banks. Loan servicing and post-closing support were also
              responsive and they were prompt to make payments on any
              construction draws."
              







Steve Brock

              "Groundfloor’s innovative approach to real estate financing is
              proving to be an effective way for us to keep pace with rising
              demand in our communities. I was blown away by how quickly and
              easily we were able to fund a project--it took less than 36 hours
              on our first deal."
              







John Mangham

              "We will defintely be using Groundfloor again. Groundfloor
              investors have become a meaningful part of our financing and
              business strategy. In addition to providing funds for our
              projects, we blieve that our cost of capital and fundraising
              timeline will decrease over time."

            loan between $50,000 - $250,000
          


            borrower operates under an active LLC or Corporation
          


            groundfloor will hold a senior lien position

ATLANTA, Nov. 11, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- GROUNDFLOOR, a progressive real estate crowdfunding startup, announces its launch into the Atlanta market with the opening of its pilot development project in Midtown.  Taking advantage of Georgia's innovative securities laws and the Invest Georgia Exemption, GROUNDFLOOR makes real estate investing accessible to all, regardless of net worth or income.  For the first time, unaccredited investors can profit from real estate opportunities by backing independent developers who choose to reach beyond the limitations of traditional bank financing.  
(Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20131024/CL03564LOGO )
With the pilot project opening to investments starting at $100 on November 20th 2013, GROUNDFLOOR seeks to change the status quo of real estate finance for the benefit of independent real estate entrepreneurs and investors who have the vision to back them. With the peer-to-peer funding facilitated by GROUNDFLOOR, investors earn uncommonly high rates of return, backed by real property as collateral, without the fees, restrictions, risks and black box complexities common to Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs).
"A new day has dawned for online investors and independent real estate entrepreneurs," says Brian Dally, co-founder and CEO of GROUNDFLOOR. "Secured lending has long been an engine of wealth creation for accredited investors and powerful financial institutions. The Web's decentralization of bank lending and bank power is undeniably entering an even more promising phase." 
For its pilot project, GROUNDFLOOR seeks to raise a total of $300,000 to fund two loans sponsored by real estate entrepreneur and Managing Principal of RPG Properties Pat Gilroy.  The loans will be used to refinance, renovate and lease a Midtown residential development and will be secured by the property until repaid with interest within a one-year term. Throughout the life of the loans, investors will be privy to confidential reports from the borrower on milestone achievements including construction progress and leasing performance.
"GROUNDFLOOR has created a refreshingly flexible way to finance real estate projects," says Gilroy. "This innovation unlocks a previously untapped source of capital and will enable us to take on more development projects in less time and with less risk than ever before."
For more information on GROUNDFLOOR and how to invest in the pilot project, please visit www.groundfloor.us.  For independent developers interested in working with GROUNDFLOOR, please submit projects for qualification at www.groundfloor.us/developers.  
About GROUNDFLOORBased in the North Carolina Triangle and launched in Atlanta, GROUNDFLOOR champions democracy, transparency, speed, efficiency and freedom as the path to building a new kind of finance. The company harnesses the breadth and scale of the Web to disrupt antiquated black-box models of financing asset-backed transactions. The innovative GROUNDFLOOR platform reduces dependence upon large financial institutions and accredited investors, while making direct real estate investing a viable addition to any savings and investment portfolio.

                  JOB DESCRIPTION
                
Startup Strategy & Operations: Assist the Chief Executive Officer in planning for and closing additional rounds of capital sufficient to develop and grow the company. Play a key role within senior management team to formulate strategy and manage operations.
Financial Operations: Develop, manage and evolve appropriate processes and controls for transactions to and from retail investors and borrowers. Properly account for transactions related to the origination and repayment of real estate loans. At scale, the operation will consist of tens of thousands of monthly transfers and hundreds of real estate transactions in 50 to 100 localities nationwide. Solutions must be tax compliant and efficient for highly scalable business operations.
Regulatory Compliance: In collaboration with the Executive Vice President of Legal & Regulatory Affairs, ensure compliance with relevant federal and state securities laws. We are currently qualifying an umbrella offering under Regulation A as one step along a more extensive regulatory roadmap. Our offering circular already exceeds 350 pages, including fully audited financials.

                  PRODUCT
                
GROUNDFLOOR takes private lending public. We offer access for non-accredited and accredited investors to participate directly in short-term commercial construction loans backed by residential property, hyper-fractionalized to $10, at yields of 5-26%.
Even for accredited investors, high minimum requirements for capital and expertise conspire with securities regulations to block the vast majority of investors from participating in the lucrative market for private lending in real estate. Leveraging our proprietary underwriting engine and innovative application of existing securities law, we solve the hunt for yield for over 250 million non-accredited investors in the U.S.
We are the only "crowdfunding" platform in real estate that offers 100% of its loans for participation by all.

                  WHY US?
                
At GROUNDFLOOR, we believe that the broadest, most inclusive capital markets win -- for its participants and for society at large -- for the same reasons, functioning in the same way that the Internet itself does. While "crowdfunding for real estate" is a hot market, we stand alone as the only platform open to participation by all, including non-accredited investors. We view ourselves as creating a consumer product in finance with the same scale of impact and implications as the online discount brokerage industry had when it arose in the 1980s and 1990s.
Our team has succeeded before together, creating and launching Republic Wireless, a highly successful wireless company, in 2010-12. Our investor group is strong, and very committed. It's not too late to have a big impact on the culture we're building. Join us!

Contagious passion and empathy for the customer, but the tenacity to ensure that we have a transparent, robust and appropriate lending policy.
Experience collaborating and planning with tools such as Atlassian's JIRA and Confluence, Desk.com, Hubspot and the like is a plus.
While we are not a hard money lender; experience as a hard money lender is highly desirable.
An opinion on traditional lending policies found in the market—what's good, what's bad and how/where technology might be able to improve and influence our lending policy in order to create the best possible experience for our borrowers.
Experience working on a fast­paced, highly­visible team; your work will have serious impact here.
Balance attention to detail with swift execution ­ we need to do things quickly, and we need to do them well. Balancing those can be challenging, and this should be a strength.
Experience with standard residential real estate laws and real estate loan closings will be a significant advantage.
Desire to grow and learn new things every day.

Bottom Line
You have to be ready to hustle! We move fast...done is better than perfect, and continual iteration is important. You must be ready and excited to learn on your feet and help build a growing business.

Analyze loan and borrower data to find trends, and untapped opportunities.
Provide a closed customer feedback loop that helps shape product and business strategy.
Assist the marketing team in variety of local marketing campaigns and activity.
You will immerse yourself in the local real estate market including, for example, meetups and forums in order to rapidly grow brand awareness and customer adoption for both borrowers and lenders.
Help establish a predictable, repeatable funnel and playbook to scale our other cities through developing and sharing best practices.
Identify strategic partnerships and alliances in your local market.

What You'll Need

Bachelor's degree.
7+ Years sales, product and/or marketing experience.
Experience working with or as any or all of the following: hard money lenders, residential GC's, residential real estate investors, residential real estate lenders, residential real estate brokers.
Excellent communication and relational skills.
Data-driven decision mentality and sound business judgment through strong analytical thinking.
Deep local knowledge of the Atlanta residential real estate market (or ability to develop quickly).
Creative solutions driven mindset, with a get it done attitude.
Killer networking skills with ability to make smart partnerships happen.
Entrepreneurial DNA, hunter mindset and the fearlessness of a honey badger.
Experience opening a new market.
Product Marketing.
Intermediate Microsoft and Google for Work tools including MS Excel (pivot tables, vlookups, etc.), MS Powerpoint, MS Word, Google Sheets, Google Docs and Google Slides.
The candidate ideally has a deep "rolodex" (especially in the real estate industry). Otherwise, they'll need to be a rockstar networker!

    What The Press Has To Say About Groundfloor
  


















        "Closing the gap between the real estate investor and borrower
        through crowdfunding is what makes Groundfloor innovative."
        






        "Groundfloor is unusual in that its mission opens real estate investing
        to the general population….The investment is secured by the real
        property, and there’s an aggressive pre-screening process for
        developers."
        






        "Groundfloor’s investors are regular Americans who partner with
        developers on 20 to 30 real estate projects over a six month period,
        investing on average $500 per project. They earn between a 5 percent
        and 16 percent return on their investment within six to 12 months….
        Investors run the gamut from retirees to professionals who want to
        invest in real estate part time."
        






        "Unlike several other real estate crowdfunding platforms that require a
        minimum investment of $5,000, Groundfloor asks for a minimum investment
        of only $10. Typical Groundfloor loans, which carry interest rates
        varying between 7 and 26 percent, return 12 percent annually on a
        six-to-12-month term…. Real estate crowdfunding opens up the potential
        for achieving high risk-adjusted yields that have traditionally remained
        the province of a very narrow sliver of privileged people…"
        






        "While most funds allow only “accredited” investors – those with at least
        $1 million net worth after their principal residence – a few like
        Groundfloor have modeled their business on more recent federal rules
        that allow non-accredited investors to play."
        






        "GROUNDFLOOR fills a void for real estate entrepreneurs...They provide short-term, high-yield returns backed by real estate to entrepreneurs who are often ignored by traditional lenders..."
        






        "Developers…have embraced the opportunity.  They see it as a viable way
        to quickly raise cash for a project."
        






        "'It was a nightmare working with banks,' Costanzo said. 'It was
        bureaucratic and tedious.' Costanzo then reached out to Groundfloor….
        Groundfloor allows developers, homebuilders and remodelers like Costanzo
        to crowdfund money from online investors across the U.S. — similar to
        how startups raise funds on Kickstarter to manufacture new products.
        Within a couple of weeks, Costanzo, a former wealth manager, raised
        $100,000 from 130 investors through Groundfloor….'They just make it
        happen,' Costanzo said. “It seems more efficient and faster than a bank."

What Other Real Estate Investors Have To Say








Nick BorthReal Estate Investor

            I decided to invest in GROUNDFLOOR because it gives me the
            ability to invest & make money in the rebounding housing
            market, without the large-scale capital requirements, time
            requirement, and managerial overhead of being a direct real
            estate investor and developer. Groundfloor allows you to take
            part with a relatively low cost of entry. Further, I like
            being able to understand how the
            funds will be spent, and who will be spending them…. The
            return is attractive, and the investment terms are short
            enough to where you don’t have to be without the liquidity for
            too long.
            







Adam AilionReal Estate Developer

            "My first GROUNDFLOOR project, which had 100% equity, was denied
            funding from a bank and a credit union since I owned the property
            for less than 6 months; I couldn’t even get a home equity line
            with my 740+ credit score! Thankfully Groundfloor arrived. The
            project funded relatively swiftly and the loan underwriting was
            timely and much smoother than what I’ve experienced at large
            banks. Loan servicing and post-closing support were also
            responsive and they were prompt to make payments on any
            construction draws."
            







Alex HillReal Estate Investor

            Groundfloor makes investing in real estate a simple process.
            With a minimum investment size of $10 per project, it is easy
            for me to diversify my capital investment, while being able to
            quickly filter through project options to find what best fits
            my strategy. The process of investing through Groundfloor has
            been very smooth, and I look forward to enjoying continued
            investments and returns in the future. I would definitely
            recommend the Groundfloor platforms to anyone looking to
            invest in real estate assets or make a superior return on
            their capital.
            







Steve BrockReal Estate Developer

            "Groundfloor’s innovative approach to real estate financing is
            proving to be an effective way for us to keep pace with rising
            demand in our communities. I was blown away by how quickly and
            easily we were able to fund a project--it took less than 36 hours
            on our first deal."
            







Dan CooperReal Estate Investor

            I like having the ability to invest in real estate without
            having to make either a massive commitment to a single
            property or trust a vague portfolio of properties selected by
            someone else.
            







John ManghamReal Estate Developer

            "We will defintely be using Groundfloor again. Groundfloor
            investors have become a meaningful part of our financing and
            business strategy. In addition to providing funds for our
            projects, we blieve that our cost of capital and fundraising
            timeline will decrease over time."

Real estate lending marketplace Groundfloor has raised $5 million in Series A funding. Fintech Ventures led the round.
PRESS RELEASE
ATLANTA–(BUSINESS WIRE)–GROUNDFLOOR, the first and only real estate lending marketplace open to non-accredited investors, today announced that the company has closed a $5 million Series A round led by Fintech Ventures. Previous investors also participated in the round, bringing the company’s total financing to $7.5 million to date.
On the heels of a recent product release, the company plans to use the new funds to scale lending operations and fuel nationwide expansion. The marketplace is now operating in nine jurisdictions nationwide and growing at a rapid pace. Since opening its limited, invite-only release following qualification by the SEC on August 31,
GROUNDFLOOR has doubled its investor base. The company has funded 54 loans and sold over $3 million in Limited Recourse Obligation securities to date.
The new capital will be deployed to support new lending-operations hires in strategic regions, develop new investor tools, and continue advancing GROUNDFLOOR’s innovative regulatory roadmap for the benefit of all self-directed investors.
“As we frequently say, the source of capital matters,” said Brian Dally, CEO and co-founder. “That’s as true in building emerging companies as it is in building more efficient, more accessible capital markets. We’re fortunate to have a resourceful investor with global perspective backing us.” 





Fintech Ventures Fund is a new early-stage venture fund led by Serguei Kouzmine, a seasoned entrepreneur and senior executive with 20 years of experience building high-tech financial businesses. The fund announced today that GROUNDFLOOR is their initial investment out of a new $100 million fund that was raised earlier this year.
The fund is strategically headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia and focused on non-banking lending/savings products and smart payment systems worldwide.
“We’re bullish on GROUNDFLOOR because they are delivering a new, mass-market financial product to an untapped investor class,” said Serguei Kouzmine, managing director, Fintech Ventures Fund. “The Fintech market is a global phenomenon, which reaches far beyond both Silicon Valley and the United States; therefore, people should not be surprised that innovation in this market comes from many corners, and Atlanta is one of the hottest.”
“The investment from Fintech will accelerate every facet of our business,” said Nick Bhargava, EVP and co-founder, GROUNDFLOOR. “We’re on a mission to establish a new and better option for household capital formation by opening the $70 billion private real estate lending market to everyone. This round is a critical milestone on that path.”

    What The Press Has To Say About Groundfloor
  


















        "Closing the gap between the real estate investor and borrower
        through crowdfunding is what makes Groundfloor innovative."
        






        "Groundfloor is unusual in that its mission opens real estate investing
        to the general population….The investment is secured by the real
        property, and there’s an aggressive pre-screening process for
        developers."
        






        "Groundfloor’s investors are regular Americans who partner with
        developers on 20 to 30 real estate projects over a six month period,
        investing on average $500 per project. They earn between a 5 percent
        and 16 percent return on their investment within six to 12 months….
        Investors run the gamut from retirees to professionals who want to
        invest in real estate part time."
        






        "Unlike several other real estate crowdfunding platforms that require a
        minimum investment of $5,000, Groundfloor asks for a minimum investment
        of only $10. Typical Groundfloor loans, which carry interest rates
        varying between 7 and 26 percent, return 12 percent annually on a
        six-to-12-month term…. Real estate crowdfunding opens up the potential
        for achieving high risk-adjusted yields that have traditionally remained
        the province of a very narrow sliver of privileged people…"
        






        "While most funds allow only “accredited” investors – those with at least
        $1 million net worth after their principal residence – a few like
        Groundfloor have modeled their business on more recent federal rules
        that allow non-accredited investors to play."
        






        "GROUNDFLOOR fills a void for real estate entrepreneurs...They provide short-term, high-yield returns backed by real estate to entrepreneurs who are often ignored by traditional lenders..."
        






        "Developers…have embraced the opportunity.  They see it as a viable way
        to quickly raise cash for a project."
        






        "'It was a nightmare working with banks,' Costanzo said. 'It was
        bureaucratic and tedious.' Costanzo then reached out to Groundfloor….
        Groundfloor allows developers, homebuilders and remodelers like Costanzo
        to crowdfund money from online investors across the U.S. — similar to
        how startups raise funds on Kickstarter to manufacture new products.
        Within a couple of weeks, Costanzo, a former wealth manager, raised
        $100,000 from 130 investors through Groundfloor….'They just make it
        happen,' Costanzo said. “It seems more efficient and faster than a bank."

What Other Real Estate Investors Have To Say








Nick BorthReal Estate Investor

            I decided to invest in GROUNDFLOOR because it gives me the
            ability to invest & make money in the rebounding housing
            market, without the large-scale capital requirements, time
            requirement, and managerial overhead of being a direct real
            estate investor and developer. Groundfloor allows you to take
            part with a relatively low cost of entry. Further, I like
            being able to understand how the
            funds will be spent, and who will be spending them…. The
            return is attractive, and the investment terms are short
            enough to where you don’t have to be without the liquidity for
            too long.
            







Adam AilionReal Estate Developer

            "My first GROUNDFLOOR project, which had 100% equity, was denied
            funding from a bank and a credit union since I owned the property
            for less than 6 months; I couldn’t even get a home equity line
            with my 740+ credit score! Thankfully Groundfloor arrived. The
            project funded relatively swiftly and the loan underwriting was
            timely and much smoother than what I’ve experienced at large
            banks. Loan servicing and post-closing support were also
            responsive and they were prompt to make payments on any
            construction draws."
            







Alex HillReal Estate Investor

            Groundfloor makes investing in real estate a simple process.
            With a minimum investment size of $10 per project, it is easy
            for me to diversify my capital investment, while being able to
            quickly filter through project options to find what best fits
            my strategy. The process of investing through Groundfloor has
            been very smooth, and I look forward to enjoying continued
            investments and returns in the future. I would definitely
            recommend the Groundfloor platforms to anyone looking to
            invest in real estate assets or make a superior return on
            their capital.
            







Steve BrockReal Estate Developer

            "Groundfloor’s innovative approach to real estate financing is
            proving to be an effective way for us to keep pace with rising
            demand in our communities. I was blown away by how quickly and
            easily we were able to fund a project--it took less than 36 hours
            on our first deal."
            







Dan CooperReal Estate Investor

            I like having the ability to invest in real estate without
            having to make either a massive commitment to a single
            property or trust a vague portfolio of properties selected by
            someone else.
            







John ManghamReal Estate Developer

            "We will defintely be using Groundfloor again. Groundfloor
            investors have become a meaningful part of our financing and
            business strategy. In addition to providing funds for our
            projects, we blieve that our cost of capital and fundraising
            timeline will decrease over time."
