Types of Investments — ETFs

 What they are
Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are investment companies that typically track the yield and return of an index, such as the S&P 500, the Dow Jones or the Russell 2000. They are traded like individual stocks on a stock exchange, meaning the price can change throughout the day — unlike a mutual fund, the shares of which are sold once a day at net asset value (NAV) (generally 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time).

How they work
An ETF is a basket of securities that trades like a stock.  The fund offers and issues its shares at their NAV only in aggregations of a specified number of shares known as “creation units”.  Shares are then bought and sold intraday at market price unlike a mutual fund whose shares are sold once a day at NAV (generally 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time).  As a shareholder, you won’t directly own nor have any direct claim to the ETFs’ investments, but you’re entitled to a portion of the profits. Often those profits are earned interest or paid in regular dividends.
Because ETFs are traded on public stock exchanges, an ETF’s ownership can easily be bought, sold, or transferred.
Advantages and disadvantages
Like most investments, there are advantages and disadvantages to investing in ETFs.
Advantages
By owning an ETF, investors get the characteristics of both stocks and mutual funds in a combined investment vehicle with some added buying and selling flexibility.

Trading flexibility. Because ETFs are traded like stocks on stock exchanges, they can be bought or sold throughout the trading day and investors can take advantage of price fluctuations.
Diversification. Investors get the benefits of diversification, much like mutual funds. One ETF can invest in hundreds or thousands of stocks or bonds in a single fund.
Lower fees. ETFs are generally passively managed.  Thus, the fees for many ETFs are lower than those of the average mutual fund.
Low investment minimums. Many mutual funds have minimum investment requirements of $2,500 or more. ETFs, on the other hand, can be purchased for as little as the price of one share.
Tax advantages. ETFs continuously offer and sell shares through a daily in-kind purchase-and-sales process to authorized participants and not to investors.  As a result, the ETF does not incur tax when securities are sold and investors do not incur capital gains taxes until they sell their shares.
Transparency. Typically, ETFs disclose their holdings to the public every day.  This enables investors to observe the fund’s share price and underlying value and attempt to profit from the discrepancy between the two.

Disadvantages

Trading costs. ETFs are bought and sold at market price which may differ significantly from the ETF’s NAV and are not individually redeemed from the fund.  Only “authorized participants” can purchase and redeem directly in the funds creation units, typically consisting of a block of 50,000 shares.  Since ETFs are traded on an exchange they are bought and sold through a brokerage account anytime during exchange hours.  An investor purchasing or selling shares in an ETF typically pays a brokerage commission on each transaction which can vary and which could reduce the investor’s returns.  Additional trading-related costs such as spread costs and premiums/discounts can also be incurred when transacting in an ETF. The spread is the difference between the price an ETF is offered for purchase and the price an ETF can be sold.  The premium/discount is when the ETF trades at a price higher (premium) or lower (discount) than the fund’s NAV.
Potentially higher fees. Not all ETFs are low cost. Actively managed ETFs generally have higher fees than passively managed ETFs. Make sure you look carefully at the fees of the specific ETF you’re interested in.
Price swings. Stock markets can be volatile, and price swings can be frequent — which means your ETFs, like mutual funds, could lose all or a substantial amount of value in a very short time.
Not guaranteed. Like mutual funds, ETFs are not guaranteed to return anything to an investor.

Types
Only available in the U.S. since 1993, ETFs have grown to be the most popular type of exchange-traded product.  By the end of 2015, approximately 1,800 ETFs addressed a broad array of market sectors and trading strategies, including index, stock, bond, commodity, and currency ETFs. While index ETFs are most numerous, actively managed ETFs have been available in the U.S. since 2008.
Diversify to avoid risk
A typical investing mistake is to concentrate a large percentage of your money into one investing type. To reduce risk, many investors diversify — which means they spread their investment dollars strategically among different assets and asset categories. Here are 3 ways to diversify.

Risk Considerations: All investing involves some degree of risk, whether it is associated with market volatility, purchasing power or a specific security. There is no assurance any investment strategy will be successful or that a fund will meet its investment objectives. ETFs are subject to risks similar to those of stocks. Investment returns may fluctuate and are subject to market volatility, so that an investor’s shares, when redeemed or sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. ETFs seek investment results that, before expenses, generally correspond to the price and yield of a particular index. There is no assurance that the price and yield performance of the index can be fully matched.  ETFs that focus on a particular sector, country, region, theme or idea may be subject to increased risk of price fluctuation over more diversified holdings due to adverse developments which can affect a particular sector country, region or industry. Shares of ETFs are bought and sold at market price which may differ significantly from the ETF’s NAV and are not individually redeemed from the fund.  Only “authorized participants” can purchase and redeem directly in the fund’s creation units, typically consisting of a block of 50,000 shares.  Ordinary brokerage commissions for purchases and sales may apply which could reduce returns.

Should I Buy Exchange Traded Funds?


Straight talk on a popular investment option



 
								 
									Print
								
						 






Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) are rapidly growing in popularity, with more than 1,500 ETFs trading in the U.S. alone and assets of nearly $2 trillion. Despite ETFs’ popularity, you might still be unclear about what they really are — and whether they’re right for your portfolio. Here are some facts about and features of this investment vehicle that is creating such buzz.
What is an ETF?
Exchange Traded funds (ETFs) at their core are securities which derive their value from a basket of securities such as stocks, bonds, commodities or indices, and are traded similar to individual stocks on an exchange. When you purchase an ETF, you are purchasing shares of the overall portfolio, not the actual shares of the underlying investments or index components. ETFs can track a wide variety of sector-specific, country-specific and broad-market indexes. ETFs may provide diversification to your overall portfolio because one share or one unit may represent multiple underlying stocks, bonds and/or other asset classes.
Why are ETFs so popular now?
Although they have existed since the early 1990s, there are now so many ETF choices that individual investors have direct access to specialty markets that were once cost-prohibitive and accessible only to institutional investors. The broad range of ETFs that exist today empowers investors to take part in any corner of any market at any given time without requiring a large upfront investment. Reform in 2008 enabled the creation of actively managed ETFs in addition to the passive ETFs linked to indexes.
Who should invest in an ETF?
Cost-effectiveness may be a key benefit of an ETF, particularly if you meet any or all of these criteria:

You use a discount broker or an online broker such as WellsTrade
You invest a large lump sum
You invest for the long term

Because ETFs are traded on an exchange, transactions occur directly with investors, leading to less overhead and a lower expense ratio. If your investment strategy doesn’t meet some of the criteria above, ETFs may not deliver an advantage.
ETFs and Your Risk Tolerance
Unlike mutual funds, which assign pricing based on end-of-day net asset value, the price of an ETF changes throughout the trading day. ETFs are priced and can be purchased and sold throughout the trading day, which may give the investor some flexibility and control over the price they pay or receive when buying or selling shares. Furthermore, you can buy or sell ETF shares on a stock exchange much like the purchase or sale of any other listed stock.
Exchange Traded Funds are also subject to risks similar to those of stocks. Investment returns may fluctuate and are subject to market volatility, so that an investor's shares, when redeemed or sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
Sound investment strategies help you manage your risk and costs as well as consider how the various investment tools in your portfolio contribute to long-term financial goals. Meet with your Financial Advisor to discuss whether an ETF is an appropriate investment to add to your portfolio.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
