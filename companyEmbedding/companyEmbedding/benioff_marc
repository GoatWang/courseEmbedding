Marc Russell Benioff (born September 25, 1964) is an American internet entrepreneur, author and philanthropist. He is the founder, chairman and CEO of Salesforce, a large enterprise cloud computing company.[2] As of March 2016, he owns approximately $3 billion worth of Salesforce shares.[3] Benioff started Salesforce in March 1999 in a rented San Francisco apartment and defined its mission in a marketing statement as “The End of Software”.[4]
Benioff has long evangelized software as a service as the model that would replace traditional enterprise software. He is the creator of the term “platform as a service” and has extended Salesforce’s reach by allowing customers to build their own applications on the company’s architecture, or in the Salesforce cloud.[5]
Benioff is a noted philanthropist. In 2000, he established the “1-1-1 model,” whereby the company contributes one percent of product, one percent of equity, and one percent of employee hours back to the communities it serves globally.[6] As of March 2016, Salesforce.org has delivered more than $115 million in grants, 1.3 million employee volunteer hours and powered 28,000 nonprofits with Salesforce technology.[7] More than 700 companies have adopted the 1-1-1 model through the Pledge 1% movement.[8] Benioff and his wife, Lynne, have focused their personal philanthropy on improving public education and advancing children’s health care through UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital.[9][10]
As CEO of Salesforce, he has used his platform to take on social causes such equal pay for women,[11] as well as leading efforts by business leaders to publicly oppose legislation in Indiana[12] and Georgia[13] that would allow discrimination against LGBT communities.
He is the author of three books, including the national best seller, Behind the Cloud.[14]

Early life and education[edit]
Benioff was raised in a Jewish family[15][16] in the San Francisco metropolitan area.[17] He graduated from Burlingame High School in 1982.[18] Benioff received a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration from the University of Southern California in 1986, where he was a member of the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity.[19] [20]
Career[edit]
While still in high school Benioff sold his first application, How to Juggle, for $75. At 15 he founded Liberty Software, creating and selling games for the Atari 8-bit computer among others.[21][22] Epyx published his King Arthur's Heir, The Nightmare, Escape from Vulcan's Isle, and Crypt of the Undead,[23][24] and by 16 Benioff was earning royalties of $1,500 a month, enough to pay for college.[22] During his time at USC he had internships as an assembly language programmer at the Macintosh division of Apple Computer, where he was inspired by the company and its co-founder, Steve Jobs.[25]
Benioff expected to continue programming after college, but USC professors advised him to obtain customer-oriented work experience and Benioff joined Oracle Corporation after graduation in a customer-service role.[22] Prior to founding Salesforce, he was at Oracle for 13 years in a variety of executive positions in sales, marketing, and product development. At 23, he was named Oracle's Rookie of the Year and three years later he was promoted to vice president, the company's youngest person to hold that title.[26]
Influence and honors[edit]
Benioff has been widely recognized for his visionary leadership and pioneering innovations. In 2016, he was named one of Fortune’s 50 World’s Greatest Leaders for his commitment to equality for all and other social issues as CEO.[27] He was also named Businessperson of the Year by Fortune readers,[28] one of the Best CEOs in the World by Barron’s,[29] and he received The Economist’s Innovation Award.[30] He served as co-chairman of the President’s Information Technology Advisory Committee from 2003–2005. Benioff is also a member of the World Economic Forum Board of Trustees.[31]
Salesforce has been named one of the World’s Most Innovative Companies five years in a row by Forbes Magazine.[32][33][34][35][36] Fortune Magazine named Salesforce as the World’s Most Admired Company in the software industry four years in a row,[37] and named the company a Best Place to Work eight years in a row.[38]
Benioff received an honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters from the University of Southern California on May 16, 2014.[39]
On March 17, 2017, Benioff was included in a business leaders' symposium organized by the Trump Administration during German Chancellor Angela Merkel's visit to the White House.[40]
Philanthropy[edit]
Benioff created the 1-1-1 model of integrated corporate philanthropy, by which companies contribute 1 percent of equity, 1 percent of employee hours and 1 percent of product back to the communities it serves.[41] Parts of this 1-1-1 model have been adopted by more than 700 companies,[42] including Google.[43] In 2005, the members of the World Economic Forum named him as one of its Young Global Leaders.[44] In 2007, the Committee Encouraging Corporate Philanthropy presented Benioff with the Excellence in Corporate Philanthropy Award [45] and in 2008 invited him to become a director of the board.[46]
In June 2010, Marc Benioff and his wife Lynne announced a $100 million gift to UCSF Children's Hospital with the goal of not only seeing the new hospital built but significantly advancing children's healthcare worldwide.[47] The Benioffs have been recognized as top philanthropists by Forbes' America's 50 Top Giver list in 2015[48] and the Chronicle of Philanthropy's Philanthropy 50 list in 2010,[49] 2014 [50] and 2015.[51]
In 2014, Marc and Lynne Benioff donated another $100 million to UCSF and Oakland Children's Hospital (both now called Benioff Children's Hospitals).[52] Marc and Lynne Benioff have also donated to The Ocean Cleanup, a non-profit organization developing technologies to rid the world's oceans of plastic[53].
Benioff credits Mata Amritanandamayi with inspiring his philanthropic business models, stating "But the most pivotal meeting for me was with Mata Amritanandamayi... It was she who introduced me to the idea, and possibility, of giving back to the world while pursuing my career ambitions. I realized that I didn't have to make a choice between doing business and doing good. I could align these two values and strive to succeed at both simultaneously."[54]
Platform for change[edit]
Benioff has said that businesses are the greatest platforms for change in the world. He follows the World Economic Forum founder Klaus Schwab’s multistakeholder approach to leadership, which says that leaders should serve not only their shareholders but all stakeholders, including customers, employees, partners, communities and the environment, to make the world a better place.[55]
In March 2015, Benioff announced Salesforce would cancel all employee programs and travel in the state of Indiana after the passing of SB 101, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a controversial bill which would allow companies and individuals to deny service to LGBT individuals based on religious beliefs.[56] As the largest tech employer in Indiana (following the 2013 acquisition of ExactTarget) Benioff led a global effort of business leaders fighting back against the legislation, ultimately leading to the Indiana State Legislature passing an amendment to the bill containing protections for LGBT customers, tenants and employees.[57]
Benioff led a similar movement in February 2016 against Georgia’s HB 757, the First Amendment Defense Act. He announced that Salesforce would reduce investments in Georgia and cancel an annual conference if the bill was passed as-is.[58] A month later, the Governor vetoed the bill.[59]
In April 2015, Benioff announced that he would be reviewing all salaries at Salesforce to ensure men and women were being paid equally for comparable work.[60] On the heels of the salary assessment, Benioff joined President Barack Obama in January 2016 as he celebrated the anniversary of the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and renewed his call on Congress to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act.[61]

Early life and education[edit]
Benioff was raised in a Jewish family[15][16] in the San Francisco metropolitan area.[17] He graduated from Burlingame High School in 1982.[18] Benioff received a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration from the University of Southern California in 1986, where he was a member of the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity.[19] [20]
Career[edit]
While still in high school Benioff sold his first application, How to Juggle, for $75. At 15 he founded Liberty Software, creating and selling games for the Atari 8-bit computer among others.[21][22] Epyx published his King Arthur's Heir, The Nightmare, Escape from Vulcan's Isle, and Crypt of the Undead,[23][24] and by 16 Benioff was earning royalties of $1,500 a month, enough to pay for college.[22] During his time at USC he had internships as an assembly language programmer at the Macintosh division of Apple Computer, where he was inspired by the company and its co-founder, Steve Jobs.[25]
Benioff expected to continue programming after college, but USC professors advised him to obtain customer-oriented work experience and Benioff joined Oracle Corporation after graduation in a customer-service role.[22] Prior to founding Salesforce, he was at Oracle for 13 years in a variety of executive positions in sales, marketing, and product development. At 23, he was named Oracle's Rookie of the Year and three years later he was promoted to vice president, the company's youngest person to hold that title.[26]
Influence and honors[edit]
Benioff has been widely recognized for his visionary leadership and pioneering innovations. In 2016, he was named one of Fortune’s 50 World’s Greatest Leaders for his commitment to equality for all and other social issues as CEO.[27] He was also named Businessperson of the Year by Fortune readers,[28] one of the Best CEOs in the World by Barron’s,[29] and he received The Economist’s Innovation Award.[30] He served as co-chairman of the President’s Information Technology Advisory Committee from 2003–2005. Benioff is also a member of the World Economic Forum Board of Trustees.[31]
Salesforce has been named one of the World’s Most Innovative Companies five years in a row by Forbes Magazine.[32][33][34][35][36] Fortune Magazine named Salesforce as the World’s Most Admired Company in the software industry four years in a row,[37] and named the company a Best Place to Work eight years in a row.[38]
Benioff received an honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters from the University of Southern California on May 16, 2014.[39]
On March 17, 2017, Benioff was included in a business leaders' symposium organized by the Trump Administration during German Chancellor Angela Merkel's visit to the White House.[40]
Philanthropy[edit]
Benioff created the 1-1-1 model of integrated corporate philanthropy, by which companies contribute 1 percent of equity, 1 percent of employee hours and 1 percent of product back to the communities it serves.[41] Parts of this 1-1-1 model have been adopted by more than 700 companies,[42] including Google.[43] In 2005, the members of the World Economic Forum named him as one of its Young Global Leaders.[44] In 2007, the Committee Encouraging Corporate Philanthropy presented Benioff with the Excellence in Corporate Philanthropy Award [45] and in 2008 invited him to become a director of the board.[46]
In June 2010, Marc Benioff and his wife Lynne announced a $100 million gift to UCSF Children's Hospital with the goal of not only seeing the new hospital built but significantly advancing children's healthcare worldwide.[47] The Benioffs have been recognized as top philanthropists by Forbes' America's 50 Top Giver list in 2015[48] and the Chronicle of Philanthropy's Philanthropy 50 list in 2010,[49] 2014 [50] and 2015.[51]
In 2014, Marc and Lynne Benioff donated another $100 million to UCSF and Oakland Children's Hospital (both now called Benioff Children's Hospitals).[52] Marc and Lynne Benioff have also donated to The Ocean Cleanup, a non-profit organization developing technologies to rid the world's oceans of plastic[53].
Benioff credits Mata Amritanandamayi with inspiring his philanthropic business models, stating "But the most pivotal meeting for me was with Mata Amritanandamayi... It was she who introduced me to the idea, and possibility, of giving back to the world while pursuing my career ambitions. I realized that I didn't have to make a choice between doing business and doing good. I could align these two values and strive to succeed at both simultaneously."[54]
Platform for change[edit]
Benioff has said that businesses are the greatest platforms for change in the world. He follows the World Economic Forum founder Klaus Schwab’s multistakeholder approach to leadership, which says that leaders should serve not only their shareholders but all stakeholders, including customers, employees, partners, communities and the environment, to make the world a better place.[55]
In March 2015, Benioff announced Salesforce would cancel all employee programs and travel in the state of Indiana after the passing of SB 101, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a controversial bill which would allow companies and individuals to deny service to LGBT individuals based on religious beliefs.[56] As the largest tech employer in Indiana (following the 2013 acquisition of ExactTarget) Benioff led a global effort of business leaders fighting back against the legislation, ultimately leading to the Indiana State Legislature passing an amendment to the bill containing protections for LGBT customers, tenants and employees.[57]
Benioff led a similar movement in February 2016 against Georgia’s HB 757, the First Amendment Defense Act. He announced that Salesforce would reduce investments in Georgia and cancel an annual conference if the bill was passed as-is.[58] A month later, the Governor vetoed the bill.[59]
In April 2015, Benioff announced that he would be reviewing all salaries at Salesforce to ensure men and women were being paid equally for comparable work.[60] On the heels of the salary assessment, Benioff joined President Barack Obama in January 2016 as he celebrated the anniversary of the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and renewed his call on Congress to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act.[61]

Marc Russell Benioff (born September 25, 1964) is an American internet entrepreneur, author and philanthropist. He is the founder, chairman and CEO of Salesforce, a large enterprise cloud computing company.[2] As of March 2016, he owns approximately $3 billion worth of Salesforce shares.[3] Benioff started Salesforce in March 1999 in a rented San Francisco apartment and defined its mission in a marketing statement as “The End of Software”.[4]
Benioff has long evangelized software as a service as the model that would replace traditional enterprise software. He is the creator of the term “platform as a service” and has extended Salesforce’s reach by allowing customers to build their own applications on the company’s architecture, or in the Salesforce cloud.[5]
Benioff is a noted philanthropist. In 2000, he established the “1-1-1 model,” whereby the company contributes one percent of product, one percent of equity, and one percent of employee hours back to the communities it serves globally.[6] As of March 2016, Salesforce.org has delivered more than $115 million in grants, 1.3 million employee volunteer hours and powered 28,000 nonprofits with Salesforce technology.[7] More than 700 companies have adopted the 1-1-1 model through the Pledge 1% movement.[8] Benioff and his wife, Lynne, have focused their personal philanthropy on improving public education and advancing children’s health care through UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital.[9][10]
As CEO of Salesforce, he has used his platform to take on social causes such equal pay for women,[11] as well as leading efforts by business leaders to publicly oppose legislation in Indiana[12] and Georgia[13] that would allow discrimination against LGBT communities.
He is the author of three books, including the national best seller, Behind the Cloud.[14]

Early life and education[edit]
Benioff was raised in a Jewish family[15][16] in the San Francisco metropolitan area.[17] He graduated from Burlingame High School in 1982.[18] Benioff received a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration from the University of Southern California in 1986, where he was a member of the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity.[19] [20]
Career[edit]
While still in high school Benioff sold his first application, How to Juggle, for $75. At 15 he founded Liberty Software, creating and selling games for the Atari 8-bit computer among others.[21][22] Epyx published his King Arthur's Heir, The Nightmare, Escape from Vulcan's Isle, and Crypt of the Undead,[23][24] and by 16 Benioff was earning royalties of $1,500 a month, enough to pay for college.[22] During his time at USC he had internships as an assembly language programmer at the Macintosh division of Apple Computer, where he was inspired by the company and its co-founder, Steve Jobs.[25]
Benioff expected to continue programming after college, but USC professors advised him to obtain customer-oriented work experience and Benioff joined Oracle Corporation after graduation in a customer-service role.[22] Prior to founding Salesforce, he was at Oracle for 13 years in a variety of executive positions in sales, marketing, and product development. At 23, he was named Oracle's Rookie of the Year and three years later he was promoted to vice president, the company's youngest person to hold that title.[26]
Influence and honors[edit]
Benioff has been widely recognized for his visionary leadership and pioneering innovations. In 2016, he was named one of Fortune’s 50 World’s Greatest Leaders for his commitment to equality for all and other social issues as CEO.[27] He was also named Businessperson of the Year by Fortune readers,[28] one of the Best CEOs in the World by Barron’s,[29] and he received The Economist’s Innovation Award.[30] He served as co-chairman of the President’s Information Technology Advisory Committee from 2003–2005. Benioff is also a member of the World Economic Forum Board of Trustees.[31]
Salesforce has been named one of the World’s Most Innovative Companies five years in a row by Forbes Magazine.[32][33][34][35][36] Fortune Magazine named Salesforce as the World’s Most Admired Company in the software industry four years in a row,[37] and named the company a Best Place to Work eight years in a row.[38]
Benioff received an honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters from the University of Southern California on May 16, 2014.[39]
On March 17, 2017, Benioff was included in a business leaders' symposium organized by the Trump Administration during German Chancellor Angela Merkel's visit to the White House.[40]
Philanthropy[edit]
Benioff created the 1-1-1 model of integrated corporate philanthropy, by which companies contribute 1 percent of equity, 1 percent of employee hours and 1 percent of product back to the communities it serves.[41] Parts of this 1-1-1 model have been adopted by more than 700 companies,[42] including Google.[43] In 2005, the members of the World Economic Forum named him as one of its Young Global Leaders.[44] In 2007, the Committee Encouraging Corporate Philanthropy presented Benioff with the Excellence in Corporate Philanthropy Award [45] and in 2008 invited him to become a director of the board.[46]
In June 2010, Marc Benioff and his wife Lynne announced a $100 million gift to UCSF Children's Hospital with the goal of not only seeing the new hospital built but significantly advancing children's healthcare worldwide.[47] The Benioffs have been recognized as top philanthropists by Forbes' America's 50 Top Giver list in 2015[48] and the Chronicle of Philanthropy's Philanthropy 50 list in 2010,[49] 2014 [50] and 2015.[51]
In 2014, Marc and Lynne Benioff donated another $100 million to UCSF and Oakland Children's Hospital (both now called Benioff Children's Hospitals).[52] Marc and Lynne Benioff have also donated to The Ocean Cleanup, a non-profit organization developing technologies to rid the world's oceans of plastic[53].
Benioff credits Mata Amritanandamayi with inspiring his philanthropic business models, stating "But the most pivotal meeting for me was with Mata Amritanandamayi... It was she who introduced me to the idea, and possibility, of giving back to the world while pursuing my career ambitions. I realized that I didn't have to make a choice between doing business and doing good. I could align these two values and strive to succeed at both simultaneously."[54]
Platform for change[edit]
Benioff has said that businesses are the greatest platforms for change in the world. He follows the World Economic Forum founder Klaus Schwab’s multistakeholder approach to leadership, which says that leaders should serve not only their shareholders but all stakeholders, including customers, employees, partners, communities and the environment, to make the world a better place.[55]
In March 2015, Benioff announced Salesforce would cancel all employee programs and travel in the state of Indiana after the passing of SB 101, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a controversial bill which would allow companies and individuals to deny service to LGBT individuals based on religious beliefs.[56] As the largest tech employer in Indiana (following the 2013 acquisition of ExactTarget) Benioff led a global effort of business leaders fighting back against the legislation, ultimately leading to the Indiana State Legislature passing an amendment to the bill containing protections for LGBT customers, tenants and employees.[57]
Benioff led a similar movement in February 2016 against Georgia’s HB 757, the First Amendment Defense Act. He announced that Salesforce would reduce investments in Georgia and cancel an annual conference if the bill was passed as-is.[58] A month later, the Governor vetoed the bill.[59]
In April 2015, Benioff announced that he would be reviewing all salaries at Salesforce to ensure men and women were being paid equally for comparable work.[60] On the heels of the salary assessment, Benioff joined President Barack Obama in January 2016 as he celebrated the anniversary of the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and renewed his call on Congress to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act.[61]

Benioff created the 1-1-1 model of integrated corporate philanthropy, by which companies contribute 1 percent of equity, 1 percent of employee hours and 1 percent of product back to the communities it serves.[41] Parts of this 1-1-1 model have been adopted by more than 700 companies,[42] including Google.[43] In 2005, the members of the World Economic Forum named him as one of its Young Global Leaders.[44] In 2007, the Committee Encouraging Corporate Philanthropy presented Benioff with the Excellence in Corporate Philanthropy Award [45] and in 2008 invited him to become a director of the board.[46]
In June 2010, Marc Benioff and his wife Lynne announced a $100 million gift to UCSF Children's Hospital with the goal of not only seeing the new hospital built but significantly advancing children's healthcare worldwide.[47] The Benioffs have been recognized as top philanthropists by Forbes' America's 50 Top Giver list in 2015[48] and the Chronicle of Philanthropy's Philanthropy 50 list in 2010,[49] 2014 [50] and 2015.[51]
In 2014, Marc and Lynne Benioff donated another $100 million to UCSF and Oakland Children's Hospital (both now called Benioff Children's Hospitals).[52] Marc and Lynne Benioff have also donated to The Ocean Cleanup, a non-profit organization developing technologies to rid the world's oceans of plastic[53].
Benioff credits Mata Amritanandamayi with inspiring his philanthropic business models, stating "But the most pivotal meeting for me was with Mata Amritanandamayi... It was she who introduced me to the idea, and possibility, of giving back to the world while pursuing my career ambitions. I realized that I didn't have to make a choice between doing business and doing good. I could align these two values and strive to succeed at both simultaneously."[54]
Platform for change[edit]
Benioff has said that businesses are the greatest platforms for change in the world. He follows the World Economic Forum founder Klaus Schwab’s multistakeholder approach to leadership, which says that leaders should serve not only their shareholders but all stakeholders, including customers, employees, partners, communities and the environment, to make the world a better place.[55]
In March 2015, Benioff announced Salesforce would cancel all employee programs and travel in the state of Indiana after the passing of SB 101, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a controversial bill which would allow companies and individuals to deny service to LGBT individuals based on religious beliefs.[56] As the largest tech employer in Indiana (following the 2013 acquisition of ExactTarget) Benioff led a global effort of business leaders fighting back against the legislation, ultimately leading to the Indiana State Legislature passing an amendment to the bill containing protections for LGBT customers, tenants and employees.[57]
Benioff led a similar movement in February 2016 against Georgia’s HB 757, the First Amendment Defense Act. He announced that Salesforce would reduce investments in Georgia and cancel an annual conference if the bill was passed as-is.[58] A month later, the Governor vetoed the bill.[59]
In April 2015, Benioff announced that he would be reviewing all salaries at Salesforce to ensure men and women were being paid equally for comparable work.[60] On the heels of the salary assessment, Benioff joined President Barack Obama in January 2016 as he celebrated the anniversary of the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and renewed his call on Congress to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act.[61]

Marc Russell Benioff (born September 25, 1964) is an American internet entrepreneur, author and philanthropist. He is the founder, chairman and CEO of Salesforce, a large enterprise cloud computing company.[2] As of March 2016, he owns approximately $3 billion worth of Salesforce shares.[3] Benioff started Salesforce in March 1999 in a rented San Francisco apartment and defined its mission in a marketing statement as “The End of Software”.[4]
Benioff has long evangelized software as a service as the model that would replace traditional enterprise software. He is the creator of the term “platform as a service” and has extended Salesforce’s reach by allowing customers to build their own applications on the company’s architecture, or in the Salesforce cloud.[5]
Benioff is a noted philanthropist. In 2000, he established the “1-1-1 model,” whereby the company contributes one percent of product, one percent of equity, and one percent of employee hours back to the communities it serves globally.[6] As of March 2016, Salesforce.org has delivered more than $115 million in grants, 1.3 million employee volunteer hours and powered 28,000 nonprofits with Salesforce technology.[7] More than 700 companies have adopted the 1-1-1 model through the Pledge 1% movement.[8] Benioff and his wife, Lynne, have focused their personal philanthropy on improving public education and advancing children’s health care through UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital.[9][10]
As CEO of Salesforce, he has used his platform to take on social causes such equal pay for women,[11] as well as leading efforts by business leaders to publicly oppose legislation in Indiana[12] and Georgia[13] that would allow discrimination against LGBT communities.
He is the author of three books, including the national best seller, Behind the Cloud.[14]

Early life and education[edit]
Benioff was raised in a Jewish family[15][16] in the San Francisco metropolitan area.[17] He graduated from Burlingame High School in 1982.[18] Benioff received a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration from the University of Southern California in 1986, where he was a member of the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity.[19] [20]
Career[edit]
While still in high school Benioff sold his first application, How to Juggle, for $75. At 15 he founded Liberty Software, creating and selling games for the Atari 8-bit computer among others.[21][22] Epyx published his King Arthur's Heir, The Nightmare, Escape from Vulcan's Isle, and Crypt of the Undead,[23][24] and by 16 Benioff was earning royalties of $1,500 a month, enough to pay for college.[22] During his time at USC he had internships as an assembly language programmer at the Macintosh division of Apple Computer, where he was inspired by the company and its co-founder, Steve Jobs.[25]
Benioff expected to continue programming after college, but USC professors advised him to obtain customer-oriented work experience and Benioff joined Oracle Corporation after graduation in a customer-service role.[22] Prior to founding Salesforce, he was at Oracle for 13 years in a variety of executive positions in sales, marketing, and product development. At 23, he was named Oracle's Rookie of the Year and three years later he was promoted to vice president, the company's youngest person to hold that title.[26]
Influence and honors[edit]
Benioff has been widely recognized for his visionary leadership and pioneering innovations. In 2016, he was named one of Fortune’s 50 World’s Greatest Leaders for his commitment to equality for all and other social issues as CEO.[27] He was also named Businessperson of the Year by Fortune readers,[28] one of the Best CEOs in the World by Barron’s,[29] and he received The Economist’s Innovation Award.[30] He served as co-chairman of the President’s Information Technology Advisory Committee from 2003–2005. Benioff is also a member of the World Economic Forum Board of Trustees.[31]
Salesforce has been named one of the World’s Most Innovative Companies five years in a row by Forbes Magazine.[32][33][34][35][36] Fortune Magazine named Salesforce as the World’s Most Admired Company in the software industry four years in a row,[37] and named the company a Best Place to Work eight years in a row.[38]
Benioff received an honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters from the University of Southern California on May 16, 2014.[39]
On March 17, 2017, Benioff was included in a business leaders' symposium organized by the Trump Administration during German Chancellor Angela Merkel's visit to the White House.[40]
Philanthropy[edit]
Benioff created the 1-1-1 model of integrated corporate philanthropy, by which companies contribute 1 percent of equity, 1 percent of employee hours and 1 percent of product back to the communities it serves.[41] Parts of this 1-1-1 model have been adopted by more than 700 companies,[42] including Google.[43] In 2005, the members of the World Economic Forum named him as one of its Young Global Leaders.[44] In 2007, the Committee Encouraging Corporate Philanthropy presented Benioff with the Excellence in Corporate Philanthropy Award [45] and in 2008 invited him to become a director of the board.[46]
In June 2010, Marc Benioff and his wife Lynne announced a $100 million gift to UCSF Children's Hospital with the goal of not only seeing the new hospital built but significantly advancing children's healthcare worldwide.[47] The Benioffs have been recognized as top philanthropists by Forbes' America's 50 Top Giver list in 2015[48] and the Chronicle of Philanthropy's Philanthropy 50 list in 2010,[49] 2014 [50] and 2015.[51]
In 2014, Marc and Lynne Benioff donated another $100 million to UCSF and Oakland Children's Hospital (both now called Benioff Children's Hospitals).[52] Marc and Lynne Benioff have also donated to The Ocean Cleanup, a non-profit organization developing technologies to rid the world's oceans of plastic[53].
Benioff credits Mata Amritanandamayi with inspiring his philanthropic business models, stating "But the most pivotal meeting for me was with Mata Amritanandamayi... It was she who introduced me to the idea, and possibility, of giving back to the world while pursuing my career ambitions. I realized that I didn't have to make a choice between doing business and doing good. I could align these two values and strive to succeed at both simultaneously."[54]
Platform for change[edit]
Benioff has said that businesses are the greatest platforms for change in the world. He follows the World Economic Forum founder Klaus Schwab’s multistakeholder approach to leadership, which says that leaders should serve not only their shareholders but all stakeholders, including customers, employees, partners, communities and the environment, to make the world a better place.[55]
In March 2015, Benioff announced Salesforce would cancel all employee programs and travel in the state of Indiana after the passing of SB 101, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a controversial bill which would allow companies and individuals to deny service to LGBT individuals based on religious beliefs.[56] As the largest tech employer in Indiana (following the 2013 acquisition of ExactTarget) Benioff led a global effort of business leaders fighting back against the legislation, ultimately leading to the Indiana State Legislature passing an amendment to the bill containing protections for LGBT customers, tenants and employees.[57]
Benioff led a similar movement in February 2016 against Georgia’s HB 757, the First Amendment Defense Act. He announced that Salesforce would reduce investments in Georgia and cancel an annual conference if the bill was passed as-is.[58] A month later, the Governor vetoed the bill.[59]
In April 2015, Benioff announced that he would be reviewing all salaries at Salesforce to ensure men and women were being paid equally for comparable work.[60] On the heels of the salary assessment, Benioff joined President Barack Obama in January 2016 as he celebrated the anniversary of the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and renewed his call on Congress to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act.[61]

Marc Benioff just dropped a few more hints about Salesforce’s next new product, Einstein

Salesforce CEO Marc BenioffBusiness Insider/screenshotSalesforce CEO Marc Benioff sees a future where his next big new product, "Einstein," helping people become better salespeople, marketers, and customer service reps.
It's because of Einstein's ability to automatically collect and analyze data stored in Salesforce's products which target people in those areas.
With this enhanced artificial intelligence feature, Salesforce's apps will soon be able to give certain recommendations on how to better sell or design marketing campaigns, Benioff said during TechCrunch's annual conference Disrupt on Tuesday.
"This is a highly accurate, extremely effective AI platform that we are going to use first to support our own applications so our customers can have the best AI in the world," Benioff said. "If you’re a Sales Cloud customer, you’re going to see Sales Cloud Einstein, a whole new way to look at sales where the software’s really helping you to be the very best salesperson." 
To build Einstein, Benioff said he's spent about $650 million to buy dozens of startups in the artificial intelligence and data analytics fields. That's helped him quietly build an army of 175 data scientists at Salesforce, who's been working on Einstein over the past few years. Einstein is expected to make its debut at this year's Dreamforce, the big annual conference hosted by Salesforce.
"This is the real McCoy. It’s really AI for everyone," he added.
Benioff has long been touting artificial intelligence and machine learning as the next big thing in business software. Among the startups he's bought in this space include RelateIQ, which he spent $390 million for in 2014, and BeyondCore, which cost at least $110 million to acquire this year. 
"This will be the huge shift going forward, which is that everybody wants systems that are smarter, everybody wants systems that are more predictive, everybody wants everything scored, everybody wants to understand what’s the next best offer, next best opportunity, how to make things a little bit more efficient," Benioff said at a recent Forbes conference.

The executive management team at Salesforce is comprised of:

Marc Benioff, Chairman & CEO

Marc Benioff
Chairman & CEO

Marc Benioff is chairman and CEO of Salesforce. A pioneer of cloud computing, Benioff founded the company in 1999 with a vision to create a new kind of enterprise software company, with a new technology model based in the cloud, a new pay-as-you-go business model and a new integrated corporate philanthropy model. Under his leadership, Salesforce has grown from a groundbreaking idea into a Fortune 500 company, the fastest-growing top ten software company in the world and the largest CRM company.
For its revolutionary approach, Salesforce has been named one of the World’s Most Innovative Companies six years in a row by Forbes Magazine, one of Fortune’s World’s Most Admired Companies in the software industry five years in a row, and a Fortune Best Company to Work For nine years in a row.
Benioff has been widely recognized for his visionary leadership and pioneering innovations. He has been named one of the World’s 50 Greatest Leaders by Fortune, 50 Most Influential People by Bloomberg, one of the top 20 Best-Performing CEOs by Harvard Business Review, Businessperson of the Year by Fortune readers, one of the Best CEOs in the World by Barron’s, Innovator of the Decade by Forbes Magazine and received The Economist’s Innovation Award. Benioff is also a member of the World Economic Forum Board of Trustees.
Benioff created the 1-1-1 model of philanthropy, which leverages the resources of Salesforce to improve communities around the world: donating 1% of Salesforce’s product, 1% of its equity and 1% of employees' time to help nonprofits achieve their missions. Today, more than 1,400 companies have adopted the 1-1-1 model through the Pledge 1% movement. Benioff and his wife, Lynne, have focused their personal philanthropy on children’s health, including building UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospitals in San Francisco and Oakland, as well as on public education, homelessness and other social issues.
Benioff believes that businesses are the greatest platforms for change in the world. He has embraced World Economic Forum founder Klaus Schwab’s multi-stakeholder approach to leadership, serving not only shareholders but all stakeholders--including customers, employees, partners, communities and the environment--to make the world a better place. Benioff is also inspiring fellow business leaders to do the same. He led a group of CEOs and business leaders in opposing state legislation that discriminated against LGBTQ communities, and instituted a company-wide salary assessment at Salesforce to ensure men and women were being paid equally for comparable work.
Benioff is a 35-year veteran of the software industry. Prior to launching Salesforce, he spent 13 years at Oracle Corporation. He founded his first company, Liberty Software, which created video games, at the age of 15. He also worked as an assembly language programmer in Apple Computer’s Macintosh Division.

Former Rival Marc Benioff Is Blown Away By The 'New Microsoft'

Salesforce.com CEO Marc BenioffBusiness Insider/Julie BortMicrosoft's new CEO Satya Nadella has made a fan out of one former Microsoft rival: Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff.
Microsoft was even the opening act of Salesforce's massive customer conference being held in San Francisco this week.
Benioff interviewed Microsoft's new Windows marketing leader, Tony Prophet, on stage. Prophet was hired away from Hewlett Packard when Nadella took office.
"A year ago at Dreamforce we would not have thought Microsoft would have been here, on stage. It's a shock," he said, to laughter from the crowd. "I'm fascinated that he chose you as the representative of Microsoft."
 John Thompson, Microsoft chairman and Virtual Instruments CEOMicrosoftIn May, just a few weeks after Nadella took office, the two companies struck up a partnership, initiated by Microsoft. They are showing off the not-yet-ripe fruits of that young partnership at the conference which includes making Salesforce.com and Microsoft Office apps work together with new Windows and Windows phone apps.
The reason this partnership is so shocking: Salesforce.com and Microsoft have been bitter competitors in Salesforce.com's bread-and-butter market, "customer relationship management" software that helps salespeople track contacts and make sales.
That competition isn't going to end either. In fact, a Salesforce exec recently told new recruits  to view this partnership like means to grab share away from Microsoft.
"We're gonna wrap our arms around Microsoft. We're gonna pretend like we're a boa constrictor. And we're gonna suck the life out of them," a Salesforce.com strategy executive told trainees last month.
That was not a sanctioned opinion by the company, who tells us,"We deeply value our partnership with Microsoft."
Clearly Benioff wanted to prove that how much he values the new partnership with Microsoft, too, with this opening interview.
Tony Prophet, Microsoft corporate vice president, Windows MarketingBusiness Insider/Julie Bort Prophet and Benioff are friends through their mutual love of philanthropy. Prophet is a supporter of the new Benioff Children's Hospital in San Francisco, and supports AIDs and teen education projects in San Francisco.
The soft-spoken, contemplative Prophet couldn't be more opposite than previous Windows boss Steven Sinofsky, the man who led Windows 7 and Windows 8 and was known as brilliant, but combative and authoritarian.
Benioff says he's floored that one of the first things Nadella did was hire Prophet and reach out to Salesforce.com, though the partnership may have been the brainchild of Microsoft's new chairman, John Thompson.
Thompson became chairman when Nadella was named CEO and Bill Gates stepped down from the chairman role. (Gates didn't leave Microsoft. His new title is "Founder and Technology Advisor" and he's actually more involved now than he was as chairman.)
Thompson is a well-respected leader in the tech industry, first as a high-ranking IBM exec and then as the man who turned security company Symantec into a multi-billion powerhouse. He left Symantec in 2008.
Right after becoming chairman Thompson called Benioff and suggested dinner.
"He's someone I've had a strong friendship with for 25 years in the industry," Benioff said. "Now he's the chairman of Microsoft. When I look at John, when I look Satya, when I look at you, I say, 'Wow, we have three dramatically different leaders than what has been there for decades.' To me that's the No. 1 indication that there is a new Microsoft because the people are new at the top."

Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce [Photo: Flickr user SwissnexSF/Myleen Hollero]
By Robert Safian7 minute ReadFast Company‘s latest cover story explores the various ways values and social responsibility are having an impact at companies such as Facebook, Airbnb, and Uber. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has long pushed his company and employees to make a positive difference in the world. I spoke to him recently about his company’s approach.advertisementFast Company: You have talked about Salesforce as a company with purpose beyond profit. Can you explain that?Marc Benioff: My goals for the company are to do well and do good. The most important thing to me is that we bring along all our stakeholders with us. We had a vision from the beginning that not only would we have a new technology model, which was the cloud, not only would we have a new business model, which was subscription, but we’d have a new philanthropic model, which is 1-1-1. [Salesforce commits 1% of its equity, employees’ time, and product to nonprofit work.] As the CEO I need to embrace all of my stakeholders, not just all of my shareholders. What I’m trying to do is maximize stakeholder value.FC: How does doing good help bottom-line performance?MB: Well, we’re the fastest growing software company of all time, so I hope it’s connected. [Laughs.] If you go to my Twitter page you can see the revenue chart. It’s a direct connection to our values. Not only are we building a great product but we’re building a great company that is trying to create a great world. Certainly it’s a source of great talent. People come to the company and stay because of the incredible opportunity and impact that they’re having on the world. Business is a great platform for change. When a business like Salesforce gets to scale, with 25,000 employees and customers all over the world, you have an opportunity to influence them in a positive way. I do believe we’re having that impact. You can see it in Pledge 1%, where the 1-1-1 idea has spread to thousands of companies.FC: Does Wall Street support this idea?MB: Wall Street is agnostic in terms of picking one philosophy or the other. But they certainly do invest and support companies that do good work. We’ve been public since 2004, you look at our chart, we’ve had a really good run, and I do connect that back to [the fact] that we’re building a great company. It is part of our differentiation. As you differentiate against an SAP or an Oracle or a Microsoft, Salesforce is indeed different.advertisementFC: There seems to be heightened discussion and activity from corporate leaders on policy issues in recent months. Is that directly related to a new administration?MB: I think you saw it before that. You’ve seen the rise of more activist CEOs who stand for things and represent their employees and their stakeholders in the same way a politician would represent the people who vote for them. I think CEOs have to think this way. They have to understand that they represent their stakeholders, all of them. They need to be able to speak and act on behalf of them.When I went to school for business, we were not taught this. It was not part of my education. I was taught marketing and organizational development, that sort of thing, I certainly was not taught stakeholder management. This is something I’ve learned, honestly, since I started Salesforce.I’ll come back to the 1-1-1. Because of 1-1-1, we got involved with so many nonprofits and NGOs. We support 30,000 of them. Many of these people I had never interacted with, and they really impacted my consciousness, how I think about the world. They are working on health care and the environment and with developing nations, areas where I have not spent that much time. Those conversations have been extremely valuable. What I realized is we can help them and support them in our work. As we’ve done that, our employees get a much higher level of satisfaction and fulfillment, knowing that they work for a company that supports that.We give our employees the ability to have direct involvement too. One of our executives just went to set up a school in Africa. We give them four hours a month paid time off, six days a year—we’re paying them for their volunteerism. That only creates a better company. It’s quite selfish in many ways. This has probably done more for Salesforce. And that’s why I encourage other CEOs and entrepreneurs to take this on.FC: When you first started doing this 18 years ago, it was novel. Do you feel the expectations on business leaders has changed since that time?advertisementMB: Yes, increasingly so. I think you’ll see that continue to accelerate. There’s a shift for CEOs to be focused on all their stakeholders, not just their shareholders, and I think that will be more and more true.FC: Are there cultural elements driving this?MB: Absolutely. You can look to millennials, they have a desire to work for companies that have meaning. Yes, they want a company that is making money, focused on profitability and market share and all of that, but also that there is meaning to their work, that they’re actually improving the state of the world.When I was at Oracle, I felt deeply inside myself that there was this bifurcation. I was working for this company, and that was one way of life, and there was another way of life that was nonprofit world or spiritual world, whatever you want to call it. I went on this tour of India in 1996, talking to gurus, incense wafting over us, and all of a sudden it became clear to me that there was a way to integrate all of this, that you could do both at the same time. Why do I have to be two people? Can’t I just be one person? I want to live an integrated life. I want to be an integrated leader.A lot of people feel like they have multiple lives. They compartmentalize. I have an integrated life. I have one set of values, and I project that through all of my work. I’m not perfect, I have incongruency, but I try to work on that. This kind of integration is something we can all strive for. I know that the work I’m doing is making the world better. Salesforce helps hospitals and schools and all kinds of nonprofits. Salesforce gives guidance to our employees to get out there and volunteer. And I think that’s why we have high levels of satisfaction in our employees. And why we can attract people. We are creating an environment that gives them satisfaction in their work, not just financial gains.FC: The trust people have in government is waning. Is trust in business leaders growing?advertisementMB: Nothing is more important today for business than trust. The Edelman Trust Barometer says trust with CEOs, companies, government is at the lowest point in a long time. We are in a crisis of trust. CEOs get caught in this crisis of trust and it gets amplified for them. That’s why I come back to that 1-1-1 model. It brings a set of values into the company. If you do have an incongruent moment, you’re going to be able to seek forgiveness for that. I’ve had those moments myself. For those people who are only out there to make money, when you hit that incongruent moment, you don’t get air cover, you’re going to be in trouble because you didn’t create the good karma.You have the opportunity to set up companies that do good in the world. It’s easy. There’s all this incredible energy in your company and you can unleash it for good. If you’re not unleashing it, you’re missing something. I really think people are inherently good and want to give, I think companies are inherently good and want to give. The ability to do it is relatively straightforward. All you have to do is open the door.FC: So is this more important than meeting the expectations of Wall Street?MB: You have to be able to do both. It’s not an either/or. Yes, you better hit your revenue and earnings goals. But there is no linear success. If you look at my stock chart, you’re going to see ups and downs, but where is it over time? From that same perspective, your company isn’t always going to be perfect, we’re human beings, there are going to be problems and challenges along the way. But when you aggregate it all up, it’s like the stock. What is your compound growth rate of your equity over the years? What is your compound growth rate of good over the lifetime of your company?In 2008 I went to Bhutan. They don’t measure gross domestic product. They measure gross national happiness. We don’t live in Bhutan, but we can look to Bhutan for inspiration—we can have companies with more happiness and satisfaction and fulfillment but that are also able to achieve strong financial outcomes. This something every CEO can do, easily, and I’m encouraging companies to do this. It’s probably more important than any time in human history that we’re all focused on improving the state of the world.advertisementRelated StoriesLeadershipFour Work-Life Questions To Ponder On Vacation This SummerLeadershipWhy Telling John McCain To Beat Cancer Feeds A Dangerous GOP NarrativeLeadershipKicking These Three Habits Made Me A Better CEOadvertisementVideoIdeasIdeasIs Your Country Ready For A Catastrophe?IdeasThe Philanthropy World Is Frightened That Trump’s Tax Plan Is Going To Slow DonationsIdeasCould Hawaii Be The First State To Offer A Basic Income?EntertainmentEntertainmentHere Are The Trailers You’ve Missed From San Diego Comic-Con So FarEntertainmentOpen Letter To SNL: Please Let Melissa McCarthy Do Spicey On TV Right NowEntertainment“Fairy Lives Don’t Matter”: Will Smith’s Fantasy Cop Movie On Netflix Is a Racial AllegoryCo.DesignProductGo Inside The ISS, The Most Expensive Structure Ever BuiltProductThis Rotary Phone Is A Delightfully Analog Way To Read The WebProductSomeday You Could Swallow This Wireless Robot Like A PillFast CompanyEntertainmentHere Are The Trailers You’ve Missed From San Diego Comic-Con So FarLeadershipFour Work-Life Questions To Ponder On Vacation This SummerIdeasIs Your Country Ready For A Catastrophe?

Marc Russell Benioff (born September 25, 1964) is an American internet entrepreneur, author and philanthropist. He is the founder, chairman and CEO of Salesforce, a large enterprise cloud computing company.[2] As of March 2016, he owns approximately $3 billion worth of Salesforce shares.[3] Benioff started Salesforce in March 1999 in a rented San Francisco apartment and defined its mission in a marketing statement as “The End of Software”.[4]
Benioff has long evangelized software as a service as the model that would replace traditional enterprise software. He is the creator of the term “platform as a service” and has extended Salesforce’s reach by allowing customers to build their own applications on the company’s architecture, or in the Salesforce cloud.[5]
Benioff is a noted philanthropist. In 2000, he established the “1-1-1 model,” whereby the company contributes one percent of product, one percent of equity, and one percent of employee hours back to the communities it serves globally.[6] As of March 2016, Salesforce.org has delivered more than $115 million in grants, 1.3 million employee volunteer hours and powered 28,000 nonprofits with Salesforce technology.[7] More than 700 companies have adopted the 1-1-1 model through the Pledge 1% movement.[8] Benioff and his wife, Lynne, have focused their personal philanthropy on improving public education and advancing children’s health care through UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital.[9][10]
As CEO of Salesforce, he has used his platform to take on social causes such equal pay for women,[11] as well as leading efforts by business leaders to publicly oppose legislation in Indiana[12] and Georgia[13] that would allow discrimination against LGBT communities.
He is the author of three books, including the national best seller, Behind the Cloud.[14]

Early life and education[edit]
Benioff was raised in a Jewish family[15][16] in the San Francisco metropolitan area.[17] He graduated from Burlingame High School in 1982.[18] Benioff received a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration from the University of Southern California in 1986, where he was a member of the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity.[19] [20]
Career[edit]
While still in high school Benioff sold his first application, How to Juggle, for $75. At 15 he founded Liberty Software, creating and selling games for the Atari 8-bit computer among others.[21][22] Epyx published his King Arthur's Heir, The Nightmare, Escape from Vulcan's Isle, and Crypt of the Undead,[23][24] and by 16 Benioff was earning royalties of $1,500 a month, enough to pay for college.[22] During his time at USC he had internships as an assembly language programmer at the Macintosh division of Apple Computer, where he was inspired by the company and its co-founder, Steve Jobs.[25]
Benioff expected to continue programming after college, but USC professors advised him to obtain customer-oriented work experience and Benioff joined Oracle Corporation after graduation in a customer-service role.[22] Prior to founding Salesforce, he was at Oracle for 13 years in a variety of executive positions in sales, marketing, and product development. At 23, he was named Oracle's Rookie of the Year and three years later he was promoted to vice president, the company's youngest person to hold that title.[26]
Influence and honors[edit]
Benioff has been widely recognized for his visionary leadership and pioneering innovations. In 2016, he was named one of Fortune’s 50 World’s Greatest Leaders for his commitment to equality for all and other social issues as CEO.[27] He was also named Businessperson of the Year by Fortune readers,[28] one of the Best CEOs in the World by Barron’s,[29] and he received The Economist’s Innovation Award.[30] He served as co-chairman of the President’s Information Technology Advisory Committee from 2003–2005. Benioff is also a member of the World Economic Forum Board of Trustees.[31]
Salesforce has been named one of the World’s Most Innovative Companies five years in a row by Forbes Magazine.[32][33][34][35][36] Fortune Magazine named Salesforce as the World’s Most Admired Company in the software industry four years in a row,[37] and named the company a Best Place to Work eight years in a row.[38]
Benioff received an honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters from the University of Southern California on May 16, 2014.[39]
On March 17, 2017, Benioff was included in a business leaders' symposium organized by the Trump Administration during German Chancellor Angela Merkel's visit to the White House.[40]
Philanthropy[edit]
Benioff created the 1-1-1 model of integrated corporate philanthropy, by which companies contribute 1 percent of equity, 1 percent of employee hours and 1 percent of product back to the communities it serves.[41] Parts of this 1-1-1 model have been adopted by more than 700 companies,[42] including Google.[43] In 2005, the members of the World Economic Forum named him as one of its Young Global Leaders.[44] In 2007, the Committee Encouraging Corporate Philanthropy presented Benioff with the Excellence in Corporate Philanthropy Award [45] and in 2008 invited him to become a director of the board.[46]
In June 2010, Marc Benioff and his wife Lynne announced a $100 million gift to UCSF Children's Hospital with the goal of not only seeing the new hospital built but significantly advancing children's healthcare worldwide.[47] The Benioffs have been recognized as top philanthropists by Forbes' America's 50 Top Giver list in 2015[48] and the Chronicle of Philanthropy's Philanthropy 50 list in 2010,[49] 2014 [50] and 2015.[51]
In 2014, Marc and Lynne Benioff donated another $100 million to UCSF and Oakland Children's Hospital (both now called Benioff Children's Hospitals).[52] Marc and Lynne Benioff have also donated to The Ocean Cleanup, a non-profit organization developing technologies to rid the world's oceans of plastic[53].
Benioff credits Mata Amritanandamayi with inspiring his philanthropic business models, stating "But the most pivotal meeting for me was with Mata Amritanandamayi... It was she who introduced me to the idea, and possibility, of giving back to the world while pursuing my career ambitions. I realized that I didn't have to make a choice between doing business and doing good. I could align these two values and strive to succeed at both simultaneously."[54]
Platform for change[edit]
Benioff has said that businesses are the greatest platforms for change in the world. He follows the World Economic Forum founder Klaus Schwab’s multistakeholder approach to leadership, which says that leaders should serve not only their shareholders but all stakeholders, including customers, employees, partners, communities and the environment, to make the world a better place.[55]
In March 2015, Benioff announced Salesforce would cancel all employee programs and travel in the state of Indiana after the passing of SB 101, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a controversial bill which would allow companies and individuals to deny service to LGBT individuals based on religious beliefs.[56] As the largest tech employer in Indiana (following the 2013 acquisition of ExactTarget) Benioff led a global effort of business leaders fighting back against the legislation, ultimately leading to the Indiana State Legislature passing an amendment to the bill containing protections for LGBT customers, tenants and employees.[57]
Benioff led a similar movement in February 2016 against Georgia’s HB 757, the First Amendment Defense Act. He announced that Salesforce would reduce investments in Georgia and cancel an annual conference if the bill was passed as-is.[58] A month later, the Governor vetoed the bill.[59]
In April 2015, Benioff announced that he would be reviewing all salaries at Salesforce to ensure men and women were being paid equally for comparable work.[60] On the heels of the salary assessment, Benioff joined President Barack Obama in January 2016 as he celebrated the anniversary of the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and renewed his call on Congress to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act.[61]

In 2016, he was named one of Fortune’s 50 World’s Greatest Leaders for his commitment to equality for all and other social issues as CEO.[27] He was also named Businessperson of the Year by Fortune readers,[28] one of the Best CEOs in the World by Barron’s,[29] and he received The Economist’s Innovation Award.[30] He served as co-chairman of the President’s Information Technology Advisory Committee from 2003–2005. Benioff is also a member of the World Economic Forum Board of Trustees.[31]
Salesforce has been named one of the World’s Most Innovative Companies five years in a row by Forbes Magazine.[32][33][34][35][36] Fortune Magazine named Salesforce as the World’s Most Admired Company in the software industry four years in a row,[37] and named the company a Best Place to Work eight years in a row.[38]
Benioff received an honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters from the University of Southern California on May 16, 2014.[39]
On March 17, 2017, Benioff was included in a business leaders' symposium organized by the Trump Administration during German Chancellor Angela Merkel's visit to the White House.[40]
Philanthropy[edit]
Benioff created the 1-1-1 model of integrated corporate philanthropy, by which companies contribute 1 percent of equity, 1 percent of employee hours and 1 percent of product back to the communities it serves.[41] Parts of this 1-1-1 model have been adopted by more than 700 companies,[42] including Google.[43] In 2005, the members of the World Economic Forum named him as one of its Young Global Leaders.[44] In 2007, the Committee Encouraging Corporate Philanthropy presented Benioff with the Excellence in Corporate Philanthropy Award [45] and in 2008 invited him to become a director of the board.[46]
In June 2010, Marc Benioff and his wife Lynne announced a $100 million gift to UCSF Children's Hospital with the goal of not only seeing the new hospital built but significantly advancing children's healthcare worldwide.[47] The Benioffs have been recognized as top philanthropists by Forbes' America's 50 Top Giver list in 2015[48] and the Chronicle of Philanthropy's Philanthropy 50 list in 2010,[49] 2014 [50] and 2015.[51]
In 2014, Marc and Lynne Benioff donated another $100 million to UCSF and Oakland Children's Hospital (both now called Benioff Children's Hospitals).[52] Marc and Lynne Benioff have also donated to The Ocean Cleanup, a non-profit organization developing technologies to rid the world's oceans of plastic[53].
Benioff credits Mata Amritanandamayi with inspiring his philanthropic business models, stating "But the most pivotal meeting for me was with Mata Amritanandamayi... It was she who introduced me to the idea, and possibility, of giving back to the world while pursuing my career ambitions. I realized that I didn't have to make a choice between doing business and doing good. I could align these two values and strive to succeed at both simultaneously."[54]
Platform for change[edit]
Benioff has said that businesses are the greatest platforms for change in the world. He follows the World Economic Forum founder Klaus Schwab’s multistakeholder approach to leadership, which says that leaders should serve not only their shareholders but all stakeholders, including customers, employees, partners, communities and the environment, to make the world a better place.[55]
In March 2015, Benioff announced Salesforce would cancel all employee programs and travel in the state of Indiana after the passing of SB 101, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a controversial bill which would allow companies and individuals to deny service to LGBT individuals based on religious beliefs.[56] As the largest tech employer in Indiana (following the 2013 acquisition of ExactTarget) Benioff led a global effort of business leaders fighting back against the legislation, ultimately leading to the Indiana State Legislature passing an amendment to the bill containing protections for LGBT customers, tenants and employees.[57]
Benioff led a similar movement in February 2016 against Georgia’s HB 757, the First Amendment Defense Act. He announced that Salesforce would reduce investments in Georgia and cancel an annual conference if the bill was passed as-is.[58] A month later, the Governor vetoed the bill.[59]
In April 2015, Benioff announced that he would be reviewing all salaries at Salesforce to ensure men and women were being paid equally for comparable work.[60] On the heels of the salary assessment, Benioff joined President Barack Obama in January 2016 as he celebrated the anniversary of the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and renewed his call on Congress to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act.[61]

Marc Russell Benioff (born September 25, 1964) is an American internet entrepreneur, author and philanthropist. He is the founder, chairman and CEO of Salesforce, a large enterprise cloud computing company.[2] As of March 2016, he owns approximately $3 billion worth of Salesforce shares.[3] Benioff started Salesforce in March 1999 in a rented San Francisco apartment and defined its mission in a marketing statement as “The End of Software”.[4]
Benioff has long evangelized software as a service as the model that would replace traditional enterprise software. He is the creator of the term “platform as a service” and has extended Salesforce’s reach by allowing customers to build their own applications on the company’s architecture, or in the Salesforce cloud.[5]
Benioff is a noted philanthropist. In 2000, he established the “1-1-1 model,” whereby the company contributes one percent of product, one percent of equity, and one percent of employee hours back to the communities it serves globally.[6] As of March 2016, Salesforce.org has delivered more than $115 million in grants, 1.3 million employee volunteer hours and powered 28,000 nonprofits with Salesforce technology.[7] More than 700 companies have adopted the 1-1-1 model through the Pledge 1% movement.[8] Benioff and his wife, Lynne, have focused their personal philanthropy on improving public education and advancing children’s health care through UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital.[9][10]
As CEO of Salesforce, he has used his platform to take on social causes such equal pay for women,[11] as well as leading efforts by business leaders to publicly oppose legislation in Indiana[12] and Georgia[13] that would allow discrimination against LGBT communities.
He is the author of three books, including the national best seller, Behind the Cloud.[14]

Early life and education[edit]
Benioff was raised in a Jewish family[15][16] in the San Francisco metropolitan area.[17] He graduated from Burlingame High School in 1982.[18] Benioff received a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration from the University of Southern California in 1986, where he was a member of the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity.[19] [20]
Career[edit]
While still in high school Benioff sold his first application, How to Juggle, for $75. At 15 he founded Liberty Software, creating and selling games for the Atari 8-bit computer among others.[21][22] Epyx published his King Arthur's Heir, The Nightmare, Escape from Vulcan's Isle, and Crypt of the Undead,[23][24] and by 16 Benioff was earning royalties of $1,500 a month, enough to pay for college.[22] During his time at USC he had internships as an assembly language programmer at the Macintosh division of Apple Computer, where he was inspired by the company and its co-founder, Steve Jobs.[25]
Benioff expected to continue programming after college, but USC professors advised him to obtain customer-oriented work experience and Benioff joined Oracle Corporation after graduation in a customer-service role.[22] Prior to founding Salesforce, he was at Oracle for 13 years in a variety of executive positions in sales, marketing, and product development. At 23, he was named Oracle's Rookie of the Year and three years later he was promoted to vice president, the company's youngest person to hold that title.[26]
Influence and honors[edit]
Benioff has been widely recognized for his visionary leadership and pioneering innovations. In 2016, he was named one of Fortune’s 50 World’s Greatest Leaders for his commitment to equality for all and other social issues as CEO.[27] He was also named Businessperson of the Year by Fortune readers,[28] one of the Best CEOs in the World by Barron’s,[29] and he received The Economist’s Innovation Award.[30] He served as co-chairman of the President’s Information Technology Advisory Committee from 2003–2005. Benioff is also a member of the World Economic Forum Board of Trustees.[31]
Salesforce has been named one of the World’s Most Innovative Companies five years in a row by Forbes Magazine.[32][33][34][35][36] Fortune Magazine named Salesforce as the World’s Most Admired Company in the software industry four years in a row,[37] and named the company a Best Place to Work eight years in a row.[38]
Benioff received an honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters from the University of Southern California on May 16, 2014.[39]
On March 17, 2017, Benioff was included in a business leaders' symposium organized by the Trump Administration during German Chancellor Angela Merkel's visit to the White House.[40]
Philanthropy[edit]
Benioff created the 1-1-1 model of integrated corporate philanthropy, by which companies contribute 1 percent of equity, 1 percent of employee hours and 1 percent of product back to the communities it serves.[41] Parts of this 1-1-1 model have been adopted by more than 700 companies,[42] including Google.[43] In 2005, the members of the World Economic Forum named him as one of its Young Global Leaders.[44] In 2007, the Committee Encouraging Corporate Philanthropy presented Benioff with the Excellence in Corporate Philanthropy Award [45] and in 2008 invited him to become a director of the board.[46]
In June 2010, Marc Benioff and his wife Lynne announced a $100 million gift to UCSF Children's Hospital with the goal of not only seeing the new hospital built but significantly advancing children's healthcare worldwide.[47] The Benioffs have been recognized as top philanthropists by Forbes' America's 50 Top Giver list in 2015[48] and the Chronicle of Philanthropy's Philanthropy 50 list in 2010,[49] 2014 [50] and 2015.[51]
In 2014, Marc and Lynne Benioff donated another $100 million to UCSF and Oakland Children's Hospital (both now called Benioff Children's Hospitals).[52] Marc and Lynne Benioff have also donated to The Ocean Cleanup, a non-profit organization developing technologies to rid the world's oceans of plastic[53].
Benioff credits Mata Amritanandamayi with inspiring his philanthropic business models, stating "But the most pivotal meeting for me was with Mata Amritanandamayi...

He follows the World Economic Forum founder Klaus Schwab’s multistakeholder approach to leadership, which says that leaders should serve not only their shareholders but all stakeholders, including customers, employees, partners, communities and the environment, to make the world a better place.[55]
In March 2015, Benioff announced Salesforce would cancel all employee programs and travel in the state of Indiana after the passing of SB 101, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a controversial bill which would allow companies and individuals to deny service to LGBT individuals based on religious beliefs.[56] As the largest tech employer in Indiana (following the 2013 acquisition of ExactTarget) Benioff led a global effort of business leaders fighting back against the legislation, ultimately leading to the Indiana State Legislature passing an amendment to the bill containing protections for LGBT customers, tenants and employees.[57]

Marc Russell Benioff (born September 25, 1964) is an American internet entrepreneur, author and philanthropist. He is the founder, chairman and CEO of Salesforce, a large enterprise cloud computing company.[2] As of March 2016, he owns approximately $3 billion worth of Salesforce shares.[3] Benioff started Salesforce in March 1999 in a rented San Francisco apartment and defined its mission in a marketing statement as “The End of Software”.[4]
Benioff has long evangelized software as a service as the model that would replace traditional enterprise software. He is the creator of the term “platform as a service” and has extended Salesforce’s reach by allowing customers to build their own applications on the company’s architecture, or in the Salesforce cloud.[5]
Benioff is a noted philanthropist. In 2000, he established the “1-1-1 model,” whereby the company contributes one percent of product, one percent of equity, and one percent of employee hours back to the communities it serves globally.[6] As of March 2016, Salesforce.org has delivered more than $115 million in grants, 1.3 million employee volunteer hours and powered 28,000 nonprofits with Salesforce technology.[7] More than 700 companies have adopted the 1-1-1 model through the Pledge 1% movement.[8] Benioff and his wife, Lynne, have focused their personal philanthropy on improving public education and advancing children’s health care through UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital.[9][10]
As CEO of Salesforce, he has used his platform to take on social causes such equal pay for women,[11] as well as leading efforts by business leaders to publicly oppose legislation in Indiana[12] and Georgia[13] that would allow discrimination against LGBT communities.
He is the author of three books, including the national best seller, Behind the Cloud.[14]

Early life and education[edit]
Benioff was raised in a Jewish family[15][16] in the San Francisco metropolitan area.[17] He graduated from Burlingame High School in 1982.[18] Benioff received a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration from the University of Southern California in 1986, where he was a member of the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity.[19] [20]
Career[edit]
While still in high school Benioff sold his first application, How to Juggle, for $75. At 15 he founded Liberty Software, creating and selling games for the Atari 8-bit computer among others.[21][22] Epyx published his King Arthur's Heir, The Nightmare, Escape from Vulcan's Isle, and Crypt of the Undead,[23][24] and by 16 Benioff was earning royalties of $1,500 a month, enough to pay for college.[22] During his time at USC he had internships as an assembly language programmer at the Macintosh division of Apple Computer, where he was inspired by the company and its co-founder, Steve Jobs.[25]
Benioff expected to continue programming after college, but USC professors advised him to obtain customer-oriented work experience and Benioff joined Oracle Corporation after graduation in a customer-service role.[22] Prior to founding Salesforce, he was at Oracle for 13 years in a variety of executive positions in sales, marketing, and product development. At 23, he was named Oracle's Rookie of the Year and three years later he was promoted to vice president, the company's youngest person to hold that title.[26]
Influence and honors[edit]
Benioff has been widely recognized for his visionary leadership and pioneering innovations. In 2016, he was named one of Fortune’s 50 World’s Greatest Leaders for his commitment to equality for all and other social issues as CEO.[27] He was also named Businessperson of the Year by Fortune readers,[28] one of the Best CEOs in the World by Barron’s,[29] and he received The Economist’s Innovation Award.[30] He served as co-chairman of the President’s Information Technology Advisory Committee from 2003–2005. Benioff is also a member of the World Economic Forum Board of Trustees.[31]
Salesforce has been named one of the World’s Most Innovative Companies five years in a row by Forbes Magazine.[32][33][34][35][36] Fortune Magazine named Salesforce as the World’s Most Admired Company in the software industry four years in a row,[37] and named the company a Best Place to Work eight years in a row.[38]
Benioff received an honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters from the University of Southern California on May 16, 2014.[39]
On March 17, 2017, Benioff was included in a business leaders' symposium organized by the Trump Administration during German Chancellor Angela Merkel's visit to the White House.[40]
Philanthropy[edit]
Benioff created the 1-1-1 model of integrated corporate philanthropy, by which companies contribute 1 percent of equity, 1 percent of employee hours and 1 percent of product back to the communities it serves.[41] Parts of this 1-1-1 model have been adopted by more than 700 companies,[42] including Google.[43] In 2005, the members of the World Economic Forum named him as one of its Young Global Leaders.[44] In 2007, the Committee Encouraging Corporate Philanthropy presented Benioff with the Excellence in Corporate Philanthropy Award [45] and in 2008 invited him to become a director of the board.[46]
In June 2010, Marc Benioff and his wife Lynne announced a $100 million gift to UCSF Children's Hospital with the goal of not only seeing the new hospital built but significantly advancing children's healthcare worldwide.[47] The Benioffs have been recognized as top philanthropists by Forbes' America's 50 Top Giver list in 2015[48] and the Chronicle of Philanthropy's Philanthropy 50 list in 2010,[49] 2014 [50] and 2015.[51]
In 2014, Marc and Lynne Benioff donated another $100 million to UCSF and Oakland Children's Hospital (both now called Benioff Children's Hospitals).[52] Marc and Lynne Benioff have also donated to The Ocean Cleanup, a non-profit organization developing technologies to rid the world's oceans of plastic[53].
Benioff credits Mata Amritanandamayi with inspiring his philanthropic business models, stating "But the most pivotal meeting for me was with Mata Amritanandamayi... It was she who introduced me to the idea, and possibility, of giving back to the world while pursuing my career ambitions. I realized that I didn't have to make a choice between doing business and doing good. I could align these two values and strive to succeed at both simultaneously."[54]
Platform for change[edit]
Benioff has said that businesses are the greatest platforms for change in the world. He follows the World Economic Forum founder Klaus Schwab’s multistakeholder approach to leadership, which says that leaders should serve not only their shareholders but all stakeholders, including customers, employees, partners, communities and the environment, to make the world a better place.[55]
In March 2015, Benioff announced Salesforce would cancel all employee programs and travel in the state of Indiana after the passing of SB 101, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a controversial bill which would allow companies and individuals to deny service to LGBT individuals based on religious beliefs.[56] As the largest tech employer in Indiana (following the 2013 acquisition of ExactTarget) Benioff led a global effort of business leaders fighting back against the legislation, ultimately leading to the Indiana State Legislature passing an amendment to the bill containing protections for LGBT customers, tenants and employees.[57]
Benioff led a similar movement in February 2016 against Georgia’s HB 757, the First Amendment Defense Act. He announced that Salesforce would reduce investments in Georgia and cancel an annual conference if the bill was passed as-is.[58] A month later, the Governor vetoed the bill.[59]
In April 2015, Benioff announced that he would be reviewing all salaries at Salesforce to ensure men and women were being paid equally for comparable work.[60] On the heels of the salary assessment, Benioff joined President Barack Obama in January 2016 as he celebrated the anniversary of the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and renewed his call on Congress to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act.[61]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
