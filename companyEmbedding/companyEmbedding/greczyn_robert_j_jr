LipoScience Appoints Robert J. Greczyn Jr. and Dr. Woodrow A. Myers 
      Jr. to Board of Directors




Experienced public health professionals bring extensive and varied 
      experience to company vision






March 28, 2011 09:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



RALEIGH, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--LipoScience, 
      Inc., a highly innovative diagnostic company that is advancing 
      patient care by developing high value proprietary blood tests using 
      nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technology, today announced that Robert 
      J. Greczyn Jr. and Dr. Woodrow Myers Jr. have joined the company’s Board 
      of Directors.
    


      “LipoScience is honored to welcome Bob and Dr. Myers to the board,” said 
      Richard O. Brajer, chief executive officer of LipoScience. “Their 
      experience is unmatched in medical quality initiatives, innovative 
      healthcare management programs and heath insurer understanding. We are 
      confident that their contributions to the board will be effective and 
      enduring.”
    

      Mr. Greczyn is CEO Emeritus of Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina. 
      During his 12 year tenure, company revenue grew from $1.6 billion to 
      $5.2 billion and the customer base increased from 1.5 million to 3.7 
      million. Currently, he serves on the Board of Directors of CivaTech 
      Oncology, The Venue Network and EmpowHR and is a member of the Board of 
      Trustees and immediate past chair at East Carolina University. He is 
      also a Visiting Professor at the Gillings School of Global Public Health 
      at the University of North Carolina. Previously, he served on the Board 
      of Directors of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, The NC Institute 
      of Medicine, The North Carolina New Schools Project and as Chairman of 
      the Board for The Council For Affordable Quality Care (CAQH). Mr. 
      Greczyn also chaired The Research Triangle Regional Partnership, The UNC 
      Chapel Hill School of Public Health's "Carolina First" Campaign 
      Committee and was a member of the Board and executive committee of the 
      NC Chamber.
    

      “LipoScience is leading the way in innovative new approaches for the 
      management of cardiovascular 
      disease,” said Mr. Greczyn. “I welcome the opportunity to help the 
      company broaden access of their proven technology, which has the 
      potential to advance patient care to the tens of millions of people at 
      risk for cardiovascular events.”
    

      Dr. Myers is a nationally recognized leader in the development of 
      medical quality initiatives and innovative healthcare management 
      programs. He currently serves as Managing Director for Myers Ventures 
      LLC, which facilitates his interests in domestic and international 
      healthcare management. In addition, Dr. Myers is a director at the 
      Stanford University Hospital and Clinics, Genomic Health and Express 
      Scripts. He is the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Mozambique 
      Healthcare Consortium and is the former executive vice president and 
      chief medical officer of WellPoint, Inc., where he established the 
      Health Quality Assurance division. Dr. Myers also served as the director 
      of healthcare management at the Ford Motor Company, where he initiated 
      quality assurance metrics for Ford healthcare vendors and established 
      new global health and safety policies to benefit Ford and its employees. 
      He is a former health commissioner for the city of New York and the 
      state of Indiana, past chairman of the Visiting Committee for the 
      Harvard School of Public Health and has served as a member of the 
      Harvard University Board of Overseers and the Stanford University Board 
      of Trustees.
    

      “A growing body of research suggests that for a sizable percentage of 
      the population, LDL cholesterol 
      may not be the best indicator of true cardiovascular risk,” said Dr. 
      Myers. “I believe that LipoScience’s current and future diagnostic tools 
      could represent a paradigm shift in the management of cardiovascular and 
      other metabolic diseases.”
    

      LipoScience retained executive search firm Caldwell Partners, one of 
      North America’s premier providers of executive search, to assist the 
      board in the recruitment of the new Directors.

In 1997, Cigna Corporation acquired Healthsource, Inc.  Prior to that, Mr. Greczyn was President and CEO of Health Plan of Delaware, Ltd. (which was acquired by Principal Health Care, Inc. in 1988, at which time it became Principal Health Care of Delaware, Inc.) from 1986 to 1990.  From March 2011 to November 2014, Mr. Greczyn served on the Board of Directors of Liposcience, Inc., a publicly traded (until its acquisition by Laboratory Corporation of America in November 2014) clinical diagnostic company, where he chaired the compensation committee and was a member of the audit committee.  He also served as the interim President and Chief Executive Officer of Liposcience, Inc. from August 2013 until February 2014, during which time he resigned from his positions on the audit and compensation committees.  In addition, from October 2011 until August 2012, Mr. Greczyn served as a director of M*Modal Inc., a publicly traded (until its acquisition August 2012 by One Equity Partners) provider of interactive clinical documentation and speech understanding technology, where he was a member of the compensation and audit committees.  From 2006 to 2008, Mr. Greczyn was Chairman of the Board of the Council for Affordable Quality Care, an alliance of chief executive officers of the nation's leading health insurers working to simplify healthcare transactions.  Mr. Greczyn received an M.P.H. degree in health policy from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and a B.A. degree in psychology from East Carolina University.


Qualifications:  Mr. Greczyn's specific skills, experience and qualifications to serve as a director of the Company include over 20 years of experience as Chief Executive Officer of three health insurance companies as well as service on the compensation and audit committees of publicly traded companies.  We believe his extensive management experience and knowledge of the managed care industry and his prior public company board experience will provide critical insight to our Board.

                Bob Greczyn            






 


A book that influenced me: “Reminiscences” by General Douglas MacArthur. I read it when I was growing up and it planted the seeds of leadership.
Bob has lived in the Triangle since 1984. He has become one of the most recognized business and community leaders in the region, first by leading Healthsource North Carolina to becoming one of the state’s largest HMOs, then successfully leading Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina for a decade.
The basics in Bob’s resume alone would merit consideration for this award as CEO of the state’s largest health insurer since 2000, leading the resurgence of BCBSNC as a customer-focused company dedicated to improving health, more than doubling annual revenue, increasing the company’s work force to 4,900. When he was promoted to CEO, BCBSNC was struggling to win new customers and had posted total operating losses of almost $180 million in the previous five years. In just a few years time, Bob was recognized as the author of a great turnaround story.
Throughout the decade, the company continued to expand by offering competitive products and by starting health programs designed to improve health. During Bob’s tenure, BCBSNC membership has nearly doubled from 1.9 million at the end of 1999 to 3.7 million today.
But there’s a lot more to consider beyond these business accomplishments. One measure of his success is how laser-focused he has been on improving the health of North Carolinians. For many decades Blue Cross was a transaction-based company, providing insurance plans and paying claims. Bob sharpened the company’s focus on improving the health of its customers, for example, becoming the first health insurer in the nation to provide coverage for obesity and enabling customers to afford needed medications by waiving copayments on generic drugs.
Recognizing that BCBSNC directly touches only about a third of the state’s residents, its customers, Bob found ways to extend that health focus statewide. Early in his tenure Bob was instrumental in creating the Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina Foundation, which has become one of the state’s most significant health-oriented nonprofits. Bob serves as chairman of the foundation, which has invested more than $58 million in improving the health and well-being of North Carolinians. One example of the foundation's success is its commitment to the N.C. Association of Free Clinics. Foundation funds have enabled a 30 percent expansion of the number and reach of free clinics that provide medical care to underserved populations.

Bob has spent as much effort in making the Triangle and North Carolina a better place to live as he has in strengthening Blue Cross. He has championed the company’s support of the United Way, serving for many years on the board of the United Way of the Greater Triangle, including a term as chairman. Bob himself has contributed quite generously to meeting needs in the Triangle through United Way, in addition to spearheading many successful drives among BCBSNC employees ($7.5 million in company and employee contributions over the last 10 years). This is one of many examples of the culture of volunteerism that Bob has fostered at Blue Cross. Employees log more than 25,000 hours each year to help improve the lives of others in their communities.
Bob has announced that he will retire from Blue Cross in January 2010. He’s certainly leaving the company in good shape, having established a strong management team ready to carry forward even in a time of great challenges in health care.
– from nomination by Brad Wilson, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina




 


Q&A with ... Bob Greczyn
What drove you to pursue your goals? I was someone who had a solid work ethic when something excited me. Health care and ultimately health insurance and the ability to impact millions of lives was a driving force.
What accomplishment are you most proud of? There are many accomplishments I am proud of, but being a good husband and father is really important to me and creating opportunities for many people to succeed is also something I am proud of. The creation of the BCBSNC Foundation also stands out.
As a child what did you want to be? I guess I wanted to be lots of different things, with no real focus. I always knew I could be anything I wanted to be if I worked hard enough since that was what I was always told.
What nonprofit and community causes are you most passionate about? I am passionate and involved with many organizations. Part of being successful is an obligation to give back. The United Way of the Greater Triangle, The New Schools Project (focused on changing the nature of high school education and eliminating dropouts) and economic development that keeps North Carolina moving forward (Research Triangle Regional Partnership) are key organizations for me.
What do you see as the biggest challenge facing Triangle leaders in the decade ahead? 
Triangle (and statewide) leaders need to not rest on the successes of the past. We need to remain aggressive, invest in the future, innovate and start taking the education of our children a whole lot more seriously or other states and countries will run us over.
What qualities are going to define tomorrow’s leaders? Tomorrow’s leaders will be much more diverse and will bring new ways of thinking. They will still need passion, a focus on quality, and they will still have to remember that leadership is a team sport.
What’s one thing few people know about you? No clue

Executive Leadership Team - Bob Greczyn





















Robert J. Greczyn, Jr.
Chief Executive Officer Emeritus

Bob Greczyn retired on February 1, 2010 as chief executive officer of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina, the state's largest health insurer. He was succeeded by J. Bradley (Brad) Wilson.
Greczyn joined the company in 1998, bringing 20 years of leadership experience in health care and a solid understanding of the North Carolina health care market. He was named president in 1999 and became CEO in April 2000.
Greczyn helped transform the company's culture to center around a ”Customer Promise“ to simplify, assist and empower. Under his leadership, the company redoubled its efforts to focus on its customers with improved service, customer-friendly products and new tools and information to help them make good decisions about their health. As a result, the company continued to attract new customers and expands its customer base.
In his role at BCBSNC, Greczyn served on both the Board of Trustees for BCBSNC and on the board of the national Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association. He was the chairman of the board of directors for The Council for Affordable Quality Healthcare (CAQH), which is an alliance of the nation's leading health plans working on simplifying health care transactions. In addition, Greczyn was campaign chair of Be Active North Carolina, a grassroots physical fitness campaign designed to help North Carolinians live healthy and active lifestyles. He also chaired the Research Triangle Regional Partnership, the UNC School of Public Health's "Carolina First" Campaign Committee, and was named to the board of directors and executive committee for North Carolina Citizens for Business and Industry (NCCBI). The Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Policy Research named Greczyn a research fellow. He served on the Kate B. Reynolds Charitable Trust Advisory Board, the board and executive committee of the Triangle United Way, and as vice chair of the Board of Trustees at East Carolina University. He has served as a director of the N.C. Institute of Medicine, as past chair of the March of Dimes' Walk America, and on the board of the N.C. New Schools Project.
Greczyn earned a Masters of Public Health from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and a Bachelor of Arts in psychology from East Carolina University. He also completed the executive program in health care finance management at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
