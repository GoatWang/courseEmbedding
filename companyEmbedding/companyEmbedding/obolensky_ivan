Early life[edit]
Obolensky was born in London, Middlesex, on 15 May 1925, to Sergei Platonovich "Serge" Obolensky and Ava Alice Muriel Astor. Through his mother, he is a great-great-great-grandson of John Jacob Astor and the elder grandson of John Jacob Astor IV, who died on the RMS Titanic.[1]
Ivan was educated at St. George's School in Newport, Rhode Island, and graduated from Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, in 1947. While at Yale, he was a member of St. Elmo, a senior secret society.
Career[edit]
After Yale, Obolensky became a writer working for Telavid Inc. Imports, and went on to serve with the United States Navy as a pilot. In 1957, he formed a publishing firm McDowell, Obolensky Inc. with a partner, David McDowell. The firm published James Agee's Pulitzer Prize novel, A Death in the Family (1957), and was the U.S. publisher for Chinua Achebe's Things Fall Apart (1959). It was dissolved in 1960. Obolensky then formed a second publishing house, Ivan Obolensky, Inc. This firm continued through 1965, when he joined the investment banking firm of A. T. Brod & Company as a partner.[1]
Throughout his main career on Wall Street as a financial analyst, Obolensky has covered many prestigious accounts. He was Vice President of Moseley, Hallgarten, Estabrook & Weeden Inc., Stock brokers and is currently Vice President of Shields & Company. Obolensky is an active member of the philanthropic community in New York. He has, for many years, been an active supporter of the Soldiers', Sailors', Marines', Coast Guard and Airmen's Club,[2] and New York's International Debutante Ball,[3] which benefits the club. He is also Treasurer of the Russian Nobility Association in America, Inc.,[4] and the US Prior of the Orthodox Order of St. John.[5]
Marriages and children[edit]
Obolensky first married in New York City on 10 October 1949 to Claire Elizabeth McGinnis (born in San Francisco, California, on 7 March 1929).[6] The marriage ended in divorce in 1956.[7] She was educated at the Convent of the Sacred Heart in San Francisco, California, United States, the Finch Junior College in Manhattan, New York City, and at Miss Burke's School in San Francisco. Claire was the daughter of Felix Signoret McGinnis (25 January 1883 – 17 March 1945), Vice-President of the Southern Pacific Company and Director of the Los Angeles Turf Club, Inc., and wife (m. June 1917) Clara Leonhardt (14 April 1887 – 25 January 1984). Claire later married secondly Garrick C. Stephenson (1927 – 3 February 2007), without issue.[7]
On 22 October 1959, he married Mary Elizabeth Morris (16 January 1934 – 21 August 2006).[8][9]
Ivan has one daughter and two sons by his first marriage, and one son by his second marriage:

Princess Marina Ivanovna Obolensky (born 31 October 1951), married N. Carlton
Prince Ivan Ivanovich Obolensky (born 22 June 1952), married without issue

Even if there were such a thing as a typical Wall Street investment banker, Ivan Obolensky, the senior vice president of research for Josephthal & Company, would not be it. That is, not unless the typical investment banker was also the London-born son of a Russian prince and a grandson of John Jacob Astor, who is said to have been the wealthiest man in America when he went down with the Titanic.

Shields & Co.


                  Shields believes that a mid-cap value equity strategy can enhance investment performance in up markets and help protect capital in down markets by focusing on stocks that are significantly undervalued by the market, have the liquidity and financial stability associated with large-cap companies and possess the attractive growth characteristics of small-cap companies. The firm believes that investment risk can be managed by over- and underweighting economic sectors in accordance with economic conditions.The firm's investment process combines economic and industry insights with rigorous fundamental, quantitative and technical analysis of individual companies and their stocks. They identify economic sectors most likely to benefit from market conditions. Shields economic analysis looks at interest rate forecast, inflationary outlook and probable market direction. They next analyze the impact of interest rates on industries. Shields industry analysis also includes reviewing and analyzing industry reports and trade publications to identify major trends.Next, the firm narrows their universe of mid-cap stocks value stocks employing a multi factor model that seeks low price-to-cash flow, low p/e, moderate debt-to-total capitalization, high ROE and low price-to-asset value. Shields then reduces the value subset to a buy list via fundamental analysis that looks at balance sheets, income and cash flow. Their active due diligence process includes meeting with management, contacting competition and performing a quantitative/technical review. These analysis criteria include relative performance, insider trades, earnings momentum and technical position.For their sell process, every stock is assigned a two-year price objective. Via fundamental analysis, Shields determines whether a stock is overvalued and will sell if fundamentals have not changed. They liquidate their position in a company if its management loses focus, diversifies into unrelated business or sells off its best assets. All research is conducted in-house.

Capital Management Associates LLC


                  Capital Management Associates (CMA) seeks to generate superior investment returns through strategic overweighing in selected industry groups, especially those that appear particularly attractive within key economic sectors. The firm's investment approach is based on sector and industry group weightings, however their process begins with the evaluation of individual stocks.CMA's stocks selection process begins with a universe of approximately 15,000 stocks that include large-, mid- and small-cap issues. Stocks are classified according to price rankings, value rankings and timeliness rankings. Their price rankings based on the price performance of all stocks within the universe, which are ranked from the most too least favorable. The firm's volume rankings based on comparisons from historical volume data points to current volume data points. CMA's timeliness rankings based on an arithmetic average of the timeliness ranking of the Value Line universe of stocks.Once sector and industry groups have been selected, CMA screens purchase candidates first by a set of company fundamental characteristics to determine if the candidate is a good company. Purchase candidates are then screened by a set of technical factors to determine if the candidate is a good stock. The firm tens to invest in stocks with market-cap weightings of $5 billion to $ 33 billion, although they may occasionally purchase smaller issues due to a lack of larger candidates available in a particular industry group.Though not limited by sector, CMA tends to invest in the stocks of companies in the stocks of US mid-cap and large-cap companies in the electronic technology, producer manufacturing and energy minerals sectors. The firm maintains a very high turnover rate.

"The Media Business: Financial Analyst of Publishing Companies Who's Done a Thing or Two". New York Times. Even if there were such a thing as a typical Wall Street investment banker, Ivan Obolensky, the senior vice president of research for Josephthal & Company, would not be it. That is, not unless the typical investment banker was also the London-born son of a Russian prince and a grandson of John Jacob Astor, who is said to have been the wealthiest man in America when he went down with the Titanic.
