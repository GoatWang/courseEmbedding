Early life[edit]
Card was born on May 10, 1947 in Brockton, Massachusetts,[1] the son of Joyce (née Whitaker) and Andrew Hill Card, Sr.[2] He was active in the Boy Scouts of America's Old Colony Council and earned the rank of Life Scout. Later, he graduated from the University of South Carolina with a Bachelor of Science in engineering. He also attended the United States Merchant Marine Academy and the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.[3] Card served as a United States Merchant Marine from 1966 to 1967.
Career[edit]
Card got his start in politics serving in the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1975 to 1983. He ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination for Governor of Massachusetts in 1982.
Private career[edit]
From 1993 to 1998, Card was President and chief executive officer of the American Automobile Manufacturers Association (AAMA), the trade association whose members were Chrysler Corporation, Ford Motor Company and General Motors Corporation. The AAMA dissolved in December 1998. From 1999 until his selection as President Bush's Chief of Staff, Card was General Motors' Vice President of Government Relations. Card directed the company's international, national, state and local government affairs activities and represented GM on matters of public policy before Congress and the Administration.
He serves on the Board of Directors of Union Pacific Railroad. The railroad announced on July 27, 2006 that Card was elected to the board, increasing the board's size to 10 members.[4] He is also a senior counselor at public relations firm Fleishman-Hillard.[5]
Government career[edit]
Under Ronald Reagan[edit]
Card first served in the West Wing under President Ronald Reagan, as Special Assistant to the President for Intergovernmental Affairs and subsequently as Deputy Assistant to the President, and Director of Intergovernmental Affairs, where he was liaison to governors, statewide elected officials, state legislators, mayors and other elected officials.
Under George H. W. Bush[edit]
From 1989 to 1992, Card served in President George H. W. Bush's administration as Assistant to the President and Deputy Chief of Staff. From 1992 until 1993, Card served as the 11th U.S. Secretary of Transportation under President Bush. In August 1992, at the request of President Bush, Secretary Card coordinated the administration's disaster relief efforts in the wake of Hurricane Andrew. Later that year, Secretary Card directed President Bush's transition office during the transition from the Bush Administration to the Clinton Administration.
Under George W. Bush[edit]
In 2000, Card was asked by Texas Governor George W. Bush to run the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia.
On November 26, 2000, Card was appointed to be chief of staff for President-elect George W. Bush upon Bush's January 20, 2001 inauguration.
On September 11, 2001, it was Card who famously approached Bush as he was visiting Emma E. Booker Elementary School in Sarasota, Florida, and whispered in his ear the news that a second plane had hit the World Trade Center, confirming that a terrorist attack was underway.[6] Card later recounted his story, saying that he whispered "A second plane has hit the second tower. America is under attack."[7]
On March 28, 2006, the White House announced that Card would resign as Chief of Staff and be replaced by United States Office of Management and Budget director Joshua B. Bolten.[8] Card's resignation was effective April 14, 2006.[9]




Card, along with George W. Bush, Laura Bush, Bill Clinton, George H. W. Bush, and Condoleezza Rice pay their respects to Pope John Paul II before the pope's funeral.


Post-government career[edit]
Card received an honorary degree from the University of Massachusetts Amherst on May 25, 2007. While accepting the degree, Card was booed loudly by students and faculty who disapproved of him receiving the honor.[10]
Card considered running in the 2010 special election to fill the United States Senate seat held by Ted Kennedy, who had died in office. State Senator Scott Brown, who considered entering the race, promised to drop out if Card decided to run.[11] Card announced on September 11, 2009 that he would not enter the race and that he was throwing his support to Brown, who went on to win the election.[12]
On July 5, 2011, Card was named acting dean of The Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University.[13]
It was announced on November 25, 2014 that Card had been selected as the fifth president of Franklin Pierce University in Rindge, New Hampshire.[14] He began his tenure in December 2014, and resigned in summer of 2016.

Early life[edit]
Card was born on May 10, 1947 in Brockton, Massachusetts,[1] the son of Joyce (née Whitaker) and Andrew Hill Card, Sr.[2] He was active in the Boy Scouts of America's Old Colony Council and earned the rank of Life Scout.

Card got his start in politics serving in the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1975 to 1983. He ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination for Governor of Massachusetts in 1982.
Private career[edit]
From 1993 to 1998, Card was President and chief executive officer of the American Automobile Manufacturers Association (AAMA), the trade association whose members were Chrysler Corporation, Ford Motor Company and General Motors Corporation. The AAMA dissolved in December 1998. From 1999 until his selection as President Bush's Chief of Staff, Card was General Motors' Vice President of Government Relations. Card directed the company's international, national, state and local government affairs activities and represented GM on matters of public policy before Congress and the Administration.
He serves on the Board of Directors of Union Pacific Railroad. The railroad announced on July 27, 2006 that Card was elected to the board, increasing the board's size to 10 members.[4] He is also a senior counselor at public relations firm Fleishman-Hillard.[5]

In 2000, Card was asked by Texas Governor George W. Bush to run the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia.
On November 26, 2000, Card was appointed to be chief of staff for President-elect George W. Bush upon Bush's January 20, 2001 inauguration.

Early life[edit]
Card was born on May 10, 1947 in Brockton, Massachusetts,[1] the son of Joyce (née Whitaker) and Andrew Hill Card, Sr.[2] He was active in the Boy Scouts of America's Old Colony Council and earned the rank of Life Scout. Later, he graduated from the University of South Carolina with a Bachelor of Science in engineering. He also attended the United States Merchant Marine Academy and the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.[3] Card served as a United States Merchant Marine from 1966 to 1967.
Career[edit]
Card got his start in politics serving in the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1975 to 1983. He ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination for Governor of Massachusetts in 1982.
Private career[edit]
From 1993 to 1998, Card was President and chief executive officer of the American Automobile Manufacturers Association (AAMA), the trade association whose members were Chrysler Corporation, Ford Motor Company and General Motors Corporation. The AAMA dissolved in December 1998. From 1999 until his selection as President Bush's Chief of Staff, Card was General Motors' Vice President of Government Relations. Card directed the company's international, national, state and local government affairs activities and represented GM on matters of public policy before Congress and the Administration.
He serves on the Board of Directors of Union Pacific Railroad. The railroad announced on July 27, 2006 that Card was elected to the board, increasing the board's size to 10 members.[4] He is also a senior counselor at public relations firm Fleishman-Hillard.[5]
Government career[edit]
Under Ronald Reagan[edit]
Card first served in the West Wing under President Ronald Reagan, as Special Assistant to the President for Intergovernmental Affairs and subsequently as Deputy Assistant to the President, and Director of Intergovernmental Affairs, where he was liaison to governors, statewide elected officials, state legislators, mayors and other elected officials.
Under George H. W. Bush[edit]
From 1989 to 1992, Card served in President George H. W. Bush's administration as Assistant to the President and Deputy Chief of Staff. From 1992 until 1993, Card served as the 11th U.S. Secretary of Transportation under President Bush. In August 1992, at the request of President Bush, Secretary Card coordinated the administration's disaster relief efforts in the wake of Hurricane Andrew. Later that year, Secretary Card directed President Bush's transition office during the transition from the Bush Administration to the Clinton Administration.
Under George W. Bush[edit]
In 2000, Card was asked by Texas Governor George W. Bush to run the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia.
On November 26, 2000, Card was appointed to be chief of staff for President-elect George W. Bush upon Bush's January 20, 2001 inauguration.
On September 11, 2001, it was Card who famously approached Bush as he was visiting Emma E. Booker Elementary School in Sarasota, Florida, and whispered in his ear the news that a second plane had hit the World Trade Center, confirming that a terrorist attack was underway.[6] Card later recounted his story, saying that he whispered "A second plane has hit the second tower. America is under attack."[7]
On March 28, 2006, the White House announced that Card would resign as Chief of Staff and be replaced by United States Office of Management and Budget director Joshua B. Bolten.[8] Card's resignation was effective April 14, 2006.[9]




Card, along with George W. Bush, Laura Bush, Bill Clinton, George H. W. Bush, and Condoleezza Rice pay their respects to Pope John Paul II before the pope's funeral.


Post-government career[edit]
Card received an honorary degree from the University of Massachusetts Amherst on May 25, 2007. While accepting the degree, Card was booed loudly by students and faculty who disapproved of him receiving the honor.[10]
Card considered running in the 2010 special election to fill the United States Senate seat held by Ted Kennedy, who had died in office. State Senator Scott Brown, who considered entering the race, promised to drop out if Card decided to run.[11] Card announced on September 11, 2009 that he would not enter the race and that he was throwing his support to Brown, who went on to win the election.[12]
On July 5, 2011, Card was named acting dean of The Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University.[13]
It was announced on November 25, 2014 that Card had been selected as the fifth president of Franklin Pierce University in Rindge, New Hampshire.[14] He began his tenure in December 2014, and resigned in summer of 2016.

Under George W. Bush[edit]
In 2000, Card was asked by Texas Governor George W. Bush to run the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia.
On November 26, 2000, Card was appointed to be chief of staff for President-elect George W. Bush upon Bush's January 20, 2001 inauguration.
On September 11, 2001, it was Card who famously approached Bush as he was visiting Emma E. Booker Elementary School in Sarasota, Florida, and whispered in his ear the news that a second plane had hit the World Trade Center, confirming that a terrorist attack was underway.[6] Card later recounted his story, saying that he whispered "A second plane has hit the second tower. America is under attack."[7]
On March 28, 2006, the White House announced that Card would resign as Chief of Staff and be replaced by United States Office of Management and Budget director Joshua B. Bolten.[8] Card's resignation was effective April 14, 2006.[9]




Card, along with George W. Bush, Laura Bush, Bill Clinton, George H. W. Bush, and Condoleezza Rice pay their respects to Pope John Paul II before the pope's funeral.


Post-government career[edit]
Card received an honorary degree from the University of Massachusetts Amherst on May 25, 2007. While accepting the degree, Card was booed loudly by students and faculty who disapproved of him receiving the honor.[10]
Card considered running in the 2010 special election to fill the United States Senate seat held by Ted Kennedy, who had died in office. State Senator Scott Brown, who considered entering the race, promised to drop out if Card decided to run.[11] Card announced on September 11, 2009 that he would not enter the race and that he was throwing his support to Brown, who went on to win the election.[12]
On July 5, 2011, Card was named acting dean of The Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University.[13]
It was announced on November 25, 2014 that Card had been selected as the fifth president of Franklin Pierce University in Rindge, New Hampshire.[14] He began his tenure in December 2014, and resigned in summer of 2016.

Early life[edit]
Card was born on May 10, 1947 in Brockton, Massachusetts,[1] the son of Joyce (née Whitaker) and Andrew Hill Card, Sr.[2] He was active in the Boy Scouts of America's Old Colony Council and earned the rank of Life Scout. Later, he graduated from the University of South Carolina with a Bachelor of Science in engineering. He also attended the United States Merchant Marine Academy and the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.[3] Card served as a United States Merchant Marine from 1966 to 1967.
Career[edit]
Card got his start in politics serving in the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1975 to 1983. He ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination for Governor of Massachusetts in 1982.
Private career[edit]
From 1993 to 1998, Card was President and chief executive officer of the American Automobile Manufacturers Association (AAMA), the trade association whose members were Chrysler Corporation, Ford Motor Company and General Motors Corporation. The AAMA dissolved in December 1998. From 1999 until his selection as President Bush's Chief of Staff, Card was General Motors' Vice President of Government Relations. Card directed the company's international, national, state and local government affairs activities and represented GM on matters of public policy before Congress and the Administration.
He serves on the Board of Directors of Union Pacific Railroad. The railroad announced on July 27, 2006 that Card was elected to the board, increasing the board's size to 10 members.[4] He is also a senior counselor at public relations firm Fleishman-Hillard.[5]
Government career[edit]
Under Ronald Reagan[edit]
Card first served in the West Wing under President Ronald Reagan, as Special Assistant to the President for Intergovernmental Affairs and subsequently as Deputy Assistant to the President, and Director of Intergovernmental Affairs, where he was liaison to governors, statewide elected officials, state legislators, mayors and other elected officials.
Under George H. W. Bush[edit]
From 1989 to 1992, Card served in President George H. W. Bush's administration as Assistant to the President and Deputy Chief of Staff. From 1992 until 1993, Card served as the 11th U.S. Secretary of Transportation under President Bush. In August 1992, at the request of President Bush, Secretary Card coordinated the administration's disaster relief efforts in the wake of Hurricane Andrew. Later that year, Secretary Card directed President Bush's transition office during the transition from the Bush Administration to the Clinton Administration.
Under George W. Bush[edit]
In 2000, Card was asked by Texas Governor George W. Bush to run the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia.
On November 26, 2000, Card was appointed to be chief of staff for President-elect George W. Bush upon Bush's January 20, 2001 inauguration.
On September 11, 2001, it was Card who famously approached Bush as he was visiting Emma E. Booker Elementary School in Sarasota, Florida, and whispered in his ear the news that a second plane had hit the World Trade Center, confirming that a terrorist attack was underway.[6] Card later recounted his story, saying that he whispered "A second plane has hit the second tower. America is under attack."[7]
On March 28, 2006, the White House announced that Card would resign as Chief of Staff and be replaced by United States Office of Management and Budget director Joshua B. Bolten.[8] Card's resignation was effective April 14, 2006.[9]




Card, along with George W. Bush, Laura Bush, Bill Clinton, George H. W. Bush, and Condoleezza Rice pay their respects to Pope John Paul II before the pope's funeral.


Post-government career[edit]
Card received an honorary degree from the University of Massachusetts Amherst on May 25, 2007. While accepting the degree, Card was booed loudly by students and faculty who disapproved of him receiving the honor.[10]
Card considered running in the 2010 special election to fill the United States Senate seat held by Ted Kennedy, who had died in office. State Senator Scott Brown, who considered entering the race, promised to drop out if Card decided to run.[11] Card announced on September 11, 2009 that he would not enter the race and that he was throwing his support to Brown, who went on to win the election.[12]
On July 5, 2011, Card was named acting dean of The Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University.[13]
It was announced on November 25, 2014 that Card had been selected as the fifth president of Franklin Pierce University in Rindge, New Hampshire.[14] He began his tenure in December 2014, and resigned in summer of 2016.

Early life[edit]
Card was born on May 10, 1947 in Brockton, Massachusetts,[1] the son of Joyce (née Whitaker) and Andrew Hill Card, Sr.[2] He was active in the Boy Scouts of America's Old Colony Council and earned the rank of Life Scout. Later, he graduated from the University of South Carolina with a Bachelor of Science in engineering. He also attended the United States Merchant Marine Academy and the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.[3] Card served as a United States Merchant Marine from 1966 to 1967.
Career[edit]
Card got his start in politics serving in the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1975 to 1983. He ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination for Governor of Massachusetts in 1982.
Private career[edit]
From 1993 to 1998, Card was President and chief executive officer of the American Automobile Manufacturers Association (AAMA), the trade association whose members were Chrysler Corporation, Ford Motor Company and General Motors Corporation. The AAMA dissolved in December 1998. From 1999 until his selection as President Bush's Chief of Staff, Card was General Motors' Vice President of Government Relations. Card directed the company's international, national, state and local government affairs activities and represented GM on matters of public policy before Congress and the Administration.
He serves on the Board of Directors of Union Pacific Railroad. The railroad announced on July 27, 2006 that Card was elected to the board, increasing the board's size to 10 members.[4] He is also a senior counselor at public relations firm Fleishman-Hillard.[5]
Government career[edit]
Under Ronald Reagan[edit]
Card first served in the West Wing under President Ronald Reagan, as Special Assistant to the President for Intergovernmental Affairs and subsequently as Deputy Assistant to the President, and Director of Intergovernmental Affairs, where he was liaison to governors, statewide elected officials, state legislators, mayors and other elected officials.
Under George H. W. Bush[edit]
From 1989 to 1992, Card served in President George H. W. Bush's administration as Assistant to the President and Deputy Chief of Staff. From 1992 until 1993, Card served as the 11th U.S. Secretary of Transportation under President Bush. In August 1992, at the request of President Bush, Secretary Card coordinated the administration's disaster relief efforts in the wake of Hurricane Andrew. Later that year, Secretary Card directed President Bush's transition office during the transition from the Bush Administration to the Clinton Administration.
Under George W. Bush[edit]
In 2000, Card was asked by Texas Governor George W. Bush to run the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia.
On November 26, 2000, Card was appointed to be chief of staff for President-elect George W. Bush upon Bush's January 20, 2001 inauguration.
On September 11, 2001, it was Card who famously approached Bush as he was visiting Emma E. Booker Elementary School in Sarasota, Florida, and whispered in his ear the news that a second plane had hit the World Trade Center, confirming that a terrorist attack was underway.[6] Card later recounted his story, saying that he whispered "A second plane has hit the second tower. America is under attack."[7]
On March 28, 2006, the White House announced that Card would resign as Chief of Staff and be replaced by United States Office of Management and Budget director Joshua B. Bolten.[8] Card's resignation was effective April 14, 2006.[9]




Card, along with George W. Bush, Laura Bush, Bill Clinton, George H. W. Bush, and Condoleezza Rice pay their respects to Pope John Paul II before the pope's funeral.


Post-government career[edit]
Card received an honorary degree from the University of Massachusetts Amherst on May 25, 2007. While accepting the degree, Card was booed loudly by students and faculty who disapproved of him receiving the honor.[10]
Card considered running in the 2010 special election to fill the United States Senate seat held by Ted Kennedy, who had died in office. State Senator Scott Brown, who considered entering the race, promised to drop out if Card decided to run.[11] Card announced on September 11, 2009 that he would not enter the race and that he was throwing his support to Brown, who went on to win the election.[12]
On July 5, 2011, Card was named acting dean of The Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University.[13]
It was announced on November 25, 2014 that Card had been selected as the fifth president of Franklin Pierce University in Rindge, New Hampshire.[14] He began his tenure in December 2014, and resigned in summer of 2016.

White House officials said today that the administration was following a meticulously planned strategy to persuade the public, the Congress and the allies of the need to confront the threat from Saddam Hussein.The rollout of the strategy this week, they said, was planned long before President Bush's vacation in Texas last month. It was not hastily concocted, they insisted, after some prominent Republicans began to raise doubts about moving against Mr. Hussein and administration officials made contradictory statements about the need for weapons inspectors in Iraq.The White House decided, they said, that even with the appearance of disarray it was still more advantageous to wait until after Labor Day to kick off their plan.''From a marketing point of view,'' said Andrew H. Card Jr., the White House chief of staff who is coordinating the effort, ''you don't introduce new products in August.''

A centerpiece of the strategy, White House officials said, is to use Mr. Bush's speech on Sept. 11 to help move Americans toward support of action against Iraq, which could come early next year. Continue reading the main story

''Everybody felt that was a moment that Americans wanted to hear from him,'' said Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's chief political adviser. Sept. 11 will also be a time, Mr. Rove said, ''to seize the moment to make clear what lies ahead.''Toward that end, in June the White House picked Ellis Island in New York Harbor, not Governors Island, as the place where President Bush is to deliver his Sept. 11 address to the nation. Both spots were considered, White House advisers said, but the television camera angles were more spectacular from Ellis Island, where the Statue of Liberty will be seen aglow behind Mr. Bush.''We had made a decision that this would be a compelling story either place,'' said Dan Bartlett, the White House communications director. ''We sent a team out to go and look and they said, 'This is a better shot,' and we said O.K.''In the same way, Mr. Bush's Sept. 11 remarks, about 10 minutes in length, are to serve as the emotional precursor for a tougher speech about Iraq that the president is to deliver to the United Nations General Assembly the following day.''The fact is, there's a pretty abysmal relationship between Saddam Hussein and the United Nations,'' said Mr. Bartlett, who added that Mr. Hussein had flouted ''everything the U.N. has stood for.''''The president is going to be very direct and articulate a history of defiance,'' Mr. Bartlett said.Both speeches are in final drafts, although Mr. Bush spent time reviewing the United Nations speech on Thursday night on Air Force One as he returned to Washington from Indiana. ''He's trimming it up so it's in his cadence,'' Mr. Rove said.

The Sept. 12 speech, a half hour or less in length, was written by a team that included Mr. Bush's chief speechwriter, Michael Gerson; Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser; Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld; and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell. The Sept. 11 speech was written by Mr. Gerson and Karen P. Hughes, the former counselor who still closely advises Mr. Bush from Texas.On Capitol Hill, meanwhile, the administration has begun a full-scale lobbying campaign. On the day after Labor Day, the opening of Washington's political new year, Mr. Bush summoned a skeptical Congressional leadership to the White House to enlist their support for action against Iraq. The next day two dozen senators from both parties were invited to the Pentagon to discuss Iraqi policy with Vice President Dick Cheney, Mr. Rumsfeld and George J. Tenet, the director of central intelligence.

Later in the day, Mr. Cheney and Mr. Tenet gave evidence on Iraqi military capacity to the top four Congressional leaders, some of whom have said the administration has provided no proof that the threat from Mr. Hussein is imminent.''That was thought of as a necessary step, as was having the leadership down, as was the necessity of providing a higher level of intelligence,'' Mr. Rove said.Another senior administration official said the White House lobbying campaign on Capitol Hill would include not-so-subtle mentions of the regrets experienced by those lawmakers, like former Senator Sam Nunn, who did not vote for the 1991 ''use of force'' resolution before the Persian Gulf war.The White House wants a resolution approving the use of force in Iraq to be approved in the next four to five weeks.''In the end it will be difficult for someone to vote against it,'' the administration official said.White House officials said they began planning more intensively for the Iraq rollout in July. Advisers consulted the Congressional calendar to figure out the best time for Iraq hearings while Ms. Hughes, even as she was driving back to Texas, discussed with Mr. Bush the outlines of his Sept. 11 speech.By August, with Congress out of town and the United Nations not convening until September, White House officials decided to wait out the month, even as final planning continued by phone between advisers in Washington and at Mr. Bush's ranch in Texas.

''There was a deliberate sense that this was not the time to engage in his process,'' Mr. Rove said. ''The thought was in August the president is sort of on vacation.''White House officials refused to say today whether Mr. Bush would build on his United Nations speech and directly address the nation about his planned course in Iraq. ''Stay tuned,'' Mr. Bartlett said.But some Republicans said that a speech to the nation was inevitable and necessary.''At some time, they're going to have to talk directly to the people,'' said Michael K. Deaver, President Ronald Reagan's longtime communications strategist. ''Because I think that people expect to hear from their commander in chief.''But Mr. Deaver, who helped create the stage for Mr. Reagan's 1980 presidential announcement speech in Battery Park, with the Statue of Liberty as a backdrop, said the White House had done well in setting the agenda after a chaotic August.''They have had a history of doing it their way, and doing it very well from a communications standpoint,'' Mr. Deaver said. ''Once they get started, and once it is clearly part of a strategic plan, it moves well.'' Continue reading the main story

Invasion of Iraq
Card helped coordinate the White House campaign for the 2003 invasion of Iraq. In September 2002, the New York Times quoted Card as saying, "From a marketing point of view you don't introduce new products in August." Card was explaining what the Times characterized as a "meticulously planned strategy to persuade the public, the Congress, and the allies of the need to confront the threat from Saddam Hussein." George W. Bush credited Card with the idea for Bush's brief visit to 600 U.S. soldiers celebrating Thanksgiving in Baghdad in 2003.[3]
Profiles
Andrew H. Card, Jr. (b. May 10, 1947) served as Secretary of Transportation under President George Herbert Walker Bush (1992), and was Chief of Staff during the presidential transition in 2000-2001.
Card has also served as director of government affairs at General Motors Corp. (1999-2000); president and CEO, American Automobile Manufacturers Association (1993-1998); assistant to the president and deputy White House chief of staff (1989-92); New Hampshire primary campaign manager for George W. Bush (1987-88); special assistant to President Ronald Reagan for intergovernmental affairs (1983-87); candidate for Massachusetts governor (1983); various Massachusetts elected and appointed offices, including state legislator (1971-82); structural design engineer (1971-75). He received a B.S. in engineering from U.S.C. in 1971.[4]
On December 16, 2000, the Associated Press reported that Card "already has Bush family and White House credentials.

"He was President Ronald Reagan's liaison to the nation's governors and then, after George Bush (the president-elect's father) was elected president in 1988, Card stayed on as assistant to chief of staff John Sununu. He later became transportation secretary."


"Card's history with the Bush family began in 1980" when he, Andrew Natsios ("a Card confidant" and then "in charge of Boston's massive 'Big Dig' highway project") and Paul Cellucci -- the incumbent Massachusetts governor who is believed to be in line for a Bush administration job -- led the elder George Bush's presidential campaign in Massachusetts."


"Card, after a failed run for governor in 1982, joined Reagan's administration and stayed through Bush's. ... After the Democrats won the White House in 1992, Card helped organize the transition, then found a lobbying job with the American Automobile Manufacturers Association, representing the big three U.S. car companies.


"That led to a job as director of government affairs for General Motors for Card, who lives in Holbrook, Mass. He took a leave of absence when the Bush family came calling again."


George W. Bush "sought him out to coordinate the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia. Card is credited with staging a seamless political coronation with no intraparty squabbling." Card's second in command at the convention was Republican consultant Ed Gillespie.


"In 1980, Card also helped form the Ward Commission, which investigated corruption in construction of the Boston campus of the University of Massachusetts."
