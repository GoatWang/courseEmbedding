Multi-industry executive brings broad, global experience








Her background is an excellent fit for us as we increase our focus on the growth of our businesses and building a world-class organization that attracts and retains the best talent.


Memphis, Tenn. (PRWEB)
December 18, 2013
 The ServiceMaster Company, one of the world’s largest residential and commercial service networks, announced today Susan Hunsberger has been named senior vice president of human resources. She will report to ServiceMaster Chief Executive Officer Robert Gillette.
Hunsberger joins ServiceMaster from Connecticut-based Nielsen, a $5.4 billion global information and measurement company with leading market positions in marketing and consumer information, television and other media measurement, online intelligence and mobile measurement. Hunsberger served as senior vice president, human resources, for the global business solutions (GBS) group of Nielsen, and supported Nielsen’s transition from a private to a public company.
“Susan has a strong record of building high-performing teams and driving results in talent management, organization design and capability, change management and employee relations,” said Gillette. “Her background is an excellent fit for us as we increase our focus on the growth of our businesses and building a world-class organization that attracts and retains the best talent.” 
Prior to working for Nielsen, Hunsberger spent more than 12 years in a variety of HR leadership positions at GE Aviation, an operating unit of General Electric Company based in Cincinnati. Among her assignments at GE Aviation, was leading the HR team for the $2 billion global technology group, with overall responsibility for HR strategy and plans, and 6,000 employees across 15 sites, including India, Poland, Turkey, Mexico and China. Before GE, she worked in HR roles at Johnson & Johnson and Marathon Oil. 
Hunsberger holds a bachelor’s degree in accountancy and personnel management from Miami (Ohio) University, and a master’s degree in organizational development from Bowling Green State University.
Hunsberger is succeeding Jed Norden, who has been ServiceMaster’s senior vice president of human resources since 2008, and recently announced his retirement. “I want to thank Jed for his many contributions to ServiceMaster over the past five-and-a-half years,” said Gillette. “He’s been a stabilizing influence during a period of tremendous business and leadership changes, and helped build a stronger, more talented HR team that put our associates at the center of everything we do. He’s touched virtually every aspect of organizational growth – always with a view toward making ServiceMaster a more competitive company and a more attractive place to work.”  
About ServiceMaster
With a global network of more than 7,300 company-owned, franchised and licensed locations, Memphis-based ServiceMaster is one of the world's largest residential service networks. The company's high-profile brands are Terminix, TruGreen, American Home Shield, ServiceMaster Clean, Merry Maids, Furniture Medic and AmeriSpec. Through approximately 21,000 corporate associates and a franchise network that independently employs over 31,000 additional people, the ServiceMaster family of brands provided services and products to approximately 8 million customers during the last 12 months.

Susan Hunsberger
Senior Vice President, Human Resources

Susan Hunsberger joined ServiceMaster in December 2013 as senior vice president of human resources.
Hunsberger joined ServiceMaster with broad global experience in a variety of industries, including market research, aviation, medical devices, and oil and gas. Most recently, she served as senior vice president, human resources, for the global business solutions group of Nielsen, a $5.4 billion global information and measurement company. There, Hunsberger built a strong record of building high-performing teams and driving results in talent management, organization design and capability, change management and employee relations.
Prior to Nielsen, Hunsberger spent more than 12 years in HR leadership positions at GE Aviation, a division of General Electric Company, and she also held several other roles in organization and executive leadership, supporting IT, manufacturing, and sales and marketing. Before GE, she worked in HR roles at Johnson & Johnson and Marathon Oil.
Hunsberger holds a bachelor's degree in accountancy and personnel management from Miami (Ohio) University and a master's degree in organizational development from Bowling Green State University.

When a company is eyeing a relocation, a loss of talent is always a risk. Which employees will want to make the move and who won't?
This week’s Memphis Business Journal cover story, " The secret heroes behind ServiceMaster's decision to stay," looks at everyone and everything that went into ServiceMaster Global Holdings Inc.’s decision to relocate to Downtown Memphis. And, one factor that weighed heavily on that choice was the company’s staff.

Susan Hunsberger, senior vice president of human resources for ServiceMaster, said any time a company relocates, it loses talent.




“By staying here, you minimize the disruption to the business; you provide great opportunities for your employees that are here and reinforce the message that Memphis is where we want to be — it’s a stabilizing factor,” Hunsberger said. “People know you are going to be here; they know that you are obviously doing well … that you are growing. We are undergoing a culture change, and just pivoting from a suburban location to an urban location was something we really weren’t going to be able to do in these other locations [outside of Memphis]. So being urban, being part of the Memphis revitalization, being able to keep our brain trust of employees, that was something that all worked out for us.”
ServiceMaster, which includes the American Home Shield, AmeriSpec, Furniture Medic, Merry Maids, ServiceMaster Clean, ServiceMaster Restore and Terminix brands, announced in June 2016 its plans to stay in Memphis and move from its current Ridge Lake Boulevard properties in East Memphis to the vacant Peabody Place mall.
A year later, the company’s innovation center, Ground Floor at ServiceMaster, opened in the former Tower Records space at Peabody Place. The innovation center — 20,000 square feet of the more than 300,000-square-foot building — is split into sections for both ServiceMaster employees and local entrepreneurs.




 


Work is now underway on the remaining office space, which is slated to be finished by the end of 2017. The big move will bring 1,200 ServiceMaster employees to the city’s core.

After the Downtown announcement, ServiceMaster kicked off several employee-lead committees to help people prepare for the move, and identify items they would like to see in a new work environment. These groups, which Hunsberger said serve as ambassadors to the rest of the employees, helped familiarize staffers with Downtown and kept everyone updated on the headquarter's progress.
Hunsberger said a move Downtown — even if it is in the same city — is still a big deal for people, which is why the company wanted to ensure everyone is prepared. Long-term, she said the relocation should be a key asset for recruitment.
“We know this is a trend across the country,” Hunsberger said. “People want to be at the center of action. They want to be able to walk to work, walk to restaurants, walk to entertainment, and I think just by being more contemporary and in-line with what people want, we will become a very attractive employer to people that maybe wouldn’t have before because they like the urban environment and they can see us every day. We will be front and center there.”
