			J. Taft Symonds has served as a director of PAGP GP since November 2016. He served as a director of PAA's general partner from June 2001 until November 2016. Mr. Symonds is Chairman of the Board of Symonds Investment Company, Inc. (a private investment firm). From 1978 to 2004 he was Chairman of the Board and Chief Financial Officer of Maurice Pincoffs Company, Inc. (an international marketing firm). Mr. Symonds has a background in both investment and commercial banking, including merchant banking in New York, London and Hong Kong with Paine Webber, Robert Fleming Group and Banque de la Societe Financiere Europeenne. He was Chairman of the Houston Arboretum and Nature Center and currently serves as a director of Howard Supply Company LLC. Mr. Symonds previously served as a director of Tetra Technologies Inc., Schilling Robotics LLC and Free Flow Wines LLC, where he served on the audit committee. Mr. Symonds received a BA from Stanford University and an MBA from Harvard. The board of directors has determined that Mr. Symonds is "independent" under applicable NYSE rules and qualifies as an "Audit Committee Financial Expert."  In addition to his qualifications as an Audit Committee Financial Expert, Mr. Symonds has a broad background in both commercial and investment banking, as well as investment management, all with a heavy emphasis on the energy sector. We believe that Mr. Symonds' background offers to the board a distinct and valuable knowledge base representative of both the capital and physical markets and refined by the leadership qualities evident from his executive experience.

Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"

Gizmodo.com

From the Press
U.S. News & World Report
"BeenVerified easily and inexpensively provides access to public records information through its website and several mobile phone applications. No longer are large corporations the only ones who can afford background checks."
