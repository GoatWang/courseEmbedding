These non-GAAP measures are provided in addition to, and not as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial data is included in the supplemental financial tables included in this press release.

	,


	 assembly and test providers

	 and other vendors that subject Quantenna's business and results of operations to risks of natural disasters, epidemics, war and political unrest; the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry


	,


	 adjustments to the preliminary financial results reported in this press release and related earnings call announcement and materials for the first quarter 2017 in connection with completion of the final closing process and procedures and preparation of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and other factors that are detailed in the Securities and Exchange (“SEC”) filings of Quantenna Communications, Inc., which you may obtain for free at the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 In addition to GAAP reporting, Quantenna provides information regarding income, gross margin and operating expenses on a non-
 GAAP basis. This non-GAAP information excludes stock-based compensation expense, which the Company’s management believes is
 not reflective of the Company’s underlying performance. These non-GAAP measures are used by the Company’s management for
 purposes of evaluating the underlying operating performance of the Company, establishing internal budgets, comparing performance
 with internal forecasts and goals, strategic planning, benchmarking against other companies, and to provide a more consistent basis
 of comparison and to enable more meaningful period to period comparisons. These non-GAAP measures are provided in addition to,
 and not as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation between GAAP
 and non-GAAP financial data is included in the supplemental financial tables included in this press release.
 Forward-Looking Statements
 This press release contains forward-looking statements based on Quantenna’s current expectations, including statements regarding
 Quantenna’s financial results for the first quarter ended April 2, 2017, expected future business and financial performance, growth 
opportunities, product technologies and customer relationships. The words "believe," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "anticipate," 
"plan," "project," "will" and similar phrases as they relate to Quantenna are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. 
These forward-looking statements reflect the current views and assumptions of Quantenna and are subject to various risks and 
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Among the factors that could cause actual results 
to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are the following: risks that Quantenna may not be able to maintain 
its historical growth; quarterly fluctuations in revenues and operating results; ability to accurately predict future revenue and 
expenses; challenges developing new and leading edge products on a timely basis that achieve market acceptance; ability to attract 
and retain customers and service providers; dependence on a limited number of products and customers; intense market 
competition; intellectual property litigation risks; political uncertainty; potential changes in tax and other laws affecting Quantenna’s 
business; risks associated with acquisitions, divestitures and strategic partnerships; product liability risks; potential cancellation of 
customer orders; difficulties managing international operations; risks that Quantenna may not be able to manage strains associated 
with its growth; dependence on key personnel; stock price volatility; dependence on, and geographic concentration of, contract 
manufacturers, assembly and test providers, and other vendors that subject Quantenna's business and results of operations to risks 
of natural disasters, epidemics, war and political unrest; the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, adjustments to the
 preliminary financial results reported in this press release and related earnings call announcement and materials for the first quarter 
2017 in connection with completion of the final closing process and procedures and preparation of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-
 Q, and other factors that are detailed in the Securities and Exchange (“SEC”) filings of Quantenna Communications, Inc., which you 
may obtain for free at the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov. Quantenna disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise 
any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Product family[edit]
QSR1000 (Wave 2) Features[edit]
802.11ac Wave 2 4X4 MIMO - QSR1000 was the 1st 802.11ac chipset using 4x4 MIMO Technology. 
It was consequently the first chipset on the market able to break the barrier of Gigabit throughput over Wi-Fi. 
In your Access Point, this means more capacity delivered to more devices, all over your Home or Office.
QSR1000 also enhances your network with Multi-User MIMO, a Technology that boosts the capacity of your Wi-Fi 
Network even further with compatible devices. The excellence of QSR1000 has led many manufacturers and 
Service Providers to use it their Wi-Fi Access Points, Repeaters and Clients worldwide.

QV940 - 2x4 802.11ac Wave 2 Wireless LAN Chipset Solution

QSR2000 (Wave2) Features[edit]
Leveraging the unique performance of QSR1000, Quantenna released our 4 Streams Technology 
in both the Wi-Fi 2.4GHz and 5GHz band with QSR2000 (Dual-Band-Selectable).
The QSR2000C is specially adapted to high performance Media Players, Consumer devices, STB. 
Combined with QSR1000 Access Points in 5Ghz Band, QSR2000 will ensure a unique user experience 
through long range and high quality Wi-Fi service. 
A typical application is Full HD Live Television distributed over Wi-Fi with perfect picture.
The QSR2000C 2.4GHz interface provides a universal connectivity to any legacy Access Point. 
Combined with QSR10G in 2.4GHz, QSR2000 provides the farthest reach on the market.

QSR10G-AX Family Features[edit]
The QSR10G-AX solution supports 12 total streams: 8 streams in the 5GHz band and 4 streams in the 2.4GHz band. 
QSR10G-AX adds support for downlink and uplink OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access), 
providing the best network efficiency in dense environments as well as the best uplink performance. 
QSR10G-AX is designed to enable a very easy and fast transition for existing QSR10G customers. 
The QSR10G-AX chipset is pin-to-pin compatible with QSR10G, Quantenna’s 802.11ac Wave 3 12-stream dual-band 
AP solution. Customers designing with QSR10G solution will be able to drop in the new QSR10G-AX solution.
Key QSR10G-AX Planned Features and Benefits

• Integrated AP chipset for dual-band (5GHz and 2.4GHz), 
dual concurrent operation and management 
• Pin-to-Pin compatibility with QSR10G 
• 802.11ax Draft 1.0 compliant 
• 12-stream operation 
• Supports rich set of interfaces to external hosts 
such as PCIe Gen3/Gen2, RXAUI, RGMII, and others 
• Support 2.4GHz coexistence interface 
• Enable full offload for external host 
• Cloud managed
