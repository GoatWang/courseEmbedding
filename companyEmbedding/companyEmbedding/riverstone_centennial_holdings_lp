Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Item 4.                                                         Purpose of Transaction
 
Item 4 of the Statement is amended and supplemented as follows:
 
Silverback Subscription Agreement
 
On November 27, 2016, Riverstone Silverback Holdings, L.P. (the Riverstone Subscriber) entered into a subscription agreement (the SB Subscription Agreement) with the Issuer, pursuant to which the Riverstone Subscriber, a subsidiary of  Riverstone REL, agreed to purchase up to approximately $400 million in shares of (i) Class A Common Stock, at a purchase price of $14.54 per share, subject to adjustment as described below (the Class A Shares), and (ii) the Issuers convertible Series B Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the Series B Preferred Stock), at a purchase price of $3,635 per share (or $14.54 per share on an as-converted basis), subject to adjustment as described below (the Series B Shares and, together with the Class A Shares, the SB Subscription Shares), plus up to an additional approximately $100 million in shares of Class A Common Stock and/or Series B Preferred Stock at the same respective purchase prices set forth above.
 
If the number of Class A Shares to be issued to the Riverstone Subscriber, together with any additional shares of Class A Common Stock that may be issued to finance the acquisition of Silverback Exploration, LLC and Silverback Operating, LLC by Centennial Resource Production, LLC (the Acquisition), would exceed 19.9% of the issued and outstanding Class A Common Stock, then the Riverstone Subscriber will purchase a number of Class A Shares such that the 19.9% limitation will not be exceeded and will purchase its remaining commitment in Series B Shares.  In the event Centennial determines to finance any portion of the Acquisition by issuing additional shares of common stock or preferred stock to one or more additional purchasers at a per share price less than the price payable by the Riverstone Subscriber, then the Riverstone Subscribers purchase price will be correspondingly reduced to the lowest per share price to be paid by any such additional purchaser.
 
Riverstone Subscriber has assigned its rights under the SB Subscription Agreement to Riverstone QB Holdings, Riverstone Non-ECI and REL US, pursuant to which the SB Subscription Shares will be purchased by Riverstone QB Holdings, Riverstone Non-ECI and REL US pro rata in proportion to their limited partnership interests in Riverstone Centennial.
 
The foregoing description of the SB Subscription Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such agreement, which is attached as an exhibit to this Schedule 13D, and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
Riverstone Centennial Distribution
 
On December 15, 2016, Riverstone Centennial disposed of all of its shares of Class A Common Stock in a pro rata distribution to all of its limited partners. As a result, REL US, Riverstone Non-ECI and Riverstone QB Holdings, as the limited partners of Riverstone Centennial, each became the record holder of the number of shares of Class A Common Stock as set forth herein.

Cash, people and equipment are pouring into the prolific Permian shale basin in Texas as business booms in the largest U.S. oilfield. The speed of the recovery in the U.S. shale industry in the past year has surprised oil investors after a global supply glut led to a two-year crude price slump and bankrupted many shale firms.

Strong demand for shale oil-and-gas infrastructure is giving rise to an important new financing vehicle for pipeline, processing and storage ventures that are needed to get more shale fuels to market.

 PRESS RELEASE
HOUSTON, July 22, 2016 /PRNewswire/ — Silver Run Acquisition Corporation (“Silver Run”) (NASDAQ: SRAQ, SRAQU, SRAQW) today announced that, subject to certain conditions, including approval of the Silver Run stockholders, it has agreed to acquire a controlling interest in Centennial Resource Production, LLC (“Centennial”), an independent oil and natural gas company located in the core of the Southern Delaware Basin. On July 6, 2016, an affiliate of Riverstone Holdings LLC (“Riverstone”) entered into a definitive agreement to purchase an approximate 89% interest in Centennial from funds controlled by, and affiliates of, NGP Energy Capital Management, L.L.C. (together, “NGP”). In accordance with the definitive agreement, Riverstone has agreed to assign, and Silver Run has agreed to assume, its right to purchase the interest in Centennial to Silver Run and will participate in the transaction as an equity holder directly in Silver Run. 





In connection with the assignment of Riverstone’s rights under the definitive agreement and the acquisition of the Centennial interest by Silver Run, Riverstone and certain Riverstone controlled investment funds will purchase an estimated $810 million of Silver Run Class A Common Stock at $10.00 per share, including up to $175 million from Riverstone Energy Limited. In addition, certain funds managed by Capital World Investors and certain funds managed by Fidelity Management and Research Company will purchase $200 million of Silver Run Class A Common Stock at $10.00 per share. The proceeds of both stock sales will be used to fund a portion of the cash consideration required to effect the Centennial acquisition. Following the closing of the Centennial acquisition and related transactions, Riverstone and such affiliates will be the single largest stockholder of Silver Run, with an approximate 51% ownership interest. NGP is expected to retain a significant equity stake in Centennial, approximating 11% of the outstanding interests, and will have a representative on the Silver Run Board of Directors.






Mark Papa, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Silver Run, will lead Centennial following the consummation of the transaction. Centennial’s existing senior management team led by Chief Executive Officer Ward Polzin, will provide transition services for a period of time as Mr. Papa looks to permanently fill key management positions. Mr. Papa commented, “Since our IPO, we have been searching to acquire a meaningful position in one of North America’s premier oil shale basins. There has been a lot of recent excitement about the Delaware Basin, but we believe its potential is still significantly underappreciated. Centennial has an enviable position in the Delaware’s southern oil-rich core. I want to commend Ward and his team for assembling such a top-notch set of assets and organization. I look forward to replicating the culture and philosophy that made EOG Resources such a success during my time there and using the Centennial assets as a platform to build something truly special.” 





The anticipated initial enterprise value of the combined company is approximately $1,735 million, implying a multiple of 12.6x and 6.6x projected calendar 2017 and 2018 adjusted EBITDA, respectively, and post-closing equity value of $1,835 million at$10.00 per share. Silver Run expects to be debt-free at the closing of the transaction and have $100 million of cash-on-hand and an undrawn revolving credit facility to fund future drilling and acquisitions. At consummation of the transaction, Silver Run is expected to be renamed Centennial Resource Development Corp. and trade on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbol “CDEV”.

Transaction Details 





On July 6, 2016, Riverstone entered into a definitive agreement to purchase an approximate 89% interest in Centennial. Under the terms of the definitive agreement, Riverstone retained the ability to assign its rights and obligations to purchase the interest in Centennial to Silver Run. On July 22, 2016, Riverstone agreed to assign, and Silver Run agreed to assume, its right to purchase the interest in Centennial, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the approval of the transaction by Silver Run’s stockholders.
In connection with the transaction, Silver Run intends to obtain equity financing through the private placement of 81 million newly issued shares of Class A Common Stock to Riverstone and its affiliates and 20 million newly issued shares of Class A Common Stock to certain funds managed by Capital World Investors and certain funds managed by Fidelity Management and Research Company. Silver Run expects to receive approximately $1 billion in net proceeds from these sales. NGP is expected to retain an approximate 11% interest in Centennial, which interest may be exchanged for 20 million shares of Silver Run Class A Common Stock. Silver Run will not use debt financing to fund any portion of the cash consideration for the transaction.  In connection with the transaction, Silver Run and Centennial expect to repay all existing outstanding indebtedness and either replace or amend Centennial’s revolving credit facility to permit the transaction. As of March 31, 2016, a maximum of $140 million was available for borrowing under Centennial’s revolving credit facility. 





Prior to closing the transaction, Silver Run’s existing Class A stockholders will have the opportunity to vote on the transaction, and to redeem their shares of Class A common stock, if the transaction is approved and consummated. In the event any stockholders choose to have their shares redeemed, Riverstone and its affiliates expect to purchase an equivalent number of additional shares of Silver Run Class A Common Stock at $10.00 per share to fund such redemptions.
The transaction is subject to approval of Silver Run stockholders and the satisfaction or waiver of other customary conditions. The transaction is expected to close in September 2016.
The description of the transaction contained herein is only a summary and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the contribution and subscription agreements relating to the transaction.
