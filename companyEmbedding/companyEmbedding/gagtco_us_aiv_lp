	ABOUT THIS PROSPECTUS



	This prospectus is part of a registration statement that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) utilizing
	a shelf registration process. Under this shelf process, the selling securityholder may sell any combination of the securities described in this prospectus in one or more offerings. This prospectus provides you with a general description
	of the securities the selling securityholder may offer. Each time the selling securityholder sells securities pursuant to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, we will provide a prospectus supplement that will contain
	specific information about the terms of that offering. The prospectus supplement may also add to, update or change the information contained in this prospectus. You should carefully read this prospectus and the accompanying prospectus supplement,
	along with all of the information incorporated by reference herein and therein, before making an investment decision.


	In this prospectus,
	unless the context indicates otherwise, references to we, our, us, ourselves, the Company, KCG Holdings or KCG refer to KCG Holdings, Inc. and, where appropriate,
	its subsidiaries.


	Neither we nor the selling securityholder has authorized anyone to provide any information other than that contained in
	this prospectus, in any prospectus supplement or in any free writing prospectus prepared by or on behalf of us to which we have referred you. Neither we nor the selling securityholder takes responsibility for, and neither we nor the selling
	securityholder provides any assurance as to the reliability of, any other information that others may give you. We have not, and the selling securityholder has not, authorized any other person to provide you with different information. We are not,
	and the selling securityholder is not, making an offer to sell these securities in any jurisdiction where the offer or sale is not permitted. You should assume that the information appearing in this prospectus, in the accompanying prospectus
	supplement, in any document incorporated by reference herein or therein, and in any free writing prospectus prepared by or on behalf of us to which we have referred you is accurate only as of their respective dates. Our business, financial
	condition, results of operations and prospects may have changed since that date.


	The distribution of this prospectus and any applicable
	prospectus supplement and the offering of the securities in certain jurisdictions may be restricted by law. Persons into whose possession this prospectus and any applicable prospectus supplement come should inform themselves about and observe any
	such restrictions. This prospectus and any applicable prospectus supplement do not constitute, and may not be used in connection with, an offer or solicitation by anyone in any jurisdiction in which such offer or solicitation is not authorized or in
	which the person making such offer or solicitation is not qualified to do so or to any person to whom it is unlawful to make such offer or solicitation.






	Table of Contents








	INCORPORATION OF CERTAIN DOCUMENTS BY REFERENCE

	RISK FACTORS



	Investment in any of the securities involves risk. In addition to all of the other information contained or incorporated by reference into

	CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING







	FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS



	Certain statements contained in this Registration Statement and the documents incorporated by reference herein may constitute
	forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as believe,
	expect, anticipate, intend, target, estimate, continue, positions, prospects or potential, by future conditional verbs such as
	will, would, should, could or may, or by variations of such words or by similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts and are based on current expectations,
	estimates and projections about KCGs industry, managements beliefs and certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond the Companys control. Accordingly, readers are
	cautioned that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict including, without limitation, risks associated with:
	(i) the inability to manage trading strategy performance and sustain revenue and earnings growth (ii) the sale of KCG Hotspot, including the receipt of additional payments that are subject to certain contingencies; (iii) changes in
	market structure, legislative, regulatory or financial reporting rules, including the increased focus by Congress, federal and state regulators, the self-regulatory organizations and the media on market structure issues, and in particular, the
	scrutiny of high frequency trading, alternative trading systems, market fragmentation, colocation, access to market data feeds, and remuneration arrangements such as payment for order flow and exchange fee structures; (iv) past or future
	changes to KCGs organizational structure and management; (v) KCGs ability to develop competitive new products and services in a timely manner and the acceptance of such products and services by KCGs customers and potential
	customers; (vi) KCGs ability to keep up with technological changes; (vii) KCGs ability to effectively identify and manage market risk, operational and technology risk, cybersecurity risk , legal risk, liquidity risk,
	reputational risk, counterparty and credit risk, international risk, regulatory risk, and compliance risk; (viii) the cost and other effects of material contingencies, including litigation contingencies, and any adverse judicial, administrative
	or arbitral rulings or proceedings; (ix) the effects of increased competition and KCGs ability to maintain and expand market share; (x) the announced plan to relocate KCGs global headquarters from Jersey City, NJ to New York,
	NY; and (xi) KCGs ability to complete the sale or disposition of any or all of the assets or businesses that are classified as held for sale. The above list is not exhaustive. Because forward-looking statements involve risks and
	uncertainties, the actual results and performance of the Company may materially differ from the results expressed or implied by such statements. Given these uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking
	statements. Unless otherwise required by law, the Company also disclaims any obligation to update its view of any such risks or

	Table of Contents



	uncertainties or to announce publicly the result of any revisions to the forward-looking statements made herein. Readers should carefully review the risks and uncertainties disclosed in the
	Companys reports with the SEC. This information should be read in conjunction with the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes thereto contained in the Companys Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, in the
	Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K, and in other reports or documents the Company files with, or furnishes to, the SEC from time to time.


	These and other factors are more fully discussed in the documents incorporated by reference herein. These and other risks could cause actual
	results to differ materially from those implied by forward-looking statements herein and therein.


	You should keep in mind that any
	forward-looking statement made by us herein and in the documents incorporated by reference herein speaks only as of the date on which we make it. New risks and uncertainties come up from time to time, and it is impossible for us to predict these
	events or how they may affect us. We have no obligation to update any forward-looking statements herein or therein after the date hereof or thereof, except as required by federal securities laws.

	SELLING SECURITYHOLDER



	The selling securityholder named in the table below may from time to time offer and sell pursuant to this prospectus and any applicable
	prospectus supplement up to 20,209,027 shares of our Class A Common Stock, up to 8,094,683 of our Warrants and up to an additional 8,094,683 shares of our Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants. When we refer to the
	selling securityholder in this prospectus, we mean GA-GTCO Interholdco, LLC, as well as its transferees, pledgees or donees or their successors. The selling securityholder may sell all, a portion or none of its Class A Common Stock
	and Warrants at any time. The information regarding the Class A Common Stock and Warrants beneficially owned after the offering assumes the sale of all Class A Common Stock and Warrants offered by the selling securityholder. The percentage
	of Class A Common Stock beneficially owned before the offering assumes that the selling securityholder exercised its Warrants in full and no other holder of Warrants exercised any Warrants. Except as otherwise indicated, the selling
	securityholder has sole voting and dispositive power with respect to such shares.

	Material Relationships with Selling Securityholder





	Registration Rights Agreement




	On
	July 1, 2013, the Company entered into a registration rights agreement with the principal shareholders of GETCO, including GA-GTCO Interholdco, LLC (the Registration Rights Agreement). Under the terms of the Registration Rights
	Agreement, among other things, the Company was obligated to file with the SEC a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 covering resales of the shares by such holders of Class A Common Stock and the Warrants received by each of them in the
	Mergers and shares of Class A Common Stock issued upon exercise of the Warrants (collectively, the Registerable Securities), which was filed on July 1, 2013. The original registration statement expired on July 1, 2016.
	Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, KCG is required to file a new registration statement upon expiration of the original registration statement if any holders maintain ownership of a specified level of Registerable Securities. As of
	July 1, 2016, GA-GTCO Interholdco was the only party to maintain the required ownership level.


	Subject to the terms and conditions
	of the Registration Rights Agreement, GA-GTCO Interholdco, LLC may request to sell all or any portion of the Registerable Securities that it holds in one or more underwritten or non-underwritten registered offerings pursuant to a shelf registration
	statement. The Registration Rights Agreement also provides GA-GTCO Interholdco, LLC with certain other customary demand registration rights and piggyback registration rights, in each case subject to the terms and conditions of the Registration
	Rights Agreement. In any registration, the Company has agreed to pay all registration fees (other than underwriting fees, discounts, selling commissions and stock transfer taxes and certain legal expenses of the selling securityholder) and indemnify
	the selling securityholder. The description of the Registration Rights Agreement contained herein does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Registration Rights Agreement, which is incorporated herein by
	reference to Exhibit 4.4 to this registration statement on Form S-3.




	Board of Directors of the Company




	Rene M. Kern, a managing director of General Atlantic, LLC, is a member of our Board and serves on our Compensation Committee and our
	Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. In addition, John C. (Hans) Morris, a member of our Board, was initially selected as a director by GA-GTCO Interholdco, LLC and has since been elected to our Board at each of our Annual Meetings of
	Stockholders. Mr. Morris was, at the time of selection by GA-GTCO Interholdco, LLC, an advisory director of General Atlantic, LLC. However, he is no longer affiliated with General Atlantic, LLC. Mr. Morris is the Chairperson of our
	Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and serves on our Compensation Committee.








	DESCRIPTION OF OUR
	CAPITAL STOCK




	General



	The
	following description of the material provisions of our capital stock is based upon our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended (the Certificate of Incorporation), our second amended and restated bylaws, (the
	Bylaws), the Warrant Agreement, dated July 1, 2013, between us and Computershare Shareowner Services LLC, as warrant agent (the Warrant Agreement), and applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the
	DGCL), in each case as currently in effect as of the date of this prospectus, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the provisions of those documents. For more information on the rights of the holders of shares of our
	Class A Common Stock, see Exhibit 99.3 (Description of Rights of Holders of KCG Common Stock) to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on July 1, 2013, which is incorporated by reference herein.






	Description of Our Capital Stock



	Under
	our Certificate of Incorporation, we are authorized to issue 1,040,000,000 shares of capital stock, consisting of 1,000,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the Class A Common Stock), 20,000,000 shares
	of Class B common stock, par value $0.01 per share ( the Class B Common Stock), and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share (the Preferred Stock).

	Table of Contents



	As of the date of this registration statement, there are no shares of Class B Common Stock or
	Preferred Stock outstanding.




	Common Stock





	Dividend Rights



	We are permitted to pay
	dividends if, as and when declared by our Board of directors, subject to compliance with limitations imposed by the DGCL. The holders of shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock (collectively, Common Stock) are
	entitled to receive and share equally in these dividends as they may be declared by our Board out of funds legally available for such purpose. If we issue Preferred Stock, the holders of shares of such Preferred Stock may have a priority over the
	holders of shares of the Common Stock and with respect to dividends. We do not currently expect to pay dividends on our Common Stock.



	Voting
	Rights



	Class A Common Stock votes as a single class on all matters on which stockholders are entitled to vote, and each share of
	Class A Common Stock is entitled to cast one vote in person or by proxy on such matters. Class B Common Stock has no voting rights. Holders of shares of Class A Common Stock do not have any right to cumulate votes in the election of
	directors. Directors are elected by a majority of the shares actually voting on the matter at each annual meeting or special meeting called for the purpose of electing such directors at which a quorum is present. If we issue Preferred Stock, the
	holders of the Preferred Stock may also possess voting rights.



	Liquidation Rights



	In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, whether voluntary or involuntary, the holders of shares of Common Stock will be
	entitled to receive, after payment or provision for payment of all our debts and liabilities, all of our assets available for distribution. If we issue Preferred Stock, holders thereof may have a priority over the holders of shares of the Common
	Stock in the event of liquidation or dissolution.



	Preemptive Rights



	Holders of shares of Common Stock are not entitled to any preemptive rights to subscribe for additional shares of Common Stock nor are they
	liable to further capital calls or to assessments by us. Therefore, if additional shares of Common Stock are issued by us without the opportunity for existing stockholders to purchase more shares, a stockholders ownership interest in the
	Company may be subject to dilution.






	Transfer Agent and Registrar



	The Transfer Agent and Registrar for our Class A Common Stock is Computershare Trust Company, N.A.



	Listing



	Our Class A Common Stock is
	listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol KCG.




	Preferred Stock




	Our Board is authorized to provide for the issuance of all or any shares of Preferred Stock in one or more classes or series, and to fix for
	each such class or series rights such as voting powers.

	Warrant Agreement and Warrants





	Exercise Price; Expiration



	The
	Class A, Class B and Class C Warrants issued as part of the consideration in the Mergers entitle holders to purchase shares of Class A Common Stock, on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustments as provided by the Warrant
	Agreement and summarized below. As a result of the Companys modified Dutch auction tender offer, the final results of which were announced on June 9, 2015, the exercise price of each of the Class A, Class B and Class C Warrants was
	adjusted in accordance with the terms of the Warrant Agreement. The Class A Warrants are now exercisable at an exercise price of $11.70 per share of Class A Common Stock; the Class B Warrants are now exercisable at an exercise price of
	$13.16 per share of Class A Common Stock; and the Class C Warrants are now exercisable at an exercise price of $14.63 per share of Class A Common Stock, in each case, subject to further adjustments as provided by the Warrant Agreement and
	summarized below. All or a portion of the Warrants are exercisable at any time prior to (i) in the case of Class A Warrants, July 1, 2017, (ii) in the case of Class B Warrants, July 1, 2018, and (iii) in the case of
	Class C Warrants, July 1, 2019. The following table sets forth information with respect to each class of Warrants as of July 1, 2016:

	Exercise



	The Warrants may be exercised pursuant to a cashless exercise, in which case the registered holder will receive a number of shares
	of Class A Common Stock that is equal to the aggregate number of shares of Class A Common Stock for which the Warrants are being exercised less the number of shares of Class A Common Stock that have an aggregate market price (as such
	term is defined in the Warrant Agreement) on the trading day on which such Warrants are exercised that is equal to the aggregate exercise price for all such shares of Class A Common Stock. The Warrant Agreement also provides that if Warrants
	are exercised such that the aggregate exercise price would exceed the aggregate market price of the shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise, the exercise will be null and void, no shares will be issued upon that exercise, and such
	Warrants will continue in effect subject to their terms.



	Adjustments to Prevent Dilution



	The number of shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise of a Warrant, and the exercise price of such Warrant, will be subject
	to adjustment in order to protect warrant holders from dilution in case of:


	 




	 


	


	 


	stock splits, subdivisions, reclassifications or combinations;




	 




	 


	


	 


	specified issuances of common shares or convertible securities;

	Listing of Common Stock Issuable upon Exercise of the Warrants



	The Warrants are not listed or displayed on any securities exchange or electronic communications network. The shares of Class A Common
	Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants are listed as reserved for issuance on the New York Stock Exchange.



	Effect of a Business
	Combination Transaction



	In case of any merger, consolidation, statutory share exchange or similar transaction that requires the
	approval of our stockholders or reclassification of the Common Stock (other than a reclassification that is otherwise provided for in the anti-dilution provisions of the Warrant Agreement), the Warrant holder will upon exercise be entitled to
	receive, during the period specified by the Warrant, an equivalent number of shares of common stock or other securities or property of the surviving entity that the holder would have been entitled to in such sale if the Warrant had been exercised
	immediately prior to such transaction. Appropriate adjustments will be made to the Warrant so that the right to exercise the Warrant in exchange for any such shares of stock or other securities or property will remain substantially the same as prior
	to such transaction.



	Transfer



	At
	the option of the holder of a Warrant, each Warrant and all rights thereunder may be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, encumbered or in any other manner transferred or disposed of, in whole or in part, by the registered holder, but only in
	accordance with the terms of the Warrant Agreement and in compliance with all applicable laws.



	Warrant Rights



	A Warrant will not, prior to its exercise, confer upon its holder or such holders transferee, the right to vote or receive dividends, or
	consent or receive notice as stockholders in respect of any meeting of stockholders for the election of our directors or any other matter, or any rights whatsoever as stockholders of the Company.



	Certain Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaw and Statutory Provisions



	Certain provisions of the DGCL, our Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws summarized in the following paragraphs may have an
	anti-takeover effect and may delay, defer or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt that a stockholder might consider in its best interests.




	Charter and Bylaws




	Our
	Certificate of Incorporation provides that stockholders are not entitled to act by written consent in lieu of a meeting except where such consent is unanimous. This provision of the Certificate of Incorporation could discourage potential acquisition
	proposals and could delay or prevent a change of control of the Company.




	Delaware Takeover Statute




	We are subject to Section 203 of the DGCL (Section 203), which, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits a publicly held
	Delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that such stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless: (i) prior to such date, the board of
	directors of the corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder; (ii) upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an
	interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding for purposes of determining the number of shares outstanding those shares owned
	(a) by persons who are directors and also officers and (b) by employee stock plans in which employee participants do not have the right to determine confidentially whether shares held subject to the plan will be tendered in a tender or
	exchange offer; or (iii) on or subsequent to such date, the business combination is approved by the board of directors and authorized at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, and not by written consent, by the affirmative vote of at
	least 66 2/3% of the outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the interested stockholder.

	Table of Contents



	Section 203 defines business combination to include: (i) any merger or
	consolidation involving the corporation and the interested stockholder; (ii) any sale, transfer, pledge or other disposition of 10% or more of the assets of the corporation involving the interested stockholder; (iii) subject to certain
	exceptions, any transaction that results in the issuance or transfer by the corporation of any stock of the corporation to the interested stockholder; (iv) any transaction involving the corporation that has the effect of increasing the
	proportionate share of the stock of any class or series of the corporation beneficially owned by the interested stockholder; or (v) the receipt by the interested stockholder of the benefit of any loans, advances, guarantees, pledges or other
	financial benefits provided by or through the corporation. In general, Section 203 defined an interested stockholder as any entity or person beneficially owning 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation and any entity or
	person affiliated with or controlling or controlled by such entity or person.




	Other Provisions




	The holders of shares of Common Stock are not entitled to preemptive or subscription rights. In any merger, consolidation or business
	combination, the holders of each share of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive the same per share consideration without regard to class. No class of Common Stock may be split, subdivided, reclassified or otherwise changed unless the other class
	of Common Stock concurrently is split, subdivided, reclassified or otherwise changed in the same proportion and in the same manner.

	PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION



	We are registering the securities to permit the resale of the securities by the selling securityholder from time to time after the date of
	this prospectus. The selling securityholder may sell all or a portion of the securities from time to time directly or through one or more underwriters, broker-dealers or agents. If the securities are sold through underwriters or broker-dealers, the
	selling securityholder will be responsible for underwriting discounts or commissions or agents commissions. The securities may be sold in one or more transactions at fixed prices, prevailing market prices determined at the time of the sale,
	varying prices determined at the time of sale or negotiated prices. These sales may be effected:


	 




	 


	


	 


	on any national securities exchange or quotation service on which the securities may be listed or quoted at the time of sale;




	 




	 


	


	 


	in the over-the-counter market;




	 




	 


	


	 


	in transactions other than on these exchanges or systems or in the over-the-counter market;




	 




	 


	


	 


	in underwritten transactions through an underwriter;




	 




	 


	


	 


	in ordinary brokerage transactions and transactions in which the broker-dealer solicits purchasers;




	 




	 


	


	 


	in block trades in which the broker-dealer will attempt to sell the shares as agent but may position and resell a portion of the block as principal to facilitate the transaction;




	 




	 


	


	 


	in purchases by a broker-dealer as principal and resale by the broker-dealer for its account;




	 




	 


	


	 


	in privately negotiated transactions;




	 




	 


	


	 


	in sales pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act;




	 




	 


	


	 


	where broker-dealers may agree with the selling securityholder to sell a specified number of shares at a stipulated price per share;




	 




	 


	


	 


	through any other method permitted pursuant to applicable law; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	through any combination of any such methods of sale.




	If the selling securityholder effects
	such transactions by selling shares of our Class A Common Stock or Warrants to or through underwriters, broker-dealers or agents, such underwriters, broker-dealers or agents may receive commissions in the form of discounts, concessions or
	commissions from the selling securityholder or commissions from purchasers of the securities for whom they may act as agent or to whom they may sell as principal (which discounts, concessions or commissions as to particular underwriters,
	broker-dealers or agents may be in excess of those customary in the types of transactions involved).


	In connection with sales of our
	Class A Common Stock or Warrants or otherwise, the selling securityholder may enter into hedging transactions with broker-dealers, which may in turn engage in short sales of the securities in the course of hedging the positions they assume.


	The selling securityholder and any broker-dealer participating in the distribution of the securities may be deemed to be
	underwriters within the meaning of the Securities Act, and any commissions paid to, or any discounts or concessions allowed to, any such broker-dealer may be deemed to be underwriting commissions or discounts under the Securities Act. At
	the time a particular offering of the securities is made, a prospectus supplement may be distributed setting forth the aggregate amount of the securities being offered and the terms of the offering, including the name or names of any broker-dealers
	or agents, any discounts, commissions and other terms constituting compensation from the selling securityholder and any discounts, commissions or concessions allowed or re-allowed or paid to broker-dealers.

	Table of Contents



	There can be no assurance that the selling securityholder will sell any or all of the shares of
	our Class A Common Stock or Warrants registered to it pursuant to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part.


	The selling securityholder and any other person participating in such distribution may be subject to applicable provisions of the Exchange Act
	and the rules and regulations thereunder, including, without limitation, Regulation M of the Exchange Act, which may limit the timing of purchases and sales of any of the securities by the selling securityholder and any other participating person.
	Regulation M may also restrict the ability of any person engaged in the distribution of the securities to engage in market-making activities with respect to the securities. All of the foregoing may affect the marketability of the Class A Common
	Stock and Warrants and the ability of any person or entity to engage in market-making activities with respect to such securities.


	Once
	sold under the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, the securities sold thereunder will be freely tradable in the hands of persons other than our affiliates.



	Direct Sales



	The selling securityholder
	may directly solicit offers to purchase the securities. In this case, no underwriters or agents would be involved.



	General Information



	To the extent required to supplement the information contained in this prospectus, the place and time of delivery for the securities described
	in this prospectus may be set forth in an applicable prospectus supplement.


	Underwriters, dealers and agents may engage in transactions
	with, or perform services for, us in the ordinary course of business.


	In connection with the sale of the securities, certain underwriters
	may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the securities. Specifically, underwriters may overallot an offering, creating a short position. In addition, underwriters may bid for, and purchase, the securities
	in the open market to cover short positions or to stabilize the price of the securities. Any of these activities may stabilize or maintain the market price of the securities above independent market levels. Underwriters will not be required to
	engage in these activities and may end any of these activities at any time.

	Sullivan & Cromwell LLP. If legal matters in connection with the offerings made pursuant to this prospectus are passed upon by counsel for the underwriters, dealers or agents, if any, such counsel will be named in the prospectus supplement
	relating to such offering.

	Indemnification of Directors and Officers





	Delaware law permits a corporation to adopt a
	provision in its certificate of incorporation eliminating or limiting the personal liability of a director to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except that such provision will not
	limit the liability of a director for (i) any breach of the directors duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders, (ii) acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of
	law, (iii) liability under section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the DGCL) for unlawful payment of dividends or stock purchases or redemptions, or (iv) any transaction from which the director derived an improper
	personal benefit. The Companys amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that no director of the Company will be personally liable to the Company or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a
	director, except to the extent such an exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted under applicable law.


	Under
	Delaware law, a corporation may indemnify any person made a party or threatened to be made a party to any type of proceeding, other than action by or in the right of the corporation, because he or she is or was an officer, director, employee or
	agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as an officer, director, employee or agent of another corporation or entity against expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably
	incurred in connection with such proceeding: (1) if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation; or (2) in the case of a criminal proceeding,
	he or she had no reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful. A corporation may indemnify any person made a party or threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit brought by or in the right
	of the corporation because he or she was an officer, director, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or other entity, against
	expenses actually and reasonably incurred in connection with such action or suit if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, provided that such
	indemnification will be denied if the person is found liable to the corporation unless, in such a case, the court determines the person is entitled to indemnification for such expenses in any event. A corporation must indemnify a present or former
	director or officer who successfully defends himself or herself in a proceeding to which he or she was a party because he or she was a director or officer of the corporation against expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him or her. Expenses
	incurred by an officer or director, or any employees or agents as deemed appropriate by the board of directors, in defending civil or criminal proceedings may be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such proceedings upon
	receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it will ultimately be determined that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation. The Delaware law regarding indemnification and
	expense advancement is not exclusive of any other rights which may be granted by the Companys certificate of incorporation or bylaws, a vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, agreement or otherwise.


	 


	II-1






	Table of Contents



	Under the DGCL, termination of any proceeding by conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or
	its equivalent will not, of itself, create a presumption that such person is prohibited from being indemnified.


	The Companys second
	amended and restated bylaws provide that the Company will indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
	investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Company) by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Company, or is or was a director or officer of the Company serving at the request of the Company as
	a director or officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement
	actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, and,
	with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, such person had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo
	contendere or its equivalent, will not, of itself, create a presumption that such person did not act in good faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, and, with respect
	to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful.


	The Companys second
	amended and restated bylaws further provide that the Company will indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Company to procure a
	judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Company, or is or was a director or officer of the Company serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
	corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action
	or suit if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation; except that no indemnification will be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to
	which such person will have been adjudged to be liable to the Company unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought will determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of
	liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court will deem proper.


	However, the Companys second amended and restated bylaws provide that the Company will only provide indemnification pursuant to the
	bylaws (unless ordered by a court) if such indemnification is authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the present or former director or officer is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the
	applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Companys second amended and restated bylaws. Such determination will be made, with respect to a person who is a director or officer at the time of such determination, (i) by a majority vote
	of the directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum, or (ii) by a committee of directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding designated by a majority vote of such directors,
	even though less than a quorum, or (iii) if there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (iv) by the stockholders. Such determination will be made, with respect to
	former directors and officers, by any person or persons having the authority to act on the matter on behalf of the Company. To the extent, however, that a present or former director or officer of the Company has been successful on the merits or
	otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person will be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in
	connection therewith, without the necessity of authorization in the specific case.


	The Companys second amended and restated bylaws
	further provide that, except for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the Company will not be obligated to indemnify any director or officer (or his or her heirs, executors or personal or legal representatives) or advance expenses in
	connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person unless such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized or consented to by the board of directors.


	The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, the Companys second amended and restated bylaws
	will not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking


	 


	II-2






	Table of Contents



	indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under the Companys amended and restated certificate of incorporation, second amended and restated bylaws, agreement, vote of
	stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in such persons official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office. It is the Companys policy that indemnification will generally be
	made to the fullest extent permitted by law. The Companys second amended and restated bylaws do not preclude indemnifying persons in addition to those specified in the bylaws but whom the Company has the power or obligation to indemnify under
	the provisions of the DGCL, or otherwise.


	The Company may also purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a
	director or officer, or is or was a director or officer serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted
	against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such persons status as such, whether or not the Company has the power or the obligation to indemnify such person against such liability under the
	provisions of the Companys second amended and restated bylaws.

	Undertakings





	The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes:


	 




	 


	(1)


	To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement:




	 




	 


	(i)


	To include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act;




	 




	 


	(ii)


	To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a
	fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was
	registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in
	volume and price represent no more than a 20 percent change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the Calculation of Registration Fee table in the effective registration statement; and




	 




	 


	(iii)


	To include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement; provided,
	however, that paragraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) do not apply if the registration statement is on Form S-3 and the information required to be included in a post-effective amendment by those paragraphs is contained in reports filed with or
	furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission by the registrant pursuant to Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that are incorporated by reference in the registration statement, or is contained in a
	form of prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) that is part of the registration statement;




	 




	 


	(2)


	That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and
	the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof; and




	 


	II-3






	Table of Contents





	 


	(3)


	To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering.




	 




	 


	(4)


	That, for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act to any purchaser:




	 




	 


	(i)


	each prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3) shall be deemed to be part of the registration statement as of the date the filed prospectus was deemed part of and included in the registration
	statement; and




	 




	 


	(ii)


	each prospectus required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2), (b)(5) or (b)(7) as part of a registration statement in reliance on Rule 430B relating to an offering made pursuant to Rule 415(a)(1)(i), (vii) or
	(x) for the purpose of providing the information required by Section 10(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the earlier of the date such form of prospectus is
	first used after effectiveness or the date of the first contract of sale of securities in the offering described in the prospectus. As provided in Rule 430B, for liability purposes of the issuer and any person that is at that date an underwriter,
	such date shall be deemed to be a new effective date of the registration statement relating to the securities in the registration statement to which the prospectus relates, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the
	initial bona fide offering thereof.




	 




	 


	    


	Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration
	statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such effective date, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that
	was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such effective date.




	 




	 


	(5)


	That, for the purpose of determining liability of the registrant under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities, the undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary
	offering of securities of the undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any
	of the following communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser:




	 




	 


	(i)


	any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424;




	 




	 


	(ii)


	any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned registrant;




	 




	 


	(iii)


	the portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of an undersigned registrant; and




	 




	 


	(iv)


	any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser.




	 




	 


	(6)


	The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that, for purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each filing of the registrants annual report pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d)
	of the Exchange Act (and, where applicable, each filing of an employee benefit plans annual report pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act of 1934) that is incorporated by reference in the registration statement shall be deemed to
	be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.

	(7)


	Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise,
	the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for
	indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted
	by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate
	jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.
