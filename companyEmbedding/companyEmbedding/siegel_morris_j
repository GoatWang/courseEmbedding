BUSINESS PEOPLE
BUSINESS PEOPLE; Founder Is Rejoining Celestial Seasonings


By STEPHANIE STROM


Published: August 6, 1991









                    Morris J. Siegel, the creator of Celestial Seasonings herbal teas, is once again meshing his entrepreneurial spirit with his concern for the environment.        

                    The tea company he founded in 1970 is acquiring another of his creations, Earth Wise Inc., which manufactures biodegradable household detergents and cleaners, as well as garbage bags made from recycled plastic.        

                    Mr. Siegel has bought an equity stake of undisclosed size in the privately held Celestial Seasonings Inc. and will rejoin the company as its chairman and chief executive.        

                    "You could say we made an exchange," the Colorado entrepreneur said. "With Celestial and Earth Wise together, we've got a little nucleus of good-for-the-world products."        

                    Mr. Siegel founded Earth Wise about a year ago and began marketing products early this year in Colorado, Oregon, Minnesota, the state of Washington, California and in small stores in the Northeast.        

                    The company says it uses special technology that enables it to manufacture garbage bags with about 30 percent less plastic than conventional bags. Earth Wise also makes what it calls environmentally safe dishwashing liquid, stain remover and detergent.        

                    Mr. Siegel, 41 years old, sold Celestial Seasonings, with headquarters in Boulder, Colo., to Kraft General Foods in 1984. He remained with the company until 1986, when he placed its direction in the hands of his close friend and Boulder neighbor, Barnet M. Feinblum.        

                    Mr. Feinblum built a new manufacturing plant and led the company to record sales before orchestrating a management buyout in 1988 that took the company private again with the help of an investment firm, Vestar Capital Partners. Mr. Feinblum will remain as Celestial's president and chief operating officer.        

                    With Mr. Siegel, he will oversee the redesign of Celestial Seasonings' packaging and products and the introduction of the herbal teas to an international audience, beginning with Europe.        

                    Mr. Siegel is widely credited with inventing the $100 million herbal tea market when he began brewing the plants he picked during long bicycle rides in the Rockies. He said yesterday that he expected Celestial's biggest growth to come from its herbal iced tea line, being tested this summer.        

                    "It's nature's way of making water better," Mr. Siegel said. And, at 70 cents for about half a gallon, he added, "it's dirt cheap compared to Coke and Pepsi."
