Clients Say It Best



 


On behalf of The WOW Factory and our client Carpet One, thank you for an outstanding job! Your performance carried the entire event. Your impersonations of Donald Trump, Austin Powers, Wayne from Wayne's World and Ozzy Osbourne were the hit of the meeting. Your scripts nailed the key information that had to be communicated and the characters were dead-on funny. You have exceeded our expectations and we look forward to working with you again soon.

Clients Say It Best




John utilized his amazing comedic talents at our national sales meeting to drive content, educate our attendees and make us laugh while learning important product information. His Donald Trump, Dr. Phil and Austin Powers impersonations were spot on. Some people thought he was the real thing and most people couldn't tell they were all the same guy. John is a skilled professional and worked directly with us to craft scripts that integrated the 'take away' content that needed to be communicated. During our Dr. Phil segment of our show he was able to rearrange the script on the fly and integrate attendees into the performance. We wanted our people involved and he did it beautifully. He knocked the ball out of the park and we plan to have him back next year.

I'm a graphic designer with 35 years print and 25 years web experience. I was at the forefront of digital design in New York. I bring expert knowledge of Adobe Creative Suite and MicroSoft Office products together with traditional disciplines of design, copywriting, typography, illustration, photography and communications. I've managed projects and staffs from large to small, and performed as a design satellite for global and Fortune 500 companies for decades at a time. Among those are American Express, Chase, Standard Chartered and Deutsche Bank. They relied on me because I turned around solutions that work quickly and cost-effectively, with a minimum of back and forth.I've chosen to live and work in Boca Raton to be close to family and improve my lifestyle. My goal is to put my experience to good use. I'm a good fit for any position where expert digital and design skills, combined with practical business experience, are essential. No job is too big or too small.ErfahrungTutorWyzAnt Tutoring2015  –  2015 (weniger als ein Jahr)President/Creative DirectorNew Media Design, Inc.1987  –  2010 (23 Jahre)Responsible for the development and team oversight of creative advertising/marketing products from concept through completion.
