Live Oak Health Sciences Fund


Investment Goal

River Oak Discovery Fund seeks long-term capital growth by investing primarily in stocks of smaller companies selected for their growth potential.

Investment Approach

River Oak Discovery is a small cap growth fund that seeks growth primarily in smaller companies (less than $3 billion in market capitalization) that are rapidly growing and may not yet be fully discovered by Wall Street. The Fund invests in companies that have cutting edge products, visionary management, and the ability to bring innovation to both new and established industries. The Fund is most appropriate for an investor who seeks a diversified way to participate in the growth potential of smaller capitalization companies.
The manager’s investment process involves a combined approach of “top-down” analysis and “bottom-up” stock selection.  The “top-down” approach takes into consideration long-term investment themes, such as  globalization, demographics, productivity and innovation. As a result of the “top-down” analysis, the manager identifies sectors, industries and companies which it believes should benefit from the overall themes that the manager has observed.  As part of the “bottom-up” stock selection, the investment process involves looking for individual companies with earnings growth potential that should exceed the earnings growth rate of the overall market over the long-term, and that may not be fully recognized by the market at large.  The manager evaluates a number of different attributes, including the company’s specific market expertise or dominance, its competitive durability and pricing power, solid fundamentals, strong and ethical management, apparent commitment to shareholder interests, earnings growth rates that exceed those of the overall market and  what the manager believes to be above-average growth potential with sustainable competitive advantage.

Investment Goal

Red Oak Technology Select Fund seeks long-term capital growth by investing primarily in stocks of companies which rely extensively on technology for their product development or operations.  The Fund also seeks companies whose earnings and sales growth may be driven by technology-related products and services.

Investment Approach

Red Oak is a sector-specific mutual fund that invests primarily in technology companies that develop, produce, or distribute products or services related to computers, semi-conductors, and electronics. The manager’s investment process involves identifying what are believed to be the most attractive areas within technology and narrowing the search to individual stocks. The manager generally does not base stock selections on a company’s size, but rather on the assessment of its fundamental outlook. The manager invests with a long-term focus and seeks to keep the Fund’s portfolio turnover to a minimum relative to its peers.

              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.
