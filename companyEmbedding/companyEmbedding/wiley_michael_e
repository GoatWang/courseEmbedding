      ■ Michael E. Wiley spent his entire career in the oil and gas
      industry, and industry analysts regarded him as one of the top two or
      three executives in the entire field. Because of his highly successful
      28-year career with the Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO), Wiley was
      chosen to head up the world's third-largest oil and gas company,
      Baker Hughes Incorporated (BHI) at a time when the company was
      experiencing a serious slump in profits. After turning the ailing company
      around, he announced in 2004 that he would retire in April 2005.
      Responding to the announcement, lead BHI director H. John Riley said:
      "The entire board is extremely appreciative of Mike Wiley's
      outstanding leadership and his significant contributions to the success of
      Baker Hughes" (press release, April 28, 2004).
    

      EARLY CAREER
    

      Upon graduating from high school in 1968, Wiley entered the University of
      Tulsa as a student in the newly created Petroleum Engineering
      Undergraduate Scholarship program on a scholarship from ARCO. His summers
      were spent working for ARCO, one of the nation's largest oil
      companies, and he began full-time employment there after graduating in
      1972. After serving in numerous engineering capacities in production,
      operation, drilling, planning, and research and development in Alaska, the
      continental United States, and internationally, in 1991 he became vice
      president and began his rise in senior management.
    

      When ARCO created Vastar Resources in 1993—a 100 percent domestic
      exploration and production company with a presence in some of the most
      attractive oil and gas basins in the United States—Wiley became its
      first president. The following year he became its chairman and CEO as
      well. Houston-based Vastar was 82.3 percent owned by ARCO, and
      Wiley's direction made the fledgling company a leader in domestic
      exploration, production, and marketing and substantially strengthened
      ARCO's presence in the Gulf of Mexico. In an interview with Leslie
      Haines of 
      
        Oil & Gas Investor
      
      , Wiley commented: "The thing that really differentiates Vastar is
      that it has a very focused but broad-based exploration program that is
      significant compared to most of its peers" (January 1996).
    

      Wiley added that the cornerstones of his strategy were, first, to be a
      low-cost full-cycle company in all respects, from exploration to
      marketing. He said Vastar's cash-cost structure was as good as any
      in its peer group, and at startup their expenses were even lower than they
      had expected. Second, focused and disciplined exploration coupled with
      aggressive exploitation would drive internal growth. Apart from 5 percent
      "seed money" slated for expansion into new areas and
      technologies, 95 percent of their efforts would be concentrated on their
      regional focus areas—the rich fields in the Gulf of Mexico, the
      Gulf Coast, the San Juan Basin in New Mexico, and the Mid-continent Region
      extending from the Texas Panhandle into Michigan. His third strategy was
      value-added marketing: they were already a top producer-marketer in the
      United States, marketing nationally and selling more than two billion
      cubic feet daily. His fourth strategy was to keep the company financially
      strong and flexible. This would be achieved, he said, by keeping the
      balance sheet solid and by funding operations with internally generated
      cash.
    

      FOCUS AND EXPERTISE LEADS TO THE TOP
    

      In 1998 ARCO was the seventh-largest oil company in the United States and
      employed 20,000 people globally. On September 30 of that year, following
      an internal memo announcing planned budget cuts and layoffs to offset
      decreased oil prices globally and increased competition from larger
      companies, ARCO undertook a major management shake-up. Two top executives,
      including president William Wade, retired suddenly. Wiley was chosen to
      replace Wade and fill a newly created position as COO. ARCO chairman Mike
      Bowlin commented that the changes would help the company execute its core
      strategies, one of which was to focus on businesses in which they could
      maintain a leadership position in the industry.
    

      In May 2000 ARCO was acquired by BP Amoco, and thus ended Wiley's
      association with the company. Two months later, however, he was chosen by
      BHI, the world's third-largest oil-service company by market
      capitalization, to become president, chairman, and CEO. The position
      became vacant following the resignation of Max L. Lukens, under whose
      stewardship accounting blunders had caused the company to restate
      earnings. Industry analysts applauded the appointment, and James K.
      Wicklund of Dain Rauscher Wessels in Dallas summed up the enthusiasm:
      "We believe it will be very well received by investors, due to his
      CEO experience with a large, public oil and gas company and extensive oil
      field operating experience. Wiley is highly respected for his leadership
      ability and is considered one of the top two or three executives in the
      oil and gas industry" (
      
        Hart's Petroleum Finance Week
      
      , July 24, 2000).
    

      STRONG LEADERSHIP FOR A LANGUISHING COMPANY
    

      BHI, based in Houston, Texas, was a global provider of petroleum products
      and services. Apart from manufacturing well-drilling equipment,
      submersible oil pumps, and equipment to maintain oil and gas wells, it
      specialized in oil discovery and recovery, tested potential well sites,
      and drilled and operated wells. It also manufactured specialty chemicals
      for petroleum and wastewater-treatment industries. Its Oilfield segment
      alone was comprised of six operating divisions: Baker Atlas, providing
      down-hole well logging and services; Baker Oil Tools, providing down-hole
      completion, fishing equipment, and services; Baker Petrolite, providing
      specialty chemicals such as drilling fluids and stimulation additives;
      Centrilift, specializing in electric submersible pumps; Hughes
      Christensen, manufacturer of drill bits; and INTEQ, providing drilling and
      evaluation services.
    

      BHI was languishing in several areas, however, and Wiley's
      assignment was to turn the company around. Retired Marathon Oil chairman
      Victor G. Beghini, who led the search committee for BHI, commented that
      Wiley was "a strong leader and a tough-minded businessman, with
      hands-on technical and operating knowledge of the oil field. At Vastar, he
      demonstrated that he could mobilize people, assets, and technology to
      achieve change, growth, and solid profitability. Mike clearly has the
      qualities we are looking for in our CEO search" (
      
        Hart's Petroleum Finance Week
      
      , July 24, 2000). A BHI press release quoted Wiley as saying: "I
      have long respected the products and services of Baker Hughes. I am
      looking forward to working closely with our employees, customers, and
      stockholders as we become the premier performer in our industry"
      (July 19, 2000).
    

      In reporting his interview with Wiley for 
      
        Oil & Gas Investor
      
      , Bill Pike wrote: "Michael E. Wiley … brings
      enthusiasm—and the fresh viewpoint of a former customer—to
      the task of reversing the fortunes of BHI…. A veteran executive
      from the exploration and production sector crosses over to inject new life
      into Baker Hughes Inc." Pike noted that confidence in
      Wiley's leadership was so high that, of 25 industry analysts, 12
      rated BHI's stock a strong buy while another 12 rated it a buy. He
      quoted analyst Wicklund as commenting: "During [Wiley's]
      tenure at Vastar Resources, the company had the lowest finding costs in
      the Gulf of Mexico for four consecutive years." Wicklund felt that,
      while BHI still had "issues," they were now being addressed
      far more effectively and directly than many analysts had previously
      anticipated. Meanwhile, according to Pike, an analyst for A. G. Edwards
      & Sons said that the "weakness in stock price created a good
      opportunity to by a company that has become the purest play in the
      oilfield-service business and is finally on the right track" (May
      2001). Just nine months after Wiley joined BHI, the company's debt
      of $2.9 billion in 1999 had been reduced and the target for the end of
      2001 was set at $1.9 billion. That target was attained.
    

      When asked by Pike how his management style affected BHI's
      turnaround, Wiley responded: "I do not believe there is any one
      formula or methodology for management and leadership. I think each
      industry, each business has its own set of issues and opportunities. You
      have to be flexible…. The key is to build a culture of performance
      that creates value over a long period of time." He also said he
      felt sure the industry had not seen the end of fluctuating economic
      cycles, and that those inevitable cycles needed to be managed in a manner
      that attracts, maintains, and motivates the workforce: "That is a
      big one," he said.
    

      MISSION ACCOMPLISHED
    

      On April 28, 2004, Wiley announced to the BHI board that he would not seek
      reelection as its chairman when his
       term expired in April 2005, nor would he remain on as CEO. In a BHI press
      release, he said: "I will be nearing the end of five years as the
      leader of Baker Hughes. We have accomplished essentially all of the major
      objectives I set … and I am very proud to have shared this success
      with our outstanding employees and management team…. As a
      Best-in-Class leader in the oilfield services industry, Baker Hughes is
      well positioned for the future." H. John Riley, BHI's lead
      director, commented: "[Wiley] has implemented a strategy for growth
      and improved performance that has reenergized the Company. We are grateful
      to Mike for his dedicated efforts on behalf of the Company and look
      forward to working with him through out the year on the succession
      process" (press release, April 28, 2004).
