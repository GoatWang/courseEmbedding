This one of your most elegant products.  I ordered it to do birthday invitations for one of my most picky clients, and she loved them. I have become a fan of cards and pockets so much, that you are fast becoming a sole source.

The Democrats’ Better Way: Positive Messaging or Pandering to Trump Voters Who Are Never Coming Back?



George Washington law professor and economist praises Democrats for coming up with a message that preserves the party’s commitment to social justice issues, rather than attempting to woo Trump voters by appealing to what Trump appealed to.

Okay, if this shoe isn't fitting quite as well as your other Alegrias, take out the insole and remove the pink liner! I can't believe what a different that slim liner made to the toe box. (I read this on another site.) I'm super happy that the fit just improved and I'm walking out the door with them.

I have wide feet. Love the Alegria Paloma, which saved my feet after struggling with a neuroma and plantar fasciitis. But they are clunky shoes, and not very pretty. These Alegria Petal shoes are great-are cute ballet style flats with good arch supports. I wear 7.5, but they were too short, however they were wide enough for my wide feet. Ordered size 8- fit well, am ordering other colors!!!
I'd also recommend:  Finn comfort sandles with rocker soles

I think these shoes are adorable, but they're just too wide for my feet (and I have wide feet). I normally wear a 9, and my toes hit the front of the toebox. I had the same issue with the 9 1/2 AND my heel kept slipping out, no matter what kind of socks I tried. It's not just wide at the widest part of the foot, but also at the toes, which is why I think my foot kept sliding too far forward in the shoe. I'll stick to Alegria sandals from now on.

I can only wear Alegria's and this is my first pair in this style but they are really
cute and look dressier for skirts than some others. Very comfortable!
