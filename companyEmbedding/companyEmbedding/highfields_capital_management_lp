Business[edit]
In 2012, the company described itself as a "value-oriented investment management firm which manages private investment funds for endowments, charitable and philanthropic foundations, pension funds and other institutional and private investors ... [with] over $11 Billion in net capital invested worldwide".[4]
In 2010, Highfields was listed as having $10 billion of assets on January 1, 2010 (30th in The Hedge Fund Journal Top 50), up from $9.3 billion on July 1, 2009 and up from a 38th-place ranking in 2008.[3]
Highfields has invested in publicly traded equities;[5] private companies like Harry & David,[6][7] Michaels (6.2%[8]) and Genworth Financial;[9] and other investments including reinsurance sidecars.[10] In February 2012, Highfields called for management change at CoreLogic,[11] in which it had a 7.65% stake.[12]
Senior management[edit]
Richard Grubman and Jonathon Jacobson were the founders and principals of Highfields.[3]
Grubman retired in August 2010.[13][14][12]
Jacobson is an undergraduate alumnus of Wharton School in finance and has an MBA from Harvard Business School.[12] After working as an options trader and at Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers, he joined Harvard Management Company in 1990. In 1998 Jacobson HMC left to co-found Highfields with a third of the fund's initial $1.5 billion under management coming from HMC.[12] Bloomberg reported in 2011 that HMC no longer invested with Highfields.[15]

[with] over $11 Billion in net capital invested worldwide".[4]
In 2010, Highfields was listed as having $10 billion of assets on January 1, 2010 (30th in The Hedge Fund Journal Top 50), up from $9.3 billion on July 1, 2009 and up from a 38th-place ranking in 2008.[3]
Highfields has invested in publicly traded equities;[5] private companies like Harry & David,[6][7] Michaels (6.2%[8]) and Genworth Financial;[9] and other investments including reinsurance sidecars.[10] In February 2012, Highfields called for management change at CoreLogic,[11] in which it had a 7.65% stake.[12]
Senior management[edit]
Richard Grubman and Jonathon Jacobson were the founders and principals of Highfields.[3]
Grubman retired in August 2010.[13][14][12]
Jacobson is an undergraduate alumnus of Wharton School in finance and has an MBA from Harvard Business School.[12] After working as an options trader and at Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers, he joined Harvard Management Company in 1990. In 1998 Jacobson HMC left to co-found Highfields with a third of the fund's initial $1.5 billion under management coming from HMC.[12] Bloomberg reported in 2011 that HMC no longer invested with Highfields.[15]

Business[edit]
In 2012, the company described itself as a "value-oriented investment management firm which manages private investment funds for endowments, charitable and philanthropic foundations, pension funds and other institutional and private investors ... [with] over $11 Billion in net capital invested worldwide".[4]
In 2010, Highfields was listed as having $10 billion of assets on January 1, 2010 (30th in The Hedge Fund Journal Top 50), up from $9.3 billion on July 1, 2009 and up from a 38th-place ranking in 2008.[3]
Highfields has invested in publicly traded equities;[5] private companies like Harry & David,[6][7] Michaels (6.2%[8]) and Genworth Financial;[9] and other investments including reinsurance sidecars.[10] In February 2012, Highfields called for management change at CoreLogic,[11] in which it had a 7.65% stake.[12]
Senior management[edit]
Richard Grubman and Jonathon Jacobson were the founders and principals of Highfields.[3]
Grubman retired in August 2010.[13][14][12]
Jacobson is an undergraduate alumnus of Wharton School in finance and has an MBA from Harvard Business School.[12] After working as an options trader and at Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers, he joined Harvard Management Company in 1990. In 1998 Jacobson HMC left to co-found Highfields with a third of the fund's initial $1.5 billion under management coming from HMC.[12] Bloomberg reported in 2011 that HMC no longer invested with Highfields.[15]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
