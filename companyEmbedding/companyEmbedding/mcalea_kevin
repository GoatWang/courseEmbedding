Biography
English / Deutsch



Kevin McAlea
Born on 10th April, 1949 in Belfast, Kevin comes from a musical family, and plays keyboards, saxophone and twelve-string guitar. He played with a number of groups in Ireland, before moving to London and joining Bees Make Honey, familiar faces on the pub rock circuit, in the spring of 1974.  He went into session work (including keyboards on the first two solo albums by X-Ray Spex vocalist Poly Styrene), and even built his own synthesizers. Subsequently he has toured and recorded with, amongst others, Kate Bush, Clannad, Seal, Enya, Roy Harper and, of course, Barclay James Harvest. He had the unenviable task of filling at least part of Woolly's role when he was drafted in to assist with the recording of Eyes Of The Universe in 1979, where he played Hammond organ, mini-Moog and grand piano. The subsequent 1980 tour of Britain and Europe culminated in the band's biggest ever show, in front of 175,000 people at the Reichstag in Berlin.

Kevin became a regular with BJH, guesting on 1981's Turn Of The Tide as well as the 1981, 1982 and 1984 tours. In 1984 he also found time to write the English lyrics for Nena's worldwide hit "99 Red Balloons". Back with BJH, he guested on the Face To Face, Caught In The Light and River Of Dreams albums, plus all the live shows from 1987 to 1995 inclusive. He was also credited with "additional arrangement" on "Yesterday's Heroes" from River Of Dreams. He has written music for film and TV and formed his own group, the Celtic Orbis project, in 1999. His keyboards, Uilleann pipes, whistles and Irish bouzouki can be heard on the Celtic Orbis album The Dagda's Cauldron and at the Celtic Orbis web site and MySpace page:

http://www.celticorbis.co.uk

http://www.myspace.com/celticorbis


Kevin has also been writing songs for Pearson Longman English language courses, where he writes and records the songs (in Logic Audio), programs all the parts, plays the guitars and then gets professional singers in for the vocals. Another old friend of BJH, Gregg Jackman, then mixes the finished recordings.

In September 2014 Kevin performed with Kate Bush in her stunning series of twenty-two live concerts in London, and in 2015 and 2016 he joins Dave Gilmour's live band for concerts across Europe and the U.S.A. in support of the album Rattle That Lock.

Kevin McAlea
Geboren am 10. April 1949 in Belfast. Kevin stammt aus einer musikalischen Familie und spielt Keyboards, Saxophon und Twelve-string-Gitarre. Er spielte mit diversen Gruppen in Irland, bevor er nach London zog und der Gruppe Bees Make Honey beitrat, die im Frühling 1974 bekannte Gesichter in Pubrock-Kreisen waren.  Er begann mit Sessionarbeit (einschließlich Keyboards auf den ersten beiden Alben vom X-Ray Spex Sänger Poly Styrene), und baute sogar seine eigenen Synthesizers. Danach tourte er mitunter mit Kate Bush, Clannad, Seal, Enya, Roy Harper und natürlich Barclay James Harvest und nahm mit ihnen Platten auf. Er hatte die undankbare Aufgabe, wenigstens einen Teil von Woollys Rolle zu übernehmen, als er 1979 gebeten wurde, bei den Aufnahmen von Eyes Of The Universe mitzuwirken, wo er Hammondorgel, Mini-Moog und Flügel spielte. Die nachfolgende 1980er Tour durch Britannien und Europa endete mit der größten Show aller Zeiten für die Band: vor 175,000 Leuten am Berliner Reichstag.

Kevin gastierte regelmäßig bei BJH, vom 1981er Turn Of The Tide wie auch auf den Tourneen von 1981, 1982 und 1984. 1984 fand er auch die Zeit, den englischen Text für Nenas Welthit "99 Red Balloons" (99 Luftballons) zu schreiben. Wieder bei BJH, gastierte er auf den Alben Face To Face, Caught In The Light und River Of Dreams plus allen Liveshows von 1987 bis einschließlich 1995. Er wurde auch in den Credits für "additional arrangement" in "Yesterday's Heroes" von River Of Dreams erwähnt. Er hat Musik für Film und Fernsehen geschrieben und gründete 1999 seine eigene Gruppe, Celtic Orbis. Seine Keyboards, Uilleann Pipes, Pfeifen und irische Bouzouki kann man auf dem Celtic Orbis Album The Dagda's Cauldron hören:

http://www.celticorbis.co.uk

http://www.myspace.com/celticorbis


Zuletzt hat Kevin Songs für Pearson Longman English Sprachkurse geschrieben, wobei er die Songs (in Logic Audio) schreibt, aufnimmt, alle Teile programmiert, die Gitarren spielt und dann professionelle Sänger für den Gesang anheuert. Gregg Jackman, auch ein alter Freund von BJH, mischt die fertigen Aufnahmen dann ab.

Ab Juli 2014 übt Kevin zusammen mit Kate Bush für ihre Serie von zweiundzwanzig Konzerten in London im September, als Teil eines Super-Lineups, auch mit Musikern der Bands von Miles Davis, Weather Report, Herbie Hancock und Peter Gabriel.
