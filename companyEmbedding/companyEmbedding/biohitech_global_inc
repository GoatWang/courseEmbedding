Dispose & Digest



                Eco-Safe Digester® is simple technology that eliminates food waste on-site. Since the digested food
                waste is converted into wastewater it is natural to use the municipal sewer systems to transport that
                water to wastewater treatment facilities where it will be recovered. There is no waste to store or
                transport, no residual solids to handle or manage, and no extra handling is required.
            






Add

                    Food waste is added to the digester continuously throughout the day
                





Digest

                    Aerobic digestion converts up to 2,500 pounds of waste each day
                





Drain

                    The result is a wastewater that can safely be disposed of to a standard sewer line

BioHiTech Cloud™
Measure & Optimize



                BioHiTech Cloud™ delivers a reliable, manageable, and secure reporting platform for data that
                can
                be accessed on many types of devices offering a simple explanation that brings value to our
                customers.
                Quantifying food waste data in real-time is paramount to driving increased profitability, enhancing
                staff performance, reporting sustainability progress, and preventing waste altogether.
            






Measure

                    Accurately identify what is wasted in order to prevent it. Track waste by the hour, day, month,
                    employee, location, or type of food.
                





Analyze

                    Detailed reporting for single or multiple locations provides a unique view of your food waste
                    profile.
                





Optimize

                    Collecting data will help you make critical decisions related to purchasing, staffing and
                    production
                    to drive down costs, prevent waste, and save the environment.

Words From Our Customers

"The installation of the Eco-Safe Digester is giving us the opportunity to
                    have a positive impact on the environment by instituting a sustainable practice into our operations
                    that reduces waste, pollution, and the hotel’s carbon footprint."




Words From Our Customers

"In addition to the hauling savings there is the added financial benefit
                    of labor savings. We no longer have kitchen staff transporting garbage well away from the restaurant
                    to an out-of-the-way location, where it stays in dumpsters until pick-up."




Words From Our Customers

"For every $1 saved in the Food Bank operating budget, we can provide
                    between $7 and $8 worth of food."




Words From Our Customers

"Our sustainability approach to food not only includes our commitment to
                    sourcing new organic products, but also our impact on the environment. Our ability and willingness
                    to embrace technology not only puts us in compliance of new and upcoming legislation, it allows us
                    to identify opportunities for process improvement. This initiative is a rare example of how the
                    right strategy can create both consumer and investor value from both sustainable and financial
                    standpoints."




Words From Our Customers

"After researching the few options for food waste disposal, and weighing
                    the risks and reward of each solution, we felt BioHiTech’s on-site solution was the most
                    environmentally and economically friendly way to divert waste from going to landfills. BioHiTech’s
                    solution will not only allow us to divert the waste, but also give us information to help prevent
                    and reduce waste wherever possible. This strategy will take the VA a step closer to helping achieve
                    a world without waste."




Words From Our Customers

"This smart waste management solution is more than just about eliminating
                    it more efficiently it is all about learning how to prevent what is wasted. Managing waste properly
                    lowered our operational costs and improved our environmental performance."




Words From Our Customers

"Changes in procurement and food preparation will not only afford us the
                    means to achieve a more sustainable status but will offer significant economic benefits and greater
                    efficiency."

Dec 22, 2015


                
                In the Richmond section of Vancouver, city officials are demanding more stringent air-quality regulations to control the stink from the region’s composting plant, suggesting the methods of odor management being used are “out of date.” Harvest Power, which has held a composting facility license since 1997 and collects 200,000 tonnes of Metro Vancouver’s food scraps each year, has […]

Jul 28, 2015


                
                Local governments have mailed out brochures. They’ve held live web chats. They’ve designed helpful magnets.

BioHiTech: SubCo Launch Completes Product Ecosystem, Should Be Highly Synergistic - BioHiTech Global, Inc. (OTCMKTS:BHTG) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»BioHiTech: SubCo Launch Completes Product Ecosystem, Should Be Highly SynergisticMay.25.16 | About: BioHiTech Global, (BHTG) Dallas Salazar IPOs, contrarian, long/short equity, long-term horizonATLAS CONSULTINGSummaryBioHiTech Global (BHTG), a microcap I've been tracking from the outside, is out with a nice update regarding its product portfolio and potential TAM.BioHiTech announced that it has “launched its new subsidiary, Entsorga North America". Entsorga North America brings with it a unique technology that completes BioHiTech's product ecosystem.I breakout the structuring of the SubCo launch as well as how the new technology should be a multiplier to existing growth drivers; also, how it will drive other synergies.The BioHiTech story continues to get better and better - this startup is highly unique and executing at a level I've rarely ever seen.BioHiTech Global (OTCQB:BHTG), a microcap I've been tracking from the outside (no position currently), is out with a nice update regarding its product portfolio and potential TAM. For those unfamiliar, BioHiTech is a clean-tech company that "provides data-driven solutions for disposal of food" - or put simply, it provides a combination data-monitoring platform as well as a "digester" to customers that converts food waste to "grey water". Grey water is a natural waste product that can be transported to waste water treatment facilities via traditional municipal sewer systems rather than by truck. Eliminating the usage of trucks helps lowers operational costs for building owners and helps reduce the ancillary liabilities associated with storage capacity equipment and associated human capital. Summarized, BioHiTech helps fix a meaningful cost at a lower net overhead number. That, of course, matters greatly to the building owner tethered to such costs. BioHiTech has also recently expanded its data collection and analysis capacity and is now able to meaningful, in a quantifiable way, contribute to human-capital productivity management and overall human-capital cost management. On May 16, 2016 BioHiTech announced that it "launched its new subsidiary, Entsorga North America". Entsorga North America, which will manage Apple Valley Waste Conversions LLC (an Entsorga North America part-owned subsidiary), possesses an exclusive license to deploy proprietary Entsorga HEBioT Mechanical Biological Treatment (NYSE:MBT) technology throughout the northeastern United States. The HEBioT MBT system converts food waste, plastics and other carbon based materials from the mixed municipal solid waste (NASDAQ:MSW) stream into an EPA recognized alternative fuel source. It's important to note that the structuring of Entsorga North America - having it only partially own the managed SubCo "Apple Valley Waste Conversions LLC" - will mean the BioHiTech SubCo "Entsorga North America" is a SubCo that will have substantially no assets or liabilities other than the license to deploy Entsorga MBT technology.
 Currently, BioHiTech's fleet of deployed digesters DOES NOT possess the capacity to convert to traditional municipal sewer system acceptable waste product "plastics and other carbon based materials (that are not considered food waste). Definitively, the subsidiary launch of Entsorga North America is a total addressable market multiplier and a massive product portfolio addition. This is before considering the data/analytics capture expansion this positions BioHiTech for on a go-forward basis (something I'll elaborate on later). Using the new Entsorga North America-SubCo based technology, waste received at a facility will be converted to a clean burning alternative fuel (Solid Recovered Fuel or SRF), which will be used as an alternative or supplement to fossil fuels. SRF is ideal for co-processing plants such as cement kilns and steel mills, as well as coal fired power plants, as a source for the production of renewable energy. The Entsorga MBT technology creates an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-recognized "engineered fuel." This means that facilities using this specific SRF, as an alternative fuel, will not be subject to the EPA incinerator rule (Commercial/Industrial Solid Waste Incinerator Rule) and that the SRF meets certain standards that other fuels cannot meet. Frank Celli, BioHiTech CEO stated in a press release announcing the SubCo launch, "We now have the ability to expand our solutions to provide economically feasible alternatives for organic and inorganic waste disposal to all generators, including businesses and municipalities. We will deploy this exciting technology along with our Eco-Safe Digesters throughout the United States, providing a 'one stop' solution to our customers". Clearly, I would agree. And yet again BioHiTech has done the hard to imagine for a startup of its size. So far into my coverage of BioHiTech I've opined on its data-based, data-led, data-quantifiable value-prop to customers as being the reason to consider investment and/or to consider following the story. Celli, who I chat with often in following the narrative, calls this startup's "if you can't measure it you can't manage it" message; a message that clearly is resonating with its expanding client base. With the SubCo launch of Entsorga North America, which will have a completed processing facility erected in Martinsburg, West Virginia in the spring of 2017, BioHiTech can begin to seed and expand into an entirely new inorganic waste market - one that I believe will take to the data-based, data-quantifiable value prop as well as its predecessor has. It should be noted, the West Virginia facility is being erected via a $25 million tax-exempt bond issued by the West Virginia Economic Development Authority. This facility is being erected at no cost to BioHiTech, outside of its licensing agreement, in that its Subco Entsorga North America is partially owned by the actual owner of the Entsorga MBT technology (who is responsible for the facility and facility financing dynamic). Details of BioHiTech's SubCo license as well as economics of the license are available via a recently updated investor presentation posted to the BioHiTech investor relations website. The license, from my review, appears to be one in which BioHiTech is paid for throughput provided. Considering BioHiTech's considerable existing volume and potential volume scale over the immediate and mid-term, these throughput revenues could very quickly add up.
 While not wanting to assume too large an economic impact, at least in the immediate and/or mid-term, I do think it's safe to assume some level of economic contribution from this licensing agreement/SubCo launch - especially longer-term - in that now BioHiTech has a comprehensive, complete product ecosystem that runs the full spectrum of organic AND inorganic waste. BioHiTech can now scale to whatever level its diverse customer base wants to scale to (of course taking into account current size and balance sheet constraints) without having product-based, capacity-based constraints - which is huge. BioHiTech also now has a secondary product to 1) sell when meeting new prospects - potentially increasing total ticket and/or recurring revenue capture, and 2) to sell back into its book. Those with sales backgrounds know that selling back into a book of clients is (generally) easier to do (meaning the sales calls close at higher rates than new sales) and do well to increase retention. Both should do well to drive overall financials over time (even using the most conservative of assumptions) at BioHiTech; one can reasonably assume a fair amount of operating leverage being realized from 1) increased sales team productivity on a per dollar basis (per dollar of cash G&A as a result of what's been outlined above) and 2) other synergistic effects of having an expanded product portfolio. Again, BioHiTech won't even begin to monetize this tech until spring 2017 - but it can sure seed the "new" market it can target as well as take LOI's until then. All told this is yet another maturation point that I think investors should take careful note of in regards to the BioHiTech story. BioHiTech, on the heels of its best quarter in company history, continues to execute and continues to build out a real business; a data-based, data-led, quantifiable value-prop having business. With its client base just now beginning to express confidence in the name, via expanded orders and follow on additions to existing fleet delivery, I think BioHiTech has a superb future in front of it. The buildout of the TAM and the product portfolio should embellish already in the works growth drivers at the company (outlined by CEO Frank Celli here): increased traction of and expansion of the BioHiTech Cloud and BioHiTech Cirrus (BioHiTech's two prong analytics platform), international expansion (Latin America, Asia, etc.) via partners, and expansion of artificial intelligence capacity (via the introduction of data/analytics "bots" as described by Frank Celli). If you can add a starter position in the highly-illiquid stock without blowing out pricing, I'd do so.
 Good luck, everybody.

                        aerobic digestion technology to eliminate food waste at its origin. This clean technology uses
                        microorganisms and oxygen to safely and quickly break-down food waste and discharges it to a
                        standard sewer line. The Digesters are modern, smart, network-connected devices
                        that can be monitored across large numbers of locations under one brand.
                    




BioHiTech Cloud™ uses Big Data

                        users with powerful reporting and analytics tools. BioHiTech Cloud offers unparalleled

E.N.A. Renewables




                        E.N.A. Renewables, through its joint ventures, will be the first to introduce a proprietary
                        system of Mechanical Biological Treatment (MBT) to the United States.
                    

                        Utilizing a combination of automated sorting equipment, enhanced biological composting, and
                        mechanical refinement, the High Efficiency Biological Treatment (HEBioT®) process will
                        ultimately remove recyclables, produce a clean alternative fuel and achieve approximately 80%
                        landfill diversion.
                        Our MBT technology is perfect for larger generators of food waste, municipalities, and
                        corporations with Zero Waste initiatives.

BioHiTech Global, Inc. Key Developments

BioHiTech Global, Inc. Receives a Purchase Order to Deploy Two Eco-Safe Digesters® from a International Resort Developer and Operator
Jul 18 17
BioHiTech Global, Inc. announced that the company has received a purchase order to deploy two Eco-Safe Digesters® from a international resort developer and operator, marking the fifth property location to implement BioHiTech's commercial food waste disposal systems. BioHiTech's Eco-Safe Digesters offer a one-step solution for converting food waste into safe wastewater, allowing businesses to conveniently meet their recycling requirements in a cost-effective manner and achieve even greater sustainability. BioHiTech's on-site solution eliminates the need to store or transport food waste – reducing costs and eliminating the pests and odor that accompany food waste storage. The Resort Company will also utilize BioHiTech Cirrus™ at the location, the Company's proprietary cloud-based mobile app, that can turn each unit into a 'Smart' device that provides a wealth of actionable real-time data analytics to improve supply chain management and operational efficiency.


BioHiTech Global, Inc. Provides Update on Launch of New Revolution Series Digesters
Jun 13 17
BioHiTech Global, Inc. provided an update on the initial launch of its new Revolution Series Digesters. The company received an extremely favorable response to the launch of its Revolution Series Digesters at the RFMA tradeshow in early March and has already received numerous requests for pilots from new and existing customers including several national restaurant and grocery store chains. As a result of the initial market response to the Revolution Series Digesters the Company has scheduled an initial order for 100 units that it expects to roll out in the coming quarters. The new digester series targets a large market segment of the food services industry that represents more than 1.5 million potential customers including full and quick service restaurants, coffee shops, hospitality companies and other specialty food service providers. The company intends to expand its 30-day pilot programs and expects this will lead to a sharp increase in unit rentals that will impact revenue beginning in the second half of 2017. The new Revolution Series Digesters are designed to cost effectively meet the needs of not only the restaurant market segment but also any small volume waste generator by leveraging the same regulatory compliant digestive technologies as the company's successful line of Eco-Safe Digesters that service the mid-to-large volume organic waste markets. The Revolution Series Digester units have a compact design requiring minimal floor space and eliminate the odors, leaks, and pests associated with the use of dumpsters and bins. They operate on standard 115 Volt power and can be easily connected to existing plumbing in about two hours. The rapid throughput of the units will enable BioHiTech to offer this sustainable solution at a cost that is competitive with or lower than traditional waste disposal.

Words From Our Customers

"The installation of the Eco-Safe Digester is giving us the opportunity to
                    have a positive impact on the environment by instituting a sustainable practice into our operations
                    that reduces waste, pollution, and the hotel’s carbon footprint."




Words From Our Customers

"In addition to the hauling savings there is the added financial benefit
                    of labor savings. We no longer have kitchen staff transporting garbage well away from the restaurant
                    to an out-of-the-way location, where it stays in dumpsters until pick-up."




Words From Our Customers

"For every $1 saved in the Food Bank operating budget, we can provide
                    between $7 and $8 worth of food."




Words From Our Customers

"Our sustainability approach to food not only includes our commitment to
                    sourcing new organic products, but also our impact on the environment. Our ability and willingness
                    to embrace technology not only puts us in compliance of new and upcoming legislation, it allows us
                    to identify opportunities for process improvement. This initiative is a rare example of how the
                    right strategy can create both consumer and investor value from both sustainable and financial
                    standpoints."




Words From Our Customers

"After researching the few options for food waste disposal, and weighing
                    the risks and reward of each solution, we felt BioHiTech’s on-site solution was the most
                    environmentally and economically friendly way to divert waste from going to landfills. BioHiTech’s
                    solution will not only allow us to divert the waste, but also give us information to help prevent
                    and reduce waste wherever possible. This strategy will take the VA a step closer to helping achieve

                                Emerging technologies provide opportunity to recycle & prevent food waste
            


            April 20, 2016
        



















        Frank E. Celli, CEO of BioHiTech Global
        





In 2009, San Francisco became the first local municipal ordinance in the United States to universally require source separation of all organic material, including food residuals. Since then, cities, counties and a handful of states have passed similar legislation requiring commercial facilities that generate large amounts of waste to either send the source separated food waste to an authorized recycling facility or to utilize alternative “on-site” diversion technologies moving the food waste out of landfills.  Several emerging technologies are not only helping generators comply with these legislations initiatives, but they are making an impact on how we address the problem of waste around the globe.

BioHiTech: Launching Renewable Energy Proof Of Concept Efforts - BioHiTech Global, Inc. (OTCMKTS:BHTG) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»BioHiTech: Launching Renewable Energy Proof Of Concept EffortsJan.20.16 | About: BioHiTech Global, (BHTG) Dallas Salazar IPOs, contrarian, long/short equity, long-term horizonATLAS CONSULTINGSummaryBioHiTech is out with news that it’s launching a proof of concept effort – currently at just lab-scale – for a product portfolio addition.
        BioHiTech’s proof of concept efforts, if ultimately proven successful at commercial scale, would allow it a potential renewable energy vertical entry.
        BioHiTech’s proof of concept partner, Natural Systems Utilities, has been able to show successful “early trials” to which BioHiTech will leverage in completion efforts.
        I think it’s premature to be anything but optimistic from a speculative standpoint but I’m going to be following these developments very closely.
        BioHiTech Global (OTCPK:BHTG), a microcap I've been tracking from the outside (no position currently), is out with a nice update regarding its product portfolio and potential TAM. For those unfamiliar, BioHiTech is a clean-tech company that "provides data-driven solutions for disposal of food" - or put simply, it provides a "digester" to customers that converts food waste to "grey water". Grey water is a natural waste product that can be transported to waste water treatment facilities via traditional municipal sewer systems rather than by truck. Eliminating the usage of trucks helps lowers operational costs for building owners and helps reduce the ancillary liabilities associated with storage capacity equipment and associated human capital. Summarized, BioHiTech helps fix a meaningful cost at a lower net overhead number. That, of course, matters greatly to the building owner tethered to such costs. Yes, the business model at BioHiTech is currently that simple. But as simple as BioHiTech's story seems, it's really not that simple. The recent update from the company is a perfect example. BioHiTech is out with news that it's launching a proof of concept effort - currently at just lab-scale - for a product portfolio addition that will allow BioHiTech's Eco-Safe Digester to "digest, tank, and deliver the grey water from its Eco-Safe Digesters to Anaerobic Digestion (AD) facilities anywhere in the world". That's right, anywhere in the world. But why does this matter? Where's the monetization event?
 Well, outside of this effort adding to the overall capacity and product portfolio at the company - if proof of concept milestones can be hit and if BioHiTech can scale this concept up to commercial levels - this effort also expands the total addressable market that can be targeted by the company. BioHiTech's proof of concept efforts, again if ultimately proven successful at commercial scale, would allow it to tank its unit's grey water which would allow for transportation to an anaerobic digestion plant where biogas can be captured and used to create renewable energy. BioHiTech's proof of concept partner, Natural Systems Utilities, has been able to show successful "early trials" (likely single instances at less than lab-scale) in which feeding the material to a digester have been successful. Natural Systems Utilities will leverage its prior data with BioHiTech's intellectual capital and operating prowess in an effort to prove concept at higher scale. I think it's premature to be anything but optimistic from a speculative standpoint but I'm going to be following these developments very closely. With alternative/renewable energy still a huge focus of government funding efforts and with it now, in light of what's taken place in traditional energy T24M, becoming a major non-traditional capital focus (PE, VC, etc.) I could see BioHiTech and Co. marketing any early proof of concept to funding effort success. Unlike many alternative/renewable energy efforts, what BioHiTech is trying to do, at least with this particular segment, is more of an operating process than an exercise in science. BioHiTech is simply dialing in the efficacy of its digester - BioHiTech will need to leave its digestion process at different stages of being incomplete for this effort to prove concept - rather than inventing or creating additional processes (via operating processes or science). That derisks this effort greatly in my opinion. Still though, if BioHiTech can successfully prove concept it should be able to qualify for process tethered IP (READ: patent protection for the process). That matters from a valuation standpoint when trying to figure out what this vertical could generate longer term. Again, I'll wait to do that until we're further down the development road.
 All told I thought the update from BioHiTech was productive. I think it shows that there's more to the story of the company's digester than meets the eye and I think it shows that BioHiTech has target markets that are proactively looking for solutions. That matters. It's one thing to be government mandated into a solution - or a cost uptick for that matter - but it's a completely different story to want to find a solution to a problem from a proactive basis. From my background in consulting I've learned that the easiest way to sell a product is to sell it to a market that's already looking for it (or something like it). It looks like BioHiTech might be on the road to doing just that for a very, very large market. Good luck everybody. Risks:  BioHiTech is a microcap with shares traded over the counter, where liquidity is often light. Low liquidity is one of the reasons the stock is so cheap. You can buy the stock well below fair value, but that also means you may have a problem selling at fair value, or at all, in the future. Because of the illiquidity in the shares, you should only enter a position if you won't need the money in the near term. Secondly, there is competition. The overall sector in which the company operates is competitive, and almost all the competitors in BioHiTech's space are much better funded, have longer track records of operations, and are in a better position to access the credit markets. Third, there is execution risk. If management does try to significantly grow the business and increase market share organically by increasing expenses, the plan could suffer setbacks and the company could be forced to raise capital on inferior terms, if it can raise capital at all.
