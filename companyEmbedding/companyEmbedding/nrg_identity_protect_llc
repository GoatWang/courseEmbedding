"GREAT SERVICE" 



"I have had LifeLock for several years with upgrading to Ultimate Plus within the past year. They have thwarted attempts at my personal information twice in the past month. I would probably have never known of these if I hadn't had LifeLock. Thanks for taking care of this, LifeLock." 


Tres S, Current Ultimate Plus Member 


Member since Jan 2009 







"THANK YOU"  



"I was notified of fraudulent attempt to open a cell phone service in my name without my knowledge. I was asked to verify if it was me. When I said no the account was stopped. It made me feel thankful that someone was looking out for me." 


Joyce S, Current Member

Peace of mind

                                                I just got my first alert.  It  felt so reassuring. I am an older person (64 years old) and have been increasingly scared about identity theft.  I know I have to be vigilant but it helps to know that LifeLock has my back.  THANKS.

FICO


FICO® Scores are developed by Fair Isaac Corporation. The FICO Score provided by ConsumerInfo.com, Inc., also referred to as Experian Consumer Services ("ECS"), in Experian CreditWorksSM, Credit TrackerSM and/or your free Experian membership (as applicable) is based on FICO Score 8, unless otherwise noted. Many but not all lenders use FICO Score 8.
In addition to the FICO Score 8, ECS may offer and provide other base or industry-specific FICO Scores (such as FICO Auto Scores and FICO Bankcard Scores). The other FICO Scores made available are calculated from versions of the base and industry-specific FICO Score models. There are many different credit scoring models that can give a different assessment of your credit rating and relative risk (risk of default) for the same credit report. Your lender or insurer may use a different FICO Score than FICO Score 8 or such other base or industry-specific FICO Score, or another type of credit score altogether. Just remember that your credit rating is often the same even if the number is not.
For some consumers, however, the credit rating of FICO Score 8 (or other FICO Score) could vary from the score used by your lender. The statements that "90% of top lenders use FICO Scores" and "FICO Scores are used in 90% of credit decisions" are based on a third-party study of all versions of FICO Scores sold to lenders, including but not limited to scores based on FICO Score 8. Base FICO Scores (including the FICO Score 8) range from 300 to 850. Industry-specific FICO Scores range from 250-900. Higher scores represent a greater likelihood that you'll pay back your debts so you are viewed as being a lower credit risk to lenders. A lower FICO Score indicates to lenders that you may be a higher credit risk.
There are three different major credit reporting agencies — the Experian credit bureau, TransUnion® and Equifax® — that maintain a record of your credit history known as your credit report. Your FICO Score is based on the information in your credit report at the time it is requested. Your credit report information can vary from agency to agency because some lenders report your credit history to only one or two of the agencies. So your FICO Score can vary if the information they have on file for you is different. Since the information in your report can change over time, your FICO Score may also change.

Experian CreditLock FAQs






What is a credit lock?
A credit lock allows you to easily lock your Credit Report, helping to protect you against identity theft and unwanted credit activity. If someone attempts to apply for credit in your name while your Report is locked, you will be notified with a real time alert.
When locked, your Experian Credit Report is NOT accessible to:

Banks and lenders that check your Credit Report for a credit or loan application
Companies checking your Credit Report in order to open new utilities, cellular service or apartment rentals

When locked, your Experian Credit Report is accessible to:

You, as part of your Experian CreditWorksSM Premium membership
Potential employers or insurance companies during the application process
Companies that have an existing credit relationship with you
Collection agencies acting on behalf of companies you may owe
Government agencies in connection to a Child Support claim
Personalized offers from Experian, such as credit card offers, if you choose to receive them
Companies providing pre-screened credit card offers. Learn more about opting out of credit offers



How can Experian CreditLock help prevent credit fraud?
If an identity thief tries to apply for credit in your name, access to your Credit Report will be blocked when the lender tries to view it, stopping the crime before it starts. If someone tries to access your Report while it is locked, you will be notified with a real time alert.


What kind of Alerts will I get with Experian CreditLock?
In addition to the regular alerts you receive as part of your membership, Experian CreditLock provides attempted inquiry alerts that inform you when someone attempts to apply for credit while your Report is locked. You will receive a confirmation alert when you lock or unlock your Experian Credit Report.






What does it mean if my Experian Credit Report is unlocked?

Banks or lenders may review your Report if you, or someone who claims to be you, applies for a loan or financing in your name.
Any company with permissible purpose may access your Report if it is unlocked. This means any company with a legal right, including any new or existing creditor wishing to review your Report or extend you credit; a Grand Jury request; a potential employer or an insurance company underwriting a policy.
To block unwanted inquiries and potential fraudulent activity, you may want to keep your Experian Credit Report locked until you’re in the market for credit or financing.



If I use Experian CreditLock, can any information, including new accounts, be posted to my Experian Credit Report?
When your Experian Credit Report is locked, new accounts may still be reported to Experian and posted to your Experian Credit Report if:

A creditor opens an account using a report from one of the other major credit bureaus that you have not locked or applied a security freeze.
You unlock your Experian Credit Report, granting access to a potential lender or creditor.



What is the difference between Experian CreditLock, a Security Freeze and a Fraud Alert?
With Experian CreditLock, you have greater control over who can view your Credit Report, blocking unwanted inquiries that result in extensions of credit. Locking your Credit Report gives you similar protection to a security freeze, but with additional advantages. Learn more about the differences between CreditLock, Security Freezes, and Fraud Alerts.


What happens if my Report is locked and I cancel or downgrade my Experian CreditWorks Premium membership?
Your Experian Credit Report will be unlocked at the end of your billing cycle.

FICO


FICO® Scores are developed by Fair Isaac Corporation. The FICO Score provided by ConsumerInfo.com, Inc., also referred to as Experian Consumer Services ("ECS"), in Experian CreditWorksSM, Credit TrackerSM and/or your free Experian membership (as applicable) is based on FICO Score 8, unless otherwise noted. Many but not all lenders use FICO Score 8.
In addition to the FICO Score 8, ECS may offer and provide other base or industry-specific FICO Scores (such as FICO Auto Scores and FICO Bankcard Scores). The other FICO Scores made available are calculated from versions of the base and industry-specific FICO Score models. There are many different credit scoring models that can give a different assessment of your credit rating and relative risk (risk of default) for the same credit report. Your lender or insurer may use a different FICO Score than FICO Score 8 or such other base or industry-specific FICO Score, or another type of credit score altogether. Just remember that your credit rating is often the same even if the number is not.
For some consumers, however, the credit rating of FICO Score 8 (or other FICO Score) could vary from the score used by your lender. The statements that "90% of top lenders use FICO Scores" and "FICO Scores are used in 90% of credit decisions" are based on a third-party study of all versions of FICO Scores sold to lenders, including but not limited to scores based on FICO Score 8. Base FICO Scores (including the FICO Score 8) range from 300 to 850. Industry-specific FICO Scores range from 250-900. Higher scores represent a greater likelihood that you'll pay back your debts so you are viewed as being a lower credit risk to lenders. A lower FICO Score indicates to lenders that you may be a higher credit risk.
There are three different major credit reporting agencies — the Experian credit bureau, TransUnion® and Equifax® — that maintain a record of your credit history known as your credit report. Your FICO Score is based on the information in your credit report at the time it is requested. Your credit report information can vary from agency to agency because some lenders report your credit history to only one or two of the agencies. So your FICO Score can vary if the information they have on file for you is different. Since the information in your report can change over time, your FICO Score may also change.

Credit monitoring FAQs






How can credit monitoring and fraud resolution help me?
Credit monitoring continuously monitors your Credit Report, freeing you from checking your Credit Report frequently and saves you time and effort if fraud or identity theft issues arise. Our Fraud Resolution Agents can help you get back on track with your credit, so that you do not have to navigate resolution on your own.


When can credit monitoring become important?
For a major purchase such as a home, the general recommendation is to check your credit report and credit score at least 6 months in advance. Credit monitoring can help provide peace of mind as you get closer to realizing your financial goals and help identify any issues that could arise.






Can I access my credit information from the past?
Once you start your Experian CreditWorksSM Premium membership, your Credit Report and Credit Score will be archived so you have access to prior credit information. For both practical and legal reasons, Experian cannot provide credit information for a specific date in the past outside of its credit monitoring service.


Is it easy to cancel Experian CreditWorksSM Premium credit monitoring?
There are no lengthy contracts with Experian CreditWorksSM Premium. You can keep your membership on a month-to-month basis and cancel at anytime. You can cancel online within your account directly or call customer care, available toll-free 7 days a week.

FICO


FICO® Scores are developed by Fair Isaac Corporation. The FICO Score provided by ConsumerInfo.com, Inc., also referred to as Experian Consumer Services ("ECS"), in Experian CreditWorksSM, Credit TrackerSM and/or your free Experian membership (as applicable) is based on FICO Score 8, unless otherwise noted. Many but not all lenders use FICO Score 8.
In addition to the FICO Score 8, ECS may offer and provide other base or industry-specific FICO Scores (such as FICO Auto Scores and FICO Bankcard Scores). The other FICO Scores made available are calculated from versions of the base and industry-specific FICO Score models. There are many different credit scoring models that can give a different assessment of your credit rating and relative risk (risk of default) for the same credit report. Your lender or insurer may use a different FICO Score than FICO Score 8 or such other base or industry-specific FICO Score, or another type of credit score altogether. Just remember that your credit rating is often the same even if the number is not.
For some consumers, however, the credit rating of FICO Score 8 (or other FICO Score) could vary from the score used by your lender. The statements that "90% of top lenders use FICO Scores" and "FICO Scores are used in 90% of credit decisions" are based on a third-party study of all versions of FICO Scores sold to lenders, including but not limited to scores based on FICO Score 8. Base FICO Scores (including the FICO Score 8) range from 300 to 850. Industry-specific FICO Scores range from 250-900. Higher scores represent a greater likelihood that you'll pay back your debts so you are viewed as being a lower credit risk to lenders. A lower FICO Score indicates to lenders that you may be a higher credit risk.
There are three different major credit reporting agencies — the Experian credit bureau, TransUnion® and Equifax® — that maintain a record of your credit history known as your credit report. Your FICO Score is based on the information in your credit report at the time it is requested. Your credit report information can vary from agency to agency because some lenders report your credit history to only one or two of the agencies. So your FICO Score can vary if the information they have on file for you is different. Since the information in your report can change over time, your FICO Score may also change.

FICO


FICO® Scores are developed by Fair Isaac Corporation. The FICO Score provided by ConsumerInfo.com, Inc., also referred to as Experian Consumer Services ("ECS"), in Experian CreditWorksSM, Credit TrackerSM and/or your free Experian membership (as applicable) is based on FICO Score 8, unless otherwise noted. Many but not all lenders use FICO Score 8.
In addition to the FICO Score 8, ECS may offer and provide other base or industry-specific FICO Scores (such as FICO Auto Scores and FICO Bankcard Scores). The other FICO Scores made available are calculated from versions of the base and industry-specific FICO Score models. There are many different credit scoring models that can give a different assessment of your credit rating and relative risk (risk of default) for the same credit report. Your lender or insurer may use a different FICO Score than FICO Score 8 or such other base or industry-specific FICO Score, or another type of credit score altogether. Just remember that your credit rating is often the same even if the number is not.
For some consumers, however, the credit rating of FICO Score 8 (or other FICO Score) could vary from the score used by your lender. The statements that "90% of top lenders use FICO Scores" and "FICO Scores are used in 90% of credit decisions" are based on a third-party study of all versions of FICO Scores sold to lenders, including but not limited to scores based on FICO Score 8. Base FICO Scores (including the FICO Score 8) range from 300 to 850. Industry-specific FICO Scores range from 250-900. Higher scores represent a greater likelihood that you'll pay back your debts so you are viewed as being a lower credit risk to lenders. A lower FICO Score indicates to lenders that you may be a higher credit risk.
There are three different major credit reporting agencies — the Experian credit bureau, TransUnion® and Equifax® — that maintain a record of your credit history known as your credit report. Your FICO Score is based on the information in your credit report at the time it is requested. Your credit report information can vary from agency to agency because some lenders report your credit history to only one or two of the agencies. So your FICO Score can vary if the information they have on file for you is different. Since the information in your report can change over time, your FICO Score may also change.

FICO


FICO® Scores are developed by Fair Isaac Corporation. The FICO Score provided by ConsumerInfo.com, Inc., also referred to as Experian Consumer Services ("ECS"), in Experian CreditWorksSM, Credit TrackerSM and/or your free Experian membership (as applicable) is based on FICO Score 8, unless otherwise noted. Many but not all lenders use FICO Score 8.
In addition to the FICO Score 8, ECS may offer and provide other base or industry-specific FICO Scores (such as FICO Auto Scores and FICO Bankcard Scores). The other FICO Scores made available are calculated from versions of the base and industry-specific FICO Score models. There are many different credit scoring models that can give a different assessment of your credit rating and relative risk (risk of default) for the same credit report. Your lender or insurer may use a different FICO Score than FICO Score 8 or such other base or industry-specific FICO Score, or another type of credit score altogether. Just remember that your credit rating is often the same even if the number is not.
For some consumers, however, the credit rating of FICO Score 8 (or other FICO Score) could vary from the score used by your lender. The statements that "90% of top lenders use FICO Scores" and "FICO Scores are used in 90% of credit decisions" are based on a third-party study of all versions of FICO Scores sold to lenders, including but not limited to scores based on FICO Score 8. Base FICO Scores (including the FICO Score 8) range from 300 to 850. Industry-specific FICO Scores range from 250-900. Higher scores represent a greater likelihood that you'll pay back your debts so you are viewed as being a lower credit risk to lenders. A lower FICO Score indicates to lenders that you may be a higher credit risk.
There are three different major credit reporting agencies — the Experian credit bureau, TransUnion® and Equifax® — that maintain a record of your credit history known as your credit report. Your FICO Score is based on the information in your credit report at the time it is requested. Your credit report information can vary from agency to agency because some lenders report your credit history to only one or two of the agencies. So your FICO Score can vary if the information they have on file for you is different. Since the information in your report can change over time, your FICO Score may also change.

Benefits of OneLogin




Strengthen Security
Execute your identity policy across all users, devices, cloud and on-premise applications.





Reduce Costs
Automate processes, eliminate identity infrastructure costs, and deploy integrated applications in minutes.







Increase Productivity
Eliminate lengthy integration and provisioning projects, manual de-provisioning, password resets and Shadow IT policing.





Enterprise Growth
Empower users to get started quickly with the apps they need, while fully aligned with the identity policy.








Simplify Identity and Access Management for a More Secure Enterprise







Single Sign-on (SSO)
Real-time User Provisioning
Multi-factor Authentication
Unified Directory
Reporting





Single Sign-on (SSO)
With OneLogin’s single sign-on portal users only have to enter one set of credentials to access to their web apps in the cloud and behind the firewall – via desktops, smartphones and tablets. This greatly increases productivity while keeping data secure.







Real-time User Provisioning
Automating the user provisioning lifecycle reduces errors and streamlines access control based on role, department, location, title and other attributes. Changes in Active Directory are synchronized to downstream applications within seconds, providing an effective user kill switch to help minimize exposure.







Multi-factor Authentication
Policy-based MFA prevents unauthorized users from accessing corporate data with passwords alone. OneLogin comes with its own MFA application, or you can use a pre integrated solution from Duo Security and many others to protect corporate data.







Unified Directory
OneLogin allows you to synchronize users with any number of directories, such as Active Directory, LDAP, Workday, or Google Apps. Import custom user attributes and pass them on to downstream apps via SAML or API-based provisioning. The integration with Active Directory synchronizes users in real-time and supports multiple forests and domains via a single connector.







Reporting
Reports give instant insight into login activity, application utilization, weak passwords, inactive users and more. Plus you can send app usage data to SIEM tools like Splunk and Elastic to better investigate security incidents.













“What OneLogin does for us is, it gives us the security that we need, and still gives our users the flexibility that they want to choose those productive apps.”

Gary Graeff | Steelcase








“After an acquisition, OneLogin enabled us to get all new employees onboarded and collaborating in under one month. That was a huge win for us.”

AJ Tardio | Frontline Technologies








“The employee experience with OneLogin is, it’s one place for them to go to get into a portal of their apps.”

Matt Thorne | Pinterest

Court Records Monitoring
Detects criminal activity that may be associated with an individual's personal information, alerting them to signs of potential criminal identity theft. This service searches for online court records that match the member's name and date of birth from county courts, Department of Corrections (DOC), Administration of the Courts (AOC), and other legal agencies - approx. 350 million criminal records searched. Court records are sourced from county, state and federal data sources.

Members have access to continuous credit monitoring through TransUnion only. Monitoring can be accessed immediately by the member via the service portal dashboard.

Credit Inquiry Alerts
Members will be notified via email when a creditor requests their TransUnion credit file for the purposes of opening a new credit account. Alerts may also be triggered when a creditor requests a member's credit file for changes that would result in a new financial obligation, such as a new cell phone account, a lease for a new apartment, or even for an application for a new mortgage. Inquiry alerts can be helpful in determining when an identity thief is opening a new account without the member's authorization.

Monitoring does not affect an individual's credit score nor does it appear as a hard inquiry on his or her credit report when accessed by a third party. The credit monitoring service will alert members to activity up to and including new delinquent accounts, fraud alerts, improved account, new account, new address, new bankruptcy, new employment, new account inquiry, and new public records.
Credit Inquiry Alerts
Members will be notified via email when a creditor requests their TransUnion credit file for the purposes of opening a new credit account. Alerts may also be triggered when a creditor requests a member's credit file for changes that would result in a new financial obligation, such as a new cell phone account, a lease for a new apartment, or even for an application for a new mortgage. Inquiry alerts can be helpful in determining when an identity thief is opening a new account without the member's authorization.
Quarterly Credit Score Tracker
A quarterly credit score from TransUnion that plots the member's score quarter by quarter on a graph. Upon enrollment and quarterly thereafter, members will be able to see how their credit scores have changed over time, along with score factors that provide insight into what events may have caused their specific credit score to change.

An alert is generated whenever new loans or inquiries are detected.

Allows Parents/Guardians of up to 8 minors under the age of 18 to monitor for potential fraudulent activity associated with their child's SSN. Unauthorized names, aliases and addresses that become associated with a minor's name and date of birth may be detected. The service monitors public records in all 50 States and including; real estate data, new mover information, property and recorder of deed registration, county assessor/record data, internet job site providers, state occupational license data providers, voter information, public records/court proceedings, bankruptcies, liens, and judgments.

Name
Date of birth
Social Security number
Emails (up to 10)
Phone numbers (up to 10)
Driver's License number
Passport Number
Medical ID numbers (up to 10)
When an exact match for the monitored information is found, the member is alerted with an email notification. The detail of the alert can be accessed via the service portal dashboard.
Address Change Verification
Keeps track of a personal mailing address and alerts when a change of address has been requested through the United States Postal Service. An initial baseline report is provided of activity within the last 18 months, and monitoring thereafter provides alerts whenever a new change of address request is made. The detail of the alert can be accessed through the member dashboard on www.myidshield.com.This service can be accessed immediately by the member via the service portal dashboard.
Security Monitoring
Black Market Website Surveillance (Internet Monitoring)
Monitors global black-market websites, IRC (internet relay chat) channels, chat rooms, peer to peer sharing networks, and social feeds for a member's Personally Identifiable Information (PII), looking for matches of:
SSN
Credit card numbers (up to 10)
Bank account numbers (up to 10)
When an exact match for the monitored information is found, the member is alerted with an email notification. The detail of the alert can be accessed through the member dashboard on www.myidshield.com.


Court Records Monitoring
Detects criminal activity that may be associated with an individual's personal information, alerting them to signs of potential criminal identity theft. This service searches for online court records that match the member's name and date of birth from county courts, Department of Corrections (DOC), Administration of the Courts (AOC), and other legal agencies - approx. 350 million criminal records searched. Court records are sourced from county, state and federal data sources. County records are sourced from the 250 most populous counties along with arrest records, court records, correctional records and State Department records. If an incident appears associated with the member's information, they will be notified via alert.
Credit Monitoring
Members have access to continuous credit monitoring through TransUnion only. Monitoring can be accessed immediately by the member via the service portal dashboard. Credit activity will be reported promptly to the member via an email alert. Monitoring does not affect an individual's credit score nor does it appear as a hard inquiry on his or her credit report when accessed by a third party.

Credit Inquiry Alerts
Members will be notified via email when a creditor requests their TransUnion credit file for the purposes of opening a new credit account. Alerts may also be triggered when a creditor requests a member's credit file for changes that would result in a new financial obligation, such as a new cell phone account, a lease for a new apartment, or even for an application for a new mortgage. Inquiry alerts can be helpful in determining when an identity thief is opening a new account without the member's authorization.
Quarterly Credit Score Tracker

Upon enrollment and quarterly thereafter, members will be able to see how their credit scores have changed over time, along with score factors that provide insight into what events may have caused their specific credit score to change.

"GREAT SERVICE" 



"I have had LifeLock for several years with upgrading to Ultimate Plus within the past year. They have thwarted attempts at my personal information twice in the past month. I would probably have never known of these if I hadn't had LifeLock. Thanks for taking care of this, LifeLock."

Member since Jan 2009 







"THANK YOU"  



"I was notified of fraudulent attempt to open a cell phone service in my name without my knowledge. I was asked to verify if it was me. When I said no the account was stopped. It made me feel thankful that someone was looking out for me."

Peace of mind

                                                I just got my first alert.  It  felt so reassuring. I am an older person (64 years old) and have been increasingly scared about identity theft.  I know I have to be vigilant but it helps to know that LifeLock has my back.  THANKS.

FICO


FICO® Scores are developed by Fair Isaac Corporation. The FICO Score provided by ConsumerInfo.com, Inc., also referred to as Experian Consumer Services ("ECS"), in Experian CreditWorksSM, Credit TrackerSM and/or your free Experian membership (as applicable) is based on FICO Score 8, unless otherwise noted. Many but not all lenders use FICO Score 8.
In addition to the FICO Score 8, ECS may offer and provide other base or industry-specific FICO Scores (such as FICO Auto Scores and FICO Bankcard Scores). The other FICO Scores made available are calculated from versions of the base and industry-specific FICO Score models. There are many different credit scoring models that can give a different assessment of your credit rating and relative risk (risk of default) for the same credit report. Your lender or insurer may use a different FICO Score than FICO Score 8 or such other base or industry-specific FICO Score, or another type of credit score altogether. Just remember that your credit rating is often the same even if the number is not.
For some consumers, however, the credit rating of FICO Score 8 (or other FICO Score) could vary from the score used by your lender. The statements that "90% of top lenders use FICO Scores" and "FICO Scores are used in 90% of credit decisions" are based on a third-party study of all versions of FICO Scores sold to lenders, including but not limited to scores based on FICO Score 8. Base FICO Scores (including the FICO Score 8) range from 300 to 850. Industry-specific FICO Scores range from 250-900. Higher scores represent a greater likelihood that you'll pay back your debts so you are viewed as being a lower credit risk to lenders. A lower FICO Score indicates to lenders that you may be a higher credit risk.
There are three different major credit reporting agencies — the Experian credit bureau, TransUnion® and Equifax® — that maintain a record of your credit history known as your credit report. Your FICO Score is based on the information in your credit report at the time it is requested. Your credit report information can vary from agency to agency because some lenders report your credit history to only one or two of the agencies. So your FICO Score can vary if the information they have on file for you is different. Since the information in your report can change over time, your FICO Score may also change.

FICO


FICO® Scores are developed by Fair Isaac Corporation. The FICO Score provided by ConsumerInfo.com, Inc., also referred to as Experian Consumer Services ("ECS"), in Experian CreditWorksSM, Credit TrackerSM and/or your free Experian membership (as applicable) is based on FICO Score 8, unless otherwise noted. Many but not all lenders use FICO Score 8.
In addition to the FICO Score 8, ECS may offer and provide other base or industry-specific FICO Scores (such as FICO Auto Scores and FICO Bankcard Scores). The other FICO Scores made available are calculated from versions of the base and industry-specific FICO Score models. There are many different credit scoring models that can give a different assessment of your credit rating and relative risk (risk of default) for the same credit report. Your lender or insurer may use a different FICO Score than FICO Score 8 or such other base or industry-specific FICO Score, or another type of credit score altogether. Just remember that your credit rating is often the same even if the number is not.
For some consumers, however, the credit rating of FICO Score 8 (or other FICO Score) could vary from the score used by your lender. The statements that "90% of top lenders use FICO Scores" and "FICO Scores are used in 90% of credit decisions" are based on a third-party study of all versions of FICO Scores sold to lenders, including but not limited to scores based on FICO Score 8. Base FICO Scores (including the FICO Score 8) range from 300 to 850. Industry-specific FICO Scores range from 250-900. Higher scores represent a greater likelihood that you'll pay back your debts so you are viewed as being a lower credit risk to lenders. A lower FICO Score indicates to lenders that you may be a higher credit risk.
There are three different major credit reporting agencies — the Experian credit bureau, TransUnion® and Equifax® — that maintain a record of your credit history known as your credit report. Your FICO Score is based on the information in your credit report at the time it is requested. Your credit report information can vary from agency to agency because some lenders report your credit history to only one or two of the agencies. So your FICO Score can vary if the information they have on file for you is different. Since the information in your report can change over time, your FICO Score may also change.

Experian CreditLock FAQs






What is a credit lock?
A credit lock allows you to easily lock your Credit Report, helping to protect you against identity theft and unwanted credit activity. If someone attempts to apply for credit in your name while your Report is locked, you will be notified with a real time alert.
When locked, your Experian Credit Report is NOT accessible to:

Banks and lenders that check your Credit Report for a credit or loan application
Companies checking your Credit Report in order to open new utilities, cellular service or apartment rentals

When locked, your Experian Credit Report is accessible to:

You, as part of your Experian CreditWorksSM Premium membership
Potential employers or insurance companies during the application process
Companies that have an existing credit relationship with you
Collection agencies acting on behalf of companies you may owe
Government agencies in connection to a Child Support claim
Personalized offers from Experian, such as credit card offers, if you choose to receive them
Companies providing pre-screened credit card offers. Learn more about opting out of credit offers



How can Experian CreditLock help prevent credit fraud?
If an identity thief tries to apply for credit in your name, access to your Credit Report will be blocked when the lender tries to view it, stopping the crime before it starts. If someone tries to access your Report while it is locked, you will be notified with a real time alert.


What kind of Alerts will I get with Experian CreditLock?
In addition to the regular alerts you receive as part of your membership, Experian CreditLock provides attempted inquiry alerts that inform you when someone attempts to apply for credit while your Report is locked. You will receive a confirmation alert when you lock or unlock your Experian Credit Report.






What does it mean if my Experian Credit Report is unlocked?

Banks or lenders may review your Report if you, or someone who claims to be you, applies for a loan or financing in your name.
Any company with permissible purpose may access your Report if it is unlocked. This means any company with a legal right, including any new or existing creditor wishing to review your Report or extend you credit; a Grand Jury request; a potential employer or an insurance company underwriting a policy.
To block unwanted inquiries and potential fraudulent activity, you may want to keep your Experian Credit Report locked until you’re in the market for credit or financing.



If I use Experian CreditLock, can any information, including new accounts, be posted to my Experian Credit Report?
When your Experian Credit Report is locked, new accounts may still be reported to Experian and posted to your Experian Credit Report if:

A creditor opens an account using a report from one of the other major credit bureaus that you have not locked or applied a security freeze.
You unlock your Experian Credit Report, granting access to a potential lender or creditor.



What is the difference between Experian CreditLock, a Security Freeze and a Fraud Alert?
With Experian CreditLock, you have greater control over who can view your Credit Report, blocking unwanted inquiries that result in extensions of credit. Locking your Credit Report gives you similar protection to a security freeze, but with additional advantages. Learn more about the differences between CreditLock, Security Freezes, and Fraud Alerts.


What happens if my Report is locked and I cancel or downgrade my Experian CreditWorks Premium membership?
Your Experian Credit Report will be unlocked at the end of your billing cycle.

FICO


FICO® Scores are developed by Fair Isaac Corporation. The FICO Score provided by ConsumerInfo.com, Inc., also referred to as Experian Consumer Services ("ECS"), in Experian CreditWorksSM, Credit TrackerSM and/or your free Experian membership (as applicable) is based on FICO Score 8, unless otherwise noted. Many but not all lenders use FICO Score 8.
In addition to the FICO Score 8, ECS may offer and provide other base or industry-specific FICO Scores (such as FICO Auto Scores and FICO Bankcard Scores). The other FICO Scores made available are calculated from versions of the base and industry-specific FICO Score models. There are many different credit scoring models that can give a different assessment of your credit rating and relative risk (risk of default) for the same credit report. Your lender or insurer may use a different FICO Score than FICO Score 8 or such other base or industry-specific FICO Score, or another type of credit score altogether. Just remember that your credit rating is often the same even if the number is not.
For some consumers, however, the credit rating of FICO Score 8 (or other FICO Score) could vary from the score used by your lender. The statements that "90% of top lenders use FICO Scores" and "FICO Scores are used in 90% of credit decisions" are based on a third-party study of all versions of FICO Scores sold to lenders, including but not limited to scores based on FICO Score 8. Base FICO Scores (including the FICO Score 8) range from 300 to 850. Industry-specific FICO Scores range from 250-900. Higher scores represent a greater likelihood that you'll pay back your debts so you are viewed as being a lower credit risk to lenders. A lower FICO Score indicates to lenders that you may be a higher credit risk.
There are three different major credit reporting agencies — the Experian credit bureau, TransUnion® and Equifax® — that maintain a record of your credit history known as your credit report. Your FICO Score is based on the information in your credit report at the time it is requested. Your credit report information can vary from agency to agency because some lenders report your credit history to only one or two of the agencies. So your FICO Score can vary if the information they have on file for you is different. Since the information in your report can change over time, your FICO Score may also change.

Benefits of OneLogin




Strengthen Security
Execute your identity policy across all users, devices, cloud and on-premise applications.





Reduce Costs
Automate processes, eliminate identity infrastructure costs, and deploy integrated applications in minutes.







Increase Productivity
Eliminate lengthy integration and provisioning projects, manual de-provisioning, password resets and Shadow IT policing.





Enterprise Growth
Empower users to get started quickly with the apps they need, while fully aligned with the identity policy.








Simplify Identity and Access Management for a More Secure Enterprise







Single Sign-on (SSO)
Real-time User Provisioning
Multi-factor Authentication
Unified Directory
Reporting





Single Sign-on (SSO)
With OneLogin’s single sign-on portal users only have to enter one set of credentials to access to their web apps in the cloud and behind the firewall – via desktops, smartphones and tablets. This greatly increases productivity while keeping data secure.







Real-time User Provisioning
Automating the user provisioning lifecycle reduces errors and streamlines access control based on role, department, location, title and other attributes. Changes in Active Directory are synchronized to downstream applications within seconds, providing an effective user kill switch to help minimize exposure.







Multi-factor Authentication
Policy-based MFA prevents unauthorized users from accessing corporate data with passwords alone. OneLogin comes with its own MFA application, or you can use a pre integrated solution from Duo Security and many others to protect corporate data.







Unified Directory
OneLogin allows you to synchronize users with any number of directories, such as Active Directory, LDAP, Workday, or Google Apps. Import custom user attributes and pass them on to downstream apps via SAML or API-based provisioning. The integration with Active Directory synchronizes users in real-time and supports multiple forests and domains via a single connector.







Reporting
Reports give instant insight into login activity, application utilization, weak passwords, inactive users and more. Plus you can send app usage data to SIEM tools like Splunk and Elastic to better investigate security incidents.













“What OneLogin does for us is, it gives us the security that we need, and still gives our users the flexibility that they want to choose those productive apps.”

Gary Graeff | Steelcase








“After an acquisition, OneLogin enabled us to get all new employees onboarded and collaborating in under one month. That was a huge win for us.”

AJ Tardio | Frontline Technologies








“The employee experience with OneLogin is, it’s one place for them to go to get into a portal of their apps.”

Matt Thorne | Pinterest

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
