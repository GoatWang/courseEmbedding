Board of Directors        


William S. Aichele, Board Member
William S. Aichele serves as a Class A director. His  election was concurrent with his retirement as CEO at Univest Corporation. He  continues in his role as chairman of the board for the corporation, based in  Souderton, PA, and its wholly owned subsidiary, Univest Bank and Trust Co.
Aichele started with the Univest Corporation as a management  trainee in 1971 and became vice president in 1988. In 1990, he was appointed  executive vice president for Univest Corporation as well as chairman of Univest  Bank and Trust Co. He became president of Univest Corporation in 1997 and took on the additional roles of CEO in 1999 and chairman in 2005. In 2013, as  Univest began implementing its succession plan to prepare for Aichele’s  retirement, he left his role as president but continued on as chairman and CEO.
Aichele serves on the boards of the James A. Michener Art Museum,  Grand View Health, and Grand View Health Foundation. He is the recipient of the  Penn Foundation’s Adventures in Excellence Award and was named the 2011 Pillar  of the Community by Encore Experience. He was also inducted into the Pennsylvania Bankers Association’s 40-Year Club in honor of his years of service in Pennsylvania’s banking industry.
Aichele, who has an associate’s degree in business administration from Valley Forge Military Academy, is also a graduate of the  Stonier Graduate School of Banking.

Frontier Leasing sells dirty paper to Univest dba “Vanguard Leasing” 
A little birdie told me that Vanguard Leasing is really Univest.  (A publicly held company NASDAQ:UVSP buying dirty paper I might add.) If you refer to my earlier post, you’ll see that Frontier Leasing is selling its paper to avoid the courts finding out their dirtly little secrets, or perhaps because it’s fluff, they’ve already made all their money off of you lessees so they can now sell you to another abusive company and make the trail that much more complex so as not to be liable in the courts.  (More likely they’re close friends and they’re all involved in yet a new type of ponzi scheme to fleece Main Street out of its life savings.)  The new company is now beating the new lessees into submission.  If you want to know more about Univest, and you’re someone who has been so rudely introduced to them, give the “President” a call.  I hear he’s doing his customer harassment himself – probably out of the cafeteria or maybe a Starbucks?
 according to their annual report (below) it’s Mr. William S. Aichele – Chairman, CEO, President of Univest.
 or perhaps it’s Mr. Hugh Connelly President of Vanguard Leasing in the press release below
Vanguard Leasing, Inc. Changes Name to Univest Capital, Inc.
June, 2008Univest National Bank and Trust Co. (NASDAQ: UVSP) today announced its nationwide equipment financing company, Vanguard Leasing, Inc., has changed its name to Univest Capital, Inc. Formed by Univest National Bank and Trust Co. in 2006, the equipment finance subsidiary has integrated Univest products into its portfolio of product offerings for businesses and government entities. Univest Capital customers can open business savings or checking accounts through UnivestDirect, the online home for the company’s business and personal financial solutions. Univest National Bank and Trust Co.’s business credit cards and SBA loans will be available through Univest Capital in June and later this summer, respectively.

http://www.rtofunding.com/2008/docs/PR121807.pdf
2006 Annual Report – http://www.univest.net/PDFs/2006UnivestAnnualReport.pdf
 
“Vanguard Leasing, Inc., a new business venture which Univest established in May, will continue to help us enhance the nontraditional side of the bank. Specializing in leasing small ticket items such as commercial and industrial equipment, machine tools and material handling and medical equipment, Vanguard delivers solutions to businesses in 50 states. The company operates as an independent, wholly owned subsidiary of Univest National Bank and Trust Co., and will significantly contribute to future revenue and profits.”
