the 2001 model year in Japan as a five-door subcompact hatchback. In other markets outside of Japan, it has also been known as the Jazz, including Europe, Australia, and parts of Africa as well as some countries in the Middle East. The Fit wasn't unveiled all at once, as its release started first in Japan before making its way across the globe. The first model in the US didn't become available until 2006, where it made its first appearance on the American soil at the North American International Auto Show. It wound up going on sale in the US in April of that year. When it was initially introduced in Japan, the Fit was outfitted with a 1.2L inline four-cylinder engine mated to a either a five-speed manual or five-speed automatic transmission. Engine configurations and parts haven't changed drastically throughout the Fit's run, nor has its size. As for the model's dimensions, the Fit measures in with a wheelbase of 96.5 inches, a width of 65.9 inches, a height of 60 inches, and an overall length of 151.4 inches (the Fit is 157.4 inches long in the US and Canada). 
When the Honda Fit was introduced in the US, it became available in two separate trim levels: base and Sport. Such Hinds Fit parts as air conditioning and a CD stereo system came standard in the base model but the higher-level Sport took it a step further. The Fit Sport showcases additional accessories such as a leather-wrapped steering wheel, remote keyless entry, cruise control, an MP3 audio system, and different exterior styling cues including 15" alloy wheels. Inside the model, the Fit's second row is designed for a 60/40 split-seat and can be changed around depending on the driver's needs for both passengers and cargo. The engine parts of the Honda Fit were updated in the US model to a 1.5L four-cylinder capable of around 109 horsepower directed through a standard five-speed manual transmission, although a five-speed automatic transmission is also available. 
Since the Honda Fit's arrival in the US, it has produced a substantial amount of success for the Japanese automaker. The Honda Fit has averaged approximately 58,000 units sold per year beginning in 2006, a highly respectable number given the segment the model competes in. It has also received a bevy of awards and honors. The Honda Fit was named the Best Small Car by Top Gear (2006) and received recognition on Car and Driver magazine's Ten Best List for Small Cars. It was also called one of Greencars.org's Greenest Vehicles (2007, 2008) before being nominated as a finalist for Motor Trend's prestigious Car of the Year award (2009) as well as being named the 2010 Best Hatchback for the Money by US News & World Report. 
Subcompact style with stylish implications is what it's all about with the Honda Fit. One of the more recognized models on the European landscape, the Honda Fit offers a hip look into the future mixed with a throwback body-shape that gets as much attention for its beauty as it does its uniqueness. Of course, it's efficient on fuel. And yes, it has enough zip in the performance to get by on the highway. When all is said and done, what you have with the Honda Fit is a winner. Good things really do come in small packages!

YesThis review was helpful for 0 user!4.5 of 5I Like It, But...WeatherTech® 80544 - In-Channel Dark Smoke Front Side Window DeflectorsI really like the look that this gives my Honda Fit. I think they're built well and will last a very long time. You can also go through an automatic car wash with no issues. It fits in the upper channel of the window and installation is easy, but you do need to be careful because it requires you to bend the deflectors slightly. If done hastily or improperly, they will break. If you pull on the lower end of the front deflectors, it will come out of the window easily so you can restart if needed. I would recommend also using some type of adhesive in addition because I have had deflectors fall out when the window was rolled down more than once. Thankfully, the rear deflector fell into the vehicle each time so I was able to save it. I have had to replace one of the front deflectors because it also fell out onto the highway after a slightly shaky road and was subsequently run over. That's the only thing I don't like about these. Other than that, they're great!DPosted by Derek (Mooresville, NC) / August 19, 20162010 Honda FitWas this review helpful for you? YesThis review was helpful for 0 user!5 of 5Floor Mat Mix-Up. They Got It RightWeatherTech® 441772 - DigitalFit™ 2nd Row Black Molded Floor LinerThese weather tech floor mats are awesome. I have them in all of our vehicles. We just had a gallon of weed killer fall over in the back and leaked all over. The floor mats caught all of it and saver our carpets! Better yet I originally ordered the mats from another co. And had to send them back because sent the wrong ones(clearly) marked on the box. I ordered through CARiD and the manufacturer made the mistake this time. CARiD listened to me carefully, politely and in person (no e-mail or computer voice). They sent a return label and checked then they double checked the manufacturers box to make sure the numbers matched the part inside, Yeah!!!DPosted by Dawn (Pahrump, NV) / August 6, 20162008 Honda FitWas this review helpful for you?

Demon camber. You may know it as oni-camber. You've seen the look, and whether you like it or not is totally beside the point. The great thing about this stanced look is that it gets your attention. From the interviews we've read with owners and drivers of these machines, that is exactly what they are after. They've said that it's all about being noticed.Custom wheels and tires have been around for years, and continue to be immensely popular. But customizers are always looking for ways to be ahead of the game, to be first with a trend. It is no longer enough to have the most outrageous set of rims. That look can be taken to the next level with stanced cars. Technically, demon camber is extreme negative camber. Let's explain what "negative camber" is and how that effect is achieved.Camber is one of the alignment specifications which affect the angle, or tilt of the wheel compared to the vehicle's body. If you are looking directly at the front or rear of a car, the angle of the tire relative to the ground is the camber. Look at the illustration below. Negative camber means that the tops of the tires lean in relative to the car's body. Zero camber means the tire is perfectly perpendicular to the ground. Positive camber means the tops of the tires are leaning out...March 18, 2015Pickup Truck Cab And Bed SizesTimothy ZahlAmericans love to have choices. Buying a dress shirt?

Neither are we, so upgrading your car or truck's power and handling is just a click away in our Performance Parts department. You can pack more air and fuel into your engine with free flowing filters and cold air intakes, big carburetors and throttle bodies, high flow injectors and intake manifolds; get a fat spark to fire that mixture with performance plugs, wires, and ignition systems; and give those spent gases a quick exit and get a rumble to boot with headers and low restriction exhaust systems. And if you crave massive increases in go-power, we have complete engines, turbochargers and superchargers, and nitrous oxide systems. But performance isn't just about power, you have to handle the turns and hit the binders once in a while and for that we have suspension and brake systems for every need and purpose. Check out our vast selection of lift kits, lowering kits, shocks, struts, springs and sway bars and state of the art drilled and slotted brake rotors, multi-piston calipers, and performance compound brake linings.We all like to modify and customize our vehicles, but sometimes you just need to fix them or do maintenance to make sure they last. We can help you save money by doing the job yourself, with auto parts and tools to repair any part of your machine and maintenance supplies to help keep it going for many more miles. Water pumps, alternators, starters, clutches, timing belts, mufflers, and more are all here along with the chemicals and tools you need to get repair jobs done right. Regular maintenance has been proven to extend the life of a vehicle and we can help keep yours in top shape with filters, lubricants, spark plugs, brake pads and more. And to make sure you never tire of looking at your pride and joy we have an extensive selection of wax and polish, car wash, tire dressing and detail supplies.

              Quick to call back, did everything we asked.  Not pushy sales people who have to "check with their manager" to make a deal.  The price was certainly fair so no need to haggle.

              I phoned the  sales lady telling her I would come by on Sat. to look at the truck. When we got there, a salesman told us the truck had been sold. ( someone had put a deposit on it) We left.  As we were looking at another truck, the phone rang and another person from the dealership asked us if we were going to be able to come look at the truck...after explaining that we had just left the dealership, she checked with her manager and told us that yes the truck had been sold.  She apologized and we told her it was fine....a day after we got home, we received an email from Carsguru, that the price of the truck had dropped 100$. I sent the dealership an email asking what was going on....they did not reply....

Road Tested01Protect & Customize Your Vehicle02Your Best Option for Towing 03The Fit is a subcompact multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) manufactured by Honda since 2001. Its excellent fuel efficiency and reliability are the reasons why it is sought after all over the world. But this small vehicle has even more surprises beneath its sheetmetal. The third-generation Honda Fit went on sale in the U.S. as the 2015 model and got immediately noticed for its unmatched interior space. The 2015 Honda Fit definitely looks smaller outside than it actually is inside. Stepping into the cabin, you discover that this subcompact can easily accommodate two six-feet tall adults on the rear seats. Despite being 1.6 inch shorter than the previous generation, the 2015 Fit features a longer wheelbase and redesigned rear suspension and thus provides 4.8 inches more legroom in the rear row. 
Such an increase, although, steals some inches from the cargo area and decreases the Fit’s cargo capacity to 17 cubic feet compared to the previous-model’s 21 cubic feet. But no worries! If you need to haul more, folding the rear seats flat will provide 52.7 cubic feet of cargo space. There is also a new Magic Seat technology that allows you to arrange seating places in 4 different positions and manage the passenger/cargo space ratio depending on your particular needs. For the 2015 model year, the Honda Fit also received new headlights and a redesigned grille. Its interior now boasts a more refined design and upscale materials. 
Under the hood, there is a whole new drivetrain that consists of a 1.5-liter 130-horsepower four-cylinder engine coupled with either a six-speed manual or a CVT, depending on the trim level. The 2015 Honda Fit accelerates from zero to sixty mph in 8.8 seconds. Its impressive fuel economy is one of its strongest selling points. Equipped with a CVT, the 2015 Fit reaches 32 mpg city/38 mpg highway, whereas models with a standard manual transmission deliver 29 mpg city/37 mpg highway. 
The Fit is an exemplary multi-purpose subcompact. It’s flexible, reasonably-priced, reliable, and efficient. But if you think that your vehicle lacks personality and character, our assortment of 2015 Honda Fit accessories and parts will help you change this for good. So choose what to start with and find your perfect 2015 Honda Fit accessories and parts in our online store. The accessories and upgrades we carry are designed to get your tuning projects done. And sure, our 2015 Honda Fit parts and accessories are made with the highest quality in mind.Want to make your 2015 Honda Fit one of a kind, keep it running at its peak, or turn it into a high-powered beast?

the 2001 model year in Japan as a five-door subcompact hatchback. In other markets outside of Japan, it has also been known as the Jazz, including Europe, Australia, and parts of Africa as well as some countries in the Middle East. The Fit wasn't unveiled all at once, as its release started first in Japan before making its way across the globe. The first model in the US didn't become available until 2006, where it made its first appearance on the American soil at the North American International Auto Show. It wound up going on sale in the US in April of that year. When it was initially introduced in Japan, the Fit was outfitted with a 1.2L inline four-cylinder engine mated to a either a five-speed manual or five-speed automatic transmission. Engine configurations and parts haven't changed drastically throughout the Fit's run, nor has its size. As for the model's dimensions, the Fit measures in with a wheelbase of 96.5 inches, a width of 65.9 inches, a height of 60 inches, and an overall length of 151.4 inches (the Fit is 157.4 inches long in the US and Canada). 
When the Honda Fit was introduced in the US, it became available in two separate trim levels: base and Sport. Such Hinds Fit parts as air conditioning and a CD stereo system came standard in the base model but the higher-level Sport took it a step further. The Fit Sport showcases additional accessories such as a leather-wrapped steering wheel, remote keyless entry, cruise control, an MP3 audio system, and different exterior styling cues including 15" alloy wheels. Inside the model, the Fit's second row is designed for a 60/40 split-seat and can be changed around depending on the driver's needs for both passengers and cargo. The engine parts of the Honda Fit were updated in the US model to a 1.5L four-cylinder capable of around 109 horsepower directed through a standard five-speed manual transmission, although a five-speed automatic transmission is also available. 
Since the Honda Fit's arrival in the US, it has produced a substantial amount of success for the Japanese automaker. The Honda Fit has averaged approximately 58,000 units sold per year beginning in 2006, a highly respectable number given the segment the model competes in. It has also received a bevy of awards and honors. The Honda Fit was named the Best Small Car by Top Gear (2006) and received recognition on Car and Driver magazine's Ten Best List for Small Cars. It was also called one of Greencars.org's Greenest Vehicles (2007, 2008) before being nominated as a finalist for Motor Trend's prestigious Car of the Year award (2009) as well as being named the 2010 Best Hatchback for the Money by US News & World Report. 
Subcompact style with stylish implications is what it's all about with the Honda Fit. One of the more recognized models on the European landscape, the Honda Fit offers a hip look into the future mixed with a throwback body-shape that gets as much attention for its beauty as it does its uniqueness. Of course, it's efficient on fuel. And yes, it has enough zip in the performance to get by on the highway. When all is said and done, what you have with the Honda Fit is a winner. Good things really do come in small packages!

I think they're built well and will last a very long time. You can also go through an automatic car wash with no issues. It fits in the upper channel of the window and installation is easy, but you do need to be careful because it requires you to bend the deflectors slightly. If done hastily or improperly, they will break. If you pull on the lower end of the front deflectors, it will come out of the window easily so you can restart if needed. I would recommend also using some type of adhesive in addition because I have had deflectors fall out when the window was rolled down more than once. Thankfully, the rear deflector fell into the vehicle each time so I was able to save it. I have had to replace one of the front deflectors because it also fell out onto the highway after a slightly shaky road and was subsequently run over. That's the only thing I don't like about these.

THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


___________________________

Hillsborough-northern judicial district
No. 94-198


THOMAS LEBLANC


v.


AMERICAN HONDA MOTOR CO., INC.


January 28, 1997

Vincent C. Martina, of Amherst, by brief and orally, for the 
plaintiff.

Shaheen, Cappiello, Stein & Gordon, P.A., of Concord (Robert A. 
Stein and Diane Perin Hock on the brief, and Mr. Stein 
orally), for the defendant.

BROCK, C.J. The defendant, American Honda Motor Co., Inc. (Honda), appeals 
the special jury verdict of the Superior Court (Conboy, J.), holding 
Honda liable for injuries caused by the defective design and failure to warn of 
the braking and steering properties of its product, the Honda Odyssey. For the 
reasons that follow, we reverse and remand.

On January 16, 1988, the plaintiff, Thomas LeBlanc, while riding on the back 
of a snowmobile driven by his friend, was injured when the snowmobile collided 
with an off-road vehicle driven by Stephen Beaulieu and manufactured by Honda. 
The impact of the collision severely injured the plaintiff's leg.

The plaintiff sued Beaulieu and Honda alleging negligent operation of the 
Odyssey by Beaulieu and asserting a products liability claim against Honda. The 
jury rendered its verdict via a special verdict form that contained eight 
questions agreed to by the parties. The jury found: that the 1985 Honda Odyssey 
contained a design defect which rendered it unreasonably dangerous; that the 
design defect was a cause of the accident; that the Odyssey was unreasonably 
dangerous and defective due to Honda's failure to adequately warn the driver, 
Beaulieu; that the failure to warn Beaulieu was a cause of the accident; that 
the plaintiff proved all the elements of his negligence claim against Beaulieu; 
that negligence or misconduct by the plaintiff contributed to cause his injury; 
that Honda was 68% at fault, Beaulieu was 27% at fault, and the plaintiff was 5% 
at fault; and that the plaintiff's total damages were $2,206,000. The superior 
court ordered judgment against Honda for $1,487,196 plus statutory interest and 
costs, and against Beaulieu for $590,504 plus statutory interest and costs. 

On appeal, Honda argues: (1) that the plaintiff's trial counsel, Vincent C. 
Martina, made improper and inflammatory remarks during the trial and during 
closing arguments in an attempt to cultivate in the jury a racial and national 
bias against Honda, a subsidiary of a Japanese corporation; (2) that the trial 
court erred by admitting previously undisclosed testimony and by allowing a 
courtroom demonstration; and (3) that the trial court erred by denying the 
defendant's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. 

Honda first argues that certain remarks made by Martina so tainted the 
proceedings as to deprive Honda of a fair trial and that denial of its motion 
for a mistrial and motion for a new trial on this ground was reversible error. 
We agree.

The trial court should grant a party's motion for a mistrial if it determines 
that 


some circumstance . . . indicates that justice may not be done if 
  the trial continues to verdict. To justify a mistrial, remarks or the conduct 
  must be more than merely inadmissible; they must constitute an irreparable 
  injustice that cannot be cured by jury instructions. Because the trial court 
  is in the best position to gauge prejudicial impact, it has broad discretion 
  to determine whether a mistrial or other remedial action is 
necessary.State v. Martin, 138 N.H. 508, 516, 643 A.2d 946, 
951 (1994) (citations, quotations, and brackets omitted); see Walton 
v. City of Manchester, 140 N.H. 403, 408, 666 A.2d 978, 981-82 (1995). 
Remedial action includes, but is not limited to, curative jury instructions, 
which the jury is presumed to follow. State v. Lemire, 130 N.H. 552, 555, 
543 A.2d 425, 426 (1988).

The defendant points to several statements made by Martina as grounds for 
reversal. The first, directed at Honda's vehicle design expert, focused on the 
color scheme of the Odyssey. Martina asked the expert if he knew the color of 
the Japanese flag. After Honda objected, Martina explained that he was curious 
about how the machine's color happened to be designed. The court decided to give 
Martina "some latitude." Martina then questioned the expert about whether the 
expert had ever wondered why the Odyssey is "red, white and blue, the color of 
the American flag." 

The second series of statements highlighted by Honda occurred during the 
plaintiff's closing argument: 


What's this case about? It's not about Honda making great 
  automobiles or Sony making good Walkmans. But also it's not about Pearl Harbor 
  or the Japanese prime minister saying Americans are lazy and stupid.
  
. . . .
  
What this case is about is not American xenophobia; it's about corporate 
  greed.Counsel for Honda again objected and, at a bench 
conference, moved for a mistrial. At the bench conference, Martina explained 
that he was certain that the fact that the defendant is a foreign corporation 
had entered the minds of the jurors, and he was trying to tell them that that 
was irrelevant to the case. The court denied the motion for a mistrial but 
warned Martina: "I am, however, Mr. Martina, cautioning you that there's a limit 
to how far argument can go, and I think you're right at the wall on it. So 
please back away from it and focus on the issues in the case." The court did not 
strike the remarks or issue a curative instruction to the jury.

At the conclusion of the trial, the court instructed the jury:


I try to be fair and impartial, just as you are required to be. . 
  . . You must decide the case only on the basis of the evidence and the law as 
  I give it to you. You should keep in mind that all parties, whether an 
  individual or a corporation, are equal before the law. . . .
And again:


[Y]ou should decide this case without passion, without prejudice, 
  and without sympathy. It is your highest duty as officers of this court to 
  conscientiously determine a fair and just result in this 
case.See Walton, 140 N.H. at 408, 666 A.2d at 982. 
The court never instructed the jury specifically with regard to Attorney 
Martina's above-quoted remarks.

Although the decision whether to grant the mistrial motion or the motion for 
a new trial falls within the trial court's discretion, see Martin, 
138 N.H. at 516, 643 A.2d at 951, "[i]n some circumstances . . . , counsel's 
remarks may be so prejudicial as to mandate reversal," Walton, 140 N.H. 
at 408, 666 A.2d at 982; see Texas Employers' Ins. Ass'n v. 
Guerrero, 800 S.W.2d 859, 863 (Tex. Ct. App. 1990) (appeals to racial 
prejudice incurable by instruction).


We do not expect advocacy to be devoid of passion. But jurors must 
  ultimately base their judgment on the evidence presented and the natural 
  inferences therefrom. Thus, there must be limits to pleas of pure passion and 
  there must be restraints against blatant appeals to bias and 
prejudice.Walton, 140 N.H. at 406, 666 A.2d at 981 
(quotation, brackets, and ellipsis omitted). A mistrial or a new trial may be 
warranted "where counsel attempts to appeal to the sympathies, passions, and 
prejudices of jurors grounded in race or nationality, by reference to the 
opposing party's religious beliefs or lack thereof, or by reference to a party's 
social or economic condition or status." Id. at 407, 666 A.2d at 981 
(quotation omitted). Such an appeal was attempted in this case.

The remarks, when viewed in isolation and outside of the context of the 
trial, may not seem to be so "explicit and brazen," Guerrero, 800 S.W.2d 
at 864, as to warrant the severe remedy of reversal. This sort of argument, 
which "may be indirect or implied, as well as direct or express," Annotation, 
Statement by Counsel Relating to Race, Nationality, or Religion in Civil 
Action as Prejudicial, 99 A.L.R.2d 1249, 1255 (1965), is nonetheless an 
affront to the court. See Guerrero, 800 S.W.2d at 865 
(characterizing racial or ethnic appeals to be "an attack on the social glue 
that helps bind society together"). "It is true that counsel's closing reference 
was brief. At the same time, when an elephant has passed through the courtroom 
one does not need a forceful reminder." Willey v. Ketterer, 869 F.2d 648, 
652 (1st Cir. 1989).

Honda invites us to declare appeals to racial bias per se 
incurable. Although we have considered seriously the adoption of a per
se rule of reversal in such cases, we believe it better at this time to 
leave these matters to the sound discretion of the trial court. Compare
Walton, 140 N.H. at 408, 666 A.2d at 982 with Guerrero, 800 
S.W.2d at 866. Such appeals, although extremely unprofessional and deplorable, 
must be considered in light of the circumstances of the particular case. 
See Lincoln v. Gupta, 370 N.W.2d 312, 317 (Mich. Ct. App. 1985). 
When a racial or ethnic appeal has been made, as in this case, the trial judge


must examine, on a case-by-case basis, the totality of the 
  circumstances, including the nature of the comments, their frequency, their 
  possible relevancy to the real issues before the jury, the manner in which the 
  parties and the court treated the comments, the strength of the case (e.g. 
  whether it is a close case), and the verdict itself.Forrestal v. 
Magendantz, 848 F.2d 303, 309 (1st Cir. 1988) (quotation omitted); 
see Walton, 140 N.H. at 408, 666 A.2d at 982. In reaching this 
conclusion, we keep in mind that it will be an unusual case in which the 
invocation of racial or ethnic bias should not result in a mistrial or 
sanctions, see Walton, 140 N.H. at 408, 666 A.2d at 982; N.H. 
R. Prof. Conduct 3.5 ("A lawyer shall not . . . seek to influence a . . . 
juror . . . by means prohibited by law . . . ."), and that attorneys and judges 
have authority to refer these matters to the committee on professional conduct 
or the committee on judicial conduct when appropriate. See N.H. R. 
Prof. Conduct 8.3; N.H. Prof. Conduct Comm. R. 2.1; Sup. Ct. 
R. 38, Canon 3(A)(2).

In denying Honda's motion for a new trial, the trial court recognized that 
Martina's remarks "raised irrelevant and potentially prejudicial issues," but 
nonetheless concluded that "the jury followed the Court's instructions, and 
based its verdict only on the evidence and the law." No immediate curative jury 
instruction was given. See Walton, 140 N.H. at 408, 666 A.2d at 
982; cf. South Hampton Co. v. Stinnes Corp., 733 F.2d 1108, 
1123-24 (5th Cir. 1984) (trial court's immediate curative instruction after 
ethnic appeal "sufficient to smother the inflammatory effect" of comments). 
Plantiff's counsel's remarks, however, were "not only improper but reflect 
disregard . . . of his duty to the court and to the adversary system which 
supposes a fair contest, not under-handed blows." South Hampton Co., 733 
F.2d at 1124. Under the circumstances of this case, we conclude that Martina's 
remarks, "calculated as they were to encourage the jury to make a decision based 
on . . . bias rather than reason and the presented evidence, were so prejudicial 
as to require a new trial." Walton, 140 N.H. at 408, 666 A.2d at 982 
(quotation omitted); see Border Brook Terrace Condo. Assoc. v. 
Gladstone, 137 N.H. 11, 18, 622 A.2d 1248, 1253 (1993). 

Honda argues that several other remarks made by Martina during the trial 
would also, independently, mandate a new trial. Specifically, it asserts that 
Martina falsely implied that the Odyssey had caused deaths; that he wrongly 
implied that the defendant deprived the jury of valid evidence; that he falsely 
implied that the plaintiff had sustained psychological injury and would only be 
able to walk with great difficulty; and that he improperly expressed his 
personal opinion. The trial court sustained objections, immediately instructed 
the jury, or cautioned Martina in front of the jury at the time each of these 
statements was made. See Lemire, 130 N.H. at 555, 543 A.2d at 
426-27 (jury presumed to follow trial judge's instructions). Because we assume 
that counsel for the plaintiff, knowing that this conduct is inappropriate, is 
unlikely to make the same mistakes on remand, we decline to address Honda's 
arguments.

Honda next argues that the trial court erred in permitting the plaintiff's 
expert to testify regarding testing with a model vehicle. The defendant asserts 
that the admission of previously undisclosed testimony and the courtroom 
demonstration unfairly surprised the defendant and substantially prejudiced its 
defense. See Super. Ct. R. 62; Welch v. Gonic Realty Trust 
Co., 128 N.H. 532, 535, 517 A.2d 808, 809 (1986). Because the model and 
accompanying testimony will no longer be a surprise in the event of another 
trial, we decline to address this issue.

Next, the defendant argues that the trial judge erred in denying its motion 
for judgment notwithstanding the verdict because the plaintiff failed to present 
sufficient evidence on the issues of design defect and causation, and inadequate 
warning and causation. We disagree.

The standard of review of a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict 
is well established:


A party is entitled to judgment notwithstanding the verdict only 
  when the sole reasonable inference that may be drawn from the evidence, which 
  must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, is so 
  overwhelmingly in favor of the moving party that no contrary verdict could 
  stand. The court cannot weigh the evidence or inquire into the credibility of 
  the witnesses, and if the evidence adduced at trial is conflicting, or if 
  several reasonable inferences may be drawn, the motion should be 
denied.Broderick v. Watts, 136 N.H. 153, 159, 614 A.2d 600, 
604 (1992) (citations, quotation, and brackets omitted).

In this case, the plaintiff sought to prove that the absence of a rear-wheel 
differential on the Odyssey amounted to a design defect and that the defect was 
a cause of the accident. The plaintiff also sought to prove that Honda failed 
adequately to warn the Odyssey's driver of the general operating characteristics 
of the vehicle on packed snow and that the failure to warn made the Odyssey 
unreasonably dangerous.


To maintain a products liability claim based on defective design, 
  a plaintiff must prove: (1) that the design of the product created a defective 
  condition unreasonably dangerous to the user; (2) that the condition existed 
  when the product was sold by a seller in the business of selling such 
  products; (3) that the use of the product was reasonably foreseeable by the 
  manufacturer; and (4) that the condition caused injury to the user or the 
  user's property.Chellman v. Saab-Scania AB, 138 N.H. 73, 77, 
637 A.2d 148, 150 (1993).


An analysis of whether a product is unreasonably dangerous 
  requires evaluating many possible factors including a product's social utility 
  balanced against the risk of danger, the cost and practicality of reducing the 
  risk of danger, and the presence or absence and efficacy of a warning of 
  hidden danger . . . . If the design of a product makes a warning necessary to 
  avoid an unreasonable risk of harm from a foreseeable use, the lack of warning 
  or an ineffective warning causes the product to be defective and unreasonably 
  dangerous.Id. at 77-78, 637 A.2d at 150; see
Thibault v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 118 N.H. 802, 395 A.2d 843 (1978).

The plaintiff's design defect and failure to warn claims are separate. Under 
the design defect claim, the issue is whether the Odyssey was defective 
in that it had a fixed rear axle and whether that defect made the 
product unreasonably dangerous. The issue in the failure to warn claim, in 
contrast, is whether the danger inherent in the Odyssey was or could have been 
made reasonable by the issuance of adequate warnings.

"[L]iability may attach if the manufacturer did not take available and 
reasonable steps to lessen or eliminate the danger of even a significantly 
useful and desirable product." Thibault, 118 N.H. at 807, 395 A.2d at 
846. Moreover, "when an unreasonable danger could have been eliminated without 
excessive cost or loss of product efficiency, liability may attach even though 
the danger was obvious or there was adequate warning." Id. at 808, 395 
A.2d at 847. In the end,


[a] court will rarely be able to say as a matter of law that a 
  product has no social utility, or that the purpose or manner of its use that 
  caused the injury was not foreseeable. The jury must decide whether the 
  potentiality for harm is open and obvious. Reasonableness, foreseeability, 
  utility, and similar factors are questions of fact for jury 
determination.Id. at 809, 395 A.2d at 847-48 (citations 
omitted).
"The existence of concurrent causes will not in and of itself vitiate a 
finding that one cause was a proximate cause of the injury." Reid v. Spadone 
Mach. Co., 119 N.H. 457, 463-64, 404 A.2d 1094, 1098 (1979), overruled in 
part by Daigle v. City of Portsmouth, 129 N.H. 561, 534 A.2d 689 (1987); 
see Chellman, 138 N.H. at 79-80, 637 A.2d at 152. The plaintiff 
need not show that either design defect or failure to warn was the sole 
proximate cause of the accident. See Reid, 119 N.H. at 463-64, 404 
A.2d at 1098.

Here, the plaintiff's automobile expert testified as to the handling behavior 
of vehicles lacking rear-wheel differentials. The rear wheels of such vehicles 
essentially are locked together -- forced at all times to rotate at the same 
rate. With the aid of a model, the expert demonstrated that vehicles which 
combine conventional steering with fixed rear axles behave differently than 
vehicles which combine conventional steering with rear axles having 
differentials. The expert testified that the class of vehicles lacking 
rear-wheel differentials, of which the Odyssey is one, have uncertain steering 
responses depending on whether the front wheels grip or the rear wheels grip in 
a turn. The expert testified that in evasive maneuvers, when turning to avoid 
something, "there's a tremendous risk that the back end will simply break away 
and you'll spin sideways into something." Furthermore, it was the expert's 
opinion that the lack of a differential in the Odyssey was a design defect and 
that the defect made the Odyssey dangerous. Finally, the expert testified that 
he could not see how Honda could be unaware of the effect of the fixed axle and 
that it was foreseeable that this type of collision would occur.

In a deposition read into the record at trial, the plaintiff's warnings 
expert stated that the Odyssey was defective because it did not come with 
instructions and warnings regarding the special hazards involved with driving 
the Odyssey on a frozen lake, especially in light of the fact that the Odyssey 
employs hand-operated brakes. He stated that the warnings that did come with the 
Odyssey regarding safe operation of the vehicle were inadequate. In his report, 
he indicated that difficulties associated with hand-actuated controls "have 
caused brake lockup and subsequent skids such as took place in this accident." 
Finally, he stated that even assuming the driver did lock the brakes, the skid 
could have been caused by over-steering or loss of traction on the surface.

Beaulieu testified that he applied the Odyssey's brakes and turned hard right 
immediately prior to the moment of impact. He also testified that he was 
probably traveling thirty to thirty-five miles per hour -- a speed at or above 
which, according to the defendant's own expert, the Odyssey reaches the limit of 
"its frictional capabilities."

The jury explicitly found (1) that the Odyssey contained a design defect 
which rendered it unreasonably dangerous and which was a cause of the accident, 
and (2) that the Odyssey was unreasonably dangerous and defective because of 
Honda's failure adequately to warn the driver and that this failure to warn was 
a cause of the accident. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the 
plaintiff, we cannot say that the sole reasonable inference that could have been 
drawn therefrom is so overwhelmingly in favor of Honda that no contrary verdict 
could stand. Broderick, 136 N.H. at 159, 614 A.2d at 604. Accordingly, we 
find that the trial judge properly denied the defendant's motion for judgment 
notwithstanding the verdict.

We decline to address the defendant's remaining arguments either because the 
defendant failed to raise timely objections at trial, or because it failed to 
include the issues in its notice of appeal. See Sup. Ct. R. 
16(3)(b); LeFavor v. Ford, 135 N.H. 311, 313, 604 A.2d 570, 572 (1992).

Reversed and remanded.
BRODERICK, J., did not sit; BATCHELDER, J., retired, sat by special 
assignment under RSA 490:3; HORTON, J., with whom THAYER, J., joined, dissented; 
BATCHELDER, J., concurred specially; JOHNSON, J., concurred.

BATCHELDER, J., concurring specially: Because I would adopt a per
se rule of reversal, I concur only in the result reached in Chief Justice 
Brock's opinion.

HORTON, J., dissenting: The plurality correctly asserts that the plaintiff's 
arguments regarding the color of the Honda Odyssey and the need to ignore 
Japanese transgressions in favor of attention to corporate greed were "extremely 
unprofessional and deplorable," but the plurality also correctly states that 
these arguments "must be considered in light of the circumstances of the 
particular case." The plurality further notes correctly that "the decision 
whether to grant the mistrial motion or the motion for a new trial falls within 
the trial court's discretion." The actual rule is "[b]ecause the trial court is 
in the best position to gauge prejudicial impact, it has broad discretion to 
determine whether a mistrial or other remedial action is necessary." State v. 
Martin, 138 N.H. 508, 516, 643 A.2d 946, 951 (1994). I would hold that the 
trial court's actions relative to these arguments were within its broad 
discretion.

Neither comment was directly related to an issue in the case. Although 
completely uncalled for, the arguments were, at best, a weak attempt to engender 
nationalistic (rather than racial) prejudice, the former suggesting that it 
might be unfair for a Japanese manufacturer to use the colors of the American 
flag, and the latter pointing out (albeit in the context of suggesting that the 
jury should not consider this fact) that the Japanese had bombed Pearl Harbor 
and criticized American workers. These comments are so unrelated to the basis of 
the case and so lame in their obvious intent to move the jury to act on 
prejudice that the trial court could make a fair assessment that any prejudice 
would be cured by its general instructions. In the words of the trial court, the 
plaintiff "raised irrelevant and potentially prejudicial issues. . . . The Court 
must evaluate the statements in the context of the entire trial and determine 
whether they . . . rendered the trial unfair." The trial court specifically 
found that the jury followed the court's instructions and based its verdict on 
the evidence and the law. A review of the record demonstrates that the verdict 
is, in all other respects, consistent with the evidence and the law. There is no 
indication that the verdict was based on national prejudice.

I would affirm the verdict. To reach this result, I have reviewed the 
remaining issues preserved on appeal and not addressed in the plurality opinion. 
This review leads me to the conclusion that the defendant's claims of error are 
without merit.

I respectfully dissent.

THAYER, J., joins in the dissent.

Vehicle02Sturdy, Durable & Secure03Since 1948, Honda has been churning out efficient, stylish vehicles for a wide following of drivers. Honda got its start by producing motorcycles after World War II to accommodate Japan's population of transportation-deprived citizens. Scooters were the primary type of motorbike Honda assembled, as their small stature and penchant for fuel economy were a necessity for the climate. As the 1960s came into view, Honda finally began to get into automobiles as well as auto parts and forayed into Formula One racing. However, it would take another decade before the N600 would reach American shores. While initial interest in the brand was lukewarm, the arrival of the Honda Civic in 1973 would establish the company as a highly respected alternative to traditional domestic nameplates.
In 1976, the Accord joined the Civic as Honda's two main entrants in the US. The Accord's popularity in conjunction with the already admired Civic gave Honda the ability to spread its reach. Motorcycles were still a part of the roster, but the success of the sedans was beginning to snowball. The Accord would eventually surge through the 80s and by decade's end, the versatile sedan took over as the most popular car in America. Honda would not sit on its hands, though. It was during this time the brand launched Acura, their luxury division. Other developments such as VTEC engines, aluminum body construction, and plenty of technological comforts located inside their models had given Honda a well earned reputation for responding to consumer needs. The nineties saw even more achievements for Honda, as models such as the Prelude and the S2000 became reliable yet stylish choices for a new generation of car buyers.
Currently, Honda offers top-quality vehicles in a variety of segments. The Ridgeline, Honda's lone 4X4 truck, combines the cab and bed into one, giving drivers the capability of a truck with the cozy confines of an SUV. As for sport utility vehicles, the Pilot and Element provide smooth, responsive handling with an extra dose of cargo space as well as tech-savvy features. The CR-V is Honda's crossover, a sleekly-styled SUV that is both compact and dependable. As for sedans, Honda still carries their longtime superstars such as the Accord and Civic, with both seeing as much action as ever before. The Honda Fit is a subcompact hatchback that shows off a reasonable amount of kick, terrific fuel efficiency, and a surprisingly comfortable cabin. Legends like the Prelude and S2000 are still desired automobiles for most, as the resale value of most Honda vehicles is one of the company's biggest strengths.
When it comes to straight-up performance with the style to match, Honda makes it mark year after year. Efficient, economical, and ultra-modern, drivers from all walks of life benefit from the advantages their Honda version presents. Everyone from street-tearing roadburners to suburban homemakers have made Honda their choice because the brand forever remains that versatile. From headlights to taillights, Honda Accessories and Parts have always remained popular and relevant because this is one of the top companies that invite the very best in modern customization.

We had several people stop and ask where we got it at and of course referred them to CARiD.com. Ours mounted on our 2004 Cadillac Escalade. We will probably never camp another way.

Vehicle02Sturdy, Durable & Secure03Since 1948, Honda has been churning out efficient, stylish vehicles for a wide following of drivers. Honda got its start by producing motorcycles after World War II to accommodate Japan's population of transportation-deprived citizens. Scooters were the primary type of motorbike Honda assembled, as their small stature and penchant for fuel economy were a necessity for the climate. As the 1960s came into view, Honda finally began to get into automobiles as well as auto parts and forayed into Formula One racing. However, it would take another decade before the N600 would reach American shores. While initial interest in the brand was lukewarm, the arrival of the Honda Civic in 1973 would establish the company as a highly respected alternative to traditional domestic nameplates.
In 1976, the Accord joined the Civic as Honda's two main entrants in the US. The Accord's popularity in conjunction with the already admired Civic gave Honda the ability to spread its reach. Motorcycles were still a part of the roster, but the success of the sedans was beginning to snowball. The Accord would eventually surge through the 80s and by decade's end, the versatile sedan took over as the most popular car in America. Honda would not sit on its hands, though. It was during this time the brand launched Acura, their luxury division. Other developments such as VTEC engines, aluminum body construction, and plenty of technological comforts located inside their models had given Honda a well earned reputation for responding to consumer needs. The nineties saw even more achievements for Honda, as models such as the Prelude and the S2000 became reliable yet stylish choices for a new generation of car buyers.
Currently, Honda offers top-quality vehicles in a variety of segments. The Ridgeline, Honda's lone 4X4 truck, combines the cab and bed into one, giving drivers the capability of a truck with the cozy confines of an SUV. As for sport utility vehicles, the Pilot and Element provide smooth, responsive handling with an extra dose of cargo space as well as tech-savvy features. The CR-V is Honda's crossover, a sleekly-styled SUV that is both compact and dependable. As for sedans, Honda still carries their longtime superstars such as the Accord and Civic, with both seeing as much action as ever before. The Honda Fit is a subcompact hatchback that shows off a reasonable amount of kick, terrific fuel efficiency, and a surprisingly comfortable cabin. Legends like the Prelude and S2000 are still desired automobiles for most, as the resale value of most Honda vehicles is one of the company's biggest strengths.
When it comes to straight-up performance with the style to match, Honda makes it mark year after year. Efficient, economical, and ultra-modern, drivers from all walks of life benefit from the advantages their Honda version presents. Everyone from street-tearing roadburners to suburban homemakers have made Honda their choice because the brand forever remains that versatile. From headlights to taillights, Honda Accessories and Parts have always remained popular and relevant because this is one of the top companies that invite the very best in modern customization.

The product was shipped a d received as promised. Set up time is about 10 minutes or less when you do it a couple of times. It held up perfectly on the wind blown Oregon Coast and resisted the cold in the 4 feet of snow at Crater Lake Campground. We had several people stop and ask where we got it at and of course referred them to CARiD.com. Ours mounted on our 2004 Cadillac Escalade. We will probably never camp another way.

Demon camber. You may know it as oni-camber. You've seen the look, and whether you like it or not is totally beside the point. The great thing about this stanced look is that it gets your attention. From the interviews we've read with owners and drivers of these machines, that is exactly what they are after. They've said that it's all about being noticed.Custom wheels and tires have been around for years, and continue to be immensely popular. But customizers are always looking for ways to be ahead of the game, to be first with a trend. It is no longer enough to have the most outrageous set of rims. That look can be taken to the next level with stanced cars. Technically, demon camber is extreme negative camber. Let's explain what "negative camber" is and how that effect is achieved.Camber is one of the alignment specifications which affect the angle, or tilt of the wheel compared to the vehicle's body. If you are looking directly at the front or rear of a car, the angle of the tire relative to the ground is the camber. Look at the illustration below. Negative camber means that the tops of the tires lean in relative to the car's body. Zero camber means the tire is perfectly perpendicular to the ground. Positive camber means the tops of the tires are leaning out...March 18, 2015Pickup Truck Cab And Bed SizesTimothy ZahlAmericans love to have choices. Buying a dress shirt?

Everyone notices them. One of the...May 11, 2015 Not content with "factory" performance? Neither are we, so upgrading your car or truck's power and handling is just a click away in our Performance Parts department. You can pack more air and fuel into your engine with free flowing filters and cold air intakes, big carburetors and throttle bodies, high flow injectors and intake manifolds; get a fat spark to fire that mixture with performance plugs, wires, and ignition systems; and give those spent gases a quick exit and get a rumble to boot with headers and low restriction exhaust systems. And if you crave massive increases in go-power, we have complete engines, turbochargers and superchargers, and nitrous oxide systems. But performance isn't just about power, you have to handle the turns and hit the binders once in a while and for that we have suspension and brake systems for every need and purpose. Check out our vast selection of lift kits, lowering kits, shocks, struts, springs and sway bars and state of the art drilled and slotted brake rotors, multi-piston calipers, and performance compound brake linings.We all like to modify and customize our vehicles, but sometimes you just need to fix them or do maintenance to make sure they last. We can help you save money by doing the job yourself, with auto parts and tools to repair any part of your machine and maintenance supplies to help keep it going for many more miles. Water pumps, alternators, starters, clutches, timing belts, mufflers, and more are all here along with the chemicals and tools you need to get repair jobs done right. Regular maintenance has been proven to extend the life of a vehicle and we can help keep yours in top shape with filters, lubricants, spark plugs, brake pads and more. And to make sure you never tire of looking at your pride and joy we have an extensive selection of wax and polish, car wash, tire dressing and detail supplies.

Honda Self-propelled
When I first got a self-propelled mower several years ago, I paid over five hundred dollars for it. It looks like the 160cc (21 or 22 ''), but had a grass catcher. After the first month, it never worked well again. I carried it back and forth to the store which could take 6 weeks or more each time to get a call to say it was ready. 

Some times it was okay, sometimes it really was not fixed. About a year later, I carried it back for repair again/again/again!!!!!. Eventually, one of the times I took it in, another customer had returned his mower just like the one I had, and they gave it to me. I did not know not to get it. All I wanted was to have a mower that would work.

Well, yes you guessed it. It was worse than the first.
