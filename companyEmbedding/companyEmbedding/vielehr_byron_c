����������������������� APPEAL
from a judgment of the circuit court for Waukesha County:� patrick
l. snyder, Judge.� Affirmed.� 
����������������������� Before Nettesheim, P.J., Anderson and Snyder, JJ. 
�1������� PER CURIAM.   Phillip Kmiec and Diana Kmiec
(hereinafter the Kmiecs) appeal from the judgment dismissing their trespass
claim against Byron C. Vielehr.�
The judgment followed a jury verdict finding that Vielehr had not
trespassed on the Kmiecs� property.� The
issues on appeal are whether the circuit court properly denied the Kmiecs�
motion for summary judgment, whether the circuit court properly instructed the
jury about the effect of a stipulation between the parties, and whether the jury�s
verdict was contrary to the great weight of the evidence.� We affirm the judgment of the circuit court.
�2������� Phillip Kmiec�s father, Marjan Kmiec, owned two adjoining
lots of property.� He sold one lot to
Vielehr and one lot to the Kmiecs.� A
portion of the driveway from Vielehr�s lot went onto the Kmiecs� lot.� After closing, Marjan Kmiec noticed
that Vielehr was parking vehicles on this portion of the driveway, and sent him
a letter which said in part:� �While we
have no adamant objection about your using the driveway apron located on our
lot at this time, I believe it would be healthy for us to have a discussion
about a potential driveway easement and use of the apron on an interim
basis.�� 
�3������� The discussions apparently were not successful because the
Kmiecs brought an action for trespass.�
They also moved for a temporary restraining order prohibiting Vielehr
from using the disputed portion of the driveway.� At the hearing in March 1999, the parties entered into a
stipulation in court.� Pursuant to this
stipulation, Vielehr was allowed to use the disputed portion of the driveway,
and the Kmiecs agreed to have a utility company bore under the asphalt to bring
utility lines onto the Kmiecs� lot.�
Vielehr also agreed to pay part of the costs of boring.� Shortly after the stipulation was entered
into, the Kmiecs discovered that the utility company could not bore under the
asphalt.� The circuit court dissolved
the stipulation in December 1999.
�4������� After the hearing on the temporary restraining order, Vielehr
filed a third-party complaint against Marjan Kmiec seeking reformation of deed
given by Marjan to Vielehr.� Marjan and
the Kmiecs then moved for summary judgment but the trial court denied both
motions. 
�5������� The case then went to trial.�
At trial, the court instructed the jury that it could not find that
Vielehr trespassed between March and December 1999, the time the stipulation
was in effect, because the stipulation provided that Vielehr was allowed to use
the driveway.� At the conclusion of the
trial, the jury found, among other things, that Vielehr had not
trespassed.� The Kmiecs appeal on this
issue.
�6������� The Kmiecs first argue that the circuit court erred when it
denied their motion for summary judgment.�
Our review of the circuit court�s grant of summary judgment is de novo,
and we use the same methodology as the circuit court.� M&I First Nat�l Bank v. Episcopal Homes Mgmt., Inc.,
195 Wis. 2d 485, 496, 536 N.W.2d 175 (Ct. App. 1995).� That methodology is well known, and we need not repeat it
here.� Summary judgment is appropriate
when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is
entitled to judgment as a matter of law.�
Id. at 497.
�7������� We conclude that the circuit court properly denied the motion
for summary judgment.� At the time the
Kmiecs brought this motion, Vielehr had a claim pending for reformation of the
deed Marjan Kmiec gave to him.� Had the
trial court ruled in Vielehr�s favor on that claim, it would have mooted
Vielehr�s reformation claim against Marjan Kmiec.� Given the pendency of Vielehr�s claim, the circuit court properly
denied the Kmiecs� motion for summary judgment.[1]�� 
�8������� The Kmiecs next argue that the trial court erred when it
instructed the jury that the stipulation was in effect from the time it was
entered into in March 1999, until it was set aside by the court in December
1999.� The Kmiecs argue that the
stipulation was automatically revoked once the utility company said that it
could not do the borings.� The
stipulation was entered into in court.� Wisconsin Stat. � 806.07
(1999-2000), provides that �[o]n motion and upon such terms as are just,� a
party may obtain relief from a stipulation.�
Until the Kmiecs went to the circuit court to have the stipulation
dissolved, the stipulation remained in effect.�
The trial court, therefore, properly instructed the jury that it could
find that Vielehr had trespassed during the time the stipulation was in effect.
�9������� The Kmiecs further argue that the verdict on the trespass
issue was against the great weight of the evidence.� �If the challenge is to the sufficiency of the evidence to
support the jury�s verdict�however the motion is designated by the parties (or
the court)�the standard is the same for the trial court and for this court on
appeal:� whether there is any credible
evidence, or reasonable inferences based on that evidence, to support the
verdict.�� Foseid v. State Bank of
Cross Plains, 197 Wis. 2d 772, 784, 541 N.W.2d 203 (Ct. App.
1995).� 
�10����� The jury could reasonably find, based on the evidence presented
at trial, that the Kmiecs granted Vielehr permission to use the driveway
apron.� We conclude that there was
credible evidence to support the jury�s verdict that Vielehr had not
trespassed.� For the reasons stated, we
affirm the judgment of the circuit court.
����������������������� By
the Court.�Judgment affirmed.
����������������������� This
opinion will not be published.� See Wis. Stat.
Rule 809.23(1)(b)5.




 

 




[1]  Since
we conclude that the court properly denied summary judgment on this basis, we
need not address the Kmiecs� additional arguments as to why summary judgment
should have been granted to them.
